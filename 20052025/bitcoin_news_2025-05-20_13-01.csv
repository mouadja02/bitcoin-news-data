2025-05-20T10:59:07.000Z,"US-Traded Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Highest Inflow in Two Weeks! Here Are the Details","U.S.-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs saw increased demand on Monday, with net inflows reaching $667.4 million, the highest daily total in two weeks, as investors rushed to cash in on renewed base trading and strong Bitcoin prices. As Bitcoin ETFs Flock, Base Trading Nears 9%, Signals Corporate Revival According to data from Farside Investors, around $306 million of the inflows went to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which currently boasts net inflows of $45.9 billion. The renewed buying interest marks a sharp reversal from the outflows and caution seen earlier this year, with Bitcoin (BTC) continuing to trade above $100,000 for the eleventh consecutive day. The increased interest is partly due to the return of the base trading strategy, where investors go long on spot ETFs and short on futures contracts on the CME to capture risk-free returns. That yield, known as an annualized basis, has nearly doubled in the past month to near 9%, presenting an attractive arbitrage opportunity for institutional investors. “That base level has now returned to the area that is attracting professional capital. It’s a significant reversal from the sub-5% yields seen in April,” said senior analyst James Van Straten. CME Bitcoin futures volume reached $8.4 billion on Monday, the most since April 23 and indicating a revival of activity. Open interest rose by more than 30,000 contracts from April’s lows to 158,000 BTC, according to Velo data. While both volume and open interest remain below January highs, when BTC reached a new all-time high of $109,000, the recent surge suggests significant growth potential. The widening base appears to be drawing back participants who exited the market earlier in the year. For example, recent 13F filings revealed that the Wisconsin State Retirement Board sold off its Bitcoin ETF holdings in the first quarter. This decision was likely due to reduced arbitrage opportunities at the time. However, with the base now recovering, analysts predict that large investors could return to the market in the second quarter to take advantage of improved spreads. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T10:53:58.000Z,"Binance Tries Again to Move Securities Case Out of US Courts","This latest development is the latest chapter in a years-long legal saga that reached the Supreme Court, which declined to hear Binance's appeal. Meanwhile, Coinbase is under investigation by the US Department of Justice after a data breach involving bribed customer support agents led to estimated user losses of up to $400 million. The breach also helped facilitate a number of scams, and triggered multiple lawsuits and intensified scrutiny from the SEC. In Australia, a court ruling may revolutionize crypto tax law by declaring Bitcoin a form of money rather than property. The ruling could potentially unlock up to $1 billion AUD in capital gains tax refunds. It is also expected that the decision could set a global precedent if upheld. Binance Argues Lawsuit Must Go Crypto exchange Binance renewed its push to move a US class-action lawsuit to arbitration, and recently pointed out that users agreed to waive their rights to sue as a group under its terms of service. In a May 16 filing to a federal court in New York, Binance argued that its 2019 Terms of Use include a binding arbitration clause, which should apply to all claims that arose after Feb. 20, 2019. The company also stated that these terms contain a class-action waiver that should cover all the plaintiffs’ claims. Part of Binance’s filing (Source: PACER) This comes in response to a prior ruling by Judge Andrew Carter, who in March declined to send all claims to arbitration—particularly for users who bought digital tokens on Binance between April of 2017 and February of 2019. The judge also partially denied Binance’s arbitration request for post-2019 claims, pending further clarification on how broadly the arbitration clause should be applied. In its latest argument, Binance said that its earlier terms of service already reserved the right to update the agreement without notifying each user individually. The crypto firm is pushing for the court to uphold the arbitration clause and enforce the waiver across all the relevant time periods. The case has a long legal history. It was originally dismissed in March of 2022 after Judge Carter sided with Binance, which claimed it was not subject to US securities laws due to a lack of physical presence in the country. However, that decision was overturned by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in March 2024. Binance tried to appeal to the Supreme Court, which declined to take the case in January 2025. Binance’s legal challenges in North America have intensified over the past two years. In June of 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a high-profile lawsuit against Binance for allegedly selling unregistered securities. That case was settled in November 2023 for $4.3 billion. In April 2024, Binance was also hit with a class-action lawsuit in Canada over alleged securities law violations. DOJ Probes Coinbase Data Breach Other crypto exchanges also find themselves in legal hot water. The US Department of Justice is reportedly investigating a data breach at Coinbase involving customer service agents in India who allegedly accepted bribes in exchange for giving criminals access to user information. The probe was first reported by Bloomberg on May 19, and it centers around a group of support contractors who were later terminated by Coinbase for abusing their system access. Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach on May 15 and said that it was working with the DOJ and international law enforcement agencies. Paul Grewal, the company’s chief legal officer, said that they were cooperiating and supporting the prosecution of the people who were involved. While Coinbase stated that no user passwords, private keys, or funds were directly exposed, the breach still facilitated a wave of social engineering attacks. One high-profile victim was reportedly a partner at Sequoia Capital. It is estimated that total user losses may have reached up to $400 million. To make things worse, the attackers demanded a $20 million extortion payment from Coinbase in exchange for silence, which the company refused to pay. Coinbase’s response to the data breach (Source: Coinbase ) Naturally, the breach led to multiple lawsuits from affected users, with claims that Coinbase failed to adequately protect personal data. Among the plaintiffs is a retired artist, Ed Suman , who says he lost $2 million due to the scam. At the same time, Coinbase is also under regulatory scrutiny from the SEC , which is examining whether the exchange misrepresented its number of verified users. The combination of legal pressures and security concerns also led to volatility in Coinbase’s stock. Court Shakes Up Crypto Tax Law in Australia In the latest crypto-related legal development from Australia, a recent court ruling could reshape the country’s approach to cryptocurrency taxation, and potentially unlock hundreds of millions in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds for Bitcoin users. The decision came as part of a criminal case involving former federal police officer William Wheatley, who was accused of stealing 81.6 Bitcoin in 2019. William Wheatley At the time, the digital assets were valued at approximately $492,000, but they are now worth over $13 million. In a landmark judgment, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin should be treated as a form of money rather than property, drawing parallels between the cryptocurrency and traditional Australian dollars. This classification stands in stark contrast to the Australian Taxation Office’s long-standing stance. Since 2014, the ATO categorized cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as CGT assets. Under this classification, any transaction involving the disposal of Bitcoin — whether it be a sale, exchange for another cryptocurrency, or use as payment for goods or services — constitutes a CGT event subject to taxation. The ruling, if upheld, will fundamentally challenge this framework by saying that Bitcoin operates as a monetary instrument rather than a tradable asset. Tax experts believe the ruling could have far-reaching consequences. Adrian Cartland, a tax lawyer that was interviewed by the Australian Financial Review , explained that if Bitcoin is not considered a CGT asset, then buying and selling it would carry no tax consequences. He estimated that Australians could be entitled to as much as 1 billion Australian dollars in potential CGT refunds. However, the ATO did not specifically confirm this figure and hold firm that there are no official estimates regarding the scale of possible refunds should the ruling be upheld on appeal. The outcome of any appeal could greatly impact not just Bitcoin holders but the broader legal and regulatory treatment of digital assets in Australia. Overall, the decision will be the start of a historic shift in recognizing cryptocurrency as money in the legal system, and it could inspire similar legal challenges to crypto tax regimes in other countries.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9186/binance-tries-again-to-move-securities-case-out-of-us-courts,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB","News|Legal",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T10:47:04.000Z,"Bitcoin to $250K or Ozak AI to $1? Investors Debate 2025's Best Crypto Bet","Two vastly different projects—Bitcoin (BTC) and Ozak AI (OZ) —are at the center of a heated investor debate. One is the original crypto juggernaut with a proven track record; the other is a rising AI-powered altcoin still in its presale phase. The question is: will Bitcoin hit the coveted $250,000 mark, or will Ozak AI surge to $1 and offer a better return on investment? Bitcoin to $250K: Is the King Ready to Run Again? Bitcoin’s journey has been nothing short of legendary. From being worth a few cents to reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in 2021, Bitcoin has cemented its position as digital gold. With the recent halving in 2024 reducing mining rewards, many analysts believe the stage is set for another massive bull run. The $250K target may sound aggressive, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. Why some believe BTC could hit $250K: Institutional adoption is stronger than ever, with asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offering Bitcoin ETFs. Scarcity model post-halving supports bullish long-term price action. Macroeconomic shifts (inflation, fiat devaluation) continue to push investors toward decentralized assets. However, even if Bitcoin reaches $250,000, that represents roughly a 3x gain from current prices (~$65,000). Impressive—but not necessarily the life-changing ROI that some investors are seeking. Ozak AI: The Sleeper Altcoin With 300x Potential? While Bitcoin dominates headlines, Ozak AI is quietly building momentum as a new-age crypto backed by artificial intelligence. Priced at just $0.003 in its presale , Ozak AI is aiming for a realistic $1 target—a potential 300x return if achieved. It’s gaining traction as both a utility token and a high-growth speculative asset. What sets Ozak AI apart: AI integration: Offers decentralized tools for data analysis, trading bots, predictive modeling, and automation across DeFi platforms. Strong presale performance: Over $1 million raised, signaling early investor trust and demand. Low market cap entry: Smaller capital needed to make big moves compared to blue-chip cryptos. Narrative-driven appeal: Combining two of the hottest tech trends—AI and blockchain—makes it appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Unlike Bitcoin, which already commands a $1+ trillion market cap, Ozak AI’s journey is just beginning. The upside potential is undeniably larger for early backers if the project delivers on its roadmap. Bitcoin remains a solid bet for long-term wealth preservation and moderate growth, especially with institutional interest and a bullish post-halving setup. But for investors chasing exponential returns, Ozak AI’s $0.003 entry price and real-world AI utility offer a compelling case. While Bitcoin may climb to $250K by 2025, it’s the emerging plays like Ozak AI that could generate life-changing profits. For those with a higher risk appetite and belief in the future of AI and blockchain convergence, Ozak AI might just be the best crypto bet of 2025. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based project that offers a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Ozak AI helps crypto investors and companies in choice-making by offering real-time, accurate, and actionable insights thru machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies.

2025-05-20T10:45:00.000Z,"Bitcoin privacy tool Payjoin receives $100K grant from Maelstrom","Bitcoin developer Ben Allen has received a $100,000 grant from investment firm Maelstrom to support the development of Payjoin, a privacy-focused tool aimed at improving Bitcoin’s scalability and privacy. According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy. Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev Kit Payjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction. “Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states. A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach: “We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“ Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEO Payjoin: Soon in wallets near you? Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time. The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added: “The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“ A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects. Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin? Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or not Hayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily. Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.

2025-05-20T10:41:24.000Z,"The US Senate Pushes the GENIUS Bill. Best Wallet Token to Rally?","The Senate revived the GENIUS bill on Monday, after a procedural vote put the bill on track to receive the green light. Altcoins like Best Wallet Token could catch steam as a result. GENIUS was initially rejected by the democrats two weeks ago due to concerns relating to Donald Trump’s ‘crypto dealings.’ Dem Senator, Elisabeth Warren, led the charge against the bill and reinforced her opinions yesterday, saying: ‘This week’s bill is worse than no bill at all,’ she stated, invoking the danger of increased corruption and even putting national security at risk. Enactment of the GENIUS bill could reverberate in the crypto market and fuel some of the best altcoins like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . What’s the GENIUS Bill and Will It Fuel Altcoins like Best Wallet Token? Simply put, the GENIUS bill is a piece of legislation that would regulate the crypto space, more specifically, stablecoins. Among the numerous specifications, the most notable ones are: ‘(GENIUS) would define payment stablecoin as a digital asset issued for payment or settlement and redeemable at a predetermined fixed amount (e.g., $1). Issuers would be required to hold at least one dollar of permitted reserves for every one dollar of stablecoins issued.’ And ‘Stablecoins could be issued by banks and credit unions (through subsidiaries) or nonbanks (which would not be restricted to financial firms), each of which would be required to register with the appropriate federal regulator.’ While most democrats were against the bill originally, some have supported it, arguing that Trump’s supposed crypto shenanigans highlight the need for more strict regulations in the crypto space. This last point ultimately proved paramount to shifting the democratic tide, as several bipartisan negotiators jumped boats after reaching a consensus regarding their main demands. These include new and more strict changes to the consumer protection policies, more transparent restrictions on tech companies dealing with stablecoins, and extend these standards to governmental agencies. The last mention would also target Elon Musk and tech giant David Sacks. So, what does this all mean for the crypto market? As Kara Calvert, Head of US Policy at Coinbase, put it: ‘The winners, if Congress passes this bill, are Americans who want to make payments faster and easier to access. It’s transformational technology, so passing this bill is a win for them. It’s not just a win for the industry or a political candidate.’ In Calvert’s view, the GENIUS bill is a massive step forward for the cryptosphere. Naturally, we expect the crypto market to react accordingly and pump some of the most exciting new crypto projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST). Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Holders Enjoy Lower Transaction Fees Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers holders several benefits, including lower fees across the Best Wallet ecosystem, early access to trusted presales and upcoming hot meme coins , and community governance rights. Holding $BEST also rewards you with a dynamic staking APY of up to116%, adding even more incentive to tune into the presale early on. The project’s whitepaper details Best Wallet ’s long-term goal of capturing at least 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026. Best Wallet Token is currently one of the best presales for 2025, with over $12.5M raised so far and a token price of $0.025055. If you want to invest, you should do it now, before the next price increase, which is due in less than two days. Our ‘how to buy $BEST’ guide will teach you how to set up your wallet and secure your $BEST tokens, if you’re not familiar with the purchasing process. Our analysts predict that $BEST could triple in value by the end of 2025 and reach a meaty $0.82 by 2030. With a current price of $0.025055, that would make for a net growth of 3,172%, enough to make anyone FOMO at the mouth. Will the GENIUS Bill Pass? Yes, we believe that the GENIUS bill will pass, given all the support it’s getting and the dems’ recent bipartisan efforts, overturning the failed attempt on May 8. Once that happens, we expect the market to react accordingly and pump crypto fuel in both established and new crypto projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . So, definitely keep your eyes and ears on the news. Remember, you shouldn’t take this as financial advice.

The survey, which involved 3,345 participants, asked how much of the gold reserve should be turned into BTC. Most preferred a conversion between 1% and 30%, with the median recommendation being 10% . The online survey was conducted from February to mid-March, with participants matched to U.S. Census demographics by age, gender, race, income, education, and region. Respondents were compensated for their time. Some questioned the credibility of the results, assuming it might only reflect the views of Bitcoin supporters. However, co-founder Troy Cross emphasized the data showed people didn’t lean entirely toward gold when given a balanced choice between the two assets. Younger participants were more open to larger Bitcoin allocations , which aligns with previous findings linking age and Bitcoin ownership. Dennis Porter, co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, noted the survey reflects Americans’ growing indifference toward gold and their general preference for diversified investment strategies. Currently, the U.S. owns over 8,133 tons of gold, valued at more than $830 billion, while its Bitcoin holdings stand at roughly 207,189 BTC—just under 3% of the gold's value. There's significant room for diversification. White House adviser Bo Hines has floated a plan to use profits from gold reserves to buy Bitcoin, possibly acquiring up to 1 million BTC over five years . This idea supports a proposal from Senator Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2025. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also previously advocated for matching the country’s gold reserves with Bitcoin holdings.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-better-than-gold,"BTC|FIAT","",cryptocompare

While stocks and gold struggled, Bitcoin showed strength. Ethereum led the charge in altcoins, up 5%, while Solana, XRP, BNB, and Dogecoin climbed 2-4%. Golden Cross Signals Rally, But Is Death Cross Here? Experts have observed that Bitcoin is about to form a “golden cross”, a classic bullish indicator that could kick off a strong rally in the next few days. The last two times it happened, Bitcoin surged 121% and 68%. All eyes are now on Bitcoin if it could reach $110K soon ,and altcoins might perform even better. However, Analyst Benjamin Cowen has analyzed a different pattern. He noticed that every time Bitcoin goes through a “death cross”, that is when the 50-day moving average drops below the 200-day, it often hits a local low right around then. This happened in Q3 of both 2023 and 2024, and again in Q2 this year (2025). Now, he warns that if Q3 is weak again this year, Bitcoin could dip one more time and more downside might be coming. Is Bitcoin Losing Strength? Analyst Ali Martinez also pointed out that Bitcoin might be losing strength after facing strong resistance. Momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD are showing signs of weakness, which shows the momentum is fading even as the price rises. On the flip side, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw a massive $667 million inflow on May 19, the biggest in over two weeks, which shows strong institutional interest is back. Data from Farside Investors shows that the spot BTC ETFs have recorded inflows in 18 out of 21 days, bringing in $6.9 billion in capital in just three weeks. Markets Look Balanced According to a latest analysis by Cryptoquant , Bitcoin’s latest rebound looks healthier than past rallies. In earlier bull runs, when Bitcoin hit new highs, it quickly overheated, then crashed soon after. But this time, Bitcoin is bouncing back with no warning signs, the buying activity and market conditions look balanced. So Bitcoin could keep going up without dropping. This shows that the market is building strength steadily and not just rushing through hype and Bitcoin could break its all-time high again more sustainably this time.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-eyes-110k-next-etf-inflows-golden-cross-fuel-bullish-momentum/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Will Cole, the son-in-law of Senator Cynthia Lummis, recently reignited controversy by openly slamming XRP and its parent company Ripple, calling the project a “centralized joke of a scam.” Cole, who has been vocal in the past, doubled down on his criticism by claiming Ripple’s security fraud troubles are only the tip of the iceberg. He also took direct aim at the company’s leadership, accusing Ripple’s founders of being excessively greedy and dishonest about their connection to the XRP token. Why Senator Lummis Might Be Avoiding Ripple? Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan weighed in and said that if Senator Lummis shares even a fraction of her son-in-law’s views, it could explain her recent avoidance of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Recently, Brad Garlinghouse had planned to meet Senator Cynthia Lummis in Washington, D.C. to discuss crypto regulations, but she cancelled and hasn’t rescheduled. To this, Brad expressed his disappointment, since Lummis plays a major role in shaping crypto policy as head of the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee. Morgan speculated that a public meeting with Garlinghouse could invite backlash within her political and personal circles, potentially triggering accusations of favoritism or conflicts of interest — something politicians are typically keen to avoid. Some in the crypto community called her out for favoring Bitcoin and not supporting a level playing field for all digital assets. But Bitcoin proponents, like Troy Cross, praised her for “keeping the scammers at bay,” showing distrust toward XRP. Bitcoiners Slam XRP as “Fake Token” Targeting Retail Investors Adding to the debate, Pierre Rochard, CEO of Catholic Bitcoin, took a shot at Garlinghouse, saying that he ruined his reputation by backing CBDCs and attacking Bitcoin. He called his comments childish and said that the crypto space needs more serious leaders. Also, Cole has recently reshared some strong critiques of XRP from Pierre Rochard, highlighting that holding XRP could be a major mistake. He believes that XRP isn’t a serious asset for institutions and even calls it a “fake token” targeting retail investors. Earlier, Bitcoiners were upset when President Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve for the US that included XRP among several other altcoins. JAN3 CEO Samson Mow slammed the move, calling it “ hypershitcoinization ,” accusing the reserve of enriching project founders like Ripple, Vitalik Buterin, and others.

Four standard contracts, reflecting 50,000 XRP each, were exchanged at an average price of $2.40, according to statistics from the CME. This was equivalent to about $480,000 in theoretical volume. A further one million dollars’ worth of trades came from 106 micro contracts, with each contract linked to 2,500 XRP. The contracts are cash-settled and use the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate as a benchmark, published daily at 3:00 PM UTC. The listing was made possible after the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) approved the decision to classify XRP as a commodity. CME now offers XRP derivatives under the existing regulatory framework. With its initial trading session, CME’s XRP futures outpaced decentralized exchange dYdX in daily notional volume and trailed only slightly behind offshore derivatives platforms BitMEX and HTX.

Spot XRP ETF could come soon The launch of CME’s XRP futures has made analysts a little more optimistic about a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the coming months. According to Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, the debut of XRP futures at CME makes a spot ETF approval more likely, saying on social media that it’s “only a matter of time.” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported that eight spot XRP ETFs are currently under review by the SEC.

At this point, CZ, who even released a memecoin after his release from prison, recently made important statements about Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin investments. Warning investors, CZ said that investing in cryptocurrencies from the X account and not investing are equally risky. “Investing in cryptocurrencies is risky. Not investing in cryptocurrencies is also risky.” Pointing out that BTC and altcoins are inherently risky investment instruments, CZ stated that investors should manage their risks in all cases. Advising investors to learn to manage their risks, CZ advised investors to conduct detailed research before investing in the cryptocurrency market, determine their risk thresholds, and only invest an amount they can afford to lose. CZ said that investors who do not know these risks and issues related to cryptocurrencies should not get involved in the crypto market. “Learn to manage risk: 1. What is the worst case scenario? If it goes to 0, can you survive? Can you maintain your lifestyle? 2. How many times can you afford to try? 3. Do you know/understand what you are doing? If you don't, read/learn.” Learn to manage risk: 1. ask: what is the worst case scenario? if it goes to 0, can you survive? keep your life style? 2. how many times can you afford to try? 3. do you know/understand what you are doing? if not, read/learn. https://t.co/brV7Icbd6a — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) May 20, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15. However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital. “Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post , adding: “Something that has to be said though - this hack - which includes home addresses and account balances - will lead to people dying.

2025-05-20T10:00:12.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs: Are We Headed For A $120,000 Breakout","With Bitcoin (BTC) surging back above the $105,000 mark and nearing its record high set in January, market expert Doctor Profit has outlined bullish predictions for the leading cryptocurrency. In a recent post on social media platform X, he detailed the dynamics he believes will drive Bitcoin toward new highs. Bitcoin Breaks Key Levels As Institutional Demand Surges Since hitting $77,000, Doctor Profit identified $100,000 as the first significant target, which has now been achieved. Looking ahead, he sees the next breakout target between $116,000 and $120,000. His confidence stems from several positive indicators, including a strong bullish divergence observed on the daily chart—a technical signal often associated with forthcoming price increases. He emphasized that daily divergences tend to have a higher success rate than those seen on longer time frames. Related Reading: Coinbase Confirms DOJ Investigation Following Major Security Incident Additionally, Doctor Profit pointed out that the funding rate is currently stable, with no over-leveraged positions in the market. He noted that BTC recently broke out of a significant double bottom formation and is now testing previous highs. A critical factor in his outlook is the substantial accumulation by US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are reportedly purchasing Bitcoin at a rate eight times greater than its current mining output. This aggressive accumulation phase, according to Doctor Profit, indicates institutional interest remains robust, even as retail traders have largely stayed on the sidelines during recent volatility. BTC Could Dip To $90,000 The analyst also highlighted that the strongest retail buying occurred around the $90,000 mark, which also represents a liquidity hotspot. Should the market revisit this level, he sees it as an optimal entry point, perfectly positioned at the bottom of the established trading box. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit anticipates volatility, particularly in light of Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating from AAA to AA1—the first major downgrade since S&P’s similar action in 2011. Historical context suggests that such downgrades can lead to swift market corrections. In August 2011, following a downgrade, markets dropped by 5.5% in a single day. Doctor Profit believes that Bitcoin could similarly dip into the $90,000 range to capture liquidity before rebounding. Related Reading: Dogecoin On The Edge: Major Breakout Or Breakdown Imminent? Despite potential short-term fluctuations due to the downgrade, Doctor Profit maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, reiterating his target of $116,000 to $120,000. He noted that the market had largely priced in the downgrade, and historically, stocks have rallied following such events. With major institutions, including BlackRock, increasing their Bitcoin purchases in the exchange-traded fund arena, Doctor Profit sees no signs of weakness in the market, pointing to further price gains for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,400, marking a 12% increase over the past two weeks and a nearly 24% increase over the past month. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency has gained 60%, lagging behind XRP’s gains of over 300% in the same period.

2025-05-20T09:40:54.000Z,"India’s top court calls out the government over lack of crypto regulation","India’s Supreme Court has called out the central government for its long silence on regulating crypto while warning them that the legal vacuum is a breeding ground for misuse. On Monday, the apex court sharply questioned why no regulatory framework has been introduced to govern cryptocurrency in India. This comes in when the biggest economies in the world are taking steps to regulate crypto and develop a working framework for investors. Recently, the US Senate voted to move ahead on stablecoin legislation, which marked a big win for the crypto industry. However, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is already in its implementation phase. According to reports , a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh made it clear that “banning crypto is not the solution, but regulation is urgently needed”. The Bench highlighted crypto’s growing role in the global economy and noted that ignoring it would be akin to “shutting your eyes to ground reality.” They added, “We aren’t experts. Experts would examine it, but some steps to regulate it and keep an eye on it are necessary.” Justice Kant reportedly referenced a two-year-old observation to the Attorney General. He had then said the government couldn’t regulate crypto due to its international nature. The Court now says that’s no longer acceptable. The court noted that the taxing of Bitcoin profits at 30% already signals a form of legal recognition. Meanwhile, if that’s the case, then why is regulation still missing? Justice Kant, while addressing ASG Aishwarya Bhati, added that courts are now facing practical challenges in crypto cases. He stated, “Tomorrow, somebody will ask me, you please prove—what is the asset? How are we going to prove it?” The ASG responded that she would seek instructions from the Centre. Indian investors have already seen the WazirX hack in the absence of regulations. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)rejected a class action filed by 40 individuals affected by WazirX’s alleged $233 million hack in July 2024. The NCDRC pointed out that cryptos are not recognized as legal tender or a permitted investment asset in India. BitConnect fraud case heating up in India The apex court resumed hearings in a case involving multi-state cryptocurrency fraud. The case centers around petitioner Shailesh Babulal Bhatt. He has been accused of abducting two employees of the now-defunct BitConnect platform in 2018 and allegedly extorting 2,091 Bitcoins, 11,000 Litecoins, and ₹14.5 crore in cash. Bhatt has reportedly mentioned that his motive was to recover losses from his investment in BitConnect. During the hearing, the Court asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati for an update on the investigation timeline. The matter has been listed for further hearing on May 30, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) directed to complete further investigation by that date. Back in 2018, Bitcoin was trading at $10,000 after hitting $17,000 in 2017. BTC price dropped to hover around the $3,000-$4,000 zone later in the year. However, Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $105,161 at the press time. BTC went on to hit its all-time high (ATH) of $109,114 on January 20, 2025. The global digital assets market printed green indexes all around on Tuesday morning. Its cumulative market cap surged by more than 2% over the last day to stand at $3.33 trillion with a trading volume of $126 billion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Michael Saylor’s Strategy Hit With Class-Action Lawsuit","Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has been hit with a class-action lawsuit over alleged misleading statements tied to its Bitcoin strategy. The May 19 Lawsuit filing claims Strategy hid the associated risks, citing a $5.9 billion unrealized Q1 loss that triggered an 8.67% drop in MSTR shares during April 7 trading. The “anticipated profitability” and “risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility” were referenced as misrepresented by Strategy officials. One focal point is the company’s repeated emphasis on key performance indicators like BTC Yield—tracking the ratio between Bitcoin holdings and common shares outstanding. These metrics allegedly downplayed the risks tied to adopting a fair-value accounting model for its Bitcoin reserves. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, president and CEO Phong Le, and executive vice president and chief financial officer Andrew Kang are all defendants in the suit. Strategy Continues to Buy, Other Firms Follow As of May 18, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC acquired for around $40.2 billion at an average price of $69,726 per coin. Never short a man who buys orange ink by the barrel. pic.twitter.com/4h2sEbIraT — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 18, 2025 At current prices, the company’s total holdings are valued at more than $59.2 billion, representing an unrealized gain of $19.2 billion, or 47%. Since the filing, Strategy continues to acquire Bitcoin with its latest 7,390 BTC purchase valued at $764.9 million. A new projection by research and brokerage firm Bernstein suggests that corporations could collectively allocate as much as $330 billion into Bitcoin by 2029.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bulls Hold $105K in Channel Technically BTC/USD is in a channel trading at $105,294 after bouncing off $104,235 support. The 50-EMA ($103,559) is support and price action shows spinning top candles which is indecision. A break above $106,000 could target $107,084 and then $108,619 but if BTC goes below $104,235 expect $103,000 or $102,185. For beginners: Imagine BTC is moving within a lane—it needs strength to break higher or risk slipping back down. BTC Bull Token Nears $6.98M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Drives Demand As BTC holding near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward yield-generating altcoins—none more so than BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The token has now raised $6.01 million out of its $6.98 million presale goal, with a price increase looming as it enters its final funding stretch. What sets BTCBULL apart is its flexible staking model, offering an estimated 71% annual yield with no lockups or withdrawal penalties. This approach gives investors the freedom to earn passive income while maintaining full liquidity—an attractive alternative to traditional DeFi staking protocols. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,015,311/ $6,981,682 Token Price: $0.00252 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: 71% APY BTCBULL merges the viral appeal of meme tokens with the real-world utility of DeFi, making it a standout pick for those looking to capitalize on the 2025 crypto cycle. With under $1 million left before the next price tier, entry at current levels is limited—fueling urgency among retail investors seeking early access to passive yield.

2025-05-20T09:25:23.000Z,"South Korean presidential front-runner proposes won-based stablecoin","South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung proposed creating a stablecoin tied to the Korean won to prevent capital outflows and strengthen national financial sovereignty. Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ), according to The Korea Herald. Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives. Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said. “We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas,” Lee reportedly said. Related: Top South Korean presidential hopefuls support legalizing Bitcoin ETFs South Korean candidates make pro-crypto promises The proposal is part of Lee’s broader digital asset strategy, which includes legalizing spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Both Lee and rival Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party have pledged to support the introduction of spot crypto ETFs. Source: Konstantin Tkachuk Lee’s campaign also calls for the National Pension Fund and other institutional players to be allowed to invest in cryptocurrencies once price stability criteria are met. To facilitate this, he proposed an integrated monitoring system and lower transaction fees, making crypto more accessible under government oversight. However, the stablecoin proposal has sparked concern among economists. Shin Bo-sung, a senior Korea Capital Market Institute researcher, warned that stablecoins could inflate the money supply and shift monetary control to private issuers. “We must not overlook the economic principles behind them. Stablecoins are essentially another form of banking, creating money out of nothing,” Shin said. Related: RedotPay enters South Korea with crypto-powered payment cards Democratic Party sets up “Digital Asset Committee” On May 13, South Korea’s Democratic Party launched a Digital Asset Committee focused on developing cryptocurrency policies and promoting industry growth. The committee, which held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul, highlighted the importance of resolving regulatory uncertainty and addressing issues like stablecoin regulation. The new committee joins similar organizations in South Korea, including the Virtual Asset Committee launched in late 2024 and another public-private crypto task force introduced in 2022, both initiated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). The Democratic Party is also set to introduce the Digital Asset Basic Act . The bill would establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold at least 50 billion won in reserves and gain approval from the FSC.

2025-05-20T09:20:01.000Z,"ChatGPT Predicts XRP Price for June 1, 2025","In a bold prediction that has captured the attention of XRP enthusiasts, ChatGPT has forecasted a significant price increase for XRP by June 1, 2025. The AI model projects that XRP could climb approximately 18% from its current level, reaching $2.80 within the next two weeks. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.36, marking a 3.2% gain in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. This short-term momentum, broader market trends, and institutional developments lend weight to ChatGPT’s forecast. “Based on current market dynamics, increased institutional activity, and recent price momentum, XRP is positioned to reach around $2.80 by June 1, 2025 — an estimated 18% increase from its current level,” said ChatGPT. “This outlook is influenced by both macro trends in the crypto space and positive XRP-specific developments.” Bitcoin Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Momentum One of the most notable drivers of market sentiment has been the sustained bullish trend in Bitcoin. As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is trading at $105,545, up a remarkable 24% in the last 30 days. Historically, strong Bitcoin rallies have often paved the way for altcoins to follow suit, particularly those with established ecosystems and institutional interest, such as XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 CME Launch of XRP Futures Marks Institutional Breakthrough Further supporting the bullish case for XRP is the recent announcement that CME Group has launched XRP futures contracts, marking a significant milestone in institutional acceptance. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed the move as a “key institutional milestone,” underlining the growing demand from professional investors to gain exposure to XRP in regulated markets. In a post made shortly after the market opened, Garlinghouse confirmed that Hidden Road, a global prime broker, had cleared the first block trade on CME. This event signals rising confidence in XRP and the development of deeper liquidity and improved price discovery mechanisms, often prerequisites for sustained growth in any financial asset. Eyes on June: Can XRP Hit $2.80? With these developments, analysts and market observers are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s near-term outlook. While price predictions are always subject to volatility and external factors, the convergence of rising Bitcoin dominance, enhanced institutional infrastructure for XRP, and increasing trading activity paints a promising picture. As June approaches, all eyes are now on whether XRP will fulfill ChatGPT’s projection and cross the $2.80 mark.

2025-05-20T09:18:02.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Q2 Ends With Bullish Signals Across the Board","If you're scanning the market for the best crypto to buy now, you're not alone. With Q2 of 2025 wrapping up and Bitcoin holding steady near $104,000, investor optimism is picking up steam. Institutional inflows are rising, on-chain activity is heating up, and bullish predictions are spreading across the board. This is the kind of climate where early entries can become life-changing wins. But while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, smart money is already looking deeper—toward altcoins with real traction, AI integration, and meme-level virality. And one project that keeps landing on investor watchlists? Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) . Let’s dive into the market trends, what makes a crypto explode, and which coins—new and established—could lead the charge into Q3. Q2 2025 Market Predictions: The Big Picture As April’s fear turns to May’s greed, momentum is clearly building in the crypto sector. Here’s what top analysts are saying about the rest of Q2: Bitcoin’s Still Leading, But Altcoins Are Moving Bitcoin remains the main driver, with Standard Chartered forecasting $120K by July and even $200K by year-end. But with dominance hovering near 52%, altcoins are starting to stir, and many believe the true “altseason” will kick off before Q3. AI and Meme Coins Are Dominating Narratives In 2025, successful tokens aren’t random—they follow hot trends. AI-powered crypto, real-world assets (RWAs), Layer-2 scaling, and community-first meme coins are the four dominant narratives right now. Tokens like Dawgz AI check more than one of these boxes, increasing their visibility. Sentiment Is Rising According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, investor mood has flipped from neutral to greed in early May. This shift is a common early indicator of major breakout phases. Technicals Remain Bullish With BTC and ETH both holding above key moving averages, momentum is still strong. Any minor pullbacks are being seen as buying opportunities—especially for undervalued altcoins. What Makes a Crypto “Explode”? Not all gains are equal. While BTC grinding to $200K could 2x your investment, newer tokens can deliver 10x or even 100x returns—if they have the right setup. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , understanding what drives explosive growth is key. Here’s what explosive coins tend to have in common: Low Market Cap at Launch: The smaller the market cap, the more room to grow. Hot Narrative Fit: AI and meme coin combos are 2025’s most talked-about pairings. Clear Utility or Roadmap: Hype fades. Real-world use cases help projects hold value. Engaged Community: Explosions are powered by virality, memes, and constant chatter. Smart Tokenomics: Limited supply, staking rewards, and burn mechanisms can create supply shocks. Presale Success: A presale that raises millions—like Dawgz AI’s—builds early trust and firepower. Exchange Momentum: Listings on platforms like Binance or Coinbase often signal the spark before a pump. Next Crypto to Explode? Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Among the rising wave of new projects, one name keeps surfacing in Q2 prediction lists: Dawgz AI. It’s early. It’s hyped. But most importantly—it’s planned. What Makes Dawgz AI Stand Out? Presale Pricing: With a token price of $0.004, Dawgz AI is a penny token with room to run. The low entry point is ideal for those looking for a 50x–100x upside. AI Utility: Its AI-backed trading tools are built to assist retail users with market signals and automation—something previously only hedge funds had. Meme Coin Branding: As a meme token, it has viral potential. But unlike DOGE or SHIB, it adds real utility to the formula. Proven Early Demand: Dawgz AI has already raised over $3.5 million during presale—a strong signal that retail and early-stage investors are confident. Audit and Tokenomics: Audited by SolidProof 30% of tokens allocated to presale buyers 20% reserved for staking rewards 15% focused on community incentives It’s not just hype—it’s structured for sustainability. And that’s rare in meme coins. Want to see more? Watch this video breakdown of Dawgz AI to hear why influencers are paying attention. Established Cryptos to Watch in Late Q2 While Dawgz AI is the top early-stage pick, these established players still offer strong momentum plays as we close out the quarter: Ethereum (ETH) With DeFi TVL over $62B, Ethereum remains the king of smart contracts. Upcoming Ethereum ETF announcements, increased L2 adoption, and continued dApp growth suggest ETH’s $3K range could soon be a springboard. Solana (SOL) Trading under $150, SOL remains a retail favorite. With a thriving NFT scene, gaming infrastructure, and blazing speed, analysts predict a retest of $200+ if altseason hits. Cardano (ADA) Steady, scalable, and research-driven, Cardano is building out quietly. If altcoin narratives shift toward energy efficiency and smart governance, ADA could be a dark horse with 3x potential. Tips for Riding the Next Bullish Wave Explosions are rare—but smart positioning can increase your odds. Here’s how to play Q2 smart: 1. Buy Narratives, Not Just Tokens AI, DePIN, Web3 Gaming, and meme utility are leading. Pick tokens that fit the story. 2. Stack Entry Points Use dollar-cost averaging to avoid going all-in at a local top. 3. Track Presale Stats Strong early traction usually signals momentum. Dawgz AI’s $3.4M raise is a good example. 4. Follow Developer Activity Watch for active GitHubs, roadmap updates, and new partnerships. 5. Take Partial Profits When your token pumps 5x–10x, consider locking in some profits to fund the next bet. Conclusion: Dawgz AI Leads the Early Movers With Q2 ending on bullish signals across the board, the market is preparing for movement. Bitcoin sets the tone, but altcoins are where real gains are made—especially early-stage tokens with strong fundamentals. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) fits this bill perfectly. It’s new, it’s timely, and it’s structured to ride both the AI revolution and meme wave of 2025. For those looking to catch the next big breakout before it happens, Dawgz AI is one of the best cryptos to buy now—before the next leg up begins. FAQs Section What's the next 1000x crypto? Early-stage projects like Dawgz AI, with low market cap and strong narratives, offer explosive potential if momentum holds. What is the most bullish crypto right now? Bitcoin remains bullish overall, but Dawgz AI is trending among early investors as a bullish small-cap opportunity. Which crypto to buy for the next bull run? Ethereum and Solana are reliable picks. For higher risk/reward, Dawgz AI and other AI-integrated tokens stand out. Which coin will reach $1 in 2025? If adoption accelerates, tokens like Dawgz AI—currently at $0.004—could hit $1 with continued community and utility development.

Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a potential breakout, despite overbought conditions. A decisive move above $110K could trigger a rapid surge toward $125K, according to John Deaton. Bitcoin ($BTC) is trading just above $105,400 as of May 21, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours.

2025-05-20T09:15:39.000Z,"Bitcoin Will Go ‘Much, Much Higher’ as US Government Needs To Borrow More Money Than We Think: Arthur Hayes","Crypto veteran Arthur Hayes thinks the US government’s borrowing needs will drive up the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ). The BitMEX co-founder predicts in a new interview with Fortune that the top crypto asset could hit $200,000 in the current run and $250,000 by the end of the year. “I believe that the US government has to borrow more money than what we think, and therefore, [Treasury Secretary] Bessent will have to issue more debt and therefore he needs to find a way for these individuals to obtain as much leverage as possible through the banking system and ultimately that means that there’s more dollars floating around in the world because the US government is spending more money on stuff. So that’s kind of the TLDR (too long, didn’t read) on what a buyback is and how I believe it’s positive for liquidity in the market and which is why I think Bitcoin bottomed on April 9th and will continue much, much higher as the government continues to borrow money and Bessent does what is necessary to make sure they’re funded at an affordable rate.” BTC is trading at $105,379 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 1% in the past 24 hours. Hayes also predicts Bitcoin will hit $1 million by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency in 2028.

2025-05-20T09:02:19.000Z,"Bitcoin Recovers From Drop to $102K, AAVE Skyrockets by Over 20% (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s volatile ride that started on Sunday evening doubled down on Monday as the asset was stopped at $107,000, pushed south by over five grand, recovered to almost $107,000 once again and dipped in the past few hours. Many altcoins have posted impressive gains on a daily scale, including ETH, which has jumped past $2,500. BTC’s Ride The bears seemed in charge at the end of the previous business week when they pushed bitcoin to under $102,000 on Thursday. However, the asset bounced off rather quickly and surged past $103,000 on Friday and spent most of the weekend trading sideways around that level. On Sunday evening, though, the cryptocurrency started to gain traction and pumped to $106,000. It was stopped there and driven south to under $103,500, but the bulls initiated an even more impressive price surge in the following hours, resulting in BTC exceeding $107,000 for the first time since last January. As bitcoin was nearing its all-time high, the landscape changed once again, and it slumped toward $102,000. Yet, that was not the end of the massively volatile ride as it skyrocketed once again, this time to a more modest peak of $106,600. It was stopped there once again, but has managed to remain above $105,000 as of now. Its market cap has neared $2.090 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 60.7%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView AAVE on the Run Many altcoins have erased yesterday’s losses. Ethereum, for instance, has returned to over $2,500 after a 5.5% daily surge. XRP defended a crucial support line and now sits at $2.35. SOL, TRX, SUI, LINK, AVAX, SHIB, HBAR, and TAO have posted gains of up to 7%. However, AAVE stands in a league of its own from the larger-cap alts. The asset has skyrocketed by over 20% and now trades at $265. The total crypto market cap has added almost $100 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.450 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-05-20T09:00:30.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) poised for surge to all-time high and beyond","Recent price action for Bitcoin (BTC) has seen the king of the cryptocurrencies taking hold above $104,000. While there is still room for some more sideways choppiness, a surge up and past the all-time high and into price discovery may not be far off. Price spike or triple top rejection? Source: TradingView As can be seen in the daily chart above, the $BTC price is gathering beyond the $104,000 horizontal level, which has just become tentative support. If a few more daily closes can take place above this level, the launchpad for the next, and possibly last, leg of this bull market would be in place. On the other hand, if a breakout past the all-time high does not happen soon, and the price begins to roll over, could this be the formation of a bearish triple top that signals a descent to much lower levels, or even the end of this current bull market? At this point it could be argued that there are more reasons for a bull market continuation than a bull market top. First among these is that the trend is still up, and that the full measured move out of the bull flag has not yet reached fruition. This would occur at around $120,000. Another good reason for continued upside is that the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , Michael Saylor’s Strategy, various other Bitcoin treasuries, and possibly sovereign nations other than those already known about, are all still buying. $BTC bearish scenario Source: TradingView Nevertheless, there are still concerns that must be taken into consideration. Chief among these might be where this current weekly candle closes in roughly six days time. If the candle closes below that $104,000 support, a retreat back to the top of the bull flag, or even to $93,000 could be the next move. Another factor to bear in mind is that the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are now reaching the top. It’s probable that both indicators will be at the very top at the end of this weekly close. If there is a rejection from $104,000, the blue indicator line could then cross below the red, potentially signalling that a top would be in. 4-year cycle takes potential top to Q4 2025 There are various scenarios that could play out. It must be noted that the 4-year cycle is not complete until later in Q4 of this year. Therefore, even if there was a rejection here, there could still be time for the price to come back to the $93,000 support, and then run up again for one last hurrah into price discovery. This would mean the weekly Stochastic RSI coming back down, and then returning to the top by the end of the year - a realistic possibility, but probably one for the crystal ball at this stage. It might also be borne in mind that a 4-year cycle is not set in stone. It has been the cycle length for the life of Bitcoin up to now, but many analysts are suggesting that this cycle may be longer, and could end in Q1 or even Q2 of 2026. Monthly $BTC chart displays bullish setup Source: TradingView Finally, if one looks at the much higher scale picture of the monthly time frame, it can be seen that the horizontal support level is actually lower at $102,000. This suggests that if the price can hold above this level by the end of May, the scene could be set for a last big surge into the final stage of this bull market. The monthly Stochastic RSI is posturing a cross-up of the fast (blue) indicator line over the slow (red) line, signalling a good period of upside price momentum. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index has the indicator line already crossing above the moving average line (yellow). If the indicator line can then cross up through the descending trendline, this would be extremely bullish. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-05-20T09:00:12.000Z,"Bitcoin Market Update: Spot Demand Climbs As Short-Term Profits Lose Steam","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show signs of strength despite experiencing a minor pullback in its most recent trading session. After briefly reaching a 24-hour high of $106,518, the asset retraced slightly and now trades at $104,820, reflecting a modest 0.5% decrease over the past day. Still, the cryptocurrency remains just 3.8% below its all-time high of $109,000 set in January, keeping traders and analysts closely focused on its next move. Notably, the current price action comes as changes in trading behavior emerge across major exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Face Make-Or-Break Moment At $106,500 Resistance – Details Binance Spot Volume Signals Renewed Interest Amid Controlled Market Activity One notable development is the return of positive spot net volume delta on Binance, according to a new analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost. This metric, which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume on spot markets, suggests that spot demand for Bitcoin is increasing once again. Darkfost emphasizes that while rising spot volume can reflect growing interest, sharp spikes, especially during euphoric rallies or profit-taking phases, can sometimes coincide with local tops. Darkfost notes that previous surges in Binance spot volume were often linked to key market tops, driven by rapid sentiment shifts. Such volume expansions tend to result from two primary drivers: enthusiasm that leads traders to chase price action, and experienced investors taking profits after breaching key resistance zones. While these volume shifts don’t necessarily point to imminent reversals, they highlight periods where risk management becomes increasingly important. In the current cycle, however, the uptick in volume appears more gradual, which the analyst views as a healthier sign for market continuation rather than a sign of overheating. Binance’s position as the top global crypto exchange gives these trends additional weight. According to data referenced in Darkfost’s analysis, Binance accounts for more than 26% of global spot volume, far outpacing other platforms like Coinbase. Monitoring activity on such a dominant exchange provides useful insights into broader market sentiment, especially in periods where Bitcoin approaches key psychological levels like $100,000 or higher. Bitcoin MVRV Momentum Divergence Highlights Short-Term Risk Pockets In a separate report, another CryptoQuant analyst, Crazzyblockk, examined the market through the lens of MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) momentum across both short- and long-term holders. The analysis found that while both groups are sitting on significant unrealized profits, short-term holders have seen their weekly MVRV momentum decline. This means that those who entered the market recently may not be achieving expected returns, which could increase the likelihood of short-term sell pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up $18,000, But HODLer Profits Same As On April 1—Here’s Why The divergence in MVRV momentum between long-term and short-term holders is often seen as an early signal of a shift in market dynamics. If long-term holders begin to distribute profits while newer market entrants grow frustrated, short bursts of volatility could emerge. However, broader positive momentum and the resilience of spot market demand suggest that Bitcoin remains positioned for continued strength, provided these emerging risk signals do not escalate in the near term.

Source: Farside Investors Additional data from CoinShares reveals that institutional investors asserted their optimism in crypto markets as $785 million flowed into crypto investment products , marking a five-week streak of inflows. Bitcoin investment products attracted $557 million in inflows over the past week, indicating growing investor confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. More institutional demand came from corporate investors, with Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, the top corporate Bitcoin holder, acquiring 7,390 BTC worth about $765 million last week. Japan’s Metaplanet has bagged another 1,004 BTC for about $129 million as per a May 19 announcement .

Bitcoin’s cup-and-handle pattern targets $138,00 From a technical perspective, the BTC/USD pair has been forming a cup-and-handle chart pattern on its daily chart since Dec. 17, 2024. A cup and handle setup is a technical formation that appears when the price falls initially, followed by a steady recovery in what appears to be a U-shaped recovery, which forms the cup. The recovery leads to a pullback move, wherein the price trends lower inside a descending channel, forming the handle. The pattern is resolved when the price breaks above the handle, rallying to an approximately equal size to the prior decline. The BTC/USD daily chart below illustrates a similar bullish technical setup. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Note that BTC's price now trades above the handle range and is pursuing a break above the neckline resistance at $106,000. A decisive daily candlestick close above the neckline could lead the BTC price to confront resistance from the $109,000 all-time high. Breaking this barrier would clear the path toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern at $138,000, up 31% from the current level. As Cointelegraph reported , a move to new highs of $116,000 could come as early as this week. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-20T08:45:11.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Rally Has More Room as These Crucial Metrics Align","With crypto assets quietly moving off exchanges and important metrics pointing away from overheated conditions, the momentum seems to be far from being exhausted. Several factors are at play, which suggest a growing case for the rally’s continuation. Market Sentiment Tilts Bullish Over 3,090 BTC, which is worth approximately $325 million, were withdrawn from Binance in a single day. This follows a pattern of large-scale outflows, including 76,000 ETH from Binance and 170,000 ETH from Kraken. This steady outflow of BTC and ETH from centralized exchanges signals ongoing bullish accumulation behavior among investors. With fewer coins held on exchanges, the available liquid supply shrinks, lowering the risk of abrupt selloffs and fostering an environment ripe for price appreciation if demand persists. According to the latest on-chain data from CryptoQuant, these movements coincide with significant developments in the crypto industry, such as Circle’s push toward a public listing and acquisition talks reportedly involving Coinbase and Ripple . Other factors at play also suggest favorable market conditions. For instance, the current state of Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. Sitting at 2.33, the MVRV remains well below the historically significant level of 2.75, which in the past marked the beginning of prolonged corrections triggered by profit-taking. This relatively moderate MVRV indicates Bitcoin is neither overheated nor at a major profit-taking threshold. Such a trend essentially indicates a potential for further upward price action. As such, these data points reinforce a positive market outlook: institutional interest, reduced exchange reserves, and a non-excessive MVRV ratio all suggest that Bitcoin’s current rally may still have legs. No Sleepy Summer Historically, summer has been a slow season for crypto, with Q3 often posting the lowest trading volumes – except in 2022’s crisis-driven spike. But 2025 is shaping up differently. According to Kaiko, multiple macro and regulatory catalysts are converging to shake up the usual lull. The Fed’s upcoming policy meeting and Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline are key near-term events, while landmark US crypto legislation is expected before Congress’s August recess. Options markets also reflect this increased anticipation, as evidenced by the June 27 expiry, which shows a notable bullish activity at $110K and $120K strikes for Bitcoin.

May 1, 2025: PI price was $0.6135 May 12: It surged to $1.6704 (113.20% growth) May 14 onwards: Price dropped by 40.27% Current (May 20): Trading around $0.7364 — down 32.3% in the last 7 days Atlas claims this dump aligns exactly with the price crash, indicating what he calls a clear insider “pump and dump” strategy. Pi Network: Boom or Bust? Launched as a mobile-first mining platform , Pi Network gained rapid traction, boasting over 60 million users globally. The project finally launched its Mainnet in early 2025 , triggering a price surge of over 2,737% in the first week . However, critics point to a lack of transparency , no working dApps , and closed-source code as major red flags. Atlas highlights the following concerns: Low number of active wallets despite 60M users No real adoption or utility Heavy reliance on a multi-level referral system Absence of communication around the 12M token movement “Stop watching announcements. Watch the wallets.” — Atlas .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin News: 14M Tokens Shifted from Exchange to Wallets, Bullish Case Explained , PI Community Reacts: Testnet Migration or Insider Dump? In response, PI supporters argue the movement of tokens is a routine testnet-to-mainnet migration , not a sell-off. But Atlas dismisses this defense, calling out the timing, wallet linkages , and lack of public explanation . He believes the project is orchestrating the “biggest slow rug” of 2025. What’s Next for PI Network? With the price down and allegations mounting, all eyes are now on the PI Core Team for clarity. Atlas has urged users to track blockchain activity , not marketing messages, and demands transparency on the 12 million PI token transfer . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.Payjoin Developer Kit’s website. Source: Payjoin Dev KitPayjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction.“Namely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,“ the Maelstrom announcement states.A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen’s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach:“We believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.“Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure — zkSNACKs CEOPayjoin: Soon in wallets near you?Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time.The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom’s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that “improving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.” He added:“The great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.“A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm “is keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.” The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects.Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin?Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or notHayes noted that “Payjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don’t use it.” Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily.Allen told Cointelegraph he is “building out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.” He explained that encouraging its adoption “is the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.” The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that “a key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.” “In particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,” they added.Magazine: Big Questions: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-payjoin-privacy-grant-maelstrom?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions.

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio.

Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22.

However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

In 2025, the SEC has dropped several investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies and issued guidance on memecoins and security tokens.Related: CFTC commissioner to leave agency on May 31“As I begin my tenure as Chairman, I can tell you that we are getting back to our roots of promoting, rather than stifling, innovation,” said Atkins. “The markets innovate, and the SEC should not be in the business of telling them to stand still.”Looking to Congress for market structureAtkins’ remarks came as US lawmakers considered draft legislation to establish a regulatory structure for crypto markets. The proposed bill, moving through the House of Representatives, could clarify the roles the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have in overseeing and regulating digital assets.Until the legislation passes Congress and is signed into law, the SEC’s rules and guidelines over crypto could face pushback from affected parties.The SEC chair has given opening remarks and overseen the commission’s roundtable events, discussing regulatory issues surrounding digital assets and blockchain.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support. That opens the doors for a retest of the 99 level.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin broke above the overhead resistance at $105,820 on May 18, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support. The pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($91,916).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($2,288) on May 18 fizzled out near $2,600, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe XRP/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2.34) on May 17, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could stay inside the range for some more time. The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price rises and maintains above $644, the bulls will again try to drive the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $153 and, after that, to the 50-day SMA ($143). That points to a possible range-bound action between $180 and $120 in the near term.The bulls will have to propel the price above the $185 level to regain control. The pair could then pick up momentum and rally to $210 and subsequently to $220. Related: XRP price risks falling to $2 after classic bearish chart pattern confirmsDogecoin price predictionBuyers successfully defended the breakout level of $0.21 on May 17 but are struggling to sustain the bounce in Dogecoin (DOGE).DOGE/USDT daily chart.

That signals a possible range formation between $0.26 and $0.14.Buyers will have to thrust the price above the $0.26 resistance to signal the resumption of the recovery. There is minor resistance at $0.30, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then ascend to $0.35.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) has broken below the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain.

Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address.

2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T09:59:39.000Z,"Dubai regulator sets compliance deadline for updated crypto rules","Dubai’s crypto regulator has given licensed digital asset companies until June 19 to comply with its updated activity-based Rulebooks to enhance market integrity and risk oversight. On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period.“In line with global regulatory best practices, a 30-day transition period has been granted to all impacted virtual asset service providers [VASPs], with full compliance required by 19 June 2025,” VARA wrote.  VARA enhances supervisory mechanismsVARA highlighted that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms across several regulated activities. This includes advisory, broker-dealer, custody, exchange, lending and borrowing, virtual asset (VA) management and investment, and VA transfer and settlement services. A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the updates will bring consistency across all activity-based rules defining core operational terms. The spokesperson gave examples of terms like “client assets,” “qualified custodians,” and “collateral requirements” as some of the terms more consistently defined in the update.  The update also aligned risk management and disclosure obligations, where activities overlap, in areas like brokerage, custody and exchange. “The aim was to reduce ambiguity and help VASPs navigate cross-functional compliance more easily,” VARA told Cointelegraph. Related: Dubai gov’t agencies to link real estate registry with property tokenizationDubai regulator tightens leverage thresholds for margin tradingAs for margin trading, the VARA spokesperson said they tightened leverage thresholds, mandated clearer collateralisation standards, and enhanced the monitoring obligations for VASPs offering this feature. Margin trading allows traders to control large positions with smaller amounts of capital. It amplifies both gains and losses. Tightening the leverage traders use helps limit the risks of widespread liquidations in a market downturn. The crypto regulator introduced a new section on token distribution that sets out licensing prerequisites, investor protections and marketing restrictions. The spokesperson emphasized the marketing restrictions, especially for “retail-facing offers.” “It’s about aligning with global conduct expectations and closing observed regulatory gaps,” the VARA spokesperson said. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-crypto-regulator-updates-rulebooks-tightens-margin-trading?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-19T08:55:00.000Z,"Crypto drainers as a service: What you need to know","What is a crypto drainer?              A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.Crypto drainers may take various forms:Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.Crypto drainers are a growing threat in Web3, enabling quick, automated theft of crypto assets from unsuspecting users through deception. Common methods of crypto drainers include: Phishing websites.Fake airdrops.Deceptive ads.Malicious smart contracts.Harmful browser extensions.Fake NFT marketplaces.                  Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS), explained              DaaS elevates the threat of crypto drainers by commercializing them. Just like  software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, DaaS platforms sell ready-to-use malware kits to cybercriminals, often in exchange for a percentage of the stolen funds.In the DaaS model, developers offer turnkey draining scripts, customizable phishing kits and even integration help in exchange for a share of the stolen funds. A DaaS offer might be bundled with social engineering support, anonymization services and regular updates, making them attractive even to low-skill scammers.Types of crypto DaaS tools include:JavaScript-based drainers: Malicious JavaScript is embedded into phishing websites that mimic legitimate decentralized apps (DApps). These scripts execute when you connect your wallet, silently triggering approval transactions that drain assets. Token approval malware: Tricks users into granting unlimited token access via malicious smart contracts.Clipboard hijackers: Hackers use clipboard hijackers to monitor and replace copied wallet addresses with those controlled by attackers. Info-stealers: They harvest browser data, wallet extensions and private keys. Some DaaS packages combine these with loader malware that drops additional payloads or updates the malicious code. Modular drainer kits: Segregated into modules, these drainers use obfuscation techniques to bypass browser-based security tools. Did you know? According to Scam Sniffer, phishing campaigns using wallet drainers siphoned off over $295 million in NFTs and tokens from unsuspecting users in 2023.                  What crypto DaaS kits include              Crypto DaaS kits are pre-built toolsets sold to scammers, enabling them to steal digital assets with minimal technical skill. These kits typically include phishing page templates, malicious smart contracts, wallet-draining scripts and more.This is what crypto DaaS kits generally include:Pre-built drainer software: Plug-and-play malware requiring minimal setup.Phishing kits: DaaS providers supply customizable phishing website templates that hackers can modify according to their plans.Social engineering: With DaaS, hackers find support for social engineering along with psychological tactics to trick users into connecting their wallets.Operational security (OPSEC) tools: To avoid detection, some DaaS vendors offer advanced operational security tools that mask user identity and hide digital footprints.Integration assistance and/obfuscation: These services help attackers deploy drainer scripts seamlessly and use obfuscation tools to evade tracking.Regular updates: Frequent improvements are designed to bypass wallet defenses and detection systems.User-friendly dashboards: Control panels that help attackers oversee operations and monitor drained funds.Documentation and tutorials: Step-by-step instructions enabling even beginners to execute scams efficiently.Customer support: Some DaaS operators provide real-time help through secure messaging apps like Telegram.With DaaS kits available for as little as $100 to $500, or through subscription models, sophisticated crypto attacks are no longer limited to experienced hackers. Even the inexperienced can now access these scripts with a small budget, effectively democratizing this type of crime.Did you know? Advanced DaaS tools often update scripts to evade detection from browser extensions like WalletGuard and security alerts issued by MetaMask or Trust Wallet.                  Evolution of crypto drainers as prominent fraudulent activity              The threat landscape of cryptocurrency fraud is constantly evolving. Emerging around 2021, crypto drainers have rapidly transformed the landscape. Their ability to stealthily siphon funds from users' wallets has made them a threat that demands vigilance.Drainers specifically designed to target MetaMask began to emerge around 2021 and were openly advertised on illicit online forums and marketplaces.Here are some prominent drainers that have been around for some time:Chick Drainer: It emerged in late 2023, targeting Solana (SOL) users through phishing campaigns. It operates using the CLINKSINK script, embedded in fake airdrop websites.Rainbow Drainer: The platform shares code similarities with Chick Drainer, suggesting potential reuse or collaboration among threat actors.Angel Drainer: Launched around August 2023, Angel Drainer is widely promoted on Telegram by threat groups like GhostSec. Affiliate scammers need to make an upfront payment between $5,000 and $10,000 and also pay a 20% commission on all stolen assets facilitated through its platform.Rugging’s Drainer: Compatible with several crypto platforms, this DaaS drainer offers comparatively low commission fees, typically ranging from 5% to 10% of the stolen proceeds. In the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account being compromised in January 2024, Chainalysis found a crypto drainer acting as the SEC. This led users to connect their wallets in an attempt to claim nonexistent airdropped tokens.According to a Kaspersky Security Bulletin, dark web threads discussing crypto drainers rose sharply in 2024, jumping by 135% to 129 threads from 55 in 2022. These conversations encompass a wide range of topics, including buying and selling malicious software and forming distribution teams.As the following chart demonstrates, crypto drainers have been stealing crypto at a faster quarterly growth rate than even ransomware.                  Red flags to identify a crypto DaaS attack              Spotting a crypto wallet drainer attack early is crucial to minimizing potential losses and securing your assets. You must be careful, as a sophisticated drainer attack can sometimes evade standard alert mechanisms. You must remain vigilant even while relying on automated tools. Here are a few indicators that your wallet may be under threat:Unusual transactions: A red flag of a drainer attack is finding transactions you didn’t authorize. These may include unexpected token transfers or withdrawals to unknown wallet addresses. Sometimes, attackers execute multiple small transfers to avoid detection, so you must monitor for repeated unusual transactions of low-value crypto. Lost access to wallet: If you cannot access your wallet or your funds are missing, it could mean an attacker has taken control. This often happens when the drainer changes private keys or recovery phrases, effectively locking you out. Security alerts from wallet providers: Your crypto wallet may issue security alerts for suspicious actions, like logins from new devices, failed access attempts or unauthorized transactions. These warnings indicate that someone may be trying to access your wallet or has already accessed it.Fake project websites or DApps: If you find a cloned or newly launched platform mimicking a real Web3 service and prompting wallet connections, it is a warning sign of a crypto drainer. It might also have urgent calls to action, urging users to immediately claim rewards, airdrops, or mint NFTs. The objective is to pressure victims into connecting wallets without verifying authenticity.Unverified social media promotions: Suspicious links shared via X, Discord, Telegram or Reddit, often unverified profiles, indicate a fraudulent attempt to drain money from a wallet. Fraudsters may also use compromised accounts to share malicious links. Unaudited smart contracts: Interacting with unfamiliar contracts without public audits or GitHub transparency can expose wallets to hidden drainer scripts.Wallet prompts requesting broad permissions: Sign-in or approval requests that ask for full token spending access or access to all assets, rather than specific transactions, are serious warning signs.Did you know? Just one popular drainer kit can be used by hundreds of affiliates. That means a single DaaS platform can be behind thousands of wallet thefts in a matter of days.                  How to protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers              To protect your crypto wallet from DaaS attackers, adopting strong, proactive security practices is essential. Blockchain monitoring tools can help identify suspicious patterns linked to drainer activity, allowing you to respond quickly. Here are key strategies to help protect your digital assets:Use hardware wallets: Hardware wallets, or cold wallets, store private keys offline, shielding them from online threats like malware and phishing. Keeping your keys in a physical device significantly lowers the risk of remote attacks and is ideal for securing long-term crypto holdings.Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication): Adding 2FA to your wallet means even if someone steals your password, they will need a second verification step. They need to put in a verification code sent to your phone to access the account, along with your password, making unauthorized access much harder.Avoid phishing links: Always verify URLs and avoid clicking on unsolicited messages claiming rewards or updates. Never input private keys or seed phrases on suspicious sites. When in doubt, manually enter the correct website address.Secure your private keys and seed phrases: Store your private keys and seed phrases offline in a safe, physical location. Never save these credentials on internet-connected devices, or hackers might get access to them, putting your wallet at risk. Verify apps and browser extensions: Take care to install software only from official sources. Research apps beforehand to avoid malicious or fake tools.Monitor wallet activity regularly: Check your wallet for unauthorized transactions or unusual patterns. Early detection can help stop further losses and improve recovery chances.                  What to do if you suffer from a crypto-drainer attack              Swift action is essential if you suspect your crypto wallet has been compromised. Though fund recovery is rare, quick action can limit further losses.Here are the steps you need to take if you suffer from a crypto DaaS attack:Secure your accounts: Immediately change the password for your wallet and enable 2FA, if you still have access to it. Transfer any remaining funds to a secure, uncompromised wallet.Notify your wallet provider or exchange: Report the incident to your wallet provider or exchange. You could request them to monitor your account or freeze suspicious activity. Platforms may flag suspicious addresses or prevent further transfers.File a report with authorities: Contact local law enforcement or cybercrime units, as cryptocurrency theft is treated as a financial crime in most regions.Seek professional assistance: Cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain forensics can analyze transactions and potentially trace the stolen funds. While full recovery is unlikely, especially if assets pass through mixers or bridges, expert help may aid investigations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/crypto-drainers-as-a-service-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T08:46:53.000Z,"Apple KYC glitch on Bybit draws swift executive response to recover $100K","Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit said it had involved team members, including an executive, to fix a glitch that affected a single user who could not go through an Apple-based know-your-client (KYC) system.In a May 18 X post, the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.After an internal investigation, Bybit concluded this was a “unique case affecting an individual user, not a systemic issue.” The account’s KYC information was not tampered with and the funds in the account remained secure at all times.Bybit had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment at the time of writing.Related: A decade-old debate is back as self-custody gets smarterThe perks of media attentionBybit claims to have taken large-scale and timely action, which involved a member of its executive team, all in response to an issue reported by a single user. Chinese-speaking X crypto influencer EnHeng claimed to be the reason for this.In a separate post that Bybit’s X post answers to — EnHeng explained that in a group chat, he noticed “a girl mentioned a bug related to Bybit’s Apple ID.” He verified the issue and after confirming that it was real, flagged it to Bybit.EnHeng said that the staff responded quickly and assisted the user in recovering access to about $100,000 worth of funds. They highlighted:“This incident really made me feel the value of having influence.”EnHeng said “in this market, retail investors often lack a voice and are vulnerable.” For this reason, he said, “When we have more resources and a bigger voice, we should use them to speak up for retail investors.”Related: Self-custody vs. centralized crypto cards: Freedom or convenience?Locked out of exchangeBeing locked out of a cryptocurrency exchange account or some of its features is not excessively uncommon. Often, it is an emergency measure meant to prevent fund losses.A recent example is Phemex crypto exchange halting withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms in late January. Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex temporarily halted crypto withdrawals during the same month, claiming compliance improvements were the reason.Sometimes action is taken on the request of law enforcement. Last summer, a small set of Palestinian user accounts was frozen after Israeli authorities issued a seizure request. Also last summer, OKX warned it would terminate any account linked to crypto mixer Tornado Cash or sanctioned addresses, and several users said their log-ins were suddenly disabled.Those incidents echo an old adage popular in the Bitcoin (BTC) community: Not your keys, not your coins.

2025-05-19T07:55:20.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum's layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup. “A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to deplatform or censor users. Many RPC providers already exclude entire countries,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik ButerinVitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes In addition to censorship, Buterin argued that reasons like expensive fully-trustless cryptographic solutions and metadata privacy show that there’s value in ensuring greater ease for those running a personal node. In the proposal, Buterin's solution relies on a novel type of node called “partially stateless nodes.” These nodes are designed to help users maintain privacy-preserving access to blockchain data without the heavy resource demands of running a full node. As Ethereum scales and the gas limit increases, running a full node requires more storage and bandwidth. Buterin said partially stateless nodes address the issue by allowing users to verify the blockchain and serve local data, but only store a subset of the Ethereum state, based on the user’s needs.Vitalik Buterin’s graphic of partially stateless nodes. Source: Vitalik ButerinRelated: Ethereum Foundation unveils security initiative to supplant legacy systemsA new node type to validate blocks “statelessly”The nodes would operate by validating blocks statelessly. This means they don't require the storage of the full Merkle proofs or the entire blockchain history. They can selectively keep certain parts of the state up to date. This means that users could configure their nodes only to save data related to their accounts, the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and their commonly used tokens like stablecoins and Ether (ETH). The rest of the data will be left out, and queries beyond the stored subset will fail or be routed through an RPC solution. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-partially-stateless-nodes-ethereum-scaling-privacy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T07:38:51.000Z,"How to read a Bitcoin liquidation map (without getting liquidated)","Understanding a Bitcoin liquidation map is imperative in dealing with the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The visual tool showcases probable liquidation levels, indicating where large orders may cause cascading price changes. This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.What is liquidation in crypto trading?In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet on a decline. Did you know? In crypto, a single liquidation cascade can wipe out millions in minutes, triggered not by hacking but by traders using too much leverage at the wrong time.What is a Bitcoin liquidation map?A Bitcoin liquidation map is a visual heatmap indicating price levels where large liquidations are expected to occur. These maps assist traders in identifying zones where leveraged positions may be closed forcibly if prices fluctuate sharply. Tools like CoinGlass provide real-time Bitcoin (BTC) liquidation maps, valuable resources for risk-aware traders. With the liquidation map, you canUse breakout trading strategies for profitable scalping opportunities.Set stop-loss levels based on key liquidation zones for better risk management.Target high-liquidity areas to secure profits efficiently.Enter large trades near liquidity clusters to minimize slippage and enhance execution.Analyze the gradient of liquidation intensity to anticipate potential price movements..Functioning of a liquidation map and key components The X-axis of the liquidation chart represents the bid price, while the Y-axis denotes the relative strength of liquidation activity. Each column on the graphic illustrates a liquidation cluster's relative significance compared to other clusters.The chart demonstrates how the market will respond if the price reaches certain thresholds. Taller liquidation bars indicate a higher potential impact. The various hues are solely for visual clarity, allowing users to distinguish between distinct liquidation zones.Here are the main components of a liquidation map:Heat zones: Indicate where most positions could be eliminated if the price reaches specific levels.Liquidity pools: Collections of stop-loss and liquidation orders that can cause rapid price movements.Open interest levels: Demonstrate where large amounts of leveraged positions are concentrated.Price imbalances or gaps: Disclose areas without support or resistance, allowing prices to move swiftly.Did you know? Crypto liquidations often follow the herd; when too many traders place similar bets, liquidation maps light up and whales use them as price targets.How to use a liquidation map in your Bitcoin trading strategyA Bitcoin liquidation map provides insights into probable price movements and risk zones by visually representing places where leveraged positions will likely be closed. Here is how to use a liquidation map in Bitcoin trading:Identify high-risk zones: Identify places with dense liquidation clusters to avoid overleveraging. These areas come across as magnets, attracting price changes that might cause a series of liquidations.Time entry and exit: Liquidation clusters help find the optimal entry and exit points. Entering and exiting trades before a cluster becomes risky helps you lock in profits before reversals.Combine with technical indicators: Enhance your research by combining liquidation maps with tools such as support/resistance levels and relative strength index (RSI). This sets out a comprehensive view of market conditions.Avoid herd mentality: Exercise caution in places with high leverage concentrations. Such zones may be traps constructed by larger players to induce liquidations and profit from the resulting volatility.Monitor whale activity: Large traders frequently target liquidation zones to turn price moves to their advantage. Observing these patterns can provide insights about prospective market movements.Anticipate reversals: Markets frequently experience reversals following large liquidation events. Recognizing these trends can aid in positioning for possible rebounds.Implement robust risk management: Use stop-loss orders and handle leverage carefully. Liquidation maps can help you determine where to put these orders to minimize exposure.Common mistakes to avoid when using the Bitcoin liquidation mapUsing a Bitcoin liquidation map can enhance trading decisions, but misinterpretation can lead to costly errors. Here are common mistakes you need to avoid:Blindly trading toward liquidity zones: If you are trading toward liquidity zones without thinking, expect reversals.Misreading map colors or scale: Making a mistake in judging map colors or scale can skew your risk assessment.Over-relying on liquidation data without context: Maps are valuable tools, not an assurance that what they reflect will happen.Ignoring macro news or sentiment analysis: External events often override technical signals. A sudden event may make all predictions fall flat.Always combine liquidation maps with broader technical analysis. Smart trading requires context, not just colorful charts.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: PACERCoinbase reported on May 15 that four days earlier it had been hit with a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals bribed several of its customer support agents to access internal systems and steal a limited amount of user account data.The stolen data included names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, some bank account identifiers, driver’s licenses, passports and some account data, such as balance snapshots and transaction history.Bender claimed that “Coinbase failed to implement and maintain reasonable security safeguards,” which exposed users to “serious and ongoing risks.”The suit also claimed Coinbase’s response to the incident was “inadequate, fragmented, and delayed.”“Users were not promptly or fully informed of the compromise, and Coinbase did not immediately take meaningful steps to mitigate further harm,  provide identity protection services, or offer actionable guidance to affected individuals,” the complaint claimed.The lawsuit claimed users could face “substantial, immediate, and ongoing threat of identity theft and financial fraud” and that the consequences of the breach could be long-term or “potentially permanent” because the compromised information can’t be recovered or made secure once exposed.Flurry of lawsuits make similar allegations Two other lawsuits filed in a New York federal court made similar claims against Coinbase, while a fourth lawsuit added the allegation of unjust enrichment, arguing that Coinbase didn’t spend enough on data security measures.All four complaints ask for damages and other measures to help protect the plaintiff’s sensitive data.Meanwhile, a fifth lawsuit filed in a California federal court on May 15 made similar claims against Coinbase, but asked the court to order Coinbase to purge all sensitive data it holds about the plaintiffs and hire third-party security auditors to test its security systems, among other requests.A Coinbase spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuits and instead pointed Cointelegraph to a blog post it shared regarding the data breaches.Coinbase said it refused to pay the $20 million ransom and has flagged plans to reimburse users tricked into sending crypto to phishing scammers due to the data breach.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the exchange said it expects reimbursement expenses ranging from $180 million to $400 million.Related: Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonatorThe exchange also reportedly fired a group of customer support agents based in India following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users.Coinbase (COIN) shares dipped 7% and dropped to $244 after it disclosed the data breach along with an ongoing SEC probe over misstated user numbers in 2021.The stock has since staged a comeback, spiking 9% and hitting $266 by the closing bell on May 16, according to Google Finance. Coinbase has climbed even higher following the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey is among those calling for the change, saying in a May 18 X post that satoshis, or sats, are too confusing for newcomers.“Bits of Bitcoin is better, and just Bitcoin is best,” Dorsey said.Dorsey pointed to a December 2024 discussion on the topic where Stevie Lee, product lead of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Spiral, argued that not enough people know or care about what satoshis are.“Everyone knows Bitcoin, no one knows sats, people just want to send and receive Bitcoin,” Lee said, recalling past conversations where people thought satoshis were an entirely new token, unrelated to Bitcoin.He added that the Bitcoin community shouldn’t be too concerned with the change, as they know the underlying economics of Bitcoin would remain intact.Related: DOJ charges 12 more gamer-turned $263M Bitcoin robbersSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten and Byte Federal director of product Michelle Weekley were among those who opposed the change.“People understand cents in a dollar, they will understand sats in a Bitcoin,” Weekley said on X.Magdalena Gronowska, a self-described Bitcoin consultant, claimed that the change could make some people think that Bitcoin abruptly crashed from its current price of around $100,000 and that its “supply has massively inflated.”Zaprite business development lead Parker Lewis argued that sats were easier to understand.
