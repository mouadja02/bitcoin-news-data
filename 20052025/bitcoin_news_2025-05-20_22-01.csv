2025-05-20T19:55:27.000Z,"Robinhood Presses SEC for Clarity on Tokenizing RWAs in Bid for On-Chain Stock Trading: Report","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting regulatory clarity on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and its potential application to on-chain stock trading. According to a Forbes report , the proposal, filed with the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, outlines a framework for compliant issuance, custody, and trading of tokenized assets, aiming to modernize US capital markets. Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan told Forbes, “This proposal could mark the first time a U.S.-regulated broker has laid out a viable path for bringing trillions of dollars in assets onchain – without compromising regulatory integrity. If the SEC embraces this, it’s a signal to the world that tokenization has a legitimate seat at the traditional finance table.” Robinhood’s plan includes federally licensed tokenized asset standards, integrated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, and a modified Form S-1 for tokenized securities. The planned Real World Asset Exchange (RRE) would operate on the Solana ( SOL ) and Base blockchains. Last month, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that the tokenization of traditional assets could secure the dominance of the US equities market. “Tokenization of securities, which we’re very excited about, allows you to have ownership in companies… Stablecoins are viewed rightly as an area that could increase demand among individuals overseas as governments become prone to diversifying away from holding treasuries. So in the same way that stablecoin legislation can kind of push forward US dollar dominance, I think tokenized securities can really push forward US company dominance in the global market.” At time of writing, the SEC has yet to issue a formal response.

2025-05-20T19:44:07.000Z,"Ethereum price gained 90% the last time this indicator turned bullish","Key Takeaways: Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600. If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur. Ethereum (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag. Ethereum 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) supports the lower range. The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern. Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline? On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow. In 2023, ETH surged 93% to $4,000 after a similar crossover, while in 2020, it skyrocketed by 1,820%, sparking a massive altcoin rally. Ethereum Gaussian channel analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Conversely, a similar setup in August 2022 led to an invalidation during a market correction, highlighting the risks of relying solely on this indicator. Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout. It is important to note that the golden cross is on a 12-hour chart, which is less dependable than the one-day chart. Related: Bitcoin fractal analysis forecasts new all-time highs above $110K by end of week Traders exercise caution ahead of possible ‘range-bound environment’ Popular crypto trader XO noted that Ethereum is consolidating under a “decent” resistance level below the $2,800 mark. The trader expects a correction if ETH cannot break above $2,800 over the next few days. The analyst said, “I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.” A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period. Ethereum 1-week price analysis.

Last month, John Moolenaar (R-Michigan), the chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, wrote to the CEOs of both banks to express “significant concerns” about their involvement in Contemporary Amperex Technology’s Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). The firm, known as CATL, is an electric vehicle battery manufacturer, but Moolenaar says it’s also a Communist Party-aligned “Chinese military company” tied to the ongoing persecution of the Uyghur people. “CATL maintains a close, tier-one supplier relationship with the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), a paramilitary entity of the Chinese state that operates forced labor camps and is directly tied to the ongoing genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. XPCC was the foundational entity written into the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and is connected to mass arbitrary detention, severe physical abuse, and other human rights abuses targeting Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the region.” Both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America (BoA) are underwriting CATL’s IPO, which reportedly raised $4.6 billion.

2025-05-20T19:21:52.000Z,"Spot XRP ETFs Now ‘Only A Matter Of Time’ After CFTC-Regulated Futures Begin Trading In US","XRP futures traded for the first time on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group’s US derivatives exchange on May 19, offering market participants new tools to manage risk and get exposure to the price of XRP as the Ripple-linked token’s mainstream adoption gains momentum. A popular crypto industry pundit believes the CME futures listing bodes well for a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in 2025. XRP Futures Finish First Day Of Trading Last month, CME confirmed plans to list two types of XRP futures contracts: retail-friendly micro contracts representing 2,500 XRP and standard contracts representing 50,000 XRP. They are the second regulated XRP futures to hit the US market after Coinbase launched XRP and nano XRP futures contracts on its derivatives exchange in April. The newly launched XRP futures are settled in cash, not physical XRP. On May 19, the contracts’ first trading day, 4 standard contracts totaling around $480,000 in notional volume at an average price of $2.40, changed hands on the exchange, according to CME data. The majority of activity came from 106 micro contracts, accounting for over $1 million in day one trading volume. “The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated on X on Monday, adding that Hidden Road executed the first block trade. CME already lists futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). US regulators approved exchange-traded funds for both of those cryptocurrencies last year. The rollout of XRP futures on CME comes as efforts to settle the SEC’s protracted lawsuit against Ripple hit a wall in court. As ZyCrypto covered last week, US District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request by the two parties to approve a settlement that would have reduced Ripple’s civil penalty from $125 million to $50 million. Calling it “procedurally improper,” Judge Torres indicated that the motion did not satisfy Rule 60, which only allows relief from a final judgment under exceptional circumstances. The ruling keeps Ripple’s legal woes alive and adds uncertainty over the timeline for spot XRP ETF approvals. ETF Approval Odds ETF Store Nate Geraci has expressed optimism about XRP’s next big move after the launch of the highly anticipated CME XRP futures. Amid the buzz surrounding this significant development, Geraci reckons that U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are next in line. His remark suggests that the launch of the CFTC-regulated futures will act as a stepping stone for XRP to secure regulatory approval for spot products.

2025-05-20T19:15:55.000Z,"Zeus Network bridges Bitcoin to Solana, with Chainlink’s cross-chain tech","Zeus Network is leveraging the secure Chainlink CCIP and proof of reserve to bridge Bitcoin to Solana in a decentralized way. More and more companies are rolling out advancements in cross-chain bridges. On Tuesday, May 20, Zeus Network, a cross-chain communications layer for Bitcoin and Solana, implemented Chainlink CCIP. This widely adopted standard for bridging crypto assets now enables users to transfer Bitcoin to Solana securely. Users can now move Zeus’s Bitcoin-backed token, zBTC, across Ethereum, Base, and Solana. All zBTC tokens are backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, which users can verify in real time using Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve. You might also like: Blockchain Bridges: What Are They & How Do They Work? According to Zeus Network founder and CEO Justin Wang, this integration is key to addressing longstanding security concerns with cross-chain transfers. Cross-chain bridges are often centralized, exposing users to risks such as hacks and rug pulls. “Wrapped BTC tokens are flawed because they aren’t decentralized — many of them still require KYC, have third-party entities involved in the trading, and ultimately take control away from the user. The Chainlink standard enables this to solve these issues and provide an enhanced experience for our users,” Justin Wang, Zeus Network. You might also like: Hacken: Access control exploits account for nearly 80% of all crypto hacks in 2024 Bitcoin liquidity is now available on Solana Wang emphasized that the integration gives Bitcoin users a decentralized way to access DeFi on Solana, while also bringing Bitcoin liquidity to the Solana ecosystem. “zBTC offers users a truly decentralized Bitcoin asset compatible with the Solana ecosystem, now able to be easily transferred across the most widely used chains thanks to our integration of Chainlink CCIP. We are excited to unlock the vast liquidity potential for DeFi on Solana by leveraging Chainlink, powered entirely by Bitcoin,” Justin Wang, Zeus Network. Zeus Network is not the only firm that recently integrated Chainlink CCIP. For instance, in April, Ronin, one of the most popular blockchain bridges, moved its legacy bridge to Chainlink’s standard. Ronin itself suffered a $650 million hack in March 2022.

2025-05-20T19:00:31.000Z,"Buy Bitcoin, Ditch The Banks Before It’s Too Late—Kiyosaki","Financial writer Robert Kiyosaki urges investors to consider assets like Bitcoin, gold and silver to protect their savings. He argues that these traditional forms of money are better shields against what he calls “mounting financial risks.” Kiyosaki has issued a fresh warning that an economic turmoil could be on the horizon. He points to the US departure from the gold standard in 1971 as the seed of ongoing instability. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight Bitcoin: Signs From Past Crises According to Kiyosaki, the Long‑Term Capital Management event in 1998 and the Wall Street crash in 2008 were early warnings. He says neither of those shocks caused the real problem—they merely hinted at deeper trouble. In his view, central banks patched holes by injecting cash, but they never fixed the underlying cracks. Those quick fixes run the risk of unravelling when debt levels get too high. In 1998 Wall Street got together and bailed out a hedge fund LTCM: Long Term Capital Management. In 2008 the Cental Banks got together to bail out Wall Street. In 2025, long time friend, Jim Rickards is asking who is going to bail out the Central Banks? In other words each… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 18, 2025 Central Bank Limits Exposed Based on reports, Kiyosaki believes that printing money can’t solve every financial headache. He warns that central banks may soon hit their limits. He points out that unlimited cash printing erodes trust in currency, making it hard for banks and governments to rely on the same old playbook. In his words, “You can’t borrow or print your way out of an endless pile of debt.” That debt, he says, is growing every day. Student Loans As Potential Trigger According to the warning, US student loan debt ranks high on his list of danger signs. He sees it as a ticking time bomb that could trigger serious credit shocks. He’s not alone: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that widespread defaults could unsettle credit markets. Economist James Rickards shares the view, arguing that mass non‑payments may shake the financial system more than commercial real estate or corporate bankruptcies. Growing Interest In Bitcoin And Precious Metals Based on his comments, more people are eyeing Bitcoin, gold and silver as lifeboats. He notes that Bitcoin’s capped supply gives it an edge over fiat money, which can be printed in endless batches. He contrasts a fixed 21 million‑coin limit with the unchecked growth of government debt. Gold and silver, with centuries of use as money, also win points because they can’t be created by a keyboard.

He reminds readers that no one can guarantee safety in cash; history has shown that hard assets often hold value when paper money weakens.

These customers included well-known people in the tech field. Cybercriminals bribed customer service reps in other countries to get access to sensitive user data without permission. The hackers tried to force Coinbase to pay $20 million in Bitcoin over stolen customer data, but the exchange refused. Coinbase revealed this on Thursday. Instead, the company offered a $20 million reward for any information to help catch and convict the attackers. Michael Arrington accuses Coinbase of using the cheapest option for customer service Michael Arrington said regulators should think again about the importance of “know-your-customer” (KYC). He added, “Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price. And Coinbase’s customers will bear that cost.” He also said that problems like these will keep happening because of KYC and other laws that make it easy for hackers to get away with their crimes. He added that the government and businesses need to do something to stop this. However, Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of Coinbase, disagreed with Arrington’s view that leaders should be punished. He said regulators are forcing KYC on companies that don’t want to do it. Crypto kidnappings are on the rise Digital assets are increasingly linked to real-world heists. It reminds investors why keeping crypto private is essential. Last November, three teens kidnapped a man in Las Vegas after a crypto event he put on and held him hostage at his home with a gun. He was pushed into a car and taken out into the desert. Attackers got into his crypto wallets and stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This year also has a share of kidnappings. In January, a group of thieves broke into the home of David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, in Vierzon, France. They took Balland and his wife hostage, beat them up, and cut off one of Balland’s fingers to get to his crypto wallet keys. After the attack, the thieves called another co-founder of Ledger and demanded a ransom. Police arrested 10 suspects. In addition, a famous streamer and OnlyFans personality named Kaitlyn “Amouranth” Siragusa had her home broken into by three armed men in March. They beat her up and told her to send them her Bitcoin. Luckily for her, she could fire her gun, which made the attackers run away. As recent as this month, the father of a crypto millionaire was kidnapped in broad daylight on the streets of Paris. French cops were able to free him. It was said that the kidnappers wanted a ransom of €5 million to €7 million. The attackers cut off one of the man’s fingers as a cruel way to get him to obey. Police arrested five suspects. Because of these and other events, a physical security company in Amsterdam told Bloomberg that it had seen a rise in clients with big amounts of crypto before the Coinbase breach.

2025-05-20T18:54:58.000Z,"Bitcoin Remains Stable as Spot Market Leads Derivatives in Inflows","The recent bitcoin (BTC) rally has been characterised by a series of impulsive moves and well-defined consolidation phases. However, one thing that stood out during the surge was the active participation of spot traders. According to the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report , BTC has been through a period of aggressive buying in the spot market. In contrast, traders in the derivatives market were caught relatively offside. Spot Market Leads Derivatives Since mid-April, the market has witnessed significant net spot buying across most trading platforms. This is evident in the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between aggressive buys and sells. Bitfinex analysts said CVD across major centralized exchanges peaked at more than $45 million per day. The surge aligned with bitcoin’s rally from $75,000 to above $104,000, with buying pressure building gradually before each breakout. This has reflected genuine demand rather than speculative derivatives activity, indicating that the rally is “built on solid ground” and supported by real capital flows. Although BTC is consolidating now, analysts insist the asset needs this pattern of spot buyer dominance to navigate key resistance levels near its all-time high. The Middle of a Mature Bull Market On the other hand, the derivatives market has been cautious and reactive, as seen in the Spot Premium. This metric shows the difference between the Bitcoin spot price and the average of seven perpetuals and futures market prices. The Spot Premium has been positive since BTC crossed $80,000 in this rally. Moreover, open interest in perpetual futures contracts has been contracting, reflecting a short squeeze as traders are compelled to unwind their bearish positions. While the market transitions from bearish to bullish, traders betting against bitcoin’s price surge have been caught off guard and liquidated with excess leverage flushed out of the system. “The presence of back-to-back squeezes, on both sides of the trade, underscores a critical point: the rally appears to be maturing in a constructive fashion. The clearing out of over-leveraged participants has reset market positioning and created a healthier foundation for continuation,” analysts said. These market dynamics are often seen during the early stages of a sustained bullish move. Analysts tagged it as the alignment of spot accumulation and derivatives market clean-up. With bitcoin’s surge now standing on firmer footing, the market is moving from speculative leverage towards structural buying, as is expected in the middle of a mature bull market.

2025-05-20T18:45:14.000Z,"Lawyers for Tornado Cash Developer Say Federal Prosecutors Withheld Critical Evidence From Court","Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm’s legal team is accusing the government of withholding information from the court. Storm was arrested in 2023 and slapped with charges related to allegedly laundering $1 billion in criminal proceeds, including hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercriminal outfit. The Tornado Cash founder was also charged with operating an unregistered money-transmitting business, though that part of the indictment was dropped earlier this month in accordance with an April Department of Justice (DOJ) memo that encouraged an end to digital asset “regulation by prosecution.” The prosecutors are still pursuing the other charges. Now, Storm’s lawyers claim government prosecutors have held onto exculpatory materials since 2023 regarding their claims that noncustodial crypto mixers can act as money transmitters. “A recent filing in a similar prosecution involving Samourai Wallet, a noncustodial cryptocurrency mixer, revealed that, on August 23, 2023, S.D.N.Y. prosecutors had a previously undisclosed call with senior officials from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)… During that call, FinCEN officials stated that because Samourai ‘did not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT (emphasis in original) acting as an MSB [money services business/money transmitting business].'” Even though the government has dropped the unregistered money-transmitter portion of the indictment, Storm’s lawyers still claim that the failure to disclose those documents constitutes a “Brady violation” and has “materially prejudiced” the Tornado Cash founder’s defense. Brady violations involve prosecutors failing to disclose pertinent evidence that would help a defendant’s case. They can result in conviction reversals, mistrials, charge dismissals and/or prosecutorial misconduct charges. Storm’s trial is scheduled for July 14th.

2025-05-20T18:44:08.000Z,"Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin’s Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead”","Cryptocurrency analyst James Van Straten has shared a remarkable analysis of Bitcoin's recent price movements. Van Straten argues that the record highs in question — $20,000 in 2017, $69,000 in 2021 and $109,000 in 2025 — do not accurately reflect investors’ profitability and market sentiment. Instead, he points out that the metric known as “realized price” is much more meaningful. According to Van Straten, the realized price represents the average purchase cost of Bitcoins withdrawn from all exchanges and is used to understand the general cost base of the market. The average realized price for 2025 is $93,266. The current price of Bitcoin, around $105,000, shows that investors are making an average profit of around 12%. After reaching a peak of $109,000 in late January, Bitcoin fell and briefly fell below its 2025 realized price. This is historically interpreted as a “capitulation” signal. Van Straten notes that this period of stress lasted until April 22, after which Bitcoin regained this critical cost floor. Related News: JUST IN: Argentina's President Makes Another Controversial Move Related to the LIBRA Cryptocurrency Scandal He Is Involved In The analyst explains how such moves provide critical signals for market cycles, citing examples from past years: 2024: Following ETF approval, Bitcoin falls to $49,000 after falling below its average cost floor, amid a decline in Japanese yen carry trades during the summer. 2023: Except for a brief dip during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in March, the price has generally traded above its cost floor. Van Straten said that in the 2017 bull market, the large difference between the market price and the realized price represented excessive speculation, whereas in the 2018 bear market, the price reconciled with this metric, suggesting that the realized price acts as a kind of “floor support” in bear markets. Finally, Van Straten notes that the realized price has continued to rise over time, and that by looking at this metric, Bitcoin has not only reached record levels, but has also become a maturing asset class over the long term. According to the analyst, this indicates that capital commitment to the network is increasing and the market is gaining a deeper structure. “Instead of focusing on peak prices, it is much more important to track investors’ profitability over the total cost base to understand where Bitcoin is heading,” the analyst said. *This is not investment advice.

KKR, which had over $360 billion in assets under management as of the end of last year, says government bonds have ceased to act as “shock absorbers” for investors, Bloomberg reports . Says Henry McVey, KKR’s head of global macro and asset allocation, “During risk off days, government bonds are no longer fulfilling their role as the ‘shock absorbers’ in a traditional portfolio… Many CIOs are considering moving assets out of the United States toward other parts of the world.” McVey also says that the US dollar is about 15% overvalued, and that a weaker greenback is most likely approaching as President Trump’s new trade agenda develops. “The traditional role of U.S. government bonds in many global portfolios will become more diminished… The reality is that the US government is burdened with a large fiscal deficit and high leverage, and its bonds are likely over-owned by many global investors who have benefited from both positive interest rate differentials and a strong US dollar.” Last week, Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating from AAA to AA1 while changing the country’s outlook from negative to stable. Moody’s attributes the downgrade to the United States’ soaring national debt and interest payment ratios that exceed those of other countries with the same credit rating. “As deficits and debt have grown, and interest rates have risen, interest payments on government debt have increased markedly. Without adjustments to taxation and spending, we expect budget flexibility to remain limited, with mandatory spending, including interest expense, projected to rise to around 78% of total spending by 2035 from about 73% in 2024. If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, which is our base case, it will add around $4 trillion to the federal fiscal primary (excluding interest payments) deficit over the next decade.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-20T18:37:07.000Z,"How German Government Missed Out On $2.3 Billion Profits By Selling Its Bitcoin Stash Too Early","The German government offloaded its Bitcoin holdings in 2024, which became a costly mistake. The price of the benchmark crypto has now soared past the $106,000 mark, costing Europe’s largest economy an estimated $2.3 billion in missed profits. Germany Missed Out On $2.35 Billion The German gov’t sold 49,858 Bitcoins during the summer of 2024 as part of the plan to offload Bitcoin seized from the now-defunct film piracy website Movie2k. The average price of the sale was $57,900 per coin. According to data provided by Arkham Intelligence, Germany could have amassed far greater profits by holding onto its BTC stash a tad longer. Bitcoin’s price rebounded above the psychologically important $60,000 level on July 14, a day after the German government ran out of BTC, dispelling investor fears about additional selling pressure. The price of Bitcoin jumped over 80% since the sale, trading hands at $106,306 as of press time. Arkham noted that the decision to sell the BTC early cost the German government a potential $2.35 billion in missed profit. “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B. Opportunity cost: $2.35 Billion,” the blockchain intelligence firm wrote on X. US Government Misses Out On $20 Billion The German government isn’t the only one that has missed out on potential gains by selling Bitcoin too early. According to data from Case CSO Jameson Lopp’s U.S. government sales tracker, the United States government has offloaded different amounts of Bitcoin in 11 auctions over the last decade. The tracker reveals that the U.S. government has sold 195,091.75 BTC over the years, raking in a total of $366.5 million. But at current market prices, that hoard would have been worth over $20 billion — resulting in an opportunity cost of around $20.3 billion. However, President Trump adopted a different approach after taking office in January. In March, he signed an Executive Order authorizing the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve with BTC owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal forfeiture proceedings. Moreover, the recently reintroduced Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act of 2025 by Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis would allow the US to potentially hold more than 1 million Bitcoin in its reserves if signed into law.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/how-german-government-missed-out-on-2-3-billion-profits-by-selling-its-bitcoin-stash-too-early/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Germany",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T18:30:49.000Z,"Jack Dorsey Backs Radical Bitcoin Overhaul: Why Your ‘Satoshis’ Could Soon Become ‘Bitcoins","Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, endorsed BIP 177, which proposes a radical rebranding of Bitcoin’s base unit. Dorsey supported the proposal on X and spread the new idea with 1 million views. A software developer, John Carvalho, published BIP 177 titled “Refine Bitcoin’s Base Unit”, arguing that the BTC currency could be simplified by removing leading zeros and the decimal point. Using current prices, A single Bitcoin worth over $100,000 makes the token cumbersome for regular trade. A Bitcoin comprises 100,000,000 Satoshis, or “sats”, named after the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. BIP 177 proposes to redefine 1 Bitcoin as the base unit of BTC, instead of the Satoshi or “sat” value, effectively removing the decimal place system and creating a more conventional system that resembles fiat systems. BIP 177 argued that a more readable system would make Bitcoin more comprehensible for new users. The change in base values to Bitcoins would align the currency with the underlying architecture, which is not a decimal-based system. The base value, called Bitcoins or Satoshis, represents the underlying technology and can be experimented with, switching between new and legacy systems without affecting the blockchain. The author of BIP 177 also criticised the “bits” proposal, suggesting that the alternate system is confusing and does not improve a user’s experience. BIP 177 suggests a phase-based transition, with both new and legacy systems being used side by side until the general public gets used to the discrete representation. An education campaign could be created to help people understand the new system. BIP 177 concludes that a discrete system of Bitcoins would better represent the underlying technology, which is discrete rather than fractional, and would enhance the continuity between blockchain technology and currency representations. The proposal would refer to Satoshis as Bitcoins, changing the way traders represent the price of Bitcoin. For example, if BIP were adopted, 0.00001234 BTC would be defined as ₿1,234, which would be described as 1,234 Bitcoin. Carvalho insists that such a change will make Bitcoin easier to comprehend. Carvalho has been accused of creating the system for ‘normies’ who may want a currency to look like fiat. But Carvalho says he wants to enhance continuity between the underlying technology and its representation. Dorsey referenced a December 2024 discussion by Stevie Lee about the confused use of Satoshis, highlighting the need to change the base currency. Lee pointed out that most people didn’t know what a Satoshi was, and may even think it was a different token. Dorsey concluded that Bitcoins should be referred to as Bitcoins, rather than Satoshis, to avoid ambiguity. He reasoned that people don’t want to think about what a Satoshi is, but want to transfer Bitcoins. The change may be difficult initially, but will be easier in the long run. Critics of the proposal, however, suggest that the changes are merely cosmetic and don’t dispel confusion about a currency’s fractional nature. The bit proposal, an alternate to BIP 177, creates a hybrid model that includes fractional elements. For example, 1 Bitcoin equals 1 million bits, and 1 bit equals 100 Satoshis. Using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, the system means that a price of $100,000 per Bitcoin (to simplify matters) would equal $100,000/1,000,000 bits, giving us a value of $0.1 per bit. That would mean $1 equals $1/0.1 bits, or $1 equals 10 bits. Therefore, using a current market price of $103,000 per Bitcoin, $103,000/1,000,000 bits would equal 0.103, which means $1 would roughly equal 9.7 bits (rounded off to one decimal place). The bit system further suggests that “sats” sounds very similar to “cents”, which may confuse traders further. Satoshi Nakamoto suggested that the decimal point could be shifted if the value becomes too big. This seems more similar to the bit method than the BIP 177 proposal, as the former uses a fractional system.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/jack-dorsey-backs-radical-bitcoin-overhaul-why-your-satoshis-could-soon-become-bitcoins/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Jack Dorsey",cryptocompare

2025-05-20T18:23:07.000Z,"Bitcoin dominance hits key resistance zone: is alt-season around the corner?","Bitcoin dominance is testing a historically significant resistance level within a long-standing bullish channel. A rejection at this level could signal the early stages of a rotation into altcoins — and potentially ignite a mini-alt season. Since November 2022, Bitcoin dominance has remained locked in an upward-sloping channel, reflecting growing market preference for BTC during periods of volatility and uncertainty. However, the chart is now showing signs of potential weakness as dominance approaches a resistance level that previously triggered a sharp altcoin rally. With Bitcoin trending toward all-time highs, a consolidation in price could create the perfect storm for a reversal in dominance, and a shift in capital into the altcoin market. Key technical points Upward Channel Structure: Bitcoin dominance has remained within a rising channel for over 18 months. Major Resistance Zone: Current levels mirror a historical rejection point that previously triggered alt-coin outperformance. Potential Reversal Catalyst: A BTC consolidation above ATH may precede a pullback in dominance, increasing alt-coin rotation. BTC.D Chart, Source: TradingView The Bitcoin dominance chart has respected the boundaries of an upsloping channel since late 2022. This structure has consistently signaled bullish control, with each test of support followed by higher highs. Currently, dominance is testing the upper bound of this channel, a resistance zone that has historically preceded notable altcoin rallies. This same region was last rejected during a previous run-up, which led to a temporary altcoin breakout and a drop in dominance. With Bitcoin now eyeing either a breakout or consolidation above its all-time high, market participants may begin reallocating capital into altcoins in search of higher returns. If dominance is rejected here again, we may see a repeat of this rotation, potentially driving a short-term altcoin rally. You might also like: XLM Price up 1.17% from key support: bullish structure points to $0.35 rally A key factor to watch is the integrity of the channel support. If dominance retraces toward the lower boundary of the channel, and especially if that level breaks, it could open the door for a more pronounced and sustained alt season. That said, such a scenario would likely require fundamental catalysts such as a major BTC correction or a strong return of risk-on sentiment to the broader market. What to expect in the coming price action A short-term rejection in dominance near this key resistance could spark a mini-alt season, particularly if Bitcoin enters a period of consolidation. If dominance loses its multi-year channel structure, it may pave the way for a broader altcoin surge, though such a move would likely depend on external catalysts and Bitcoin’s trend behavior in the weeks ahead.

2025-05-20T18:20:42.000Z,"Australian Federal Police (AFP) Seizes Man’s 25 BTC Suspected of Bitcoin Theft","The Australian Federal Police (AFP) have seized the assets of a Queensland man, suspected of Bitcoin theft, confiscating a waterfront property, a Mercedes-Benz sedan, and 25 BTC worth around $2.6 million. Local news outlets have identified the man as Shane Stephen Duffy. The seizure of assets comes after Luxembourg authorities tipped off AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, that the Queenslander was involved in a major Bitcoin theft. AFP further announced that the Bitcoin was seized some time ago, so the value of the crypto may have been priced at a different level when the AFP sold the tokens. Australian authorities also claim that the man had been previously convicted of hacking an American company. “A CACT investigation”, announced the AFP, “began in September 2018, after law enforcement partners in Luxembourg contacted AUSTRAC regarding suspicious Bitcoin transactions, linked to a Queensland man previously convicted of hacking a gaming company in the United States. The investigation identified suspected links between the man and the theft of 950 Bitcoin from a French cryptocurrency exchange in 2013. No criminal charges eventuated; however, the Commonwealth’s proceeds of crime laws allow the CACT to restrain suspected proceeds of crime, regardless of whether there is a related criminal prosecution”. The AFP announced on their website that federal authorities seized around $4.5 million in assets, including a beachfront mansion, a luxury car, and Bitcoin. The investigation began in 2018 by the AFP’s Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), which was able to link stolen Bitcoin to the Queenslander. CACT can seize assets despite no conviction, because the Australian Proceeds of Crime Act allows federal police to seize assets suspected of being connected to criminal activity. The AFP argues that his wealth far exceeded the amount of his legitimate earnings. They used this reasoning to seize all of his assets. A court ruling in April 2025 allowed the AFP to use the seized funds to pay for crime prevention programs. CACT has seized over $1.2 billion in assets since its creation in 2012. Shane Stephen Duffy, identified by local news outlets, pleaded guilty to hacking League of Legends players in 2016. However, despite Duffy pleading guilty to computer hacking and fraud, he didn’t directly hack League of Legends but obtained the data online and sold it for a profit. The original League of Legends hack occurred in 2011. There were over 5 million users whose data was compromised. Moreover, Duffy hacked the Riot Games X account to promote his data-selling business. The business promised to provide access to League of Legends accounts for a price. The Proceeds of Crime Act allows Australian officials to confiscate assets if a person can’t show that their assets came from honest work. The AFP, therefore, does not need to wait for a court case and can confiscate assets, such as cryptocurrencies, if it can prove that the assets came from dubious origins. Critics of these powers suggest that authorities could misuse them. However, supporters of these powers say that federal authorities need such powers to disrupt criminal networks. Duffy’s beachside house, Mercedes-Benz, and Bitcoin collection will be used by federal authorities to fund community awareness programs.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/australian-federal-police-afp-seizes-mans-25-btc-suspected-of-bitcoin-theft/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

Price discovery in this context refers to the process where buyers and sellers interact at an undefined or non-traded range to determine the market price of an asset. A break above Bitcoin's all-time high of $110,000 would initiate a price discovery phase, driving BTC into an uncharted trading range with successive higher highs until market participants establish a new equilibrium between supply and demand. Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin is close to confirming a “golden cross” on its daily chart, which has historically preceded 45% to 60% price rallies.

In contrast, it would take a drop to $94,612 to trigger a similar amount in long liquidations. This skew suggests a higher probability of the price pushing upward to chase liquidity on the sell-side rather than dropping lower.

Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle. In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled. “If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said. Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions. Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’ Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.” In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package. Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: Bloomberg Less than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021. Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacy It’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action. Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.” Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets. Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycle In contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high. Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money. It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake. Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. More front-facing in Washington, DC Armstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action , marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14. Source: Brian Armstrong The president faces scrutiny from lawmakers and industry leaders about his ties to the crypto industry, from his family-backed platform World Liberty Financial to his own memecoin, which was launched in January. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase and Armstrong but had not received a response at the time of publication. “It’s not my place to really comment on President Trump’s activity,” said Armstrong in response to concerns about the president’s potential conflicts of interest over stablecoins. Where the CEO takes Coinbase and his role in influencing the US government remains to be seen. There are fewer legal burdens and an administration that is seemingly friendly to the industry and Armstrong personally.

2025-05-20T17:45:59.000Z,"Top Analyst States Spots Stellar (XLM) Key Support","Stellar (XLM) , one of the most prominent altcoins in the blockchain-based payments sector, is currently facing a crucial moment in its price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ali, a respected figure known for his technical insights and data-driven market commentary, XLM is holding onto a key support level at $0.28. This zone, he notes, will be decisive in determining whether the asset stages a bullish rebound or slides into a more protracted correction. Key support for #Stellar $XLM sits at $0.28. Holding this level will determine whether we see a rebound or a deeper correction. pic.twitter.com/NKtN4PhjOr — Ali (@ali_charts) May 20, 2025 Ali’s analysis, shared via X, underscores the importance of the $0.28 support level not just as a psychological barrier, but as a historically reactive price point. In previous market cycles, XLM has shown a strong tendency to pivot from similar levels, either launching fresh upward trends or breaking down into deeper retracements depending on broader market sentiment and volume dynamics. A Crucial Technical Juncture for XLM Over the past year, Stellar has experienced a mixture of consolidation and intermittent price surges, often in tandem with macro developments across the crypto sector. After seeing moderate growth during the market-wide rally sparked by Bitcoin’s resurgence and increased institutional interest in late 2024 and early 2025, XLM began to show signs of exhaustion. As with many altcoins, the fading momentum in early May introduced a wave of cautious trading activity. Now, with prices hovering close to the $0.28 threshold, the market’s reaction will be critical. If buyers can defend this support and volume strengthens, a rebound could carry Stellar back toward key resistance levels in the $0.35–$0.40 region. Conversely, a decisive break below $0.28 could open the door to a deeper pullback, possibly testing the mid-$0.20 range depending on the strength of the broader altcoin market. Network Fundamentals and Market Outlook Despite current technical fragility, Stellar’s underlying fundamentals remain solid. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to push forward with real-world applications, including its partnerships with global remittance providers and efforts to expand blockchain adoption in developing markets. One of Stellar’s defining strengths lies in its focus on financial inclusion, particularly through low-cost, cross-border payments and tokenized asset transfers. Moreover, the blockchain has made progress in areas such as smart contracts, interoperability, and asset issuance—features that contribute to its long-term relevance even as newer chains enter the market. With this foundation, market participants are keeping a close eye on developments that could serve as catalysts for renewed investor interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Sentiment and the Role of Bitcoin As with most altcoins, Stellar’s immediate price path is closely tied to Bitcoin’s movements. Recent hesitation in BTC’s upward momentum has introduced volatility across the market. This environment often places additional pressure on altcoins, especially those testing critical support levels. However, if Bitcoin resumes its upward trend and sentiment across the market improves, Stellar could benefit from renewed capital inflows. The ability of XLM to hold $0.28 as a launchpad for recovery will be a key indicator of its strength relative to the broader market cycle. Ali’s identification of the $0.28 level as a key support for Stellar comes at a time when precision and patience are vital for investors. With the market at a pivotal stage, XLM’s next move will likely set the tone for its medium-term outlook. Whether it rebounds from this critical level or breaks lower will depend not only on technical factors but also on the strength of market-wide sentiment and confidence in Stellar’s broader mission. As the community watches closely, one thing is clear: the next few days could prove defining for Stellar’s short-term future.

While ETH's rise increased bullish expectations, option investors also switched to bull mode. According to Coindesk, option traders have turned to a bullish call spread strategy and expect Ethereum to reach $6,000 by the end of the year. According to Deribit data, institutional investors are aiming to make maximum profits if Ethereum reaches $6,000 by the end of the year by buying $3,500 call options and selling $6,000 call options. Both options expire on December 26. Investors using this strategy will make maximum profits if Ethereum surpasses $6000 by the end of the year. Crypto derivatives analyst Greg Magadini said that Ethereum still has room to rise, adding that ETH’s upside potential remains. Believing that ETH is currently undervalued compared to other risk assets that are on the rise, Magadini stated that Ethereum has still not reached its cycle peak. “Ethereum has not yet reached its peak and this is not the time to predict its peak. ETH is likely to experience a major recovery, The launch of a spot ETF with staking would be a significant catalyst for the rally.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-20T17:33:48.000Z,"South Korean Presidential Candidate Makes Case for Korean Won Stablecoin","As South Korea’s Presidential election approaches, candidates are introducing new ideas to support the country’s digital economy. Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, has recently shared plans to support the development of a stablecoin linked directly to the Korean won. This new digital currency is meant to prevent money from leaving South Korea and reduce the country’s reliance on foreign money like the U.S. dollar. Lee thinks it will strengthen South Korea’s economy and help protect national wealth. A Presidential Push for a Won-Based Stablecoin Lee Myung pushed for a stablecoin pegged to the Korean won. Many people in the country use stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which are backed by the U.S. dollar. This leads to Korean won being converted into U.S. dollars, resulting in significant outflows from domestic funds. Lee wants to change this by creating a Korean stablecoin to help keep national wealth within the country’s borders. During the first quarter of this year, South Korean crypto exchanges recorded outflows totaling $40.8 billion, equivalent to 56.8 trillion won. Half of this amount was due to the use of U.S. dollar-based stablecoins. Currently, South Korean regulations do not permit the issuance of won-backed stablecoins. This ban has made it hard to keep enough money flowing in South Korea’s financial system. Plans To Make Crypto Investment Safe and Legal in South Korea Besides the stablecoin idea, Lee also supports the introduction of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to South Korea. He asserted that this would allow people to invest in digital coins like Bitcoin (BTC) through typical financial markets. He also wants to create clear and firm rules for crypto. This would protect investors and allow big groups, like the National Pension Fund, to invest in digital assets safely. Meanwhile, Lee is not the only one who supports the growth of crypto in South Korea. Kim Moon-soo, a candidate from the People Power Party (PPP), has also expressed his intention to help expand the crypto sector if elected. During a public meeting, Kim Moon-soo pledged to legalize spot ETFs , lower transaction fees, and introduce robust consumer protections. These proposals align with the broader policy direction of the People Power Party , which was announced in April. South Korea Softens Tough Stance On Crypto Rules South Korea was once known for its strict stance on cryptocurrency. In 2017, several digital asset activities were banned in the country. However, the government has recently started to ease these restrictions, allowing businesses to re-enter the crypto space. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea plans to issue new guidelines for crypto investment in the third quarter of this year. This move signals the country’s intention to end the ban on institutional investment in digital assets.

2025-05-20T17:02:45.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Latest Rebound Signals a Healthier, More Sustainable Bull Market","Bitcoin is currently seeing an interesting trend being played out. In fact, new data suggest that buying sentiment remains favorable for further upside, implying it may be premature to consider exiting. Though it’s hard to pinpoint when Bitcoin might top its previous high, the current on-chain and market data signals remain very “constructive.” Bitcoin Rally Looks Different This Time According to a new report from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s recent price rebound shows signs of strength without the usual indicators of market overheating. In previous cycles, every time Bitcoin hit a new all-time high, Binance recorded a sharp spike in both market buy volume and funding rates. These surges were typically followed by significant corrections as the market cooled off, as seen clearly in the first two major rallies of this cycle. However, the latest rebound appears different. As Bitcoin approaches previous highs once again, funding rates remain stable, and market buy volume on Binance is actually declining. While some may view this as a lack of momentum, CryptoQuant suggests it reflects a more sustainable, healthy rally. Unlike the earlier overheated rallies that triggered sharp corrections and mass investor exits, the current trend shows that the market remains relatively light and cautious. Despite improved sentiment, on-chain data indicates that buying pressure is increasing gradually rather than surging all at once. In fact, market buy volume has shown a steady upward trajectory since 2023, which is indicative of continued bullish interest. As such, the underlying data – from funding rates to buy volumes – supports a constructive market outlook while the absence of overheating further suggests this rally may be more durable than previous ones. Bitcoin Primed for June Rally? As reported by CryptoPotato earlier, Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization has reached a record $906 billion, which reflects rising investor confidence and strong on-chain fundamentals. The metric has increased for four consecutive weeks. Since May 8, Bitcoin has attracted $14.4 billion in new capital, with large holders (100-1,000 BTC) increasing their combined balance by 122,540 BTC – a 2.2% rise. While most institutional ETFs remained cautious, BlackRock expanded its holdings by 10,302 BTC. This sustained capital inflow may set the stage for a breakout, especially if Bitcoin manages to retain the $104,731 resistance. The next target could be $107,757. Meanwhile, improving tech earnings, reduced AI capex fears, political optimism under Trump, and upcoming FTX payouts are some of the factors that could help Bitcoin into a strong June rally.

2025-05-20T17:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Power Compared To Nuclear Reactor By Brazilian Business Leader","According to a recent conference call, Méliuz Chairman Israel Salmen likened Bitcoin to a “nuclear reactor” after the company’s stock saw a sudden surge. The fintech firm won shareholder approval to become Brazil’s first Bitcoin treasury company. Shareholders backed the shift by a large margin. Salmen said the move marks a new path for Méliuz, one that ties the firm’s health directly to the performance of Bitcoin per share. It was a bold turn that has already caught the eye of investors at home and abroad. Méliuz Builds Bitcoin Treasury Based on reports, Méliuz paid about $28.4 million last week to acquire 274.52 BTC. Those coins join an existing stash of 45.78 BTC, bringing the total to 320 BTC. Salmen noted that the firm plans to add more coins in an “accretive way,” using different financial tools. It’s not a hedge against market swings, he said. Bitcoin now sits at the heart of the company’s balance sheet . Every new purchase should add real value to each share. “Bitcoin is like a nuclear reactor that has been installed in our balance sheet.” – Meliuz (CASH3BZ, mkt cap $160M), Brazil’s first Bitcoin treasury company, Chairman Israel Salmen on the conference call pic.twitter.com/vpRw8z6Nbj — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 19, 2025 Stock Rally Fuels Interest According to data shared by VanEck’s Matthew Sigel, Méliuz stock jumped from R$3.00 in mid‑February 2025 to R$10.70 by mid‑May. Trading volume spiked in April, giving the rally fresh muscle. That kind of price move turns heads. Some traders say it’s a sign that linking the stock to Bitcoin could pay off. Others warn that a pullback in Bitcoin would hit Méliuz hard. Still, the stock run has put the firm on the map. Peers See Similar Gains Based on market reports, Semler Scientific’s stock climbed 40% over a month, rising $12.53 to close at $42.36 on May 19. The US‑listed firm said it posted a 22% BTC yield year‑to‑date as of May 12, adding 510 BTC and $52 million in dollar gains. And in a broader move, Strategy saw its share price rise 26% from $317 to $400 as of May 19. Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, controlling 576,230 BTC valued at roughly $59.57 billion. The company reported a gain of 73,120 BTC year‑to‑date, a 12% increase, and 140,538 BTC gains in 2024, equal to 24% of its holdings or about $13 billion in paper profit.

2025-05-20T17:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Rises Toward Previous Highs as Market Buy Volume Shows Steady Growth","Bitcoin rallies past $100K with stable funding rates and steady market buy volume. Long-term holders hold firm as Bitcoin nears its previous all-time high of $108,786. Bitcoin’s current rebound lacks overheating, signaling healthier market conditions. The current Bitcoin rally, which began near $74,508 in early April and has now pushed the price past $100,000, stands out for its stability compared to previous surges. Recent on-chain and market data show the cryptocurrency rising without the signs of overheating seen in earlier bull cycles. This trend has caught the attention of analysts monitoring the relationship between price movements, futures funding rates, and market buy volume. In the last bull phase for Bitcoin , an increase in funding rates on Binance and increases in market buy volume coincided with new all-time highs, followed by notable corrections.

2025-05-20T16:55:41.000Z,"Man Faces Multiple Charges in Alleged $350,000 Check Kiting Scam Targeting US Banks","A 42-year-old man from Connecticut has been taken into custody for his alleged role in a check fraud ring that stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from US banks. In a website post, the Connecticut State Police say they’ve arrested and charged Eric J. Christian with violating the Corrupt Organizations & Racketeering Act, conspiracy to commit first-degree larceny, fraudulent use of an ATM, illegal possession of a personal identification information device, issuing a bad check between $500-$1,000, conspiracy to commit third-degree identity theft and third-degree forgery. Police accuse Christian of participation in a check-kiting crew that defrauded US banks. Authorities say the thieves wrote bad checks from bank accounts with little to no money and deposited them into other accounts, making it appear that the funds existed. They would subsequently withdraw the funds before the check bounced. Christian has allegedly been recruiting individuals since 2020 to open accounts at various banks to facilitate the check fraud scheme. Evidence in the arrest warrant shows the fraud scheme caused banks to lose more than $350,000, but authorities say the actual figure is believed to be much higher. Six other individuals have also been arrested in connection with the case, with the expectation of more arrests. Christian is slated to appear in a Superior Court on May 22nd.

2025-05-20T16:50:56.000Z,"Americans want to ditch gold reserves for Bitcoin? New survey raises eyebrows","A survey by the Nakamoto Project attracted criticism after indicating that 8 out of 10 Americans want the U.S. to sell some of its gold reserves to buy Bitcoin. The U.S. crypto reserve continues to be a divisive issue, as revealed by the reactions to one recent survey. On May 20, the Nakamoto Project, a pro-Bitcoin (BTC) non-profit organization, claimed that one in four Americans want the U.S. to convert at least some of its gold reserves into Bitcoin. However, the findings quickly raised questions about the survey’s methodology. You might also like: Bitcoin, gold rise while stocks fall: is decoupling here to stay? Troy Cross, Chief Editor at the Nakamoto Project, explained that the survey had 3,345 respondents. These were selected to match the U.S. census by key demographic points, including age, gender, and race, to ensure the results were representative. Nakamoto Project survey on converting gold reserves to Bitcoin | Source: X Respondents were asked what percentage of gold reserves the U.S. should convert into Bitcoin. They were given a slider to select any value between 0% and 100% to indicate their answer. “Assuming the United States was thinking of converting some of their gold reserve into Bitcoin, what percentage would you advise they convert?,” was the exact survey question. You might also like: Bitcoin price target if its market cap matched that of gold Bitcoin reserve survey criticized for leading question The methodology quickly drew scrutiny, even within crypto circles. Many criticized the use of a slider and suggested that a yes-or-no question would have been more meaningful. Jan Wüstenfeld, lead researcher at Melanion GreenTech, called the design “unfortunate.” “The way you framed it and set it up, you effectively pushed people to answer with a non-zero allocation,” Wüstenfeld wrote. “You say it yourself: People are reluctant to set a slider at zero.” Nakamoto Project’s Troy Cross acknowledged the framing effects, but pointed out that the survey still gave valuable results. For instance, younger people favored bigger allocations, while women recommended smaller allocations than men.

2025-05-20T16:43:46.000Z,"Genesis Files Suits Against DCG to Recover Billions Worth of Allegedly Fraudulent Transfers","Crypto lender Genesis and its subsidiaries filed two lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), DCG CEO Barry Silbert and other executives, seeking to recover what it called fraudulent transfers of crypto worth billions of dollars. In total, Genesis and its creditors are seeking $3.2 billion across the two lawsuits. It is seeking to recover $2.2 billion in a suit filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and more than $1 billion in a suit at the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The New York filing says money was withdrawn from Genesis to repay DCG, Silbert, affiliates and other insiders in the year that led up to Genesis filing for Chapter 11 even though the company was insolvent. They \""knew through their close relationship with Genesis that its business was on the brink of collapse\"" and took the opportunity to withdraw all their assets and recover 100% of crypto and dollar loans made to the platform while members of the public were \""kept in the dark,\"" the suit alleges. Genesis suspended withdrawals in November 2022 and went into bankruptcy the following year. \""Silbert and his cronies recklessly operated, exploited, and then bankrupted Genesis following a spectacular campaign of fraud and self-dealing,\"" the Delaware filing alleges. Its creditors are still short $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets including bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and other tokens, the filing said. Alongside seeking an award of damages, Genesis wants an equitable trust over any assets the \""defendants improperly took or converted during their tenure as managers, officers, directors,\"" the filing said. “These baseless lawsuits recycle the same tired, two-year old claims in an opportunistic attempt by sophisticated investors to extract additional value from DCG,\"" a spokesperson for the company said. \""We worked in good faith with a wide range of stakeholders to try to achieve a comprehensive resolution of the DCG-related aspects of the Genesis bankruptcy.

Still, the news may not be fully priced in. XRP has since retraced to $2.35, alongside a 25% drop in trading volume in the 24 hours following the report. With many investors remaining on the sidelines and competing bidders in the mix, it has not yet made a compelling case as the best crypto to buy . Better-than-expected April inflation data have lifted sentiment, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s reluctance on rate cuts has tempered risk appetite, leaving the market cautiously optimistic. Ripple Wants Circle, But it Faces Tough Competition While Circle is still committed to going public, Fortune-reported informal talks with Coinbase and Ripple suggest it is exploring multiple paths. Sources from the banking and private equity sector say Circle is seeking at least $5 billion, the same valuation it is targeting for the IPO. Ripple has already made a bid in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion , but that offer was turned down as too low, according to Bloomberg. With a shared history dating back to 2018 through the Centre Consortium—a venture to establish fiat-backed stablecoins, including USDC—Coinbase is seen as the natural buyer. Though the consortium dissolved in 2023, Coinbase retains an equity stake in Circle and continues to share in the USDC revenue. Looks like Coinbase is trying to move in on Ripple’s plans… Looks like Coinbase is now interested in Circle USDC. However in my opinion I think Ripple got this… XRP RLUSD XLM USDC all under The Ripple Umbrella ——> USA Treasury pic.twitter.com/G93NsGmEpB — Remi In The System (@RemiRelief2) May 19, 2025 XRP Price Prediction: Could Ripple-Circle Pave the Way to $1000? Ripple Labs would likely integrate USDC into the XRP Ledger network, providing access to a sector expected to grow from $248 billion $2 trillion by 2030, according to Citigroup projections . Such an integration could significantly boost XRP Ledger transaction volumes, increasing the burn rate and utility demand for XRP. This would support long-term XRP price growth with deflationary pressure. However, in the near-term price action is likely to be defined by the breakout from the falling wedge pattern that has defined the multi-month XRP price downtrend. Momentum has faltered post-breakout, with the Rupple price now retesting the pattern’s former resistance as support. Crossing below this could invalidate the pattern completely. If momentum continues, the pattern sets an XRP price breakout target around $4 before the end of the year, representing a potential 70% surge from current prices. This outlook is supported by the MACD, which continues to lead above the signal line—often an early sign of a sustained mid-term trend. More so, the RSI holds in bullish territory above the neutral line at 50, though the balance remains delicate. Buying pressure continues to lead higher timeframes. The ongoing retest of past support at $2.20 in line with the 0.5 Fib retracement level—a common reversal zone—could mark a correction bottom if bulls fail to defend the current level. Looking further ahead, June 17 presents a major catalyst with the decision deadline on US XRP spot ETFs. Alongside a Ripple-Circle deal, the coveted $1,000 XRP price prediction could be in focus for the coming years. The Bull Market Could Be Back – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially with the market in a state of cautious optimism. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones, starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $6 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 68% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

2025-05-20T16:37:35.000Z,"Exploring The Meme Coin Ecosystem Beyond Husky Inu (HINU)","The crypto market is witnessing a significant uptick as major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), registered stunning rallies to cross key levels. BTC reclaimed $100,000 and crossed $105,000 this week, while ETH reclaimed the crucial $2,500 level. With cryptocurrencies rallying, investors are looking for low-cost, alternative investment options to enter the market. This is where meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Husky Inu (HINU) come into the picture. What Is Husky Inu (HINU)? Husky Inu (HINU) is the Solana Network’s latest meme coin offering. The fledgling project has created quite a furor in the meme coin ecosystem, positioning itself as an alternative to established meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and Dogwifhat (WIF). Husky Inu plans to conquer the meme coin ecosystem and build a supportive community offering enhanced rewards and innovative features. The project has completed its pre-sale and is in the middle of its pre-launch phase. The pre-launch phase has seen the HINU token price increase every two days. The token’s current price is $0.00017376, and the project has raised $762,568, as it gets closer to the $1.2 million milestone. Sizing Up The Competition Let’s look at the meme coins Husky Inu is set to go head-to-head with. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest meme coin by market capitalization, giving it an incumbent advantage over others. It was also one of the first cryptocurrencies created, made as a spoof on Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013. Investors who bought DOGE at its launch and HODL-ed made a significant profit. The meme coin became quite popular at launch, with the token and its blockchain having several use cases. Dogecoin’s value soared in 2021, making it one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Dogecoin has several high-profile backers and an enthusiastic community. However, none can match the profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the project’s most high-profile backer. Musk has taken the initiative to champion the token, putting it miles ahead of the competition and helping power significant gains for the asset. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest meme coins to enter the market. The project hopes to establish itself in the meme coin ecosystem and bring more value and utility to token holders and supporters by leveraging the Solana blockchain. The project and its native HINU token also hope to establish a strong and supportive community with enhanced rewards and innovative features. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) was a phenomenon in the meme coin ecosystem, setting itself apart from other players through its distinctive fusion of humor and ingenuity. The meme coin was inspired by the internet meme Doge, injecting a fresh twist into the meme-centric crypto landscape. The token has garnered a lively community around itself and has gained considerable traction in the crypto and meme coin ecosystem.

2025-05-20T16:32:25.000Z,"A Response to Bitcoin Maximalists Attacking XRP","In the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, it’s not uncommon to see spirited debates between communities advocating for different cryptocurrencies. But sometimes, what begins as a technical discussion devolves into tribalism. This is exactly what prompted the latest rebuttal from the All Things XRP community, following a post by Bitcoin advocate Pierre Rochard, who referenced an early quirk in XRP Ledger’s history as a subtle dig at its legitimacy. In a tweet captioned simply “Sir,” Rochard highlighted a snippet from the XRP Ledger documentation explaining that due to a mishap in the ledger’s early days, the first 32,569 ledgers were lost. As a result, ledger #32,570 is the earliest available on record. The post went on to explain that a reset to index zero would have caused significant disruption, so ledger #32,570 was adopted as the de facto “genesis” ledger. While factually accurate, the underlying tone of Rochard’s post struck a nerve with many XRP supporters, who saw it not as a technical insight but as yet another veiled jab from the Bitcoin maximalist camp. In response, All Things XRP delivered a powerful and eloquent rebuttal, emphasizing unity, pragmatism, and the need to move past the toxic tribalism that has held the broader crypto community back for far too long. Beyond Tribalism: Crypto Isn’t a Zero-Sum Game The All Things XRP response opens with an important reminder: this space is big enough for everyone. Supporting one project doesn’t have to mean undermining another. Many XRP supporters, including those responding to Rochard, have cheered for Bitcoin’s success from the beginning. Not because they think XRP should be subordinated, but because Bitcoin’s rise has lifted the entire industry. A healthy, growing Bitcoin often signals robust investor confidence in crypto as a whole. A RESPONSE TO BITCOIN MAXIS ATTACKING XRP. I’m all for healthy debate in crypto, but the constant attacks on XRP from folks like @BitcoinPierre need addressing. I’m rooting for Bitcoin to win. Always have. Why? Because a rising tide lifts all boats. Crypto isn’t a zero-sum… pic.twitter.com/0HHLquT5QU — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 20, 2025 However, the frequent and often unwarranted attacks on XRP from staunch Bitcoin supporters suggest a different perspective—one rooted in a zero-sum mentality. This scarcity mindset proposes that only one chain can thrive in the long run. Not only is that idea fundamentally flawed, but it’s also dangerous. It inhibits innovation and distracts from the real mission of the crypto movement: building decentralized technologies that solve real-world problems. No Chain Is Without Flaws The All Things XRP rebuttal does not shy away from acknowledging XRP Ledger’s early history. Yes, there was a mishap, and yes, the first week’s worth of ledger data is no longer available. But is that reason enough to dismiss the entire project? If historical mishaps disqualify legitimacy, then Bitcoin, too, should be under scrutiny. Take, for instance, Bitcoin’s infamous overflow bug in 2010. Due to a coding error, over 184 billion BTC were minted in a single transaction—an amount vastly exceeding Bitcoin’s total supply cap of 21 million. The bug was quickly patched, but it serves as a poignant reminder that no blockchain, no matter how venerated, is perfect. Mistakes happen. What matters is how communities respond and build resilient systems going forward. XRP has done just that. Despite its early ledger loss, the network operates smoothly, with all states accurately recorded across versions. Its design remains robust enough to serve real-world applications today, processing billions of dollars in cross-border payments and enterprise-level transactions globally. It’s a story of adaptation, not failure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Real-World Adoption Speaks Louder Than Smear Campaigns Another point of emphasis from the All Things XRP community is XRP’s undeniable traction in institutional circles. Ripple, the leading company building on the XRP Ledger, has formed partnerships with hundreds of financial institutions worldwide. Their infrastructure powers a large volume of cross-border payments , remittances, and liquidity provisioning, especially in regions where traditional banking systems are slow or expensive. It’s easy to mock from the sidelines, but data doesn’t lie. While critics post sarcastic tweets, Ripple continues to ship products and expand its reach. That’s the essence of technological progress: shipping code, not just commentary. Focus on What Unites, Not What Divides Ultimately, the All Things XRP response calls for a redirection of energy. Instead of perpetuating cycles of ridicule and one-upmanship, the crypto space would benefit far more from collaborative efforts and mutual respect. There’s a wide field of opportunity still unexplored. Layer-1s and layer-2s alike are racing to bring decentralization to real-world finance, identity systems, gaming, and more. The adversaries are not other projects, but the outdated systems crypto seeks to replace. Pierre Rochard, like many Bitcoin maximalists, is certainly entitled to his views. But when those views contribute to division instead of discourse, they risk becoming obstacles to progress. The crypto movement was never meant to be a battlefield of ideologies, but a cooperative frontier of ideas. XRP’s early ledger history is a footnote, not a fatal flaw. Its practical utility, institutional integration, and strong developer base make it one of the most viable digital assets in circulation today. Attempts to reduce its legacy to a lost week of data reflect more on the narrowness of the critic’s perspective than the strength of the project. Crypto is not a war of attrition. It is a collaborative revolution. And as All Things XRP so aptly put it, it’s time we stopped fighting over scraps and started building the future together.

2025-05-20T16:22:14.000Z,"Trump Crypto Executive Order Impact Study: Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as Prime Beneficiary for Retail Investors","Following President Trump’s March 2025 executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, retail investors are now looking for ways to meaningfully participate in the nation’s evolving crypto landscape. Bitcoin Solaris has emerged as a standout opportunity, delivering real-time token rewards through mobile mining, a capped supply model, and user-first infrastructure — making it highly aligned with the core values being adopted at the federal level. The executive order, which formally designates Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, lays out plans for the US government to maintain its holdings indefinitely. Additional BTC will be acquired through budget-neutral strategies, and no sell-off is planned. This represents a significant institutional endorsement of decentralized assets — and Bitcoin Solaris mirrors these principles through its own fixed-supply, infrastructure-first design that empowers individuals, not just institutions. Direct Protocol Participation Through Mobile Mining Bitcoin Solaris enables users to mine BTC-S tokens passively via the Nova App, using just a smartphone. Participants allocate a small amount of device storage (1–5 GB) and idle CPU, allowing the app to operate quietly in the background. Unlike validator-based systems or speculative tokens, mining on Bitcoin Solaris requires no technical knowledge or staking capital. Rewards are earned daily based on actual network contribution. Behind this system is a dual-layer blockchain architecture built for scale and accessibility: The Base Layer uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) for secure, low-energy consensus. The Solaris Layer operates using Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) to support mobile mining and contract logic with 10,000+ TPS and 2-second finality. This architecture allows for seamless, protocol-level income without the costs and barriers that have historically defined mining ecosystems. Earning Begins Before Public Access Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 4, with BTC-S priced at 4 USDT. Of the 21 million fixed token supply, 4.2 million BTC-S (20%) are allocated to presale participants. There will be no inflation or further token issuance beyond what is distributed through the protocol’s mining and validator mechanisms. This presale phase provides early access to BTC-S before broader mining competition and exchange listings elevate demand. The structure rewards early participation, much like the incentive model that allowed early Bitcoin miners to benefit from protocol-driven scarcity — now made accessible to any smartphone owner. In a timely breakdown, HotCuppaCrypto explores how Bitcoin Solaris fits within the policy changes driven by Trump’s crypto executive order. The video details how Nova App mining provides real protocol access to individuals, even as the government prioritizes institutional Bitcoin accumulation. Security Confirmed by Independent Audits To support transparency and user trust, Bitcoin Solaris has completed extensive third-party audits and verification: Cyberscope Audit : Reviewed contract emissions, mining protocols, and smart contract reliability. Freshcoins Audit : Verified mining logic and overall scalability. KYC Verification : Confirmed team credentials and governance structure. These audits ensure BTC-S tokens are distributed securely under clearly defined protocol rules — aligning with broader trends of digital asset standardization. President Trump’s executive order represents a pivotal shift in US digital asset policy. But while institutions focus on reserves, Bitcoin Solaris empowers the retail segment — delivering mobile-based, protocol-native rewards through mining and a fixed-supply model. Now in Phase 4 at 4 USDT, it offers the most accessible entry point for users to participate in the developing crypto market.

A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag. Ethereum 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) supports the lower range. The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern.Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline?On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow. In 2023, ETH surged 93% to $4,000 after a similar crossover, while in 2020, it skyrocketed by 1,820%, sparking a massive altcoin rally.Ethereum Gaussian channel analysis. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewConversely, a similar setup in August 2022 led to an invalidation during a market correction, highlighting the risks of relying solely on this indicator. Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout. It is important to note that the golden cross is on a 12-hour chart, which is less dependable than the one-day chart. Related: Bitcoin fractal analysis forecasts new all-time highs above $110K by end of weekTraders exercise caution ahead of possible ‘range-bound environment’Popular crypto trader XO noted that Ethereum is consolidating under a “decent” resistance level below the $2,800 mark. The trader expects a correction if ETH cannot break above $2,800 over the next few days. The analyst said,“I am leaning toward price carving out a range bound environment for at least several weeks potentially longer, and once again becoming a buyer.”A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period. Ethereum 1-week price analysis.

The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).“When an organization continuously uses our invention without our authorization and does so as a means of competing with us, we must take action,” said Mark Richardson, project lead at Bancor.At the time of publication, Uniswap had not publicly responded to the lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.“With this lawsuit, Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin seek compensation for Uniswap Labs’ unlicensed use of Bancor’s patented technology and Uniswap Foundation’s inducement of infringement,\"" it said.

2025-05-20T18:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase CEO&#039;s journey from no &#039;political causes&#039; to hiring DOGE staff","Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.“If you are looking for your next mission after serving your country, consider helping create a more efficient financial system for the world at Coinbase,” Armstrong said.Since assuming a government position at the White House in January, Musk and the DOGE team have faced criticism from both sides of the aisle over their cuts, which often forced out or fired experienced employees without proper notice. Lawsuits halting DOGE’s efforts or challenging dismissals are pending in federal court from parties alleging illegal or unconstitutional actions.Coinbase once called itself a ‘mission-focused company’Armstrong’s remarks, suggesting approval of DOGE’s actions, represented a sharp departure from the CEO’s position before Trump’s second term. At the time, many of the companies and executives in California’s Silicon Valley seemed to be more publicly aligned with Democrats. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis spurred nationwide outrage and protests, prompting many companies to take a public position. Armstrong issued a notice at the time saying that Coinbase was a “mission-focused company” that didn’t “advocate for any particular causes or candidates.”In response to Armstrong not publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, many Coinbase employees organized a walkout. The CEO responded by claiming the crypto exchange had an “apolitical culture” and that roughly 5% of Coinbase staff who “didn’t feel they could be on board with this direction” had accepted an exit package.Related: Coinbase considered Saylor-like Bitcoin strategy before opting out: BloombergLess than a month later, Armstrong retweeted a post suggesting he could support Kanye West for US President in 2020. After that time, the CEO made few public statements related to politics and US laws, though he did push for clarification on crypto tax rules in 2021.Stand with Crypto moves Coinbase closer to political advocacyIt’s not entirely clear how Armstrong, at least in public, moved to be more aligned with political figures. However, for Coinbase, which the CEO said was intended to be “apolitical,” the change seemed to have started around the time the company received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2023, suggesting a potential enforcement action.Armstrong, like many in the crypto industry, had often criticized the SEC before 2023 for not offering regulatory guidelines to follow, but the Wells notice and subsequent lawsuit seemed to move Coinbase from participating in a national political discussion on digital assets to outright advocacy. The company announced the launch of the Stand with Crypto Alliance in August 2023, a group “focused on mobilizing the crypto community to directly engage in the legislative process.”Before Stand with Crypto, Armstrong used his platform to call on crypto supporters to contact their elected officials about digital asset bills moving through Congress. Even with this initiative tied to the exchange and CEO, the focus wasn’t on partisan politics, but “common-sense legislation to protect consumers and their right to crypto.” “Being anti-crypto is a really bad political strategy going into 2024,” said Armstrong in a December 2023 X post, in response to legislation aimed at fighting money laundering with digital assets.Enter Trump and the 2024 election cycleIn contrast to the 2020 election and even the 2022 midterms, the 2024 cycle stood out in more ways than one. For the first time, a presidential candidate was openly advocating for policies favoring cryptocurrency. The amount of money flowing from companies in the industry, including Coinbase, into federal elections also reached a record high.Stand with Crypto, as an advocacy organization, was no exception. The group launched its own political action committee (PAC) in May 2024, allowing it to influence the elections through media buys and direct contributions. Though Stand with Crypto still organized like-minded voters, its efforts included a renewed focus on money.It stood alongside the Fairshake PAC, a committee backed by roughly $45 million from Coinbase and $45 million from Ripple, which spent more than $130 million in the 2024 election cycle. Armstrong personally contributed $1 million to Fairshake.Though the Coinbase CEO suggested a political preference, he seemed not to take a strong position at the exchange ahead of the election. In Coinbase’s shareholder letter for the third quarter of 2024, the exchange said it was “prepared to work with either administration” in the US, whether that meant Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.More front-facing in Washington, DCArmstrong became more of a presence on Capitol Hill and among members of the Trump administration after the results of the 2024 election. He personally met with the then-president-elect in November and reportedly attended at least one of the inauguration events with other cryptocurrency executives. Coinbase also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.In February, the exchange announced that the SEC would be dropping its enforcement action, marking one of many crypto-related lawsuits the regulator has dismissed under Trump. Armstrong said at the time that the move was “an important signal about where things are going.” The CEO was going to Washington, DC, seemingly more frequently than he had before this administration took power. In addition to inauguration events, Armstrong attended a crypto summit at the White House with Trump and other high-level executives and spoke with lawmakers in the Capitol to support bills establishing a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins and crypto markets. Coinbase CEO in the US Capitol rotunda on May 14.

2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z,"The crypto market values chains more than standalone applications","Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin TerminalAlthough blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.The value perspective is wrong Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises \""thin\"" protocols and \""fat\"" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower returns than applications like Google and Facebook.Monegro further stated that the value is reversed in the \""blockchain application stack.\"" The underlying protocol layer accumulates more value than the application layer, leading to \""fat\"" protocols and \""thin\"" applications. He later published an updated rejoinder to clarify \""application-layer success as a requirement for protocol growth\"" and how value capture depends on the total addressable market.As apps become more popular, they attract users to the underlying blockchain who use the chain's token to interact with the app. Such demand pressure results in token price growth and, eventually, builds a strong network where blockchains capture maximum value.A recent research report demonstrated how revenue generation parameters like onchain fees could flip Monegro's thesis.In 2024, blockchains controlling 70% of the total crypto industry market cap (excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins) earned $6 billion in fees. Meanwhile, DApps, with just a 30% market share, made $3.3 billion, generating 35% of total onchain fees. The trend continues in Q1 2025 as DApps recorded $1.8 billion in total fees compared to $1.4 billion for blockchains.According to the report, apps generate real value and user interaction, as higher fees reflect increased usage rates. Since no one logs into an app just to access a blockchain, people use apps to trade, play, invest, socialize, and spend time. Thus, apps generate value and revenue opportunities.As apps are users' first interaction layer, they have higher demands and more growth channels. The report says: \""Blockchains may have built the roads — but the apps are building the cities.\""Recent: Every chain is an island: crypto’s liquidity crisisBut without “roads,'’ it's impossible to navigate and access “cities.'’ Thus, such a value lens to evaluate whether the markets prefer chains or apps is a myopic perspective.Analysts and crypto industry veterans must understand blockchain's critical role in running the crypto industry. Consequently, the crypto markets must always support blockchains irrespective of their economic value potential.Blockchains are fundamental to crypto marketsBlockchains are the necessary trust anchor arbitrating transactions for decentralized applications through transparent and immutable ledgers. During multiparty DApp interactions, blockchains act as a truth source for tamperproof records, making chains an integral infra layer.The chain vs. app binary argument is false because blockchains are essentially timekeepers for dApp-generated data. Such timestamped data facilitates all onchain transactions and enables people to use DApps trustlessly.It's irrelevant if a blockchain's value potential is based on revenue and user adoption because that's the task of gaming, social, and financial applications. Blockchains are the foundational layer for building applications and other user products that generate returns on investment capital.Moreover, despite liquidity and integration challenges, the steady rise of modular app chains is another example of the importance of blockchain architecture. When resource-hungry apps consume network capacities, app chains solve the issue by functioning as independent blockchains to enhance performance and reduce latency.Using app chains to solve a network's bottlenecks demonstrates that apps won't function independently and require the corresponding chain architecture. Each modular appchain thus has its own computational resources, storage capacities, and resources to prevent competing applications from slowing down performance.These examples illustrate why crypto markets value blockchains more than standalone applications. It's because apps won't survive without blockchains.“Value” doesn't always mean financial incentives and growth metrics. Sometimes, value also comes from the market's recognition of their cardinal role within the industry. In this market scenario, blockchains will always be much more valuable than individual applications, regardless of fees and revenue.Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal.

2025-05-20T13:59:13.000Z,"Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption","US Senate Democrats are getting flak after they helped move stablecoin legislation ahead for discussion on the Senate floor.On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.Some activists have said that the Democrats supporting the bill should be ousted in the upcoming Democratic primaries in 2026, reflecting a growing rift in the Democratic Party over cryptocurrencies.The Senate voted 66-32 to move the bill ahead. Source: Stand With CryptoDemocratic lawmakers’ approach to crypto shows split in partyOn May 19, moderate Democratic Senator Mark Warner announced he would support the bill, stating that it was “not perfect, but it’s far better than the status quo.”Warner set corruption concerns aside, stating, “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight [...] But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay.”Warner concluded it would be better for the US to move forward on imperfect stablecoin legislation than to fall behind other jurisdictions. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the bill’s sponsors, also pushed aside Trump corruption concerns, saying they should be addressed separately. Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin bill“A lot of what President Trump is engaged in is already illegal,” she said, adding that she didn’t want the president’s scandals to “distract us from the important goal of having a clear regulatory structure in the United States that can onshore this industry.”During the vote, progressive Democrats disagreed. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a vocal critic of the crypto industry, reportedly got into a heated argument with Gillibrand on the Senate floor.Warren argued on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, “A bill that turbocharges the stablecoin market, while facilitating the President’s corruption and undermining national security, financial stability, and consumer protection is worse than no bill at all.”Democrats opposing the bill aren’t giving up either. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who voted against the GENIUS Act, immediately introduced another bill, jokingly named “the STABLE GENIUS Act,” combining the names of the bills in the Senate and House of Representatives.The bill would prevent the president, vice-president and members of Congress from “issuing or endorsing digital assets” and require them to place any assets they hold in a blind trust while in office.While the bill has little chance of passing — numerous acts that would limit members’ of Congress financial activities have fizzled out — it shows the Democrats are split on how they should provide opposition.Democratic activists lambast Democratic GENIUS supportersThe progressive and activist wings of the Democratic party have roundly criticized Congressional leadership for compromising with Republicans on measures that, they claim, should be deal breakers. In March, activists were enraged when Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and minority leader in the Senate, voted with the Republicans on a continuing resolution for government funding. One progressive observer accused him of giving up leverage and weakening the Democratic position. Then, in April, disagreements over how Democrats should fight Trump’s mass deportations further deepened the rift. Now, crypto has become another wedge between the activist wing, which provides crucial voter activation during elections, and centrists in Congress.Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of progressive activist organization Indivisible, wrote on BlueSky:Ezra Levin commenting on crypto bill. Source: Ezra LevinCommunications strategist Murshed Zaheed, who formally worked for the offices of Senator Harry Reid and Representative Louise Slaughter, urged people to call their senators to come out against the bill. “Any Democrat who votes for this today — should never be taken seriously again if they send out emails, text and do videos [...] talking a big game about Trump’s corruption,” he said.Related: What to expect at Trump’s memecoin dinnerChris Kluwe, a former American football player who has since become a prominent activist within Democratic politics, said on May 20 he was “excited to get a chance to speak at the CA state Dem convention on May 31st, I’m sure [the bill] won’t come up at all in the 4 minutes I’ve been allotted.”On BlueSky, labor researcher and media law historian Peter Labuza posted “Primary List” in reply to a post of the 16 Democratic senators who helped support the bill.The subject of primary elections, the intra-party elections to decide who will represent the party in a given district, has also grown contentious.On May 12, the Democratic National Convention (DNC) voted to void the results of an internal party vote nominating David Hogg as a vice chair. The decision essentially strips Hogg of his title at the DNC and, with it, the ability to promote his controversial policy of sponsoring progressive challengers in Democratic primary elections. Hogg had planned to spend $20 million to support progressive and young candidates in Democratic Party primaries as part of the “Leaders We Deserve” campaign — an activist group that aims to elevate younger leaders with a more combative tone against the Trump administration. With the stablecoin bills in the House and Senate poised to move ahead, the Democrats seem ill-suited to mount an effective opposition to the bills. Internal struggles and interests within Congress have disunited lawmakers, while activists want a new crop of congresspeople to represent them next term.In the Democratic Party’s internal battle between the anti-crypto progressive wing and the pro-crypto pragmatists, the latter is winning out, so far. Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senate-stablecoin-vote-democrats-corruption?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T13:50:26.000Z,"Robinhood proposes SEC rules for tokenized real-world assets","Robinhood has submitted a 42-page proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling for a national framework to regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).The brokerage firm is seeking to modernize financial infrastructure by making tokenized assets legally equivalent to their traditional counterparts and enabling compliant onchain settlement, Forbes reported on May 20.In the proposal, Robinhood also reveals plans for creating the Real World Asset Exchange (RRE), a trading platform offering offchain trade matching and on-chain settlement for efficiency and transparency.Robinhood is advocating for uniform federal standards to replace the patchwork of state-level securities regulations that currently apply. The platform would also integrate Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) tools through partners like Jumio and Chainalysis to meet global compliance expectations.Related: Central banks testing smart contract toolkit under BIS Project PineRobinhood asks for token-asset equivalenceA key feature of the proposal is the push for token-asset equivalence. Under Robinhood’s plan, a token representing a US Treasury bond, for instance, would be treated as the bond itself — not a derivative or synthetic product.That would allow institutions and broker-dealers to handle tokenized RWAs within the existing regulatory system, potentially streamlining custody, trading and settlement processes.Source: CointelegraphTechnically, RRE will be built on a dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana and Base, according to an overview of the proposal by Franklin Elevator. The system is designed to combine high-frequency offchain trade matching with onchain settlement.Franklin Elevator said Robinhood projects the platform will achieve sub-10 microsecond matching latency and throughput of up to 30,000 transactions per second.This could compress the US capital market’s standard settlement time from T+2 to T+0, cutting trading costs by an estimated 30% annually.“RWA tokenization represents a new paradigm for institutional asset allocation. Robinhood is committed to leading this trend under a compliant framework,” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said.Related: SEC Chair: Blockchain ‘holds promise’ of new kinds of market activityTokenization gains momentumRobinhood’s proposal comes amid a renewed wave of interest in RWA tokenization, with major players from both traditional finance and crypto making headlines last week.On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a blockchain-based share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, allowing a digital ledger to mirror investor ownership.

Catana described the infrastructure as “slow, expensive, full of global friction, inflexible and ill-suited to the new opportunities and risks of AI.”The company said this prompted them to create an AI-native financial institution to address the challenges of traditional financial systems. “That’s why we’re building an AI-native financial institution that will give AI agents, and the businesses and consumers they serve, the ability to transact safely and efficiently,” Neville said. In addition to the announcement, the team also shared an Agent Commerce Kit (ACK), an open-source set of patterns, components and emerging protocols for verifiable agent identity. The company said they are using an ACK as an early building block. Related: Coinbase data leak could put users in physical danger: TechCrunch founderAI agents to use “AI-native” money like stablecoinsIn the announcement, Catena Labs said AI agents can use traditional systems and financial rails.

2025-05-20T12:18:57.000Z,"India’s Supreme Court urges government to regulate cryptocurrency","India’s Supreme Court has questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated.“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.Related: Indian high court orders steps to block Proton MailGovernment says review may followThe Additional Solicitor General of India — a senior legal officer representing the government of India — reportedly answered the request by saying that the government “will take instructions, my lord,” indicating that the government may consider reviewing the country’s current cryptocurrency regulation.The report follows a May 5 hearing by the Supreme Court of India during which Kant and lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani shared their views on cryptocurrency. Jethmalani explained that Bitcoin is already seeing widespread usage worldwide, noting that “in Europe, you can walk into a car showroom and buy a car using just one Bitcoin.”Related: Coinbase plans India comeback with FIU registrationWhile this scenario is not as common as this statement may suggest, buying a car with Bitcoin is possible at specialized sellers.

He said that “there is some system of rules that applies to this.”Kant also said that “some Bitcoins are genuine, but some might not be.” However, it’s unclear whether he meant to suggest that counterfeit Bitcoin are in circulation (there are none) or that illegal activities taint some. The latter appears likely since the statement was followed by the judge saying that “it has also become a possible way to do illegal business.”India’s government has not yet introduced comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrencies, though it taxes gains and requires firms to report certain activities to financial regulators.

2025-05-20T08:05:00.000Z,"How $330M was stolen without hacking: The dark power of social engineering","The $330 million attack: A stark reminder of social engineering’s power              A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of substantial transactions.Unlike typical cyberattacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, this incident relied on psychological manipulation. Scammers posed as trusted entities, slowly building credibility before persuading the victim over the phone to share sensitive credentials. This is the hallmark of social engineering — exploiting human trust rather than system weaknesses.                  Decoding the laundering tactics after the attack              After the Bitcoin theft, the attacker swiftly began laundering the funds using a peel chain method, splitting the stolen amount into smaller, harder-to-trace portions. The funds were routed through hundreds of wallets and scores of exchanges or payment services, including Binance. A significant amount was laundered via instant exchanges and mixers, further obscuring its trail. A large portion of BTC was quickly converted into XMR, a privacy coin with untraceable architecture, causing its price to briefly surge 50% to $339.The attackers used pre-registered accounts across exchanges and OTC desks, which suggests careful planning. Some BTC was even bridged to Ethereum and deposited into various DeFi platforms, making forensic tracing more difficult. Investigators have since notified exchanges in hopes of freezing any accessible funds. While attribution remains unclear, analysts like ZachXBT ruled out North Korean Lazarus Group involvement, pointing instead to skilled independent hackers. Hacken traced $284 million of BTC, now diluted to $60 million after extensive peeling and redistribution through obscure platforms.Binance and ZachXBT were able to freeze about $7 million of the stolen funds. However, the bulk of the stolen Bitcoin remains missing. The suspects include an individual using the alias “X,” allegedly operating from the UK and believed to be of Somali origin, and another accomplice known as “W0rk.” Both have reportedly scrubbed their digital footprints since the theft.This case underscores that crypto security isn’t just about strong passwords and hardware wallets but also about recognizing psychological threats. As the investigation continues, the community is reminded that even the most secure technologies are vulnerable to human fallibility.                  What is social engineering in crypto crimes, and what psychological tactics are involved?              Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by cybercriminals to exploit human psychology. They trick you into revealing confidential information to access your wallets and perform actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking, which targets system vulnerabilities, social engineering thrives on human weaknesses such as trust, fear, urgency and curiosity. It leverages psychological tactics to manipulate victims. Here are common tactics used by criminals to convince their victims and execute their plans:Using fake authority: A common tactic criminals use is authority, where attackers impersonate figures of trust, such as law enforcement or tech support, to pressure victims into revealing the information they want. Create urgency: Urgency is another tactic, often used in phishing emails or scam calls that demand immediate action to prevent “loss” or claim a reward. Preying on the instinct of reciprocity: Reciprocity involves playing on the instinct to return favors, luring victims with gifts like fake airdrops or rewards. Triggering impulsive actions: Scarcity drives decisions by presenting fake limited-time offers, prompting impulsive behavior. Riding herd mentality: Social proof, or the herd mentality, is also common with fraudsters often claiming others have already benefited, encouraging the victim to follow suit.These psychological strategies are a major threat to users in the crypto space, where irreversible transactions and often decentralized platforms make it very difficult for the victims to regain the lost funds. Did you know? Crypto drainers-as-a-service (DaaS) offers complete social engineering toolkits, including fake DEX websites, wallet prompts and Telegram support bots for anyone to run phishing campaigns, no coding required.                  Why crypto users are vulnerable to social engineering attacks              Crypto users are particularly susceptible to social engineering attacks due to a combination of technological and behavioral issues. These include irreversibility of transactions, lack of recourse, high-value targets and overreliance on trust.Irreversibility of transactions: Once a crypto transaction is confirmed, it is final. There is no central authority or support team to reverse a mistaken transfer or a fraudulent withdrawal. Social engineers exploit this by tricking victims into sending funds or approving malicious wallet permissions, well aware that recovery is virtually impossible.Anonymity and lack of recourse: DeFi thrives on anonymity, which also empowers scammers. Attackers can hide behind pseudonyms and fake profiles, often impersonating support staff, influencers or developers. Victims have little to no legal or institutional support after an incident, especially across borders.High-value targets: Whales, NFT collectors and DeFi project founders are frequent targets of fraudulent activities due to the large sums they control. Social engineers often tailor sophisticated scams, such as fake job offers, investment pitches or urgent support calls to manipulate these high-end users.Overreliance on trust in online communities: Crypto culture emphasizes decentralization and peer collaboration, but these can foster a false sense of confidence. Scammers exploit this openness in Discord, Telegram and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to gain credibility before striking.Together, these factors make crypto users highly susceptible to human-centric attacks, more than users of traditional finance.Did you know? Unlike traditional hacks, social engineering doesn’t target code; it targets people. It is low-tech but high-reward, exploiting trust, emotion and routine to steal assets in seconds.                  Common crypto-specific social engineering tactics              Fraudsters use customized social engineering strategies to trick and exploit unsuspecting crypto users. To protect yourself from these scamsters, you must be well aware of their various tactics. From phishing scams and impersonation attacks to malicious downloads, you must have a broad idea of how these methods work.Here are some prevalent tactics that fraudsters use:Phishing scams: Attackers craft deceptive emails or messages resembling those from established crypto platforms, subtly pushing users to click on malicious links. These links take users to counterfeit websites that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges or wallets, prompting users to input sensitive information like private keys or login credentials. Impersonation attacks: Scammers pose as trusted figures or support staff on platforms like Discord and Telegram. By mimicking official channels or personnel, they convince users to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise their wallets.Fake airdrops: Tactics involve enticing users to connect their wallets to claim non-existent rewards. Users who fall prey to these tactics often end up losing their assets.Malicious downloads: Users are lured with promises of free tools or software stealthily loaded with malicious code. Once downloaded, the malware shares confidential information with its handlers.Honeytraps and fake job offers: Fraudsters create alluring profiles or job postings targeting developers and project founders. Once trust is established, they manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data or granting access to secure systems.Pretexting and quid pro quo: Attackers may fabricate scenarios, such as offering exclusive investment opportunities or lucrative rewards, to extract information or access from victims. Understanding these tactics is crucial for crypto users to safeguard their assets. Vigilance, verification of sources and skepticism toward unsolicited offers can mitigate the risks posed by social engineering attacks.                  Case studies of crypto social engineering attacks              There have been several scams in the crypto domain exploiting human weaknesses. Fraudsters used clever tactics like phishing and impersonation to steal digital assets. These case studies provide key insights to boost awareness and prevent losses.Ronin Network attackIn March 2022, the Ronin Network, which powers Axie Infinity, suffered a $600 million exploit. Investigations revealed the hack stemmed from a social engineering attack. Lazarus Group posed as a fake company and sent a job offer PDF to a senior engineer with Ronin Network. When the file was opened, it installed spyware that compromised validator nodes. This breach allowed attackers to authorize massive withdrawals that went undetected for days. Lazarus Group’s fake job offerThe Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked cybercrime unit, has been using fake job offers to target crypto employees. In one such case, they created fake recruiter profiles on LinkedIn and sent tailored job offers to engineers at blockchain companies. Engineers clicking on the job documents suffered malware infections. Fraudsters getting access to the wallets culminated in them stealing digital assets worth millions.Discord phishing scamsDiscord has become a hotspot for NFT scams through social engineering. Scamsters impersonate project admins or moderators and post fake minting links in announcements. In 2022, the popular NFT project Bored Ape Yacht Club was targeted this way. Scammers posted a fake airdrop link in the official Discord, tricking users into connecting their wallets. Once authorized, the attackers drained the NFTs and tokens, resulting in hundreds of thousands in losses.Did you know? Many social engineering attacks happen during project launches or major announcements. Hackers time their scams for peak traffic, using fake links that mimic official posts to steal funds from unsuspecting users.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks in crypto              Crypto users face an increasing wave of social engineering attacks, from fake job offers to Discord phishing links. To stay secure, you and the crypto community need to take proactive steps to build awareness and deter attacks:Verifying identities and URLs: Always double-check usernames, domain spellings and URLs before clicking. Use official channels to verify announcements or job offers.Multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA or 2-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts to make it harder for fraudsters.Use hardware wallets: To store funds securely for the long term, use hardware wallets as they reduce the risk of remote access.Community education: Circulation of scam alerts and regular security training sessions for crypto users can help raise awareness about the prowling crypto scamsters.Role of social platforms and devs in prevention: Platforms like Discord and Telegram should implement a reporting mechanism with quick responses. They can integrate transaction warnings and wallet-connection alerts to deter social engineering attacks at the source.                  Help available to elderly victims in the event of crypto attacks              Several types of aid are available to elderly victims of cryptocurrency hacks to help them recover their possessions. Here is an insight into various options at hand.Victims can file a formal complaint with law enforcement agencies, such as cybercrime units and local police, who can carry out investigations. Many countries have financial fraud helplines that provide victims with counsel. They may discuss the fraudulent act with their lawyer, who would help them understand their rights and legal support available. Nonprofits and advocacy groups in the US, such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), provide support to senior victims of scams. Crypto exchanges may assist victims by freezing suspicious transactions if alerted early. They may also contact blockchain analytics firms or crypto recovery services to assist in tracing stolen assets, though positive outcomes aren’t assured. Legal aid organizations can help victims navigate the complex processes. It is helpful for older people to involve family members and caregivers to assist them in the aftermath of an attack.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-330m-was-stolen-without-hacking-the-dark-power-of-social-engineering?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-20T08:02:27.000Z,"Genesis files dual lawsuits to claw back $3.3B from DCG, Barry Silbert","Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets, including 19,086 Bitcoin (BTC), 69,197 Ether (ETH) and over 17.1 million other tokens, along with significant unpaid fees and interest as of Feb. 9, 2025.At the core of the lawsuit is the claim that Silbert and other insiders ignored basic risk controls and pushed Genesis into reckless lending practices that ultimately served to benefit DCG’s crown jewel, Grayscale Investments.DCG withdrew $1.2 billion from Genesis before bankruptcyThe complaint describes Genesis as having operated without a board or independent oversight, with key decisions made to enrich DCG at the expense of depositors.“In particular, Silbert, Kraines, and Murphy orchestrated sham transactions at the end of the second and third quarters of 2022, when Genesis’s books closed, to deceive Genesis lenders into believing that DCG was providing liquidity and equity to Genesis,” the complaint states. Genesis also said it was forced to accept illiquid Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares as collateral and was barred from selling them, creating major valuation risks.“GBTC was illiquid because it could not be sold for six months after its purchase due to a lockup period imposed by the SEC, and DCG prohibited Genesis from reselling GBTC even after the lockup period ended,” the complaint states. The complaint names DCG, Barry Silbert, former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG chief financial officer Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy and DCG’s investment banker Ducera Partners as defendants.Source: GenesisLOCRelated: Bankrupt crypto firm Genesis completes restructuringA second complaint, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that DCG and its affiliates withdrew over $1.2 billion in US dollars and cryptocurrencies during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy.These withdrawals, the LOC argued, were timed around major market events such as the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX — moments when Genesis was already insolvent.Internal filings suggest insiders recovered 100% of their funds, while retail and institutional creditors were left exposed.Genesis seeks to recover billionsIn total, Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion through the two lawsuits.In April 2025, a New York judge ruled that most of the New York Attorney General’s civil fraud lawsuit against DCG, Silbert, and former Genesis CEO Michael Moro can move forward.The suit accuses DCG and its bankrupt lending arm Genesis of misleading investors after the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, allegedly masking a $1 billion shortfall with a 10-year, low-interest promissory note.While Gemini and Genesis have settled, DCG and the executives have fought the charges.Genesis filed for bankruptcy in early 2023 with $14 billion in outstanding loans.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-sues-dcg-barry-silbert-3-3b-fraud?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-20T03:08:27.000Z,"SEC’s Crenshaw says agency playing ‘regulatory Jenga’ with crypto","The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto“Our statements on these crypto-related issues are the equivalent of a wink and nod intended to convey that we do not plan to rigorously apply our laws in certain, specific situations.”She added that the regulator has abandoned enforcement actions, especially in crypto markets, creating what she calls “regulation by non-enforcement.”“I am deeply troubled by the Commission’s abandonment of swaths of our enforcement program,” she said. SEC Commissioner Crenshaw. Source: SECCrenshaw, the SEC’s last remaining Democrat commissioner, said the agency’s “about-face” is problematic for a host of reasons, such as corroding its reputation in court, undermining its credibility, and casting doubt on the state of “longstanding and fundamental case law.”Related: SEC is scaling back its crypto enforcement unit: ReportCrenshaw, who had also opposed the SEC’s settlement with Ripple, said in her latest remarks that the 2022 FTX collapse was an example of what a “large-scale crypto crisis” can look like. “Those risks have not gone away, but the calls for serious regulatory scrutiny are a lot quieter these days,” she said.“Failing to appreciate and address these risks and complexities destines us to repeat hard lessons with high stakes as crypto becomes increasingly entangled with traditional finance.”In comparison, remarks from the SEC’s Republican commissioners welcomed the agency’s embrace of the crypto sector. Crypto was “languishing in SEC limbo”SEC chair Paul Atkins said at the SEC Speaks event that “crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” adding that the agency should not be in the business of stifling innovation of crypto companies.Commissioner Hester Peirce, who heads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said in remarks that the agency’s approach under the Biden administration has “evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.”She also claimed that crypto did not come under the purview of securities laws because “most currently existing crypto assets in the market” are not securities. “Even if a broad swath of the crypto assets trading in secondary markets today were initially offered and sold subject to an investment contract, they clearly are no longer bought and sold in securities transactions. Many of these crypto assets are functional.”Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed the sentiment of his peers, stating that the SEC “should undertake efforts to provide assurances that regulation by enforcement will not be a tool used for future policymaking.”Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-crenshaw-agency-playing-regulatory-jenga-with-crypto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.Alpenglow consists of Votor, which processes voting transactions and block finalization logic, and Rotor, a data dissemination protocol that would replace Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping system and aim to reduce the time it takes for all nodes to agree on the network state.Source: AnzaAnza researchers claimed that “Alpenglow will shatter both these latency bounds” and the project expects it to reach actual finality in about 150 milliseconds, rivaling internet infrastructure.“A median latency of 150 [milliseconds] does not just mean that Solana is fast — it means Solana can compete with Web2 infrastructure in terms of responsiveness, potentially making blockchain technology viable for entirely new categories of applications that demand real-time performance.”Votor — which would replace TowerBFT — would aim to finalize blocks in a single round if 80% of the stake is participating, and in two rounds if only 60% of the stake is responsive.Related: DeFi lender Aave reaches $40B in value locked onchainThese two voting modes are integrated and run concurrently, with finalization taking place as soon as the faster of the two paths terminates.Anza’s researchers claimed this model would result in “unprecedented finalization latency” while enabling it to operate more effectively under “harsh network conditions.”Alpenglow won’t fix Solana’s network outagesThe project’s white paper noted that switching to Alpenglow wouldn’t completely shield Solana from the network outages that it has experienced in the past.Solana currently only has one production-ready client, Agave, meaning any security vulnerability in Agave can disrupt the entire Solana network.However, a new independent validator client called Firedancer is set to launch on Solana’s mainnet sometime this year, which will provide client diversification for the network.Magazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-labs-offshoot-anza-consensus-protocol-alpenglow?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The Sharpe ratio measures the rate of return an investment provides for the risk taken, by comparing its performance to a risk-free benchmark relative to its volatility.The chart below, tracking weekly data between 2018 and May 2025, shows Bitcoin’s returns (1x) catching up to gold’s (4x), with gold at $22.48 and Bitcoin at $15.95 in relative performance terms. Gold vs Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Source: X.comFrom an allocation standpoint, Timmer recommended a 4:1 gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for a store-of-value hedge, highlighting an intriguing observation. Timmer said, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!”While Bitcoin’s SoV credential improves above $100,000, Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin-focused macroeconomic newsletter, pointed out that it was not smooth sailing in Q1 2025. In 2024, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded traded-funds (ETFs) saw a staggering $35 billion net inflows, purchasing 500,000 BTC and driving a 120% return. However, 2025 started on a different note. The first four months saw Bitcoin ETF flows drop to less than a third compared to 2024, while gold ETFs attracted more capital. The newsletter noted that this shift could be attributed to Q1 uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policy, trade policy, and the US economy. Ecoinometrics stated,“Between two hard assets, gold and Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why capital went to the one seen as a haven.” Bitcoin vs gold ETF netflows comparison.

The report uses a scenario-based framework rooted in its gold model to project Bitcoin’s potential revaluation as a non-sovereign hard asset. If Bitcoin’s network value, measured in gold, follows a power curve, and gold maintains its current value, analysts suggest it could hit $444,000 in 2025.

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.Related: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probeThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million.

Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.Among the memecoin dinner applicants, who likely still face background checks ahead of getting a confirmed appearance before the president, included Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, a consultant named Vincent Deriu, and crypto user Morten Christensen, who reportedly only paid $1,200 for the opportunity. Others included a World Liberty Financial adviser going by the pseudonym “Ogle,” and a representative from the Singapore-based startup MemeCore. Cointelegraph has also learned that Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of the Taiwan-based company Kronos Research, plans to attend.Trump’s memecoin, even before the announced dinner and reception, was criticized by many members of Congress. Some lawmakers said the president was opening the White House up to potential bribes and conflicts of interest by allowing people, perhaps tied to foreign governments, to put money directly into his pockets without transparency.Interfering with stablecoin, market structure billsThe controversy has spilled over into proposed legislation connected to digital assets, including a bill in the Senate aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and a draft market structure bill in the House of Representatives. Some Democrats said they would not support any legislation until “Trump’s crypto corruption” was addressed.May 14 BlueSky post on Trump memecoin. Source: Elizabeth Warren“Democrats are thinking that this is just an official means by which to conduct corruption,” said Rebecca Liao, co-founder and CEO of layer-1 blockchain Saga, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph. “What began as a bipartisan bill with potential widespread support has now transformed into a proxy war between the Democrats and the Trump administration.”Related: Trump’s crypto ties ‘add a certain level of challenge’ to passing bills — Coinbase execSome organizations have planned protests during the memecoin dinner on May 22. The Democratic Party’s arm in Arlington, Virginia, announced its members would gather to oppose those in the White House “cashing in on their public office.” Cointelegraph reached out to the organization for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.Buying influence, or just speculating on an emerging market?The top 220 tokenholders reportedly spent a combined $148 million to have the opportunity to attend the event, which finalized its leaderboard on May 12. However, anyone with a wallet can still buy TRUMP tokens and potentially influence the president’s policies after the dinner is completed. “The decision to acquire the [TRUMP] token was not political,” Vincent Liu of Kronos Research, who plans on attending the memecoin dinner, told Cointelegraph. “It was based on identifying early momentum, cultural relevance, and potential market catalysts.”In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the TRUMP token, suggesting that it could affect the president’s trade policies between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. GD Culture Group announced in May that the memecoin would be included in its plans for a $300-million crypto reserve.“The issue is the conflict of interest between the Trump family’s crypto investments and the administration’s pivot toward crypto-friendly policies,” said Liao. “The Trump family has very openly invested in crypto and has started their own crypto ventures. This has created a perception problem where policy shifts favoring cryptocurrency could be viewed as self-enrichment rather than in the national interest.”If the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, is the first test for how Republicans and Democrats will respond to Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto industry, there is already a stark contrast between the two parties. ​​House Speaker Mike Johnson largely brushed off concerns about the president and his family’s connections to the industry, saying he was “not an expert in that.” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly reportedly said there were “no conflicts of interest” because Trump’s children managed his assets through a trust.Lawmakers are expected to take up a vote on the GENIUS Act in a matter of days, possibly before the memecoin dinner and reception are held. At the time of publication, it was unclear whether Republicans intended to address some of the Democrats’ concerns around Trump and crypto, or move forward with a vote with no significant changes to the bill.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-breakdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: TradingView / CointelegraphYields on Japan’s long-term government bonds soared to their highest level ever on May 19 as traders demanded higher returns, signaling a lack of trust. Japan is the largest holder of US Treasury bonds, so investors are concerned about contagion risks at a delicate moment for the global economy, especially as the ongoing trade war has severely limited growth prospects.The fact that Moody’s rating agency cut the US government’s long-term credit rating to AA1 from AAA has also played a significant role in limiting Bitcoin’s upside, particularly as its correlation with the S&P 500 index has stayed above 80% since early May. Investor sentiment could quickly deteriorate as the impact of tariffs becomes partially visible in second-quarter corporate earnings.To understand if Bitcoin has what it takes to reach an all-time high in the near term, one should analyze the demand for stablecoins in China.

Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish, repeated failure to break above the overhead resistance may tempt short-term traders to book profits. That increases the risk of a break below the psychological level of $100,000.What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its up move last week, indicating continued buying by the bulls.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (5,712) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone signal an advantage to buyers, but the up move is expected to face significant resistance in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the index could find support at 5,800 and then at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to drive the index to the all-time high. Sellers will have to tug the price below the 20-day EMA to break the bullish momentum. US Dollar Index price predictionThe relief rally in the US Dollar Index (DXY) hit a wall at the 50-day simple moving average (101.67) on May 12, indicating that the bears are selling on rallies.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe index is likely to find support at the 100.27 level. If the price rebounds off 100.27, the bulls will again try to kick the index above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the index could pick up momentum and surge toward 103.54. Such a move signals that the corrective phase may be over.Sellers will retain the advantage if the price closes below the 100.27 support. That opens the doors for a retest of the 99 level.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin broke above the overhead resistance at $105,820 on May 18, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA ($100,787) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. A rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the positive sentiment remains intact. The bulls will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $130,000.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the psychologically crucial $100,000 support. The pair could then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($91,916).Ether price predictionEther’s (ETH) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($2,288) on May 18 fizzled out near $2,600, signaling that the bears have kept up the pressure.ETH/USDT daily chart.

There is minor resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could then slump to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck inside the $2.65 to $2 range, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe XRP/USDT pair bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2.34) on May 17, but the bulls are facing selling at higher levels. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair could stay inside the range for some more time. The price action inside the range is expected to be random and volatile.The next trending move is likely to begin on a break above $2.65 or below $2. If buyers pierce the $2.65 resistance, the pair could travel to $3.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($635) on May 18, but the higher levels attracted selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate a slight edge to the bulls. If the price rises and maintains above $644, the bulls will again try to drive the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair may start its northward march toward the overhead resistance of $745.Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA clears the path for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($606) and later to $580.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($163) on May 17, but the bulls could not push the price above the $180 resistance.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could tumble to $153 and, after that, to the 50-day SMA ($143). That points to a possible range-bound action between $180 and $120 in the near term.The bulls will have to propel the price above the $185 level to regain control. The pair could then pick up momentum and rally to $210 and subsequently to $220. Related: XRP price risks falling to $2 after classic bearish chart pattern confirmsDogecoin price predictionBuyers successfully defended the breakout level of $0.21 on May 17 but are struggling to sustain the bounce in Dogecoin (DOGE).DOGE/USDT daily chart.

That signals a possible range formation between $0.26 and $0.14.Buyers will have to thrust the price above the $0.26 resistance to signal the resumption of the recovery. There is minor resistance at $0.30, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then ascend to $0.35.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) has broken below the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating that the bulls are losing their grip.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe next support is at the 50-day SMA ($0.68). If the price turns up from the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the neckline. If they can pull it off, the pair could retest the $0.86 level. A break and close above the $0.86 resistance clears the path for a rally to $1.01.Conversely, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests the markets have rejected the breakout above the neckline. That increases the risk of a drop to $0.58.Sui price predictionSui’s (SUI) bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.67) turned down from the $3.90 to $4.25 zone, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe pullback could deepen if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SUI/USDT pair could skid to $3.12 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.97).On the contrary, if the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA and rises above $3.90, it suggests a positive sentiment. That enhances the prospects of a break above the $4.25 level. The pair could then surge to $5. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral. Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at Consensus. Source: CointelegraphThis was part of the motivation behind launching Ledn, a Cayman Islands-based company that gives Bitcoin holders the ability to access dollar liquidity without having to sell their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” said di Bartolomeo, adding:“This creates a bit of a virtuous cycle that we see happen time and again with real estate, with borrowing against your stock, borrowing against your gold, and so Bitcoin is no different.”Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execCrypto lending market on the riseLedn operates in a much broader crypto lending industry that has grown over the past five years due to the rapid appreciation of Bitcoin, the arrival of institutional investors and the growing utility of stablecoins.By the fourth quarter of 2024, the crypto lending market was valued at $30.2 billion, a more than threefold increase compared to two years earlier, according to Galaxy Research. However, the size of the overall industry remains below the 2021 peak. The researchers attributed the recent rise to decentralized finance applications, which allow users to borrow against assets onchain.

Ripple Payments is a platform that combines stablecoins, cryptocurrency, and fiat to enable payments and quick settlement times, a feature of Web3 that cross-border traditional finance payment systems often lack. Ripple was licensed to offer crypto payments by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March.Reece Merrick, Ripple’s managing director for the Middle East and Africa, said acquiring this license “enables Ripple to better serve the demand for solutions to the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, such as high fees, long settlement times, and lack of transparency, in one of the world’s largest cross-border payments hubs.”Related: Ripple, Chipper Cash partner for faster and cheaper African remittancesUAE ranked 56 out of 151 countries for crypto adoptionChainalysis, a blockchain data platform, ranked the United Arab Emirates 56th out of 151 countries for crypto adoption, according to a 2024 report.

The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply cluster, formed on Dec. 16, 2024, reflects firm holder conviction, as investors have neither sold nor averaged down despite price fluctuations.Bitcoin price cost basis chart. Source: GlassnodeThe BTC price drop occurred after macroeconomic headwinds intensified, with a historic downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s and a rise in US Treasury yields, raising speculation around risk assets such as Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory.Moody’s US credit downgrade spooks marketsAfter the US markets closed on May 16, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, marking the first downgrade in modern history. Moody's cited concerns over the US's ballooning $36 trillion debt pile, with federal deficits projected to reach 9% of GDP by 2035, up from 6.4% in 2024. Interest payments on US debt are expected to consume 30% of federal revenue by 2035, a significant rise from 18%. Following similar actions by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, this downgrade underscores the unsustainable fiscal path of the US, rattling investor confidence and contributing to market turbulence.US 30Y treasury yields reached its highest level since Oct 2023. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe downgrade also coincided with a surge in US Treasury yields, further impacting markets. The 10-year Treasury yield opened at 5.53% post-downgrade on May 19, while the 30-year yield followed a similar upward trend, currently at 4.98%, reflecting investor concerns over higher borrowing costs for the US government. The Kobeissi newsletter highlighted that historically, past downgrades led to mixed yield reactions—yields fell 35% after the 2011 S&P downgrade but rose 23% after Fitch's 2023 downgrade. This time, the yield spike mirrors the 2023 pattern, signaling fears of inflation and fiscal strain, which likely contributed to Bitcoin's price correction as investors sought safer assets.Related: Bitcoin bulls should 'be careful with longs' as BTC price risks $100K breakdownWill short-term pain shift to long-term gain for Bitcoin?Bitcoin's price dump on May 19 reflects its sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin could face continued pressure in the short term as investors pivot to safer assets amid rising uncertainty and borrowing costs.However, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a shift in market sentiment, noting that traders betting on price declines have been “significantly more cautious” in building short positions during this bull cycle compared to 2021. This suggests a generally bullish long-term outlook, as bears grow risk-averse. Bitcoin Advanced Short/Long signals.

This shift has reignited interest in gold, which saw a modest 0.4% increase, though broader market reactions remain subdued. Typically, a weaker dollar bolsters risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternative stores of value. Adler Jr said,“Overall, despite the prevailing “risk-off” sentiment (typically a headwind for high-volatility assets), Bitcoin may find itself in a relatively stronger position in the current environment due to its “digital gold” narrative and the supportive effect of a weaker dollar.”Related: $107K fakeout or new all-time highs? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-19T15:01:12.000Z,"Who’s got the charm, cash and code to be a crypto hub?","Kazakhstan, the Maldives and Pakistan have recently outlined ambitions to position themselves as crypto hubs and build out their digital economies.Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.Singapore is the crypto hub with parental guidanceSingapore has long stood out as a financial hub, bolstered by its AAA credit rating, low corporate tax rates and pro-business regulations. With the emergence of digital assets, the Lion City is among the front-runners in the crypto hub race.Singapore was among the early movers in crypto regulation. Its Payment Services Act (PSA) of 2019 — enacted in 2020 — was one of Asia’s first comprehensive legal frameworks that covered crypto activities. The PSA uses the term “digital payment token” (DPT) to define digital representation of value that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically — like crypto.At the time of writing, there are 33 DPT service providers licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state’s central bank. Casper Johansen, co-founder of Singapore- and Hong Kong-based Spartan Group, said license approvals have moved at a measured pace, giving faster-moving hubs like Dubai room to catch up.“Singapore is more of an institutional financial hub than a retail financial hub,” Johansen said, alluding to the city-state’s limitations on crypto marketing to retail investors.Singapore’s retail crypto promotion ban includes social media influencer marketing and third-party websites. Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore“The ban on marketing to retail has not affected Singapore’s position as a global crypto hub. Crypto firms set up in Singapore for the low and transparent taxes, strong regulatory framework and rule of law, world-class professional services, ease of living and global connectivity,” Johansen added.But cracks have emerged recently, particularly around immigration and hiring policy. In late 2024, concerns flared when the CEO of blockchain analytics firm Nansen, Alex Svanevik, shared that he was denied permanent residency. The government has ramped up efforts to prioritize local hiring amid growing political sensitivity over foreign labor.Nansen CEO’s permanent residency rejection highlighted Singapore’s tight visa and immigration environment. Source: Alex SvanevikUAE rolls out the welcome mat for crypto hub statusUnlike other crypto hub contenders, Dubai has a dedicated digital asset regulator, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Its wide-ranging licensing regime provides clear guidelines — even for NFT platforms — which major economies like the European Union have yet to address. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework currently excludes NFTs.VARA’s clarity is appealing to companies frustrated by regulatory uncertainty elsewhere. Binance, a borderless exchange with no official head office, has had to rethink that model under global regulatory pressure — and the exchange’s ties to the UAE have been growing.Richard Teng, former CEO of free zone Abu Dhabi Global Market, took over as the CEO of Binance after Zhao, and has recently hinted that UAE is a strong candidate for the exchange’s headquarters, though a decision hasn’t been made yet.Binance’s first institutional investment is a $2-billion bet from Abu Dhabi-based MGX. Source: BinanceThe UAE also provides its own incentives, such as no personal income tax and free zones like the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) offer 0% corporate tax advantages and 100% foreign ownership.Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearingsCrypto firms have reported easier access to banking services in Dubai, which is an improvement over the challenges companies say they’ve faced in the US under “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.”Hong Kong makes crypto hub push with retail access and staking ETFsHong Kong has long acted as a financial gateway to mainland China, where crypto activities like mining and trading remain banned.Previously, the city had a voluntary licensing regime, when only OSL and HashKey were licensed to serve institutions and professional investors. In Hong Kong, professional investors are legally defined as those with portfolios worth at least 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million). It was later updated to the mandatory regime, launched in 2023, which opened the doors to retail. The shift to mandatory licensing marked a turning point. OSL and HashKey became the first exchanges authorized to serve retail investors, while firms like Bybit and OKX withdrew their applications and exited the market. As of now, 10 platforms are licensed, while 15 have either withdrawn or been rejected.Eight applicants in Hong Kong still wait the SFC’s decision. Source: Securities and Futures CommissionHong Kong has made further strides with the listing of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs, and recently approved staking within Ether ETFs, which is not yet permitted in the US. It has also introduced stablecoin sandboxes under the supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to trial approved digital assets in a controlled environment.“Sandboxes are an experiment, so too are staking ETFs,” said Kelvin Koh, a Spartan Group co-founder. “The key point is that these experiments are happening in Hong Kong.”Hong Kong recently released its ASPIRe roadmap in February 2025, which aims to foster blockchain innovation and fill regulatory gaps to set the city up as a global crypto hub.Hong Kong’s five-pillar strategy to become a crypto hub.

As Arvin Abraham, partner at law firm Goodwin’s private equity group, told Cointelegraph, crypto was once central to Sunak’s competitiveness agenda, but under the current Labour government, that focus has faded.The new Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, highlights fintech as a priority without a focus solely on crypto.“The UK does not feel like it’s prioritizing it as much as it was a few years ago,” Abraham said.In January, Andreessen Horowitz announced the closure of its UK office to move back to the US. Source: Anthony AlbaneseAbraham added the UK remains “one of the best places to set up a new startup,” especially for early-stage capital raising. He points to generous tax incentives for angel investors and the unique convergence of finance and startups in London, calling it “probably one of the best cities in the world for fintech-type businesses.” In that sense, even without headline-grabbing crypto policy, the UK’s structural appeal still draws Web3 firms — just now with a quieter backdrop.Magazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cash-code-crypto-hub-uk-us-singapore?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-19T15:00:00.000Z,"Community sales are the future of crypto fundraising","Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21SharesA new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects. The ICO eraThe original ICO boom promised broad retail participation and democratized investment opportunities previously reserved for well-connected insiders. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks led to widespread fraud, rug pulls, and market manipulation. This chaotic environment, rampant exploitation, and regulatory uncertainty eventually forced projects to abandon ICOs, shifting instead to private rounds accessible to well-connected angel investors and venture capitalists. Private funding problemsWhile private funding initially brought much-needed stability and credibility, it also introduced new problems. Over the past two years, many tokens have launched at excessively high FDVs (Fully Diluted Valuation) with a low circulating token supply. These tokens entered exchanges with the majority of supply locked and sky-high valuation, which did not meet the demand. Retail investors, attracted by initial hype, often became collateral damage. The result? Devalued tokens and damaged trust. Most of these tokens will most likely never recover. This market dynamic discouraged investments in new projects and undermined community-building efforts, weakening the overall sustainability of Web3 projects.Airdrops as an unsustainable alternativeAirdrops appeared as another alternative, designed to distribute tokens widely and spark interest in the community for a project. Airdrops frequently fail to produce meaningful, sustainable engagement. Instead, they often became targets for Sybil attackers employing multiple accounts to maximize token gains or airdrop mercenaries hopping from one project to the next, quickly dumping tokens, depressing prices and undermining project credibility. Without genuine financial commitment and interest in the project beyond the airdrop, recipients had little incentive to hold tokens or participate actively in the community.Community sales as the new cool kid on the block(chain)Community sales represent a practical, strategic alternative to private funding and token airdrops, offering a structured way to engage retail investors meaningfully and transparently. Modern community sales on platforms like Legion and Echo feature robust regulatory frameworks, with thorough KYC and AML processes ensuring regulatory compliance and security. These inclusive fundraising opportunities require participants to make real capital commitments, even if modest, cultivating genuine stakeholder interest and reducing short-term speculation.Recent: Blockchain needs efficient use cases for AI agents: X Spaces recap with VCsOne of the most significant advantages of community sales is their ability to democratize access. Investors gain entry under equitable terms, similar or sometimes superior to those previously reserved for venture capitalists. With minimum investments often as low as $100, community sales encourage broad participation, helping to build a genuinely decentralized and committed investor base. Investors who financially commit are far more likely to become long-term holders and active community members.Win-win for projects, other investors, and the communityFor Web3 projects, community sales offer profound benefits beyond immediate capital raising. Early community involvement leads to a more distributed investor base, reducing concentration risk and diverse future users. Projects with broadly distributed tokens consistently exhibit more stable prices, higher community activity, and healthier onchain engagement. Community sales significantly enhance a project's market reputation. Embracing transparent, inclusive fundraising sends a clear signal to the market and prospective users — the project prioritizes collaboration and community involvement over the extraction of value. This transparency builds grassroots evangelism, drives organic growth, and creates a loyal community base committed to the project's ongoing success. Professional investors should embrace community sales and actively encourage their portfolio companies to allocate to the community. The broader crypto market benefits substantially from a shift toward community sales. Projects that raise funds transparently and inclusively from their communities tend to attract more stable, supportive investor bases. This stability positively affects token markets, reducing volatility, restoring investor confidence, and accelerating broader adoption and integration of blockchain technologies into everyday financial services and applications.Community sales represent far more than a revival of ICOs. They mark a mature approach, combining early crypto ideals with today's regulatory clarity and technological possibilities. Projects committed to community sales position themselves for initial fundraising success, enduring market resilience, and community loyalty. The crypto ecosystem, founded on principles of decentralization and inclusivity, should embrace this model to fulfill its potential. Founders should, where possible, include the community when raising capital, as in the end, everyone wins: WAGMI.The views and opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, 21Shares, or any affiliated organizations.Opinion by: Darius Moukhtarzadeh, Research Strategist at 21Shares.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The company reportedly used USB drivers to distribute malware-ridden drivers and uploaded the compromised software to cloud storage for global download.A total of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000 have been stolen, according to the report. Crypto tracking and compliance firm Slow Mist described how the malware operates in a May 19 X post:“The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program.

Analysis of those files confirmed that they were compromised by two distinct pieces of malware: backdoor Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A and a crypto stealer designed to substitute addresses in the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker.G-Data contacted Procolored, with the hardware producer saying it deleted the infected drivers from its storage on May 8 and re-scanned all files.

2025-05-19T14:00:00.000Z,"Franklin taps blockchain to offer yield on idle payroll funds","Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.“The problem that Franklin solves for is two-fold,” Megan Knab, founder and CEO of Franklin, told Cointelegraph. For companies that have already integrated crypto onto their balance sheets, Franklin helps them use those assets to manage their operations, she said.“But for the broader market, we are enabling business models of the future, where money moves instantly, more intelligently, and to more globally,” Knab added.Source: FranklinRelated: PayPal to offer 3.7% yield on stablecoin balances: ReportAlternative to T-BillsFranklin said its new offering is an alternative to traditional treasury tools like sweep accounts or T-bills, which often involve operational complexity and limited returns.Furthermore, it differentiates from earned wage access (EWA) platforms, which enable employees to access their earned wages before their scheduled payday by avoiding additional debt and associated costs.“Traditional payments in the next decade will run entirely on public blockchain rails as a wholesale replacement to ACH and SWIFT,” Knab said.She added that if onchain payroll products go mainstream, banks could fade into the background. While technology may replace many banking functions with self-custody tools and smart contracts, regulatory frameworks will still require accountable legal entities.The result may be “zombie-like institutions” — banks in name only, existing to meet compliance rules but playing a minimal role in actual payment processing, Knab said.However, decentralized lending comes with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market fluctuations. Franklin said it aims to mitigate these by using Summer.fi’s audited contracts and overcollateralized lending.Related: How to Use tsUSDe on TON for Passive Dollar Yield in 2025Rising interest in yield-generating strategiesInterest in yield-generating strategies within the cryptocurrency sector has surged in recent years, driven by both retail and institutional investors seeking to maximize returns on their digital assets.On May 16, Solv Protocol launched a yield-bearing Bitcoin token on the Avalanche blockchain, giving institutional investors more exposure to yield opportunities backed by real-world assets, or RWAs.On May 1, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, said the demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC.Magazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins’ powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest, May 11 – 17",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/franklin-launches-payroll-treasury-yield-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) and two lower peaks (shoulders). It is resolved when the price breaks below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulder), confirming the pattern and suggesting a potential sell signal.In XRP’s case, the pattern was validated following a break and close below the neckline at $2.33 during the early Asian trading hours on May 19. If the price stays below the neckline, the XRP/USD pair could slide further to $2.25 (where the 200-day simple moving average currently sits) and then to the pattern target of $2.00.

2025-05-19T11:49:01.000Z,"Australian court ruling could lead to $640M in Bitcoin tax refunds","A court decision in Australia could open the door to as much as $640 million in capital gains tax (CGT) refunds on Bitcoin transactions after a judge ruled that crypto should be treated as money rather than a taxable asset. On May 19, the Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that the decision arose within a criminal case involving federal police officer William Wheatley, who allegedly stole 81.6 Bitcoin (BTC) in 2019. At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.The interpretation could set a legal precedent, potentially placing Bitcoin transactions outside the scope of Australia’s current CGT regime.  New court ruling challenges Australian crypto tax lawsIn an AFR interview, tax lawyer Adrian Cartland said the verdict “totally upends” the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) current position. Since 2014, the ATO has classified crypto assets as CGT assets. This means that users must pay tax when selling or trading them. Under the ATO’s guidance, any disposal of Bitcoin, including selling it for fiat, exchanging it for another crypto or using it to purchase goods or services, constitutes a CGT event. This framework has been the basis for taxing cryptocurrency transactions in Australia for over a decade. However, the recent ruling challenges the approach by suggesting that Bitcoin functions more like money than property. This potentially exempts it from CGT.Related: Australian feds seize mansion, Bitcoin allegedly linked to crypto exchange hackTax refunds could reach $640 millionCartland said it was held that Bitcoin is Australian money. “That is, it is not a CGT asset. Therefore, acquisitions and disposals of Bitcoin have no tax consequences,” the tax lawyer added. If the ruling is upheld on the appeal, Cartland estimates that there could be potential tax refunds totalling 1 billion Australian dollars ($640 million). However, while Cartland thinks there could be up to a billion in refunds, the ATO said there were no official figures that confirm the amount to be potentially refunded if the case changes how Bitcoin is taxed in Australia. Magazine: Binance Wallet ‘killing’ MetaMask and airdrops, Chinese RWA tokens: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-bitcoin-tax-ruling-cgt-refunds?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
