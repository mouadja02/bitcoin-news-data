2025-06-14T13:55:07,"New Developments Regarding Donald Trump‚Äôs $2 Billion Bitcoin Move","DRW Investments, controlled by American financier Don Wilson, invested around $100 million in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), owned by the Trump family. According to the Financial Times, this investment was made to support the company's Bitcoin move, which has exceeded $2 billion. The investment is notable because it comes just nine weeks after the SEC investigation into Wilson‚Äôs crypto company Cumberland concluded, after the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Cumberland in March that included allegations of being an ‚Äúunregistered crypto broker.‚Äù Chicago-based DRW bought about 4 million shares of TMTG last month, according to investor records, marking one of the largest investments ever made by TMTG, which is also behind the Truth Social app. The company‚Äôs largest investor in the funding round for Bitcoin was reportedly Jane Street, with a stake of about $375 million. Related News: SEC Now Making Its Intentions Clear: High-Level Appointments Related to Cryptocurrencies DRW stated that they evaluated the investment decision based on ‚Äúthe benefits of holding Bitcoin in company balance sheets.‚Äù The statement said, ‚ÄúWe have been strategically involved in the crypto asset ecosystem for decades. This transaction was evaluated entirely from this perspective.‚Äù Don Wilson has advocated for a restructuring of U.S. securities regulators, proposing the creation of ‚Äúan entirely new regulatory agency‚Äù to replace the SEC and CFTC. ‚ÄúWilson has long called for a clear regulatory framework,‚Äù a DRW spokesperson said. Wilson‚Äôs interest in crypto is not new. In 2015, he auctioned off 70,000 Bitcoins that the U.S. government had seized from the Silk Road. The assets are worth about $7.7 billion today. DRW also has a number of funds tied to digital assets, including transactions related to MicroStrategy‚Äôs rebranded Bitcoin-focused entity ‚ÄúStrategy.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-14T13:49:42,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Israel v Iran News Crash Bitcoin Price - Recovery Next?","Escalating violence in the Middle East and ongoing clashes on the Russian Ukrainian front have drained enthusiasm from nearly every market. Bitcoin, fresh from a climb to $110k, sank to almost $102k when reports of Israeli action inside Iran reached desks, and talk of deeper United States involvement amplified the slide. The drop has rekindled an old argument: can this code based asset eventually share the pedestal with bullion or blue chip assets? A growing group of strategists says yes. They view the setback as the latest echo of earlier shocks that cleared the runway for larger climbs. Each flare-up in the past left Bitcoin stronger than traditional shelters, and many expect a familiar script to unfold again. Metals Rise First Yet Bitcoin Finishes Ahead Market history shows a reflex that rarely changes. Headlines of conflict push capital into metal vaults, where spot gold often pops, silver steadies, and Bitcoin stumbles. Early this week gold prices spiked past $3400 while Bitcoin slid under $103k. Traders who watch these rotations recall that the opening move seldom crowns the long term winner. ‚ö†Ô∏èNew War Escalation: What does this mean for #Bitcoin ?üëáMarkets are rattled:üí• $1.15B in crypto liquidationsüõ¢ Oil up 13% on the newsüìâ Initial fear reaction in $BTC But here‚Äôs what happened last time tensions flared:Oil & Gold spiked short-termBitcoin dipped first...‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/iup2osrHKy ‚Äî Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) June 13, 2025 February 2022 offers a clear template. As Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, gold broke above $1900 and Bitcoin slipped below $41,000. By early April, gold had lost that shine while Bitcoin hovered in the upper $46,000 zone, delivering the larger percentage gain and reclaiming the narrative. Analysts reading today‚Äôs tape note familiar clues. Exchange balances are shrinking, suggesting holders are moving coins to cold storage rather than capitulating. At midday Friday bids were already carrying the price back toward $105k, hinting that the rubber band has started its rebound. While there are definitely critics like Peter Schiff and many others who seem to disagree with Bitcoin being in the same league as metals like gold and silver, the sentiment seems to have been slowly shifting among major institutions already. [CNBC] Michael Saylor dismisses claims that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, comparing it to Manhattan real estate. He argues that just as developers issue debt to build more as property values rise, issuing debt or equity to buy Bitcoin is part of a functioning economy $MSTR pic.twitter.com/lEeIIJ8Ggj ‚Äî BecauseBitcoin.com (@BecauseBitcoin) December 17, 2024 Michael Saylor sees the same setup through a real estate lens. Questioned live on CNBC about issuing fresh debt to accumulate Bitcoin even near record levels, the MicroStrategy chair pointed to developers in Manhattan who borrow relentlessly to put new towers on land that is already expensive. That cycle, he said, is simply how productive economies grow. His company now holds a profit of over 80% on its Bitcoin treasury, evidence that the approach is more disciplined than reckless. If geopolitical tension eventually nudges governments toward neutral digital rails for settlement, Bitcoin could gain extra utility and value. Such a move has historically ignited follow-on rallies in altcoins, turning drawdowns like the current one into rare openings rather than red flags. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Stock Up On Potential Top Gainers Snorter Snorter is being built as a Telegram native sniper bot designed to execute token buys the instant liquidity is added. The project, launched a few weeks ago, aims to offer one of the fastest and most precise trading tools for Solana. It strips away every unnecessary step. There is no dashboard, no browser extension, just clean Telegram commands and the quickest execution possible through direct blockchain interaction. The upcoming features marketed by developers include a copy trading engine where users can automatically mirror the moves of high-performing wallets. The bot is also being prepared for multi-chain compatibility, starting with Solana and expanding into other ecosystems shortly after launch. It is being developed with a fee structure that aims to be lower than most competing bots, giving it a cost advantage alongside its technical speed. Snorter has not launched yet, but its presale traction suggests that interest is building fast. It is already gaining attention in trading groups and among Solana native communities that follow new tool drops closely. YouTuber Claybro called it a 100x potential crypto, adding to its existing virality across various social media platforms. When the bot does go live, it is likely to draw early users who thrive on volatility and who want to be first in line when new tokens deploy. For those who treat speed as strategy, Snorter may become an essential tool. The fact that it is still in presale means the timing is early and quite possibly right where the real upside begins. Solaxy Solaxy is approaching its final presale phase and there is only a short window left before the platform goes live. Having raised over $48 million, it has become one of the most successful meme-aligned crypto offerings in recent months. But Solaxy is more than just another successful memecoin presale. It comes with utility as a Layer Two network engineered to facilitate fast and secure transactions between Solana and Ethereum. It bypasses traditional bridges by building its own rails, giving users smoother interoperability with less risk. Its staking model is layered with flexible options. Short-term pools offer conservative yields, while longer lockups deliver sharply increased APY that rewards those willing to commit. Solaxy‚Äôs fee rebate model ensures that staking rewards are returned in SOLX itself, consolidating value instead of diluting it across multiple assets. The geopolitical volatility that dragged Bitcoin down has led many investors to reevaluate where real utility may emerge next. With Solaxy so close to launch, attention is already turning toward protocols that can immediately deliver on their use cases. In a post correction bounce, speed and infrastructure tend to lead the charge. Both are areas where Solaxy seems prepared. SUBBD SUBBD does not just give creators a platform, but also gives their fans a revenue stream. The project tokenizes the future income of influencers, musicians, and video creators, allowing users to buy fractional stakes in their ongoing success. When revenue is generated, it flows into a smart contract vault that automatically splits payouts between the creator and their early backers. This structure removes the gatekeeping often found in traditional media and turns fans into financial participants. It also includes a discovery engine that highlights up-and-coming talent using engagement trends, giving early supporters a head start on limited allocation offerings. The tokenomics reward long-term holders by distributing protocol fees back to stakers, along with exclusive access to new creator drops. Despite wider market pullbacks, the creator economy is proving to be unusually resilient. In times when trust in institutions wanes, especially during global crises, individual creators often gain influence. SUBBD‚Äôs system allows that influence to be monetized fairly and transparently. With Bitcoin already showing signs of recovery, capital could soon pivot back toward utility-first platforms, making SUBBD a strong candidate for renewed attention. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper , as the name suggests, boasts a Bitcoin-themed concept and design style. But while it looks like another meme coin, it exists to do something else entirely. The project attempts to move value quickly, affordably, and without layers of complexity getting in the way. The protocol is lean and designed for direct usage, handling transactions that confirm almost instantly without bloating fees or requiring external dependencies. This makes it especially suitable for small or frequent transfers, whether between individuals or applications. The architecture has been built around a clear loop of movement and reward. Every completed transaction sends a portion of its fee back into staking pools and liquidity buffers. This creates a self-feeding structure that strengthens as more people use it. There are no side tokens, no secondary chains, and no unfinished utilities. What exists is already functional and being refined through iterative community feedback. As markets enter phases of hesitation, utility often becomes the metric that matters most. Traders stop chasing hype and start looking at whether a token actually does what it claims. Bitcoin Hyper directly relies on movement to justify its value. Its velocity-focused structure rewards real participation, not just passive holding. When geopolitical pressure destabilizes traditional financial rails, options that offer fast direct settlement begin to matter. Bitcoin Hyper may not dominate headlines, but its infrastructure is capable of handling practical demand. If confidence shifts back toward utility-driven tokens, this one is already in position to absorb it. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is woven directly into a system that many users already rely on. The wallet itself supports over sixty chains, with full access to asset swaps, portfolio tracking, staking, and presale aggregation. It is already live, active, and adopted by a broad user base. The wallet‚Äôs recent feature in the New York Post did not trigger its rise, but it has helped fuel a more noticeable uptick in both usage and user interest, especially from those outside the immediate crypto circle. The token acts as an access layer rather than a marketing prop. Holding it gives users lower swap fees inside the app, higher yields on certain staking pools, and first entry positions into presales curated through the aggregator. Rather than trying to gamify rewards, Best Wallet keeps things practical. Staking the token simply boosts what the user can already do inside the wallet. The platform‚Äôs presale aggregator has drawn particular attention in recent months as users search for early stage tokens before major listings. In a space where speed often determines entry, this has become one of the more practical tools to have. As centralized exchanges face more scrutiny and markets react to global tension by pulling funds off platforms, wallets like this become the default solution. Best Wallet Token ties directly into that behavioral shift. With confidence returning slowly to crypto, systems that offer genuine control, transparency, and deep chain support could be the ones that benefit first. This token is already embedded at the center of that movement. Conclusion While Bitcoin‚Äôs recent dip has reignited comparisons with metals and real estate, the broader takeaway is that innovation-driven crypto projects often recover stronger and faster. From fast settlement protocols to creator-powered economies and high utility infrastructure, the space is already pivoting toward tokens that do more than sit idle. Each of the projects discussed above reflects that shift in its own way, offering distinct value beyond short-term speculation. As Bitcoin stabilizes and capital begins to move again, these are the types of ideas that tend to benefit first and sometimes most.

2025-06-14T13:47:02,"Ethereum Price Prediction: TradFi Inflows Could Impact ETH Price ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next?","Ethereum is attracting serious institutional attention. In just 14 consecutive sessions, spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. have seen over $812 million in inflows, more than double Bitcoin‚Äôs total over the same period. According to Bloomberg , nine Ethereum ETFs are leading the charge, with funds like BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA and Fidelity‚Äôs FETH capturing a large slice of daily volumes. This sudden influx of TradFi capital, which included a $240 million spike on June 11 alone, indicates that hedge funds, RIAs, and asset managers are increasingly turning to Ethereum as their entry point into the crypto market. CoinShares notes that ETH-based investment products generated $296 million in the past week alone, marking its highest total since the 2024 U.S. election. As regulatory clarity improves and ETF accessibility widens, Ethereum appears poised to benefit from deepening institutional confidence. But so far, price hasn‚Äôt quite caught up. Ethereum Faces Technical Roadblocks Despite bullish sentiment, Ethereum price prediction remains stuck under key resistance zones. After bouncing from a low of $2,439, ETH has been unable to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement ($2,518) and the 50-day EMA around $2,614. Ethereum Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview MACD momentum is recovering slightly, but the signal line still points to caution. Meanwhile, the downtrend line from early June continues to cap upside movement. Key levels to monitor: Bullish breakout: Close above $2,567 with strong volume could open the door to $2,614 and $2,647 Downside risk: A decline below $2,480 might uncover ETH to a retest of $2,439 or lower MACD confirmation: Needed to validate any breakout attempt Traders are watching these levels closely, as momentum builds around a potential move. Can Inflows Power a Breakout for Ethereum? While the price remains range-bound, the growing ETF inflow narrative may soon put pressure on the charts. Since June began, total inflows into Ethereum ETFs have climbed past $1.37 billion. That‚Äôs not a fluke; it‚Äôs a strong sign that Wall Street is gradually leaning into ETH exposure. But inflows alone won‚Äôt push ETH higher without technical confirmation. A breakout above the $2,567 mark, backed by volume and MACD crossover, would likely ignite bullish sentiment and accelerate retail follow-through. Bottom line: Ethereum is at a tipping point. TradFi inflows are bullish, but until ETH clears resistance, price remains locked in consolidation. Traders should track ETF volume trends and technical thresholds to stay ahead of potential breakouts or breakdowns.

In a new report, the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says 2025 kicked off with an alarming number of smartphone attacks. ‚ÄúAttacks on Android devices involving malware, adware or potentially unwanted apps in the first quarter of 2025 increased to 12,184,351.‚Äù That‚Äôs up from 8,780,221 attacks in the last three months of 2024. Trojans, a type of malware that appears harmless but secretly performs malicious actions like stealing data or enabling unauthorized access, were the most common mobile threat, accounting for 39.56% of total detected threats. The sudden increase in attacks is largely attributable to the banking trojan known as Mamont, as well as scam apps. Other reasons for the attack surge include counterfeit versions of popular smartphones that come preloaded with an Android malware called Triada. ‚ÄúThis growth was largely due to the activity of Mamont banking trojans and fake money scam apps, along with the discovery of fake popular brand smartphones that came preloaded with the Triada backdoor, capable of dynamically downloading any modules from a server.‚Äù Kaspersky also says there were 180,405 malicious and potentially unwanted Android app installation packages detected in the first quarter of 2025, up from 141,779 in the last quarter of 2024.

BTC is now stabilizing around $104,957, down just 0.17% in the last 24 hours, as traders reassess their risk appetite. According to data from Coinglass, more than 247,000 traders were liquidated in a 24-hour window. The most notable wipeout was a $200 million BTC long on Binance the largest single liquidation event of the year. Most of the damage occurred on Binance and Bybit, which together accounted for $834 million in liquidated positions. UPDATE: Over $1 billion were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $943.31M from long positions. pic.twitter.com/VllxE4f3KM ‚Äî Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 13, 2025 The overwhelming majority were longs, as traders overleveraged on bullish momentum fueled by Circle‚Äôs IPO momentum and renewed interest in U.S.-based DeFi protocols. These forced liquidations act as automatic margin calls. When traders fail to meet required collateral thresholds, exchanges close positions to protect the broader system. But in times of sharp volatility, these measures often snowball, leading to rapid price declines and widespread market capitulation. Bitcoin Dominance Climbs as Altcoins Falter While altcoins suffered steep losses, Bitcoin price predction is is support above $104,000.

Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview Technically, BTC is hovering just above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $104,872 and sits on an ascending trendline that has supported price action since early June. The MACD histogram is flattening, showing early signs of bearish momentum waning. If bulls can reclaim the 50-period EMA near $106,351 and surpass the 0.5 Fib level at $106,788, a move toward $108,864 remains in play. This pattern suggests a possible higher low in the making, especially if the current consolidation zone holds. Small-bodied candles point to indecision and accumulation‚Äîtypical behavior near the bottom of correction cycles. Short-Term Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes $108K if Momentum Builds Despite market turbulence, Bitcoin‚Äôs chart structure remains technically constructive. A move over the $106,350 level would indicate a short-term breakout, validating a reversal pattern and that could propel BTC toward $107,640 and $108,864. Trade Idea Recap: Entry: Above $106,350 with volume Stop: Below $104,000 Targets: $107,640 (initial), $108,864 (extended) With major altcoins bleeding and risk sentiment fragile, Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience could attract sidelined capital.

It formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side was at $0.047 and the lower side was at $0.0051 or a 90% dip. Measuring the same distance from the cup‚Äôs upper side gives it a target of $0.090, a few points above the current level. LUNC price rises as burn rate jumps LUNC chart | Source: crypto.news Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ) token rose by over 10% on Saturday. This jump happened after the LUNC token burn rose by over 234 million in the last seven days, bringing the cumulative burn to 410 billion. Technicals suggest that the LUNC price has more gains in the coming weeks. It has remained in a tight range and formed a double-bottom pattern with a neckline at $0.00007253. LUNC has also moved in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to an eventual comeback. A move above the neckline at $0.00007253 will point to more gains to the 50% retracement level at $0.0001135. Meanwhile, Bitcoin rallied past $105,000 at last check on Saturday. See below.

2025-06-14T13:08:00,"Seven Solana ETF Filings Hit SEC ‚Äî But Is Approval Still a Long Shot?","Seven issuers filed or amended applications for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, marking the latest wave of institutional interest in the Layer 1 blockchain. Key Takeaways: Seven Solana ETF filings hit the SEC, including new entries and amendments from major issuers. Analysts say staking language in the filings could complicate approval timelines. Market optimism remains high, with Bloomberg projecting a 90% chance of approval by 2025. Despite the flurry of filings, analysts warn that approval remains far from guaranteed. ‚ÄúI think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it,‚Äù Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said . Analyst Warns Solana ETF May Face Long Road Like Bitcoin ETFs Drawing parallels to the protracted approval process for Bitcoin ETFs, he noted, ‚ÄúIf anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.‚Äù Among the June 13 filings was Fidelity‚Äôs first S-1 registration for its Solana ETF. 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Canary Capital also submitted amendments to existing applications, while VanEck ‚Äî the first firm to file for a Solana ETF back in June ‚Äî rounded out the list with an amended filing of its own. Seyffart emphasized a key complication: staking. ‚ÄúAll of them include staking language, I believe,‚Äù he said, underscoring that staking provisions, unlike past Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, could trigger regulatory pushback. While Ether ETF issuers are also seeking permission to offer staking features, the SEC has yet to sign off. They haven't yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn't seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch) ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 Still, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Bloomberg Intelligence in April placed 90% odds on a Solana ETF approval by 2025. And Bloomberg‚Äôs Eric Balchunas added fuel to speculation earlier this week, posting: ‚ÄúGet ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way.‚Äù Seyffart admitted the SEC could theoretically greenlight staking features for both Solana and Ether ETFs simultaneously, but added, ‚ÄúI have no insight into what will actually happen.‚Äù SEC Pushback on Staking ETFs Raises Doubts About Regulatory Direction Last week, the SEC raised new objections to ETF proposals from REX Financial and Osprey Funds that include staking mechanisms for Solana and Ether. The regulator argued these funds may not qualify as traditional ETFs under current rules, casting uncertainty over the future of staking-enabled investment products. Manthan Dav√© of Ripple-backed Palisade said the resistance shows the SEC struggling to reconcile existing frameworks with fast-evolving crypto technologies. Dav√© pointed out the contradiction in the SEC‚Äôs stance‚Äîacknowledging that staking may not be a securities activity, yet resisting products built around it. This inconsistency, he warned, risks stifling innovation and sending capital offshore. He called for clearer guidance and modernized classifications that account for how staking underpins blockchain security and value creation. Without it, the U.S. may continue to lose ground in the digital finance race.

2025-06-14T13:00:59,"Strategy‚Äôs Inner Circle Is Selling‚ÄîA Storm Warning For Stockholders?","Microstrategy‚Äôs (rebranded to Strategy) board shake‚Äëup took a sharp turn this week as insiders moved to cash in. It‚Äôs an unusual sight for a company that‚Äôs best known for piling up Bitcoin . Yet director Carl Rickertsen sold every last one of his shares, walking away with more than $10‚ÄØmillion. He first bought $700,000 worth of stock in October‚ÄØ2022 when the price was under $25 a share. Since then, the stock has climbed roughly 16√ó in less than three years. Insider Sales Hit Record High According to Protos, Strategy insiders have taken profits in a big way. Rickertsen alone unloaded over $10 million of stock this month. He had sold some shares back in 2023, but this time he cleared out his entire stake. Protos also notes that he exercised stock options and sold shares on the same day. Some investors see that move as a sign he‚Äôs not betting on more gains for MSTR. ‚ÄúInsiders might sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one: they think the price will rise‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Lynch. Well, ZERO insiders have bought $MSTR in 2025. Instead, there have been 26 insider sales this year alone. 5 year score: Insider sales exceed purchases by $864M. pic.twitter.com/nZSzqFcWZe ‚Äî Protos (@Protos) June 12, 2025 No Insider Buys This Year Based on reports by Protos, there haven‚Äôt been any insider purchases in 2025. Meanwhile, there have been 26 insider sales year‚Äëto‚Äëdate. Those sales exceed buys by $864‚ÄØmillion. It‚Äôs rare to see so much insider selling without a single buy to balance it out. That pattern makes a few retail holders uneasy, especially after a month where the stock slid 10%. Share Price Under Pressure The sell‚Äëoff comes even as Strategy keeps adding Bitcoin to its coffers. The firm now holds about 582,000‚ÄØBTC, worth roughly $63 billion at today‚Äôs prices. Yet MSTR shares are down 10% over the past month. By comparison, Metaplanet ‚Äîa smaller Bitcoin holdings firm‚Äîjumped 150% over the same time. Some traders are asking why Strategy‚Äôs stock can‚Äôt catch the same kind of lift. Critic Voices Doubt Strategy US President Donald Trump‚Äôs longtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff piled on this week. Schiff called Strategy‚Äôs business model ‚Äúcomplete fraud‚Äù and warned that bankruptcy is only a matter of time. He made those remarks after Saylor shared a Bloomberg report on the company‚Äôs Bitcoin stash. Schiff has pushed gold over Bitcoin for years. Even so, he admitted he regrets not buying Bitcoin back when prices were low. Investors who back the Bitcoin‚Äëreserve approach say that holding crypto will pay off over the long haul. They argue the stock‚Äôs wild ride is part of the deal. Others point to the wave of insider sales as a red flag. Watchers will be tracking a few things: whether any insiders start buying again, how the share price reacts to the latest Bitcoin purchases, and if critics like Schiff can sway the broader market. For now, Strategy‚Äôs path looks as bold as ever, but a fresh batch of insider sales has put the firm under a brighter spotlight.

2025-06-14T12:55:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Global Tensions Could Drive BTC Lower","Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $102,832 on Friday as escalating Middle East tensions kept the markets on tenterhooks. Rising uncertainty and tensions could also limit future rallies. The flagship cryptocurrency is down almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,103. Despite the decline and bearish sentiment in the overall market, BTC found buyers at lower levels, highlighting the market‚Äôs desire to buy the dip. BlackRock Holds 3% Of All Bitcoin BlackRock‚Äôs foray into the Bitcoin market through its flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) heralded a new era in institutional adoption and accumulation of Bitcoin. IBIT has registered exponential growth since its launch, with BlackRock accumulating over 662,500 BTC , 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply, giving it over $72 billion in Bitcoin exposure at current prices. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $70 billion in just 341 days, making it the fastest-growing ETF in history. The world‚Äôs largest asset manager‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings now eclipse many centralized exchanges and even major corporate holders like Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy. Only Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs 1.1 million BTC outnumbers IBIT, but the gap is quickly narrowing. If inflows continue at the current pace, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT will soon become the single-largest holder of Bitcoin. BlackRock views Bitcoin as a crucial component of long-term, diversified portfolios, embracing its volatility as a tradeoff for potential upside. BlackRock is betting that broader adoption of the asset will stabilize price volatility over time. Improve price discovery, increase liquidity, and narrow spreads. The asset manager‚Äôs adoption and decision to accumulate over 3% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply through IBIT is a turning point in Bitcoin‚Äôs perception and how it is traded and regulated. Anthony Pompliano To Launch Bitcoin-Buying Vehicle Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is in talks to launch a new Bitcoin-buying vehicle that will raise $750 million to fund purchases. Pompliano is widely expected to become the CEO of ProCapBTC, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will merge with publicly traded black cheque vehicle Columbus Circle Capital 1. ProCapBTC will look to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt as part of its merger, backed by Cohen & Company Investment Bank. The deal could be announced as early as next week. However, the terms of the deal are yet to be finalized. Columbus Circle Capital 1 is a blank cheque company formed to effect a merger, share exchange and purchase, asset acquisition, reorganization, or similar combinations with one or more businesses. In May, the company raised $250 million through an initial public offering sponsored by Cohen & Company Capital Markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum after it crossed $110,000 on Monday. Bearish sentiment had taken hold by Wednesday as the price slipped below $110,000, falling to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday and Friday as Middle East tensions escalated after Israel launched missiles against Iran, targeting its military and nuclear installations. The price plunged to a low of $102,832 on Friday but recovered to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,100. As tensions surged, BTC dipped while oil prices rose by 5%, with historical data suggesting the dip could be a buying opportunity. BTC‚Äôs performance during geopolitical tensions offers a compelling investment case. Andr√© Dragosch, the head of research at Bitwise Europe, highlighted this potential in a post on X, highlighting data from geopolitical events since 2010. According to the data, BTC averaged a price increase of almost 65% within 50 days, with a median gain of 17.3%. Blockstream CEO Adam Back reinforced this view to counter gold advocate Peter Schiff‚Äôs skepticism. BTC plunged to a low of $103,768 on Monday (June 2) but rebounded to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,902. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752.

According to the Financial Times, citing a 200-page filing, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics discloses that one of Trump‚Äôs largest revenue sources among hundreds of financial interests is his crypto venture. The filing shows Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial. Instead of a direct investment, the tokens were obtained through his promotional activities on the network. The report also shows that Trump holds positions in holding companies linked to digital ventures, such as CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, though these entities reported little to no income. The document includes Trump‚Äôs certification that the information provided is ‚Äútrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge,‚Äù and is subject to review by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Earlier this year, Trump removed David Huitema as director of the Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch.

Trump‚Äôs crypto fortune fuels conflict-of-interest concerns According to 2024 SEC filings, Steve Witkoff, Trump‚Äôs special envoy, was a ‚Äúpromoter‚Äù of the World Liberty Financial initiative. The venture operates as a decentralized finance platform offering cryptocurrency lending and trading services. Since it launched last year, World Liberty Financial sold 21 billion tokens in a public offering, generating $1 billion in funding. Trump‚Äôs involvement appears legal on the surface, but Democrats and some Republicans have flagged Trump‚Äôs willingness to profit while in office as a conflict of interest ‚Äîparticularly since the president holds substantial crypto stakes while influencing policy. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has dropped several high-profile enforcement cases against cryptocurrency companies since taking office. This has created a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry, one in which Trump has seemingly granted investors access to the executive branch if they‚Äôre Official Trump ( TRUMP ) owners. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top House Democrat, recently opened a probe into the private dinner Trump hosted for top investors in his meme coin. In addition to World Liberty Financial, Trump Media & Technology Group declared its intention to raise $2.5 billion for a ‚Äúbitcoin treasury‚Äù strategy and to introduce a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Abra CEO Bill Barhydt says it‚Äôs time for something new. And that something, he believes, is crypto. In a recent interview with Bitcoin.com News , Barhydt explained why financial advisors are starting to shift away from bonds and towards digital assets, signaling a major change in how wealth is being managed. Bonds Fade as Bitcoin Booms It‚Äôs no secret that bonds have underperformed in recent years. Bloomberg‚Äôs U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned just 1.25% in 2024, and over the past five years, it‚Äôs actually gone negative, down 0.05%. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äò40‚Äô in 60/40 isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù Barhydt said, referring to the bond portion of the traditional model. He sees crypto as a better hedge against inflation and market swings, something that more advisors are starting to recognize. That shift in thinking is breaking long-held rules about portfolio diversification. Advisors Are Warming Up to Crypto Barhydt recently attended the 7th Annual Vision Conference in Arlington, Texas, hosted by the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP). The event drew hundreds of financial advisors and the attitude toward crypto was very different from what he saw a few years ago. ‚ÄúFive years ago, people thought crypto was just magic Internet money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow, advisors want to offer it to their clients.‚Äù DACFP founder and longtime financial expert Ric Edelman didn‚Äôt hold back either. During the event, he told attendees, ‚ÄúThe 60/40 model is dead.‚Äù His recommendation? A new model that puts 70% to 100% of a portfolio into stocks and crypto, with bonds making up no more than 30% and in some cases, none at all. I‚Äôll be speaking at the Vision Conference today. I‚Äôll be showing an audience of the leading RIAs in the country how to get their clients off zero. The 60/40 allocation is dead.

It began as a Bitcoin remittance app, helping people send money using crypto. But under Barhydt‚Äôs leadership, it evolved. Today, Abra offers spot trading, lending, borrowing, and yield services ‚Äì all designed for investors who want exposure to digital assets. Barhydt‚Äôs background is just as varied ‚Äì he‚Äôs worked at the CIA, NASA, Netscape, and Goldman Sachs. Now, he‚Äôs focused on helping advisors tap into crypto in a smarter, more strategic way. Barhydt emphasized that ‚ÄúBitcoin presents the best financial chance of our era.‚Äù Crypto Is No Longer Optional With bonds losing their appeal and Bitcoin hitting record highs, more financial advisors are exploring crypto as a serious part of their strategy. Abra wants to be the platform they turn to as this shift continues. The message from Barhydt and Edelman is clear: The old rules no longer apply. Crypto is no longer a fringe bet ‚Äì it‚Äôs becoming a core part of the modern investment portfolio. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T12:01:56,"How gold took its shine as the world‚Äôs undisputed safe haven asset","Gold just made its biggest comeback in modern economic history. The ancient metal, long dismissed by economists and dumped by central banks after the collapse of the gold standard in the 1970s, has now climbed to the second most-held reserve asset on the planet‚Äîright behind the US dollar. Governments that once sold their gold for decades are now buying it again. And not in small amounts. Over the past three years, net central bank purchases have been over 1,000 tonnes annually, a record pace. That demand pushed gold above the euro in global reserves for the first time ever. The last time central banks held this much gold was back in 1965 during the Bretton Woods system. Trump‚Äôs policies trigger dollar doubts Donald Trump‚Äôs second term lit the fuse. His trade wars , unpredictable foreign policy, and fiscal blowouts drove investors and foreign governments to question the strength of the US dollar and Treasury bonds. The dollar, once the default haven in global crises, just dropped to a three-year low against the euro and pound. John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council, didn‚Äôt overcomplicate it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Trump, in a word,‚Äù he said . ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the risk and uncertainty from the new US administration.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù tariffs and increasing debt raised concerns over US fiscal discipline. His attacks on the Federal Reserve and US courts have only made things worse. Meanwhile, the price of gold has surged. This April, it hit a new intraday high of over $3,000 per troy ounce, beating the previous all-time high set in 1980. That marked a 30% rise just in 2025. After Israel bombed Iran, investors jumped into gold again, pushing prices close to that peak. For many, this wasn‚Äôt just another crisis hedge. It was a full-blown retreat from traditional safe assets like bonds. Central banks in Asia and beyond load up Most of the heavy buying came from countries outside the US and Europe. Central banks in China, Turkey, and India have been leading the charge. These governments are trying to reduce their exposure to the dollar in case they ever face sanctions similar to what Russia dealt with after the Ukraine invasion. Their goal isn‚Äôt high returns. They‚Äôre simply stacking assets that can‚Äôt be frozen, sanctioned, or printed out of thin air. With few other currencies offering enough liquidity or political neutrality, central banks are settling for gold. Oh, but demand comes with problems. When traders rushed to import gold into New York earlier this year over tariff fears, it clogged up the system. At the Bank of England, the world‚Äôs second-biggest gold vault, queues to withdraw metal stretched on for weeks. Bank staff couldn‚Äôt keep up with the requests. Eventually, Trump clarified that gold wouldn‚Äôt face tariffs. The old belief that US Treasuries were the safest place to park reserves doesn‚Äôt hold like it used to. Even private fund managers are sounding alarms. A recent Bank of America survey found that 45% of them think gold is overvalued right now‚Äîthe highest number since 2008. Still, for the second month in a row, gold was called the ‚Äúmost crowded trade‚Äù in markets. Everyone seems to be in it, even the skeptics. Kenneth Rogoff, professor at Harvard and former IMF chief economist, said the narrative around crypto replacing gold doesn‚Äôt hold up anymore. ‚ÄúPeople often say bitcoin is the new gold. I say, ‚ÄòNo, gold is the new gold.‚Äô‚Äù But not everyone‚Äôs rooting for a return to the gold standard. Economists argue that pegging currencies to a fixed asset caused more harm than good during past downturns, including the Great Depression. It limited governments‚Äô ability to react to crises. That‚Äôs why even those who are bullish on gold don‚Äôt see it replacing the dollar anytime soon. Still, the fear is real. And the demand is real. So yeah, for now, gold is doing what it‚Äôs always done best‚Äîsit still, stay quiet, and hold its value while the rest of the world freaks out. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-14T11:50:13,"Solana ETF Hopes Rise, But Approval Unlikely Next Week, Say Analysts","Seven asset managers submitted filings for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, signaling growing momentum for altcoin ETFs. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart cautioned that a swift approval is unlikely, despite optimism from market participants. In a post on X, Seyffart noted that there needs to be a regulatory back-and-forth before any green light. ‚ÄúIf anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch,‚Äù he wrote. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were eventually approved in January 2024, over a decade after the first application by Gemini‚Äôs Winklevoss twins in 2013. All Eyes on Staking Language in Solana Filings The filings from major players‚ÄîFidelity Investments, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck‚Äîall include language around staking, which has become a key area of regulatory focus. Fidelity submitted a new S-1 form, while others amended earlier filings. VanEck, which initiated the first U.S. Solana ETF application in early June 2024, submitted its amended version last. Seyffart confirmed , ‚ÄúAll of them include staking language, I believe.‚Äù While experience with prior Bitcoin and Ether ETF approvals could help speed up procedural elements, he emphasized that staking remains an unresolved issue with no precedent yet set. The SEC is also reviewing proposals to add staking features to already-approved spot Ether ETFs. Staking, which allows holders of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum to earn rewards, has raised questions about whether it constitutes a securities offering‚Äîa gray area that regulators have yet to define clearly. SOL, ETH ETFs Could See Staking Decisions Together Seyffart speculated that both Solana and Ether ETFs could potentially receive staking approvals simultaneously. ‚ÄúThey could theoretically be launched with staking at the same time,‚Äù he said, while clarifying he has ‚Äúno insight into what will actually happen.‚Äù Bloomberg Intelligence raised its estimate for Solana ETF approval in 2025 to 90% back in April. Meanwhile, in January, Consensys founder Joe Lubin expressed optimism that staking features for Ether ETFs could be authorized ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù Bloomberg‚Äôs Eric Balchunas added to the excitement, suggesting an ‚Äúaltcoin ETF summer‚Äù could be on the horizon, with Solana poised to take the lead.

2025-06-14T11:40:55,"US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: Funds Record Fifth Consecutive Day of Strong Net Inflows Totalling $301.7M","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: Funds Record Fifth Consecutive Day of Strong Net Inflows Totalling $301.7M Are you watching the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you‚Äôve likely noticed the growing excitement around US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These investment vehicles have become a significant gateway for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The latest data reveals a truly encouraging trend that speaks volumes about the current market sentiment and the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Continue Strong Streak According to recent data from Farside Investors, June 13th marked a notable day for the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market. These funds collectively saw a substantial net inflow totaling $301.7 million . What makes this figure particularly significant is that it represents the fifth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have experienced net positive inflows. This consistent buying pressure is a key indicator that investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated products remains robust. Understanding net inflows is crucial. It means that on this particular day, the total amount of money flowing into these ETFs from new investments or purchases of shares exceeded the amount flowing out from redemptions or sales of shares. A streak of consecutive net inflows suggests sustained positive sentiment and accumulation rather than fleeting interest. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Contributions While the overall figure is impressive, looking at the individual performance of the various US Spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the top contributors on June 13th: BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a massive $239 million in net inflows. This continues BlackRock‚Äôs dominance in attracting capital into the Bitcoin space via their ETF product. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC: Following BlackRock, Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw healthy net inflows of $25.2 million . Fidelity has consistently been one of the strongest performers alongside BlackRock since the ETFs launched. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added $14.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating steady interest in their offering. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC: In a significant shift from earlier trends, Grayscale‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded net inflows of $9.1 million . For months after the conversion to an ETF, GBTC experienced significant outflows, largely due to its higher fees compared to competitors. Recent inflows suggest that this selling pressure may be easing, and some investors might even be re-entering or finding value in GBTC. Grayscale‚Äôs BTC (Mini): Grayscale‚Äôs new, lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) also saw inflows, bringing in $7.5 million . This new fund is designed to offer a more competitive fee structure. VanEck‚Äôs HODL: VanEck‚Äôs Bitcoin Trust (HODL) rounded out the list of positive contributors with $6 million in net inflows. It‚Äôs worth noting that data for ARK 21Shares‚Äô ARKB was not yet available at the time of the report. The remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked by Farside Investors showed no change in their holdings for the day. What Does This Streak of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Signify? The consistent inflow trend, particularly the five-day streak, is a powerful signal for the market. Here‚Äôs why it matters: Sustained Demand: It indicates that the demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated, accessible products is not a one-off event but a sustained trend. Institutional Interest: While retail investors certainly participate, the significant amounts flowing into funds like BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT and Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC are often attributed to larger institutions, wealth managers, and financial advisors allocating capital on behalf of their clients. This suggests increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Market Validation: The success and continued growth of these ETFs provide further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset in traditional financial circles. Potential Price Impact: While not the only factor, consistent net inflows represent buying pressure on Bitcoin itself, as ETF issuers purchase BTC to back the new shares being created. This can contribute positively to Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance over time. Easing GBTC Pressure: The fact that GBTC is now seeing inflows, even modest ones, suggests that the large selling pressure from that fund, which weighed on the market for a period, may be subsiding. This period contrasts with earlier phases following the January launch, where initial euphoria was followed by some volatility and periods of net outflows, particularly from GBTC. The current streak suggests a more stable and growing base of demand. The Broader Context: Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape The success of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is also influencing the broader Cryptocurrency ETF landscape. It highlights the demand for regulated crypto investment products and could pave the way for other single-asset or basket crypto ETFs in the future, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared. Investors are clearly looking for familiar, regulated wrappers to access the potential upside of the crypto market. While the focus is currently on Bitcoin, the infrastructure and investor comfort level being built by these products could eventually benefit other digital assets seeking ETF approval. What‚Äôs Next? Keeping an Eye on the Data For investors and market watchers, monitoring the daily inflow and outflow data for these US Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains a crucial activity. Continued strong inflows would likely be interpreted as a bullish signal for Bitcoin and reflect ongoing demand from traditional finance. Conversely, a return to significant outflows could indicate shifting sentiment or macroeconomic pressures. Other factors to watch include regulatory developments, changes in global economic conditions, and significant price movements in Bitcoin itself, all of which can influence ETF flows. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive trend, it‚Äôs important to remember that the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, remains volatile. ETF flows can change direction quickly. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact demand for these products. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The streak of five consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the $301.7 million figure on June 13th, is a powerful indicator of growing confidence and sustained demand for Bitcoin via the US Spot Bitcoin ETF structure. Led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, these funds are successfully bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. The data suggests that institutional adoption is not just a buzzword but a tangible trend driving significant capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem. As these inflows continue, they provide a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs position as a recognized and increasingly accepted investment asset.

Bitcoin fell hard yesterday , due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions triggered in the Middle East. Some altcoins are showing signs of life, short sellers are being wiped out, and analysts believe a bounce could be coming. So, is this the start of a comeback? Bitcoin Crashes Amid Global Tension On one of the worst days this June, Bitcoin dropped nearly 4%, crashing to around $102,664. This drop was mainly due to rising tensions in the Middle East , which triggered panic across markets. As a result, the crypto space saw over $1 billion in leveraged positions wiped out in just one day. But within 24 hours, things began to change. While the market is still shaky, many coins have started to rise again. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week‚Äôs Crypto News Highlights | 14 June, 2025 , Short Traders Take the Bigger Hit Today, another $190.25 million in leveraged trades were liquidated. But this time, short positions took the bigger hit, losing $107 million, while long positions saw losses of $83.1 million. In the meantime, when short trades were liquidated, traders rushed to buy back their positions, which pushed prices higher. That‚Äôs exactly what happened today. In the last 24 hours, over 58,000 traders were liquidated, with the total losses hitting $191.32 million. The largest single liquidation was worth $6.26 million on Binance, involving Bitcoin. Altcoins and Memecoins Start to Move While Bitcoin is still settling, some altcoins and meme tokens are quietly climbing. Shiba Inu gained 4%, Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped 4.5%, Litecoin (LTC) rose 3%, Pi Network (Pi) increased 4.2%, and PEPE saw a 3.6% bump. On the other hand, some analysts believe this correction might be a setup for the next big rally. An expert pointed to a similar situation in April 2024, when Bitcoin jumped 15% just 11 days after a conflict between Israel and Iran.

As of June 14, 2025, the crypto market shows mixed performance. Bitcoin is trading around $105,000, up slightly in the past 24 hours, but overall market sentiment remains cautious following recent dips. Why are cryptos down? Recent crypto declines, including Bitcoin‚Äôs fall, are largely attributed to escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, leading investors to move away from riskier assets. Is it still worth investing in crypto? Investing in crypto can still be worthwhile if you understand the high risks involved, as prices can be volatile. Many analysts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook for long-term growth. How are Altcoins performing during the crash? While Bitcoin saw a significant drop, some altcoins like Shiba Inu (+4%), Hyperliquid (+4.5%), Litecoin (+3%), Pi Network (+4.2%), and PEPE (+3.6%) have shown signs of recovery and are climbing.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-faces-190m-liquidation-but-signs-hint-at-upcoming-rally/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T11:35:24,"Michael Saylor Drops Explosive Bitcoin Prediction as Crypto Market Recovers","The post Michael Saylor Drops Explosive Bitcoin Prediction as Crypto Market Recovers appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin dropped hard . Then it bounced back and Michael Saylor was quick to make his point. After BTC plunged 4.33% to hit $103,660 before rebounding 2.35%, the MicroStrategy founder took to X with a message that lit up the crypto crowd: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not going to zero, it‚Äôs going to a million.‚Äù It‚Äôs not the first time Saylor has predicted Bitcoin at $1 million , but this time, the timing hit different. His comment came just as panic was setting in and it instantly reignited one of Bitcoin‚Äôs biggest questions: Are we still on the path to something massive? Let‚Äôs dig into what Saylor has to say. Crypto Community Reacts Saylor‚Äôs post drew quick replies from longtime Bitcoin supporters. Author Adam Livingston replied with his own ultra-bullish take, saying he expects Bitcoin to reach $13 million by 2045. Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back reminded followers of a wild play he once set up: a limit order to buy all 21 million BTC at 2 cents each. That bet, placed in 2020 with investor Alistair Milne, was cancelled, but it resurfaced in the conversation as Bitcoin volatility returned. $1million Bitcoin it is then, as it's not going to zero as I have a limit order at 2c/BTC for 21m BTC. Outbid @alistairmilne 's 1c with 2c/BTC 21mil BTC live order on @bitfinex . https://t.co/lcYBUnomYs ‚Äî Adam Back (@adam3us) June 14, 2025 MicroStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin Saylor has never been one for just talk. His company is still buying. Now rebranded as Strategy, the firm added 1,045 BTC for $110.02 million in its latest purchase. That brings Strategy‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC, currently valued at $63.85 billion. The company has also posted a solid return in 2025 so far, with its Bitcoin portfolio up 17.1% year-to-date. 8,000 Dormant BTC Moves, Eyes on Institutions On-chain data added to the buzz. A market analyst from CryptoQuant flagged that 8,000 BTC, untouched for 3 to 5 years, were suddenly moved from Coinbase Custody. That service is typically used by institutional investors, and the analyst believes the transfer could be tied to Strategy or spot Bitcoin ETFs. But for now, it looks like buying activity from these players may be on pause. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week‚Äôs Crypto News Highlights | 14 June, 2025 , $415M in BTC Longs Wiped Out The recent drop shook sentiment and it triggered heavy liquidations. $415 million worth of long positions were wiped, compared to just $28.69 million in shorts. That‚Äôs a 1,446% imbalance, pointing to how unprepared bullish traders were for the crash. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may have triggered the move, but the sharp recovery shows the market is still full of conviction, especially from names like Saylor. Bottom line: The market may be shaky, but Saylor isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs predicting a million-dollar Bitcoin and investing like it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T11:30:00,"Best Entry Points Right Now: What Smart Crypto Buyers Are Watching","If you are looking for the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025, you will have thousands of options from which to choose. It can overwhelm even experienced crypto investors. To make your journey easier, we will examine the most promising cryptocurrencies to help you make the right choice. In this article, we will discuss upcoming and promising projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and staples in the crypto sector. We will go into their features, downsides, and insights on current market trends. Whether you are a newbie to crypto or a seasoned crypto trader, this article will go a long way in clearing a path for you. Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) was the first true cryptocurrency in the world. Launched back in 2009 by an anonymous person, it has remained the top crypto project by market cap. In recent years, it has gained acceptance by leasing financial institutions and is now accepted by numerous merchants as a form of payment. Bitcoin (BTC) is used as a digital store of value by many of its holders, and accounts for a large chunk of the total market cap of the crypto sector. The main downside with Bitcoin (BTC) is that it is trading quite close to its highs. Even the most optimistic estimates forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could rise to $200,000 per coin. At the current price of around $107,000, that would represent gains of around 93% for its holders. While that might be impressive in any other sector, it is quite small in the crypto world. To get the huge 100x returns, the best strategy to use is to invest in crypto projects at the presale stage. These are projects whose true potential has not been explored by the crypto community, and they are poised for massive gains. One example of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in the presale phase, analysts forecast that it could rise to $3 per coin. At the current presale price of $0.03, that is easily a 10,000% gain. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency created by Ripple Labs back in 2012. It is designed to be a form of cross-border payments on the Ripple payment network. The main advantage that XRP offers users is fast speeds and low transaction costs. Unlike most other blockchain projects, XRP uses a distributed consensus ledger known as the XRP Ledger, which is maintained by validators. This ensures fast transactions and low fees. The XRP coin has become popular due to its high liquidity and potential for global transactions. The main downside to XRP is that its supply is highly controlled by Ripple Labs. As such, its price can be modulated by a central authority, disappointing holders. Additionally, Ripple Labs is a private for-profit entity that is duty-bound to make decisions that benefit its shareholders, and not XRP holders. Ripple Labs has also been engaged in lengthy legal disputes with the SEC, which could place its goal of replacing the SWIFT financial system in limbo. Overall, Ripple is not expected to make massive gains in the long term. For massive returns of double digits, your best option remains Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently in the presale, where each token is selling for $0.03. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for the current phase 5 of the presale have already been sold. The presale has raised over $10.6 million from eager investors, who number around 12,000 to date. In the upcoming phase 6 of the MUTM token presale, the price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That increase is expected to reduce the expected ROI based on the $0.06 listing price from 100% to 71.43%. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When lenders join a pool, they deposit their funds and start earning an annualized percentage yield. The interest rate that they earn on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. The borrowers who deposit their assets in the pools as collateral benefit from being able to park their assets while accessing their liquidity. That means they can engage in trades on the open market and benefit from market opportunities in real time. At the same time, they will retain full access to their assets. When the value of those assets goes up, they can simply repay their loan and enjoy the benefits of the increased value. To protect the users of the protocol, the project has been CertiK-audited and received a Token Scan Score of 80. Based on the result of the audit, the presale has seen a massive boost in participation. The interest is expected to rise even higher when the tokens go live, due to the planned release of the beta version of the platform. It will act as proof that the project has been working on the protocol behind the scenes, helping to boost the price of MUTM tokens on exchanges. With a beta version launch planned for day one of the token listing, this could boost the price of MUTM tokens to new highs. As such, purchasing the tokens now while the price is just $0.03 could lead to 100x or more returns based on the analysts‚Äô forecast of $3 per token. This is one opportunity you do not want to miss.

2025-06-14T11:22:59,"Trump's SEC scraps Gensler-era crypto regulation by enforcement proposals","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has withdrawn multiple anti-crypto rules proposed during the administration of its former chair, Gary Gensler. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal shared the development on X, noting that Rule 3b-16 and several others are now gone. Rule 3b-16 is meant to expand the definition of an ‚Äúexchange‚Äù to include DeFi protocols. This would have been possible due to the amendment defining an exchange to include ‚Äúsystems that offer the use of non-firm trading interest and communication protocols to bring together buyers and sellers of securities.‚Äù At the time, the proposal faced several pushbacks from the crypto community, with many calling for the regulator to remove the changes due to the impact it could have on crypto innovation. While the withdrawal is now happening under the new SEC Chair , Paul Atkins, talks of the SEC abandoning the rule have started since Gensler left the regulator. Former SEC acting chair Mark Uyeda noted a few months ago that he had advised the SEC staff to abandon part of the rule affecting crypto because the original proposal was meant to address alternative trading systems for the treasury markets. SEC withdraws crypto custody rules and others Meanwhile, the SEC also withdrew several other proposed rules , including those that are not necessarily impacting the crypto market. A major rescinded proposal was the Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets rule that increased custody requirements for crypto. Under the proposal, which would have applied to all investment advisers, firms must hold all client assets, including crypto, with a qualified custodian. This would have proven challenging for crypto investment firms, which usually hold cryptocurrencies in exchanges and wallets, entities that do not meet the criteria of qualified custodians. Uyeda was also involved in the efforts to withdraw this proposed rule, as he stated in a speech on March 17 that much of the public feedback the SEC got suggested concerns about the broad scope. Interestingly, he had earlier criticized some provisions in the rule as commissioner. He said then that the proposal could prevent an investment adviser from allocating funds to crypto. However, he still agreed with the need for rules to safeguard clients‚Äô assets and supported the proposal. Beyond this, the regulator also withdrew 12 other proposed rules apart from these two. Some of these rules could impact crypto entities, including the proposed rules requiring entities to report positions of large security-based swaps and another on cybersecurity risk management and reporting for investment firms. Other rescinded proposals include Prohibition against Undue Influence over Chief Compliance Officers, Amendments to 14a-8, which is the Process for Including Shareholders Proposals in the Company‚Äôs Proxy Statements, and the Enhanced Disclosure for ESG investments. US regulators continue to shift away from regulation by enforcement Meanwhile, the latest round of SEC decisions moves the agency from its regulatory approach under Gensler. It continues the rollback of several anti-crypto policies implemented or about to be implemented under the previous administration. It is not just the SEC that has rescinded or withdrawn rules or guidances since President Donald Trump was sworn in. Other federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Office of Comptroller of Currency, have also taken similar decisions. Unsurprisingly, many have praised the changes as a welcome development as efforts to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry continue in Congress. While more progress appears to have been made on the GENIUS stablecoin act , the market structure legislation is also advancing in the House. Perhaps in a big sign of the changing times, the financial watchdog recently announced that former global head of institutional markets at Blockchain.com, Jamie Selway will become the Director of Trading and Markets, showing that the agency is bringing those with crypto industry expertise into its fold.

2025-06-14T11:20:48,"Spot Ethereum ETF Sees Crucial Outflows After Inflow Streak","BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETF Sees Crucial Outflows After Inflow Streak Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and market watchers! For nearly three weeks, we‚Äôve seen consistent interest flowing into the brand-new US Spot Ethereum ETF products. It felt like a one-way street of accumulation. However, that streak has just been broken. What Happened with US Spot Ethereum ETF Flows on June 13? According to data shared by analyst Trader T on X, June 13 marked a notable shift for US Spot Ethereum ETF s. These investment vehicles experienced their first day of net outflows since they began trading. The total net outflow for the day came in at $2.18 million. While the amount might seem relatively small in the grand scheme of institutional finance, its significance lies in breaking a pattern. Prior to June 13, these ETFs had recorded 19 consecutive trading days of net inflows. This consistent buying pressure had been a positive signal for market sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Digging into the Specifics of the ETH ETF Outflows Looking closer at the individual fund performances on this day reveals a mixed picture: Fidelity‚Äôs (FETH): This fund saw the most significant movement, recording a net outflow of $8.85 million. This suggests some investors using the Fidelity product decided to exit their positions or reallocate funds. Grayscale‚Äôs (ETHE): In contrast to Fidelity, Grayscale‚Äôs Ethereum Trust, which converted into an ETF, actually saw a net inflow of $6.67 million. Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE often experiences different flow dynamics compared to the newer, lower-fee ETFs, sometimes seeing inflows as investors potentially move funds or take new positions. Other ETFs: The remaining US Ethereum ETF products tracked in this data showed no change in their holdings for the day. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the breakdown: ETF Ticker Fund Manager Net Flow (June 13) FETH Fidelity -$8.85 million ETHE Grayscale +$6.67 million Others Various $0 million Why Do Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Matter? Tracking ETF Outflows and inflows is crucial for understanding institutional and large-scale investor sentiment. While retail investors buy and sell crypto directly on exchanges, ETFs provide a regulated and often preferred avenue for traditional finance players, wealth managers, and even some retail investors within brokerage accounts. Consistent inflows signal strong buying interest and can provide underlying support for the price of the asset held by the ETF (in this case, Ethereum). Conversely, significant ETF Outflows can indicate profit-taking, a shift in sentiment, or reallocation of capital, potentially adding selling pressure or signaling caution. Breaking a 19-day inflow streak, even with a modest outflow figure, is noteworthy because it shows that the initial wave of accumulation might be pausing, or that some participants are already managing their positions actively. It reminds us that investment flows in any market, including the Crypto ETF space, are rarely linear and can change direction. Comparing ETH ETF Flows to Bitcoin ETFs: A Different Picture? It‚Äôs helpful to compare the early flow dynamics of the US Ethereum ETF s to their older siblings, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024. Bitcoin ETFs saw massive initial inflows, but also experienced significant outflows from Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC as investors rotated into newer, cheaper options or took profits. The ETH ETF launch has been somewhat different ‚Äì delayed, with less explosive initial inflows compared to Bitcoin, but a more consistent, albeit smaller, inflow trend over the past few weeks until this recent outflow day. This could be due to various factors, including differing market conditions at launch, investor familiarity, or the relative market cap size of ETH compared to BTC. What Could This Mean for the Future of the ETH ETF Market? One day of minor net ETF Outflows doesn‚Äôt necessarily signal a major reversal in trend. It could be a temporary pause, driven by specific large trades within Fidelity, or simply market noise. However, it does prompt investors to consider: Market Sentiment: Is this related to broader market conditions or recent price movements in Ethereum? Profit-Taking: Have some early investors in the ETFs decided to lock in gains after the recent price rally? Reallocation: Are funds being moved between different investment vehicles? Monitoring the flow data in the coming days will be essential to determine if this was an isolated event or the beginning of a period of more volatile flows for the ETH ETF market. Consistent, significant outflows would be a stronger signal of weakening institutional demand. Actionable Insights for Investors For those interested in or invested in Spot Ethereum ETF s or Ethereum itself, here are some takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on daily flow data from reliable sources. Look Beyond One Day: Don‚Äôt overreact to a single day‚Äôs data point. Look for trends over several days or weeks. Understand the Drivers: Consider what might be causing flows ‚Äì regulatory news, price volatility, macroeconomic factors. ETFs as Access: Remember that ETFs offer a regulated way to get exposure to Ethereum, which is a key benefit for many, despite flow fluctuations. Diversification: Flows are just one metric. Consider Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals, network development, and broader market trends as well. Concluding Thoughts: A Blip or a Trend Shift? The $2.18 million net outflow on June 13 is a crucial data point, primarily because it ended the consistent inflow streak for US Spot Ethereum ETF s. While small in value, it serves as a reminder that capital flows are dynamic. Whether this single day of ETF Outflows is just a minor blip or the start of a more volatile period for these nascent products remains to be seen. The market will be watching closely to see if inflows resume or if outflows become more frequent, providing further clues about institutional appetite for Ethereum exposure via ETFs.

2025-06-14T11:06:36,"Crypto Remittances in El Salvador Drop 45%","The post Crypto Remittances in El Salvador Drop 45% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News El Salvador is facing a major setback in its crypto experiment as crypto remittances have dropped by 45%, raising serious concerns about the country‚Äôs economic stability. The decline, triggered by recent Bitcoin volatility , could severely affect Salvadorans who rely on remittances as a primary source of income. El Salvador Sees Sharp Decline in Crypto Remittances According to official data , crypto remittances to El Salvador dropped by 44.5% in Q1 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This marks the first significant drop since the country adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 . Back in Q4 2021, crypto remittances peaked at $57 million through the Chivo Wallet. However, the number has now halved, with crypto inflows down to just $16 million so far in 2025. In 2024, the total was $28.83 million, averaging around $7 million per quarter through roughly 27,000 transactions. Crypto transfers now account for a mere 0.52% of the country‚Äôs $3 billion in total remittance inflows‚Äîa steep decline from previous years. Why Are Crypto Remittances Dropping in El Salvador? The plunge is largely attributed to Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility. Between January and May 2025, BTC fluctuated between $93,907 and $108,949, creating uncertainty and risk aversion among Salvadorans. Additionally, ongoing regulatory challenges and inconsistent market sentiment have contributed to the decline in crypto adoption for remittance purposes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses , Why El Salvador Backed Crypto Remittances in the First Place El Salvador has long promoted crypto as a way to boost the economy. The government supported the adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology to tap into the $7 billion Central American remittance market. By integrating crypto into remittance channels, the goal was to reduce dependence on traditional services like Western Union and cut high transaction fees, allowing more money to reach families in need. However, despite these intentions, the current decline signals a failure to achieve meaningful adoption at scale. Consequences of Crypto Remittance Decline The falling numbers could have serious economic repercussions. A significant drop in crypto remittance inflows may impact: GDP growth Foreign exchange reserves Balance of payments Still, there‚Äôs some optimism. Digital remittances overall are projected to reach $148.39 million in 2025, an increase from 2024, indicating potential growth in non-crypto digital transfers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T11:05:42,"Brazil's M√©liuz raising $32M for fresh Bitcoin purchase","Brazilian firm M√©liuz has raised about $180 million reais ($32 million) in a follow-on share offering aimed at obtaining funds to purchase Bitcoin. According to its recent filing, M√©liuz said that the offering was priced at 7.06 reais per share, a 5% discount over its closing price on Thursday. This decision by the prominent company in Brazil showcases the growing interest from traditional businesses in adding digital assets to their balance sheet management and investment. According to M√©liuz, the funds raised will be used to acquire more Bitcoin, with the company already holding about 320.25 BTC from its previous foray into the market. The decision to raise capital to purchase Bitcoin shows a strong conviction in the long-term value of the digital asset. M√©liuz raises funds to purchase Bitcoin Several factors would have influenced M√©liuz‚Äôs choice of pursuing a strategic investment in the asset, with Bitcoin currently seen as a hedge against inflation due to its capped supply. Its characteristics as a decentralized and immutable digital asset appeal to corporations seeking a store of value outside the traditional financial systems. Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury is also a form of diversification from traditional securities and currencies. As a fintech firm, M√©liuz‚Äôs customer base is tech-savvy and interested in digital assets, making the move in line with the company‚Äôs brand and future offerings. Despite the volatility in the crypto market, the growth potential of Bitcoin is one of the key drivers of its adoption by corporations. For context, Bitcoin has grown steadily since its creation, moving from being sold for cents to over a hundred thousand dollars. The digital asset has also influenced the creation of other assets, making the crypto sector one of the most successful since its creation. The move to purchase more Bitcoin came earlier this year when the company launched a new strategy allowing it to allocate cash reserves in the cryptocurrency. The move saw the company label itself ‚Äúthe first Bitcoin treasury company‚Äù in Brazil. It is also expected to strengthen the company‚Äôs balance sheet, seeing that the appreciation in the price of the asset over the next few years can put it in a better financial standing compared to most of its peers. Aside from investors, the company is also expected to increase its user base and lead the fintech sector in Brazil. Crypto literacy in Latin America is on the rise Brazil has emerged as an important player in the Latin American cryptocurrency market. While regulatory clarity is improving, the country has also seen increased public interest in the sector. M√©liuz is also following that trend, which has seen a wider interest in digital asset investment and adoption among individuals and corporations. Meanwhile, M√©liuz is not the only corporation accumulating Bitcoin, with firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet also accumulating the digital asset. Days ago, Strategy announced the purchase of 1,045 BTC at $110.2 million, with each token costing about $105k. The move pushed the company‚Äôs total Bitcoin stash to 582,000, with an average purchase price of $70,086. The move by Strategy and other corporations to purchase BTC has influenced others, with more companies starting to add minimal Bitcoin to their treasuries. According to reports, about 26 companies hold more than 1,000 BTC in their treasuries, with seven holding 10,000 or more. In the past week, five companies have also purchased more BTC, using the announcement to boost their social media presence.

The approval comes only a few weeks after Trump Media confirmed a $2.3 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. SEC Declares Trump Media Bitcoin Treasury Registration Effective Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the Truth Social platform and is partially owned by President Trump , has received approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its registration statement regarding its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal. According to a June 13 SEC filing, the market regulator ‚Äúdeclared effective‚Äù Trump Media‚Äôs S-3 registration statement, filed on June 6. The S-3 form is used by US companies to register for the sale of securities like stocks, options, and different types of debt. Trump Media filed a corresponding prospectus with the SEC on the same day. An Aggressive Expansion According to the SEC filing, Trump Media registered the resale of 56 million shares and 20 million more tied to convertible notes as part of debt and equity agreements with around 50 investors, yielding $2.3 billion. The registration statement includes a universal shelf, giving the company greater flexibility for its future growth plans. However, Trump Media does not have any immediate plans to issue any securities under it. Trump Media CEO and President Devin Nunes said the company plans to expand its offerings and capabilities aggressively. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aggressively implementing our plans to expand the company, our offerings, and our capabilities. By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.‚Äù The approval comes weeks after the company confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin after strong denials of the raise. Nunes had stated at the time, ‚ÄúBitcoin is an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.‚Äù Is A Spot Bitcoin ETF In The Works? Trump Media had also filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF on June 5.

2025-06-14T10:50:38,"Altcoin Season Index: Crucial Insight into the Current Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index: Crucial Insight into the Current Bitcoin Season Are you watching the crypto market closely, wondering whether it‚Äôs time for altcoins to shine or if Bitcoin still holds the reins? A key indicator for this is the Altcoin Season Index. This metric offers valuable insight into the current market dynamics, helping investors understand whether Bitcoin or the broader altcoin market is leading the charge. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by reputable platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a simple yet powerful tool for gauging market sentiment and performance trends. It provides a snapshot of how altcoins are performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what the index measures: Top 100 Coins: It focuses on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CMC. 90-Day Performance: The index looks at the performance of these coins over the past 90 days. Relative to Bitcoin: The core comparison is how many of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance during that 90-day window. Exclusions: Importantly, the index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, as their price movements don‚Äôt reflect speculative market trends in the same way as volatile cryptocurrencies. The index is presented as a score ranging from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season: What‚Äôs the Difference? The Altcoin Season Index helps define two distinct phases within the crypto market cycle: Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season. Here‚Äôs how the index scores relate to these seasons: Index Score Range Market Phase Condition Met Key Characteristic 75 ‚Äì 100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Broad rallies across many altcoins, often leading to significant gains relative to BTC. 1 ‚Äì 25 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin tends to perform strongly, either gaining value while altcoins lag or holding value better during downturns. 26 ‚Äì 74 Neither The market is in a transitional or mixed phase, not meeting the criteria for either defined season. Performance is mixed; some altcoins may do well, others may not, or the market is consolidating. Understanding which season the market is in can significantly impact investment strategies. During Bitcoin Season, focusing primarily on Bitcoin or stable assets might be prudent, while Altcoin Season often presents opportunities for higher potential returns (along with higher risk) in smaller cap coins. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Currently at 27? As of June 14, 2024, at 00:31 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered 27. This figure, up slightly from the previous day, firmly places the crypto market in Bitcoin Season. An index value of 27 means that only a small percentage (between 25% and 27%) of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This indicates that Bitcoin‚Äôs Bitcoin performance has been relatively stronger than most altcoins over the past three months. Several factors could contribute to this: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of broader economic uncertainty, investors often flock to perceived safer assets. Within crypto, Bitcoin is typically seen as the most established and secure asset, sometimes referred to as ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô. Institutional Flows: The approval and success of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in various regions have led to significant institutional capital flowing directly into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its price and relative performance compared to altcoins which lack similar investment vehicles. Post-Halving Dynamics: While the Bitcoin halving event often precedes broader market rallies, the immediate period after can sometimes see Bitcoin consolidating or leading before capital rotates into altcoins. Dominance Cycles: The crypto market naturally goes through cycles where Bitcoin dominance (its market cap relative to the total crypto market cap) fluctuates. High dominance often correlates with Bitcoin Season. The current index value is a clear signal that, on average, altcoins are not keeping pace with Bitcoin‚Äôs gains (or holding up as well during dips) over the recent 90-day period. Navigating the Market During Bitcoin Season Being in Bitcoin Season doesn‚Äôt mean altcoins are a guaranteed bad investment, but it does suggest a shift in market dynamics. Here are some considerations for investors: Focus on Bitcoin: This might be a period where simply holding or accumulating Bitcoin yields better relative results than diversifying heavily into altcoins. Selective Altcoin Investing: Instead of broad altcoin exposure, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts (like major upgrades or partnerships), or those showing resilience against the general trend. Research is paramount. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. During Bitcoin Season, they can experience sharper downturns if Bitcoin corrects. Employ stricter risk management strategies, such as smaller position sizes or stop-loss orders. Accumulation Opportunities: For long-term holders, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate promising altcoins at lower prices relative to BTC. Watch for Shifts: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other indicators (like Bitcoin dominance) for signs that the market dynamics might be shifting back towards altcoins. The current Bitcoin performance relative to altcoins highlights the importance of adapting strategies to the prevailing market conditions. What Triggers a Shift Back to Altcoin Season? While the market is currently in Bitcoin Season, cycles are inherent to crypto. A shift back towards Altcoin Season is likely at some point. What could trigger this rotation? Sustained Bitcoin Rally Followed by Consolidation: Often, a strong Bitcoin rally captures market attention and draws in new capital. If Bitcoin then enters a period of consolidation or slower growth, this capital can rotate into altcoins seeking higher potential returns. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A falling Bitcoin dominance chart is a classic indicator that altcoins are starting to gain market share and outperform BTC. Major Altcoin Narratives: The emergence of strong, compelling narratives around specific sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI in crypto) can drive significant capital into those altcoins, leading the broader market. Improved Macro Sentiment: A more favorable global economic outlook can increase investor appetite for riskier assets, including altcoins. Technological Milestones: Successful network upgrades (like Ethereum‚Äôs transitions) or major developments in other prominent altcoin ecosystems can attract investment and boost performance. Monitoring these potential catalysts, alongside the Altcoin Season Index, is crucial for identifying when the tide might be turning. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 27 provides a clear, data-driven perspective on the current state of the crypto market: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season. This means that over the past 90 days, Bitcoin‚Äôs Bitcoin performance has outpaced the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins. This phase isn‚Äôt a signal to abandon altcoins entirely, but rather to approach the market with awareness. Strategies may need to shift towards potentially higher Bitcoin exposure, more selective altcoin investments based on strong fundamentals, and rigorous risk management. While Bitcoin Season prevails, the dynamic nature of the crypto market means that the conditions for Altcoin Season will eventually emerge again. Staying informed about key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index and understanding the underlying market drivers are essential for navigating these cycles successfully and making informed investment decisions.
