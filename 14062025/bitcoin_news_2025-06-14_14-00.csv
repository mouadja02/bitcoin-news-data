2025-06-14T11:50:13,"Solana ETF Hopes Rise, But Approval Unlikely Next Week, Say Analysts","Seven asset managers submitted filings for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, signaling growing momentum for altcoin ETFs. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart cautioned that a swift approval is unlikely, despite optimism from market participants. In a post on X, Seyffart noted that there needs to be a regulatory back-and-forth before any green light. “If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch,” he wrote. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were eventually approved in January 2024, over a decade after the first application by Gemini’s Winklevoss twins in 2013. All Eyes on Staking Language in Solana Filings The filings from major players—Fidelity Investments, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck—all include language around staking, which has become a key area of regulatory focus. Fidelity submitted a new S-1 form, while others amended earlier filings. VanEck, which initiated the first U.S. Solana ETF application in early June 2024, submitted its amended version last. Seyffart confirmed , “All of them include staking language, I believe.” While experience with prior Bitcoin and Ether ETF approvals could help speed up procedural elements, he emphasized that staking remains an unresolved issue with no precedent yet set. The SEC is also reviewing proposals to add staking features to already-approved spot Ether ETFs. Staking, which allows holders of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum to earn rewards, has raised questions about whether it constitutes a securities offering—a gray area that regulators have yet to define clearly. SOL, ETH ETFs Could See Staking Decisions Together Seyffart speculated that both Solana and Ether ETFs could potentially receive staking approvals simultaneously. “They could theoretically be launched with staking at the same time,” he said, while clarifying he has “no insight into what will actually happen.” Bloomberg Intelligence raised its estimate for Solana ETF approval in 2025 to 90% back in April. Meanwhile, in January, Consensys founder Joe Lubin expressed optimism that staking features for Ether ETFs could be authorized “soon.” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added to the excitement, suggesting an “altcoin ETF summer” could be on the horizon, with Solana poised to take the lead.

2025-06-14T11:40:55,"US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: Funds Record Fifth Consecutive Day of Strong Net Inflows Totalling $301.7M","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: Funds Record Fifth Consecutive Day of Strong Net Inflows Totalling $301.7M Are you watching the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed the growing excitement around US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These investment vehicles have become a significant gateway for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The latest data reveals a truly encouraging trend that speaks volumes about the current market sentiment and the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Continue Strong Streak According to recent data from Farside Investors, June 13th marked a notable day for the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market. These funds collectively saw a substantial net inflow totaling $301.7 million . What makes this figure particularly significant is that it represents the fifth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have experienced net positive inflows. This consistent buying pressure is a key indicator that investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated products remains robust. Understanding net inflows is crucial. It means that on this particular day, the total amount of money flowing into these ETFs from new investments or purchases of shares exceeded the amount flowing out from redemptions or sales of shares. A streak of consecutive net inflows suggests sustained positive sentiment and accumulation rather than fleeting interest. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Contributions While the overall figure is impressive, looking at the individual performance of the various US Spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here’s a breakdown of the top contributors on June 13th: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a massive $239 million in net inflows. This continues BlackRock’s dominance in attracting capital into the Bitcoin space via their ETF product. Fidelity’s FBTC: Following BlackRock, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw healthy net inflows of $25.2 million . Fidelity has consistently been one of the strongest performers alongside BlackRock since the ETFs launched. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added $14.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating steady interest in their offering. Grayscale’s GBTC: In a significant shift from earlier trends, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded net inflows of $9.1 million . For months after the conversion to an ETF, GBTC experienced significant outflows, largely due to its higher fees compared to competitors. Recent inflows suggest that this selling pressure may be easing, and some investors might even be re-entering or finding value in GBTC. Grayscale’s BTC (Mini): Grayscale’s new, lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) also saw inflows, bringing in $7.5 million . This new fund is designed to offer a more competitive fee structure. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) rounded out the list of positive contributors with $6 million in net inflows. It’s worth noting that data for ARK 21Shares’ ARKB was not yet available at the time of the report. The remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked by Farside Investors showed no change in their holdings for the day. What Does This Streak of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Signify? The consistent inflow trend, particularly the five-day streak, is a powerful signal for the market. Here’s why it matters: Sustained Demand: It indicates that the demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated, accessible products is not a one-off event but a sustained trend. Institutional Interest: While retail investors certainly participate, the significant amounts flowing into funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC are often attributed to larger institutions, wealth managers, and financial advisors allocating capital on behalf of their clients. This suggests increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Market Validation: The success and continued growth of these ETFs provide further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset in traditional financial circles. Potential Price Impact: While not the only factor, consistent net inflows represent buying pressure on Bitcoin itself, as ETF issuers purchase BTC to back the new shares being created. This can contribute positively to Bitcoin’s price performance over time. Easing GBTC Pressure: The fact that GBTC is now seeing inflows, even modest ones, suggests that the large selling pressure from that fund, which weighed on the market for a period, may be subsiding. This period contrasts with earlier phases following the January launch, where initial euphoria was followed by some volatility and periods of net outflows, particularly from GBTC. The current streak suggests a more stable and growing base of demand. The Broader Context: Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape The success of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is also influencing the broader Cryptocurrency ETF landscape. It highlights the demand for regulated crypto investment products and could pave the way for other single-asset or basket crypto ETFs in the future, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared. Investors are clearly looking for familiar, regulated wrappers to access the potential upside of the crypto market. While the focus is currently on Bitcoin, the infrastructure and investor comfort level being built by these products could eventually benefit other digital assets seeking ETF approval. What’s Next? Keeping an Eye on the Data For investors and market watchers, monitoring the daily inflow and outflow data for these US Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains a crucial activity. Continued strong inflows would likely be interpreted as a bullish signal for Bitcoin and reflect ongoing demand from traditional finance. Conversely, a return to significant outflows could indicate shifting sentiment or macroeconomic pressures. Other factors to watch include regulatory developments, changes in global economic conditions, and significant price movements in Bitcoin itself, all of which can influence ETF flows. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive trend, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, remains volatile. ETF flows can change direction quickly. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact demand for these products. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The streak of five consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the $301.7 million figure on June 13th, is a powerful indicator of growing confidence and sustained demand for Bitcoin via the US Spot Bitcoin ETF structure. Led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, these funds are successfully bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. The data suggests that institutional adoption is not just a buzzword but a tangible trend driving significant capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem. As these inflows continue, they provide a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s position as a recognized and increasingly accepted investment asset.

Bitcoin fell hard yesterday, due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions triggered in the Middle East. Some altcoins are showing signs of life, short sellers are being wiped out, and analysts believe a bounce could be coming. So, is this the start of a comeback? Bitcoin Crashes Amid Global Tension On one of the worst days this June, Bitcoin dropped nearly 4%, crashing to around $102,664. This drop was mainly due to rising tensions in the Middle East, which triggered panic across markets. As a result, the crypto space saw over $1 billion in leveraged positions wiped out in just one day. But within 24 hours, things began to change. While the market is still shaky, many coins have started to rise again. Short Traders Take the Bigger Hit Today, another $190.25 million in leveraged trades were liquidated. But this time, short positions took the bigger hit, losing $107 million, while long positions saw losses of $83.1 million. In the meantime, when short trades were liquidated, traders rushed to buy back their positions, which pushed prices higher. That’s exactly what happened today. In the last 24 hours, over 58,000 traders were liquidated, with the total losses hitting $191.32 million. The largest single liquidation was worth $6.26 million on Binance, involving Bitcoin. Altcoins and Memecoins Start to Move While Bitcoin is still settling, some altcoins and meme tokens are quietly climbing. Shiba Inu gained 4% , Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped 4.5%, Litecoin (LTC) rose 3%, Pi Network (Pi) increased 4.2%, and PEPE saw a 3.6% bump. On the other hand, some analysts believe this correction might be a setup for the next big rally. An expert pointed to a similar situation in April 2024, when Bitcoin jumped 15% just 11 days after a conflict between Israel and Iran. Two months later, it had surged 48%.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-faces-190m-liquidation-but-signs-hint-at-upcoming-rally/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T11:35:24,"Michael Saylor Drops Explosive Bitcoin Prediction as Crypto Market Recovers","The post Michael Saylor Drops Explosive Bitcoin Prediction as Crypto Market Recovers appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin dropped hard . Then it bounced back and Michael Saylor was quick to make his point. After BTC plunged 4.33% to hit $103,660 before rebounding 2.35%, the MicroStrategy founder took to X with a message that lit up the crypto crowd: “If it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million.” It’s not the first time Saylor has predicted Bitcoin at $1 million , but this time, the timing hit different. His comment came just as panic was setting in and it instantly reignited one of Bitcoin’s biggest questions: Are we still on the path to something massive? Let’s dig into what Saylor has to say. Crypto Community Reacts Saylor’s post drew quick replies from longtime Bitcoin supporters. Author Adam Livingston replied with his own ultra-bullish take, saying he expects Bitcoin to reach $13 million by 2045. Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back reminded followers of a wild play he once set up: a limit order to buy all 21 million BTC at 2 cents each. That bet, placed in 2020 with investor Alistair Milne, was cancelled, but it resurfaced in the conversation as Bitcoin volatility returned. $1million Bitcoin it is then, as it's not going to zero as I have a limit order at 2c/BTC for 21m BTC. Outbid @alistairmilne 's 1c with 2c/BTC 21mil BTC live order on @bitfinex . https://t.co/lcYBUnomYs — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 14, 2025 MicroStrategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin Saylor has never been one for just talk. His company is still buying. Now rebranded as Strategy, the firm added 1,045 BTC for $110.02 million in its latest purchase. That brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC, currently valued at $63.85 billion. The company has also posted a solid return in 2025 so far, with its Bitcoin portfolio up 17.1% year-to-date. 8,000 Dormant BTC Moves, Eyes on Institutions On-chain data added to the buzz. A market analyst from CryptoQuant flagged that 8,000 BTC, untouched for 3 to 5 years, were suddenly moved from Coinbase Custody. That service is typically used by institutional investors, and the analyst believes the transfer could be tied to Strategy or spot Bitcoin ETFs. But for now, it looks like buying activity from these players may be on pause. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 14 June, 2025 , $415M in BTC Longs Wiped Out The recent drop shook sentiment and it triggered heavy liquidations. $415 million worth of long positions were wiped, compared to just $28.69 million in shorts. That’s a 1,446% imbalance, pointing to how unprepared bullish traders were for the crash. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East may have triggered the move, but the sharp recovery shows the market is still full of conviction, especially from names like Saylor. Bottom line: The market may be shaky, but Saylor isn’t. He’s predicting a million-dollar Bitcoin and investing like it. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T11:30:00,"Best Entry Points Right Now: What Smart Crypto Buyers Are Watching","If you are looking for the best cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025, you will have thousands of options from which to choose. It can overwhelm even experienced crypto investors. To make your journey easier, we will examine the most promising cryptocurrencies to help you make the right choice. In this article, we will discuss upcoming and promising projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and staples in the crypto sector. We will go into their features, downsides, and insights on current market trends. Whether you are a newbie to crypto or a seasoned crypto trader, this article will go a long way in clearing a path for you. Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) was the first true cryptocurrency in the world. Launched back in 2009 by an anonymous person, it has remained the top crypto project by market cap. In recent years, it has gained acceptance by leasing financial institutions and is now accepted by numerous merchants as a form of payment. Bitcoin (BTC) is used as a digital store of value by many of its holders, and accounts for a large chunk of the total market cap of the crypto sector. The main downside with Bitcoin (BTC) is that it is trading quite close to its highs. Even the most optimistic estimates forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could rise to $200,000 per coin. At the current price of around $107,000, that would represent gains of around 93% for its holders. While that might be impressive in any other sector, it is quite small in the crypto world. To get the huge 100x returns, the best strategy to use is to invest in crypto projects at the presale stage. These are projects whose true potential has not been explored by the crypto community, and they are poised for massive gains. One example of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in the presale phase, analysts forecast that it could rise to $3 per coin. At the current presale price of $0.03, that is easily a 10,000% gain. XRP XRP is a cryptocurrency created by Ripple Labs back in 2012. It is designed to be a form of cross-border payments on the Ripple payment network. The main advantage that XRP offers users is fast speeds and low transaction costs. Unlike most other blockchain projects, XRP uses a distributed consensus ledger known as the XRP Ledger, which is maintained by validators. This ensures fast transactions and low fees. The XRP coin has become popular due to its high liquidity and potential for global transactions. The main downside to XRP is that its supply is highly controlled by Ripple Labs. As such, its price can be modulated by a central authority, disappointing holders. Additionally, Ripple Labs is a private for-profit entity that is duty-bound to make decisions that benefit its shareholders, and not XRP holders. Ripple Labs has also been engaged in lengthy legal disputes with the SEC, which could place its goal of replacing the SWIFT financial system in limbo. Overall, Ripple is not expected to make massive gains in the long term. For massive returns of double digits, your best option remains Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently in the presale, where each token is selling for $0.03. So far, over 35% of the tokens set aside for the current phase 5 of the presale have already been sold. The presale has raised over $10.6 million from eager investors, who number around 12,000 to date. In the upcoming phase 6 of the MUTM token presale, the price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That increase is expected to reduce the expected ROI based on the $0.06 listing price from 100% to 71.43%. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When lenders join a pool, they deposit their funds and start earning an annualized percentage yield. The interest rate that they earn on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. The borrowers who deposit their assets in the pools as collateral benefit from being able to park their assets while accessing their liquidity. That means they can engage in trades on the open market and benefit from market opportunities in real time. At the same time, they will retain full access to their assets. When the value of those assets goes up, they can simply repay their loan and enjoy the benefits of the increased value. To protect the users of the protocol, the project has been CertiK-audited and received a Token Scan Score of 80. Based on the result of the audit, the presale has seen a massive boost in participation. The interest is expected to rise even higher when the tokens go live, due to the planned release of the beta version of the platform. It will act as proof that the project has been working on the protocol behind the scenes, helping to boost the price of MUTM tokens on exchanges. With a beta version launch planned for day one of the token listing, this could boost the price of MUTM tokens to new highs. As such, purchasing the tokens now while the price is just $0.03 could lead to 100x or more returns based on the analysts’ forecast of $3 per token. This is one opportunity you do not want to miss.

2025-06-14T11:22:59,"Trump's SEC scraps Gensler-era crypto regulation by enforcement proposals","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has withdrawn multiple anti-crypto rules proposed during the administration of its former chair, Gary Gensler. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal shared the development on X, noting that Rule 3b-16 and several others are now gone. Rule 3b-16 is meant to expand the definition of an “exchange” to include DeFi protocols. This would have been possible due to the amendment defining an exchange to include “systems that offer the use of non-firm trading interest and communication protocols to bring together buyers and sellers of securities.” At the time, the proposal faced several pushbacks from the crypto community, with many calling for the regulator to remove the changes due to the impact it could have on crypto innovation. While the withdrawal is now happening under the new SEC Chair , Paul Atkins, talks of the SEC abandoning the rule have started since Gensler left the regulator. Former SEC acting chair Mark Uyeda noted a few months ago that he had advised the SEC staff to abandon part of the rule affecting crypto because the original proposal was meant to address alternative trading systems for the treasury markets. SEC withdraws crypto custody rules and others Meanwhile, the SEC also withdrew several other proposed rules , including those that are not necessarily impacting the crypto market. A major rescinded proposal was the Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets rule that increased custody requirements for crypto. Under the proposal, which would have applied to all investment advisers, firms must hold all client assets, including crypto, with a qualified custodian. This would have proven challenging for crypto investment firms, which usually hold cryptocurrencies in exchanges and wallets, entities that do not meet the criteria of qualified custodians. Uyeda was also involved in the efforts to withdraw this proposed rule, as he stated in a speech on March 17 that much of the public feedback the SEC got suggested concerns about the broad scope. Interestingly, he had earlier criticized some provisions in the rule as commissioner. He said then that the proposal could prevent an investment adviser from allocating funds to crypto. However, he still agreed with the need for rules to safeguard clients’ assets and supported the proposal. Beyond this, the regulator also withdrew 12 other proposed rules apart from these two. Some of these rules could impact crypto entities, including the proposed rules requiring entities to report positions of large security-based swaps and another on cybersecurity risk management and reporting for investment firms. Other rescinded proposals include Prohibition against Undue Influence over Chief Compliance Officers, Amendments to 14a-8, which is the Process for Including Shareholders Proposals in the Company’s Proxy Statements, and the Enhanced Disclosure for ESG investments. US regulators continue to shift away from regulation by enforcement Meanwhile, the latest round of SEC decisions moves the agency from its regulatory approach under Gensler. It continues the rollback of several anti-crypto policies implemented or about to be implemented under the previous administration. It is not just the SEC that has rescinded or withdrawn rules or guidances since President Donald Trump was sworn in. Other federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Office of Comptroller of Currency, have also taken similar decisions. Unsurprisingly, many have praised the changes as a welcome development as efforts to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry continue in Congress. While more progress appears to have been made on the GENIUS stablecoin act , the market structure legislation is also advancing in the House. Perhaps in a big sign of the changing times, the financial watchdog recently announced that former global head of institutional markets at Blockchain.com, Jamie Selway will become the Director of Trading and Markets, showing that the agency is bringing those with crypto industry expertise into its fold.

2025-06-14T11:20:48,"Spot Ethereum ETF Sees Crucial Outflows After Inflow Streak","BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETF Sees Crucial Outflows After Inflow Streak Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and market watchers! For nearly three weeks, we’ve seen consistent interest flowing into the brand-new US Spot Ethereum ETF products. It felt like a one-way street of accumulation. However, that streak has just been broken. What Happened with US Spot Ethereum ETF Flows on June 13? According to data shared by analyst Trader T on X, June 13 marked a notable shift for US Spot Ethereum ETF s. These investment vehicles experienced their first day of net outflows since they began trading. The total net outflow for the day came in at $2.18 million. While the amount might seem relatively small in the grand scheme of institutional finance, its significance lies in breaking a pattern. Prior to June 13, these ETFs had recorded 19 consecutive trading days of net inflows. This consistent buying pressure had been a positive signal for market sentiment surrounding Ethereum. Digging into the Specifics of the ETH ETF Outflows Looking closer at the individual fund performances on this day reveals a mixed picture: Fidelity’s (FETH): This fund saw the most significant movement, recording a net outflow of $8.85 million. This suggests some investors using the Fidelity product decided to exit their positions or reallocate funds. Grayscale’s (ETHE): In contrast to Fidelity, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, which converted into an ETF, actually saw a net inflow of $6.67 million. Grayscale’s ETHE often experiences different flow dynamics compared to the newer, lower-fee ETFs, sometimes seeing inflows as investors potentially move funds or take new positions. Other ETFs: The remaining US Ethereum ETF products tracked in this data showed no change in their holdings for the day. Here’s a quick look at the breakdown: ETF Ticker Fund Manager Net Flow (June 13) FETH Fidelity -$8.85 million ETHE Grayscale +$6.67 million Others Various $0 million Why Do Spot Ethereum ETF Outflows Matter? Tracking ETF Outflows and inflows is crucial for understanding institutional and large-scale investor sentiment. While retail investors buy and sell crypto directly on exchanges, ETFs provide a regulated and often preferred avenue for traditional finance players, wealth managers, and even some retail investors within brokerage accounts. Consistent inflows signal strong buying interest and can provide underlying support for the price of the asset held by the ETF (in this case, Ethereum). Conversely, significant ETF Outflows can indicate profit-taking, a shift in sentiment, or reallocation of capital, potentially adding selling pressure or signaling caution. Breaking a 19-day inflow streak, even with a modest outflow figure, is noteworthy because it shows that the initial wave of accumulation might be pausing, or that some participants are already managing their positions actively. It reminds us that investment flows in any market, including the Crypto ETF space, are rarely linear and can change direction. Comparing ETH ETF Flows to Bitcoin ETFs: A Different Picture? It’s helpful to compare the early flow dynamics of the US Ethereum ETF s to their older siblings, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024. Bitcoin ETFs saw massive initial inflows, but also experienced significant outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC as investors rotated into newer, cheaper options or took profits. The ETH ETF launch has been somewhat different – delayed, with less explosive initial inflows compared to Bitcoin, but a more consistent, albeit smaller, inflow trend over the past few weeks until this recent outflow day. This could be due to various factors, including differing market conditions at launch, investor familiarity, or the relative market cap size of ETH compared to BTC. What Could This Mean for the Future of the ETH ETF Market? One day of minor net ETF Outflows doesn’t necessarily signal a major reversal in trend. It could be a temporary pause, driven by specific large trades within Fidelity, or simply market noise. However, it does prompt investors to consider: Market Sentiment: Is this related to broader market conditions or recent price movements in Ethereum? Profit-Taking: Have some early investors in the ETFs decided to lock in gains after the recent price rally? Reallocation: Are funds being moved between different investment vehicles? Monitoring the flow data in the coming days will be essential to determine if this was an isolated event or the beginning of a period of more volatile flows for the ETH ETF market. Consistent, significant outflows would be a stronger signal of weakening institutional demand. Actionable Insights for Investors For those interested in or invested in Spot Ethereum ETF s or Ethereum itself, here are some takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on daily flow data from reliable sources. Look Beyond One Day: Don’t overreact to a single day’s data point. Look for trends over several days or weeks. Understand the Drivers: Consider what might be causing flows – regulatory news, price volatility, macroeconomic factors. ETFs as Access: Remember that ETFs offer a regulated way to get exposure to Ethereum, which is a key benefit for many, despite flow fluctuations. Diversification: Flows are just one metric. Consider Ethereum’s fundamentals, network development, and broader market trends as well. Concluding Thoughts: A Blip or a Trend Shift? The $2.18 million net outflow on June 13 is a crucial data point, primarily because it ended the consistent inflow streak for US Spot Ethereum ETF s. While small in value, it serves as a reminder that capital flows are dynamic. Whether this single day of ETF Outflows is just a minor blip or the start of a more volatile period for these nascent products remains to be seen. The market will be watching closely to see if inflows resume or if outflows become more frequent, providing further clues about institutional appetite for Ethereum exposure via ETFs.

2025-06-14T11:06:36,"Crypto Remittances in El Salvador Drop 45%","The post Crypto Remittances in El Salvador Drop 45% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News El Salvador is facing a major setback in its crypto experiment as crypto remittances have dropped by 45%, raising serious concerns about the country’s economic stability. The decline, triggered by recent Bitcoin volatility , could severely affect Salvadorans who rely on remittances as a primary source of income. El Salvador Sees Sharp Decline in Crypto Remittances According to official data , crypto remittances to El Salvador dropped by 44.5% in Q1 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This marks the first significant drop since the country adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 . Back in Q4 2021, crypto remittances peaked at $57 million through the Chivo Wallet. However, the number has now halved, with crypto inflows down to just $16 million so far in 2025. In 2024, the total was $28.83 million, averaging around $7 million per quarter through roughly 27,000 transactions. Crypto transfers now account for a mere 0.52% of the country’s $3 billion in total remittance inflows—a steep decline from previous years. Why Are Crypto Remittances Dropping in El Salvador? The plunge is largely attributed to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Between January and May 2025, BTC fluctuated between $93,907 and $108,949, creating uncertainty and risk aversion among Salvadorans. Additionally, ongoing regulatory challenges and inconsistent market sentiment have contributed to the decline in crypto adoption for remittance purposes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses , Why El Salvador Backed Crypto Remittances in the First Place El Salvador has long promoted crypto as a way to boost the economy. The government supported the adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology to tap into the $7 billion Central American remittance market. By integrating crypto into remittance channels, the goal was to reduce dependence on traditional services like Western Union and cut high transaction fees, allowing more money to reach families in need. However, despite these intentions, the current decline signals a failure to achieve meaningful adoption at scale. Consequences of Crypto Remittance Decline The falling numbers could have serious economic repercussions. A significant drop in crypto remittance inflows may impact: GDP growth Foreign exchange reserves Balance of payments Still, there’s some optimism. Digital remittances overall are projected to reach $148.39 million in 2025, an increase from 2024, indicating potential growth in non-crypto digital transfers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T11:05:42,"Brazil's Méliuz raising $32M for fresh Bitcoin purchase","Brazilian firm Méliuz has raised about $180 million reais ($32 million) in a follow-on share offering aimed at obtaining funds to purchase Bitcoin. According to its recent filing, Méliuz said that the offering was priced at 7.06 reais per share, a 5% discount over its closing price on Thursday. This decision by the prominent company in Brazil showcases the growing interest from traditional businesses in adding digital assets to their balance sheet management and investment. According to Méliuz, the funds raised will be used to acquire more Bitcoin, with the company already holding about 320.25 BTC from its previous foray into the market. The decision to raise capital to purchase Bitcoin shows a strong conviction in the long-term value of the digital asset. Méliuz raises funds to purchase Bitcoin Several factors would have influenced Méliuz’s choice of pursuing a strategic investment in the asset, with Bitcoin currently seen as a hedge against inflation due to its capped supply. Its characteristics as a decentralized and immutable digital asset appeal to corporations seeking a store of value outside the traditional financial systems. Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury is also a form of diversification from traditional securities and currencies. As a fintech firm, Méliuz’s customer base is tech-savvy and interested in digital assets, making the move in line with the company’s brand and future offerings. Despite the volatility in the crypto market, the growth potential of Bitcoin is one of the key drivers of its adoption by corporations. For context, Bitcoin has grown steadily since its creation, moving from being sold for cents to over a hundred thousand dollars. The digital asset has also influenced the creation of other assets, making the crypto sector one of the most successful since its creation. The move to purchase more Bitcoin came earlier this year when the company launched a new strategy allowing it to allocate cash reserves in the cryptocurrency. The move saw the company label itself “the first Bitcoin treasury company” in Brazil. It is also expected to strengthen the company’s balance sheet, seeing that the appreciation in the price of the asset over the next few years can put it in a better financial standing compared to most of its peers. Aside from investors, the company is also expected to increase its user base and lead the fintech sector in Brazil. Crypto literacy in Latin America is on the rise Brazil has emerged as an important player in the Latin American cryptocurrency market. While regulatory clarity is improving, the country has also seen increased public interest in the sector. Méliuz is also following that trend, which has seen a wider interest in digital asset investment and adoption among individuals and corporations. Meanwhile, Méliuz is not the only corporation accumulating Bitcoin, with firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet also accumulating the digital asset. Days ago, Strategy announced the purchase of 1,045 BTC at $110.2 million, with each token costing about $105k. The move pushed the company’s total Bitcoin stash to 582,000, with an average purchase price of $70,086. The move by Strategy and other corporations to purchase BTC has influenced others, with more companies starting to add minimal Bitcoin to their treasuries. According to reports, about 26 companies hold more than 1,000 BTC in their treasuries, with seven holding 10,000 or more. In the past week, five companies have also purchased more BTC, using the announcement to boost their social media presence.

2025-06-14T10:55:31,"Trump Media Bitcoin Treasury Deal Declared Effective By SEC","The Trump Media and Technology Group has announced that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has declared effective the company’s registration for its Bitcoin treasury deal. The approval comes only a few weeks after Trump Media confirmed a $2.3 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. SEC Declares Trump Media Bitcoin Treasury Registration Effective Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the Truth Social platform and is partially owned by President Trump , has received approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its registration statement regarding its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal. According to a June 13 SEC filing, the market regulator “declared effective” Trump Media’s S-3 registration statement, filed on June 6. The S-3 form is used by US companies to register for the sale of securities like stocks, options, and different types of debt. Trump Media filed a corresponding prospectus with the SEC on the same day. An Aggressive Expansion According to the SEC filing, Trump Media registered the resale of 56 million shares and 20 million more tied to convertible notes as part of debt and equity agreements with around 50 investors, yielding $2.3 billion. The registration statement includes a universal shelf, giving the company greater flexibility for its future growth plans. However, Trump Media does not have any immediate plans to issue any securities under it. Trump Media CEO and President Devin Nunes said the company plans to expand its offerings and capabilities aggressively. “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the company, our offerings, and our capabilities. By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” The approval comes weeks after the company confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin after strong denials of the raise. Nunes had stated at the time, “Bitcoin is an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Is A Spot Bitcoin ETF In The Works? Trump Media had also filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF on June 5. The company filed for an initial registration statement on Form S-1 for its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-14T10:50:38,"Altcoin Season Index: Crucial Insight into the Current Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index: Crucial Insight into the Current Bitcoin Season Are you watching the crypto market closely, wondering whether it’s time for altcoins to shine or if Bitcoin still holds the reins? A key indicator for this is the Altcoin Season Index. This metric offers valuable insight into the current market dynamics, helping investors understand whether Bitcoin or the broader altcoin market is leading the charge. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by reputable platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a simple yet powerful tool for gauging market sentiment and performance trends. It provides a snapshot of how altcoins are performing relative to Bitcoin over a specific period. Here’s a breakdown of what the index measures: Top 100 Coins: It focuses on the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CMC. 90-Day Performance: The index looks at the performance of these coins over the past 90 days. Relative to Bitcoin: The core comparison is how many of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin’s price performance during that 90-day window. Exclusions: Importantly, the index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, as their price movements don’t reflect speculative market trends in the same way as volatile cryptocurrencies. The index is presented as a score ranging from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season: What’s the Difference? The Altcoin Season Index helps define two distinct phases within the crypto market cycle: Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season. Here’s how the index scores relate to these seasons: Index Score Range Market Phase Condition Met Key Characteristic 75 – 100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Broad rallies across many altcoins, often leading to significant gains relative to BTC. 1 – 25 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin tends to perform strongly, either gaining value while altcoins lag or holding value better during downturns. 26 – 74 Neither The market is in a transitional or mixed phase, not meeting the criteria for either defined season. Performance is mixed; some altcoins may do well, others may not, or the market is consolidating. Understanding which season the market is in can significantly impact investment strategies. During Bitcoin Season, focusing primarily on Bitcoin or stable assets might be prudent, while Altcoin Season often presents opportunities for higher potential returns (along with higher risk) in smaller cap coins. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Currently at 27? As of June 14, 2024, at 00:31 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered 27. This figure, up slightly from the previous day, firmly places the crypto market in Bitcoin Season. An index value of 27 means that only a small percentage (between 25% and 27%) of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This indicates that Bitcoin’s Bitcoin performance has been relatively stronger than most altcoins over the past three months. Several factors could contribute to this: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of broader economic uncertainty, investors often flock to perceived safer assets. Within crypto, Bitcoin is typically seen as the most established and secure asset, sometimes referred to as ‘digital gold’. Institutional Flows: The approval and success of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in various regions have led to significant institutional capital flowing directly into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its price and relative performance compared to altcoins which lack similar investment vehicles. Post-Halving Dynamics: While the Bitcoin halving event often precedes broader market rallies, the immediate period after can sometimes see Bitcoin consolidating or leading before capital rotates into altcoins. Dominance Cycles: The crypto market naturally goes through cycles where Bitcoin dominance (its market cap relative to the total crypto market cap) fluctuates. High dominance often correlates with Bitcoin Season. The current index value is a clear signal that, on average, altcoins are not keeping pace with Bitcoin’s gains (or holding up as well during dips) over the recent 90-day period. Navigating the Market During Bitcoin Season Being in Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean altcoins are a guaranteed bad investment, but it does suggest a shift in market dynamics. Here are some considerations for investors: Focus on Bitcoin: This might be a period where simply holding or accumulating Bitcoin yields better relative results than diversifying heavily into altcoins. Selective Altcoin Investing: Instead of broad altcoin exposure, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts (like major upgrades or partnerships), or those showing resilience against the general trend. Research is paramount. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. During Bitcoin Season, they can experience sharper downturns if Bitcoin corrects. Employ stricter risk management strategies, such as smaller position sizes or stop-loss orders. Accumulation Opportunities: For long-term holders, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate promising altcoins at lower prices relative to BTC. Watch for Shifts: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other indicators (like Bitcoin dominance) for signs that the market dynamics might be shifting back towards altcoins. The current Bitcoin performance relative to altcoins highlights the importance of adapting strategies to the prevailing market conditions. What Triggers a Shift Back to Altcoin Season? While the market is currently in Bitcoin Season, cycles are inherent to crypto. A shift back towards Altcoin Season is likely at some point. What could trigger this rotation? Sustained Bitcoin Rally Followed by Consolidation: Often, a strong Bitcoin rally captures market attention and draws in new capital. If Bitcoin then enters a period of consolidation or slower growth, this capital can rotate into altcoins seeking higher potential returns. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A falling Bitcoin dominance chart is a classic indicator that altcoins are starting to gain market share and outperform BTC. Major Altcoin Narratives: The emergence of strong, compelling narratives around specific sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI in crypto) can drive significant capital into those altcoins, leading the broader market. Improved Macro Sentiment: A more favorable global economic outlook can increase investor appetite for riskier assets, including altcoins. Technological Milestones: Successful network upgrades (like Ethereum’s transitions) or major developments in other prominent altcoin ecosystems can attract investment and boost performance. Monitoring these potential catalysts, alongside the Altcoin Season Index, is crucial for identifying when the tide might be turning. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 27 provides a clear, data-driven perspective on the current state of the crypto market: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season. This means that over the past 90 days, Bitcoin’s Bitcoin performance has outpaced the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins. This phase isn’t a signal to abandon altcoins entirely, but rather to approach the market with awareness. Strategies may need to shift towards potentially higher Bitcoin exposure, more selective altcoin investments based on strong fundamentals, and rigorous risk management. While Bitcoin Season prevails, the dynamic nature of the crypto market means that the conditions for Altcoin Season will eventually emerge again. Staying informed about key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index and understanding the underlying market drivers are essential for navigating these cycles successfully and making informed investment decisions.

2025-06-14T10:49:40,"Charles Hoskinson’s Bold Move: Convert $100M ADA Treasury to Bitcoin and Stablecoins to Fix DeFi Gap","Thanks to the formation of higher lows, Cardano (ADA) is in high gear to breach the psychological prices of $0.65 and $0.80. Calling out this development, market analyst Lingrid pointed out, “Price action is forming higher lows within a broad descending channel, eyeing a break toward the $0.75 target. A close above the resistance trendline could ignite bullish momentum and invalidate the recent downside structure.” Source: Lingrid In price action, higher lows play an important role in signalling the resumption of bullish momentum because they show that buyers are stepping in earlier each time the price dips. Therefore, this reflects growing demand or confidence, a major catalyst for an uptrend. At the time of this writing, Cardano was trading at $0.6348 per CoinGecko data. Charles Hoskinson’s Stablecoin Proposal Charles Hoskinson recently highlighted Cardano’s low stablecoin ratio as a major weakness. As a result, Hoskinson proposed converting $100M in ADA from the Cardano treasury into Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins to boost decentralized finance (DeFi) growth and liquidity. The Cardano founder suggested diversifying ADA’s treasury to address its low stablecoin-to-DeFi ratio, which is under 10%.

Cyber thieves uploaded the data to a popular dark web forum, according to Cybernews. The outlet’s researchers say a sample of the data appears to contain some emails linked to prior T-Mobile breaches, along with “some new data points not seen in previous T-Mobile attacks.” But the mobile giant says the malicious actors are flat-out lying. “Any reports of a T-Mobile data breach are inaccurate. We have reviewed the sample data provided and can confirm the data does not relate to T-Mobile or our customers.” Researchers say the data contains full names, dates of birth, tax IDs, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, device IDs, cookie IDs and IP addresses. “If this data is legitimate, exposing 64M lines of highly sensitive information poses a serious threat of identity theft/fraud, surveillance, and further, better-targeted attacks on customers.” The alleged data dump comes as 76 million T-Mobile customers begin to receive their share of a $350 million payout following a 2021 data breach and class action settlement.

2025-06-14T10:20:29,"Bitcoin Treasury Boost: Trump Media Gets SEC Green Light for $2.3B Placement","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Boost: Trump Media Gets SEC Green Light for $2.3B Placement In a significant development connecting the world of media, finance, and cryptocurrency, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ: DJT), the parent company behind the Truth Social platform, recently made waves with a major announcement. The company revealed that its Form S-3 registration statement concerning a substantial private placement has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). What Does This SEC Approval Mean for Trump Media? This isn’t just any regulatory filing; it’s a critical step related to raising significant capital. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, the SEC approval makes effective Trump Media’s S-3 filing tied to recent agreements with approximately 50 investors. These agreements, encompassing both debt and equity subscriptions, successfully brought in a staggering $2.3 billion for the company. An S-3 filing is essentially a registration statement used by companies that have been public for at least a year and meet certain reporting requirements. It allows them to register securities for potential future sale more quickly. In this instance, the effectiveness of the S-3 relates to the shares that could be issued as part of the private placement deal that has already occurred, providing the necessary regulatory clearance for those securities. Why is Trump Media Building a Bitcoin Treasury? One of the most intriguing aspects of this capital raise is the stated purpose: building a Bitcoin treasury . While the press release specifically mentions the $2.3 billion capital raise tied to the S-3 effectiveness, previous reports and company statements have indicated an intention to allocate some of this capital towards acquiring Bitcoin for the corporate treasury. Holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet is a strategy popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. The rationale often cited includes: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Potential Appreciation: Hopes that Bitcoin’s value will increase over time. Alignment with a Specific User Base: Potentially appealing to individuals interested in digital assets and financial sovereignty, which may align with a segment of Truth Social’s audience. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the company’s holdings. If Trump Media proceeds with this plan, it would join a growing, though still relatively small, list of publicly traded companies holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Understanding the $2.3 Billion Private Placement The $2.3 billion wasn’t raised through a traditional public offering. Instead, it came from a private placement , meaning shares or debt were sold directly to a limited number of accredited investors, rather than through a public exchange. This type of financing is often quicker but can involve more complex terms and potential dilution for existing shareholders depending on the structure. Key details from the announcement: Amount Raised: Approximately $2.3 billion. Investors: Around 50 sophisticated investors. Structure: A combination of debt and equity subscription agreements. Regulatory Step: The S-3 effectiveness clears the path for the registration of the securities involved in this private transaction. This capital infusion provides Trump Media with significant financial flexibility, which it could use for various purposes, including expansion, operations, and, as indicated, potentially funding a Bitcoin treasury . What Could This Mean for DJT Stock? The news of the SEC approval and the massive capital raise could have varied implications for DJT stock . Potential Positive Impacts: Improved Balance Sheet: The $2.3 billion significantly strengthens the company’s financial position. Funding for Growth: Provides capital for potential business development and initiatives. Investor Confidence: The successful private placement and regulatory clearance might signal confidence from sophisticated investors and regulators. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Some investors may view the potential acquisition of Bitcoin positively, seeing it as a forward-thinking or value-preserving strategy. Potential Challenges/Risks: Dilution: The equity component of the private placement could lead to dilution for existing shareholders. Bitcoin Volatility: If the company allocates significant funds to Bitcoin, the volatility of the cryptocurrency market could impact the value of the company’s treasury and potentially DJT stock price. Market Reaction: Investor sentiment towards the Bitcoin treasury strategy and the terms of the private placement will influence stock performance. Investors in DJT stock will be closely watching how this capital is deployed and the performance of any potential Bitcoin holdings. Conclusion: A Bold Financial Move with Crypto Implications The SEC approval of Trump Media ‘s S-3 filing related to its $2.3 billion private placement is a pivotal moment for the company. This substantial capital raise provides a strong financial foundation, potentially enabling significant operational growth and strategic investments. The intention to potentially use some of these funds for a Bitcoin treasury adds a fascinating layer, linking the company directly to the volatile yet potentially rewarding world of digital assets. While the influx of capital is a clear positive, the success of this strategy, including the impact on DJT stock and the performance of its potential Bitcoin holdings, will unfold over time. This development highlights the increasing intersection of traditional finance, media, and cryptocurrency.

All of this is shaping the direction the market could take next and there’s a lot to unpack. If you’ve been feeling like it’s hard to keep up – you’re not alone. That’s why we’re here to help you catch up on everything important, all in one place. Dive right in. #1 Stripe Acquires Privy in Big Push Back Into Crypto Stripe is making its way back into crypto – this time with infrastructure. The payments giant just acquired Privy , a startup that helps developers add crypto wallets to their apps using a simple API. Privy currently supports over 75 million wallets and works with platforms like Hyperliquid and Blackbird. The startup will keep operating independently under Stripe, just like Bridge, another crypto company Stripe acquired earlier this year. After years on the sidelines, Stripe is clearly serious about crypto again and starting from the ground up. #2 Milei Walks Free in $LIBRA Token Controversy Argentina’s President Javier Milei has been cleared of any wrongdoing linked to his February post about Solana-based memecoin $LIBRA. The anti-corruption office said Milei acted “as an economist and not a public official,” using his personal X account . His post sent $LIBRA soaring to a $4.5 billion market cap – before crashing 90% after he deleted it and distanced himself. Leaked messages later claimed the token’s co-creator had ties to Milei’s sister. No charges, but the situation raised major questions about politics, influence, and hype-fueled tokens. #3 Big Win for U.S. Crypto Regulation: CLARITY Act Advances The CLARITY Act , a bill aiming to set clear rules for digital assets, has officially advanced to the full House of Representatives after passing two major committees this week. It cleared the House Agriculture Committee with a 47–6 vote, and the Financial Services Committee with 32–19. “This is a historic opportunity to unlock innovation,” said Rep. French Hill, the bill’s sponsor. Backed by both parties, the bill promises better consumer protection and legal clarity for crypto companies operating in the U.S. #4 Singapore Gives Crypto Firms a Deadline to Leave Singapore is making its crypto rules crystal clear and strict. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued a final directive giving unlicensed crypto firms until June 30, 2025 to stop offering offshore services. There’s no grace period and no flexibility. Big names are already packing their bags. Bitget is relocating staff to Dubai and Hong Kong, and Bybit is reportedly weighing similar moves. MAS says licenses going forward will only be granted under “extremely limited” conditions. It’s one of the strongest regulatory moves we’ve seen in Asia this year and a signal that the era of loose rules may be over. #5 SEC Pulls Plug on Gensler-Era Crypto Rules The SEC has scrapped 14 proposed rules from the Gensler era – including two major crypto measures. Rule 3b-16, which could’ve classified DeFi protocols as securities exchanges, is now off the table. So is a strict custody rule that would’ve forced advisers to use only “qualified custodians,” excluding most crypto platforms. Coinbase’s Paul Grewal called it: “Down goes 3b-16.” The decision follows Trump’s wider push to roll back regulation. The SEC says these proposals are done and any future rules would need to start fresh. #6 IBIT Becomes the Fastest ETF to Reach $70 Billion BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just set a new record. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reached $70 billion in assets on June 9, doing it in just 341 days. That’s five times faster than the gold ETF GLD, which took 1,691 days to get there. It’s the biggest Bitcoin ETF on the market, far ahead of Fidelity’s $20B and Grayscale’s GBTC just under that. The demand is clear: investors want Bitcoin exposure, and IBIT is now the go-to option to get it. #7 Connecticut Becomes First State to Ban Crypto in Government A new law passed this week bans all state and local divisions from accepting crypto payments or holding digital assets. The bill also rules out any kind of Bitcoin reserve – a move aimed at protecting taxpayers from crypto volatility and lack of regulation. Supporters say it’s a smart move. “Connecticut is acting prudently to protect consumers and taxpayers,” said State Rep. Jason Doucette. But critics argue it’s political. “This is signaling that Connecticut is symbolically opposed to cryptocurrency,” said attorney Aaron Brogan. #8 Cetus Is Back Online After $230M Exploit Cetus Protocol is back up and running after a $230 million hack shut it down last month . The Sui-based DEX relaunched on June 8 following a major exploit that targeted its liquidity pools and drained assets like $SUI and $USDC. Sui validators froze over $160 million shortly after the attack, and a community vote approved the return of all recovered funds. Now, most pools have between 85% and 99% of liquidity restored. It’s a fast comeback and one of DeFi’s biggest recovery efforts this year. #9 Amazon and Walmart Could Launch Their Own Stablecoins Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring the idea of launching their own US dollar-backed stablecoins, according to the Wall Street Journal . While neither company has confirmed the plans, it could mark a big shift in how payments work across retail. A stablecoin system could reduce reliance on banks, speed up transactions, and save the companies billions in fees. With Shopify already planning to integrate USDC by the end of the year, it’s clear that more big names are moving closer to using crypto in everyday payments. #10 Congress Pushes SEC for Clarity on ETH Rules Congressman William Timmons wants answers from the SEC about Ethereum’s classification . In a new letter, he called out the agency’s “zigzagging approach” and demanded internal documents, including emails from Chair Gary Gensler. Timmons pointed to the approval of ETH ETFs and the quiet end of an SEC investigation as signs of mixed messaging. He says the lack of clarity has hurt investors and businesses. His goal? To bring transparency and push for clear rules on who regulates Ethereum – the SEC or the CFTC. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! Top Footballers Tied to €3M NFT Scam: Spanish authorities are investigating a failed NFT project promoted by football stars like Papu Gómez. The platform never launched, leaving investors with worthless tokens and millions in losses. Ukraine Moves Toward Crypto Reserves : A new draft bill could let Ukraine’s central bank hold Bitcoin as part of national reserves . Lawmakers say it’s about macro stability, not hype, and aligning with global financial innovation Ripple and SEC Push to Close XRP Case: Ripple and the SEC jointly asked Judge Torres to dissolve a final injunction and release $125M in escrowed funds , aiming to end the case and avoid drawn-out litigation. EveryX Gears Up for Private Launch in Quezon City: Prediction platform EveryX will host a private launch on June 27, featuring DJs, alpha talks, and Web3 names like Steve “Icesteam” Jimenez and Hayate Matsuzaki. South Korea Moves to Legalize Stablecoins: President Lee’s party has proposed n ew rules allowing local firms to issue stablecoins. With crypto trading booming nationwide, the bill could reshape South Korea’s digital asset landscape if regulators get on board. Czech Minister Replaced After Bitcoin Donation Scandal: Eva Decroix has replaced Pavel Blažek as Czech justice minister after backlash over a $45M Bitcoin donation from a convicted criminal. The scandal comes just months before national elections. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead Singapore’s tone toward crypto is changing fast, and other Asian markets may follow with stricter rules of their own. In the U.S., all eyes are now on the House. With the CLARITY Act advancing and Congress pushing the SEC for answers on Ethereum’s status, we could be inching closer to long-awaited legal certainty. Keep an eye on stablecoins. Amazon and Walmart exploring in-house digital dollars could set off the next wave of adoption or bring new regulatory headaches if U.S. lawmakers jump in. People are watching the Fed’s upcoming decision. With interest rate cuts on the table, risk assets like crypto could see a boost. But gold is currently outperforming both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 – a reminder that investors are still being cautious. The FOMC meeting could be a major volatility trigger. Wallets holding 10,000–100,000 BTC have dumped over 37,000 coins since June 3. It’s a bearish signal from some of crypto’s biggest holders, even as ETF inflows stay strong. A shift back to accumulation would be a critical sign of market confidence. There’s also a strange calm that’s worrying some analysts. Profit-taking has suddenly dropped off, which can be a sign of market complacency. When no one’s nervous, it might be time to get a little nervous. As always, crypto sits at the crossroads of regulation, adoption, and raw market sentiment. We’ll be watching it all. Catch you next week. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T10:12:52,"Top Reasons Why XRP Could Explode Even as BTC Struggles","As Bitcoin faces a wave of market indecision, XRP is quietly building a case for a breakout. Backed by growing institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and a dedicated community, XRP is emerging as a serious contender for the next major move—even as BTC hesitates. This article breaks down the technical signals, market behavior, and broader trends suggesting why XRP could surge ahead while the rest of the market treads water. Bitcoin Bulls Struggle as Battle Wages on Price Frontlines Source: tradingview Bitcoin wavers around one hundred five thousand, indicating a challenging period for bulls. Bears seem to have a slight edge with the price hovering below resistance at nearly one hundred eleven thousand. The coin's one-week rise of about three percent shows some potential, but the one-month gain is not as promising. The support sits close to ninety-eight thousand, providing a foundation to build on if bulls gather strength. As Bitcoin approaches its one-hundred-day moving average of one hundred eight thousand, breaking through could lead to growth. Achieving this could push the price towards the second resistance, translating to a potential gain of about ten percent. XRP Struggles as Bears Clamp Down, Eyeing Recovery to $2.68 Source: tradingview XRP teeters in a tight range between just over two to less than two and a half dollars, reflecting a market in a struggle between bulls and bears. Recent movements have pushed the price up by roughly two and a half percent this week, but it remains down nearly seventeen and ten percent in the last month and six months, respectively. Bulls aim for the first resistance at just over two and a half dollars, a leap of around nine percent from current levels. If momentum kicks in, XRP could aim for nearly three percent higher at the second resistance. Current indicators lean bearish, but eyes watch closely for signs of recovery. Why XRP Could Explode Here’s why XRP could outperform, even while Bitcoin struggles: Deep Liquidity Role vs. Messaging SystemsRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that XRP could capture up to 14% of SWIFT's global liquidity volume within five years by serving as a bridge asset—not just a messaging tool. That’s a powerful long-term narrative for institutional investors. Speed & Cost Efficiency in Cross‑Border PaymentsXRP enables near-instantaneous currency conversions, reducing the need for pre-funded bank accounts and slashing intermediary costs—a stark contrast to the slower, fee-heavy SWIFT process. Tokenized Asset Growth PotentialRipple insiders at XRP APEX 2025 highlighted demand in the tokenized assets sector, suggesting XRP may serve as foundational liquidity for hundreds of billions of tokenized securities. Lower Correlation with BTCUnlike many altcoins that mirror Bitcoin’s price action, XRP often shows independent strength, making its recent consolidation a potential signal of bend—but-not-break resilience. Institutional Confidence & Community BackingRipple's proactive engagement with regulators, partners, and big‑name clients lends increasing credibility to XRP’s use-case, fueling renewed institutional interest and broader acceptance.

2025-06-14T10:10:00,"DigiByte Price Prediction 2025-2031: Is DGB a Good Investment?","Key Takeaways DigiByte is predicted to reach a minimum and maximum value of $0.0067 and $0.0191, respectively, in 2025. In 2028, the DGB price can reach a maximum price value of $0.0475 with an average value of $0.0396. The price of DigiByte is predicted to reach an average value of $0.0468 in 2030 DigiByte (DGB) is an open-source blockchain that was created in 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin, promising to be a faster and safer transaction. It is designed in a multi-layered architecture comprising a public ledger, a smart contract layer and a core protocol consisting of five mining algorithms. Developed by Jared Tate, DigiByte has continued to experience active development and a community-driven ecosystem under DigiByte Foundation and Awareness Team. In May 2021, DGB attained an all-time high of $0.1825, before dropping more than 95% below. This decline has not reduced the interest of long-term holders and developers in the project.

As of June 14, 2025, DigiByte (DGB) has extended its downward trajectory, having a 0.40% decline in the past 24 hours. The price now trades at $0.00816, signalling sustained bearish momentum. Sellers continue to dominate the market, with minimal signs of buyer interest at current levels. This ongoing slide underscores prevailing market weakness and cautious investor sentiment. Digibyte 24-hour chart analysis shows price drop as bearish momentum takes Control On the 24-hour chart, DigiByte (DGB) has shown continued bearish pressure, trading at $0.00816. The price reflects a downward trend, marked by consecutive red candles and a failure to hold previous support levels. This shows an ongoing dominance by sellers and a lack of bullish momentum. DigiByte Price Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.96, moving just above the oversold zone of 30. Its position below the 40.34 moving average suggests weak buyer activity and reinforces the bearish sentiment in the market. RSI has remained subdued for several sessions, indicating sustained selling without meaningful recovery attempts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence remains in bearish territory. The line is at -0.000404 and sits below the signal line at -0.000325. This divergence between the two lines points to prolonged downside momentum. The histogram also reflects negative pressure, with no bullish crossover in sight.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also supports the bearish outlook. The MACD line is at -0.000239, while the signal line follows at -0.000215. Though the histogram shows a slight easing in bearish strength, the MACD has not yet crossed above the signal line, signalling that selling pressure remains in place.

Volume trends will help confirm the strength behind any breakout or breakdown. Is DigiByte a good investment? DigiByte offers strong long-term potential due to its secure proof-of-work blockchain and fast 15-second block times. Transactions confirm in just 1.5 minutes, making it practical for everyday use. Its active community and committed developers continue to drive innovation. These features position DigiByte as a solid choice for investors seeking real-world utility and strong technology. Why is DigiByte up today? DigiByte’s 1.8% price rise over the past 24 hours appears to stem from a technical rebound rather than fresh fundamentals. The RSI14 climbed from near-oversold levels of 30.5 to 34.08, sparking short-term buying interest. At the same time, price was stable around the key $0.00787 low, with resistance at the 10-day SMA near $0.00882. The ongoing community initiatives around adoption and supply reduction may be improving sentiment, even as overall market liquidity remains down. Will DigiByte reach $1? Based on the recent upward trend, DigiByte’s price can reach $1 if positive market conditions and investor sentiment continue. Will DigiByte reach $10? Reaching $10 for DigiByte is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term due to its current price levels and the significant market capitalisation required. Does DigiByte have a good long-term future? DigiByte has potential for a strong long-term future due to several key factors. Firstly, it boasts a robust, secure blockchain with a focus on speed and efficiency, making it one of the fastest and most decentralised blockchains in the market.

However, we expect DigiByte to start a cautious recovery. Throughout the year, the price is projected to trend upward. Will DGB manage to reach a new all-time high? In that case, the price of DGB could significantly increase. DigiByte Historic Price Sentiment DigiByte Price History: Coinmarketcap DigiByte’s native token, DGB, was introduced into the market back in 2014. DigiByte price remained at $0.01 for a couple of days before dropping even further towards $0.0003. The altcoin did not excel during its early days, and most investors opted to acquire other, more prominent digital assets. Nevertheless, the DigiByte cryptocurrency began to grow gradually and started amassing capital. Digibyte (DGB) hovered within $0.0003 for about three years before spiking during the spring of 2017. Investors who acquired DGB early made a threefold profit when the Digibyte price reached $0.001. For once, the DigiByte cryptocurrency market cap started to spell tens of millions of dollars. During the fall of 2017, a well-known payment platform, Paytomat, added support for DGB. On top of that, popular crypto exchanges listed the cryptocurrency. As a result, the DGB price started growing more resolutely. Early into 2018, the price of DGB reached a record high of 13 cents per DGB token and $1.2 billion in total market capitalization. Unfortunately, the pull-back phase knocked in and drove the cryptocurrency downwards. The sharp retracement transformed into a broad bearish trend, and indicators dropped. Another notable pricing event occurred when the price of DGB rose from $0.017 to $0.049 in April 2018, gaining more than 185 percent. Afterward, its price plummeted to a low of $0.004 in 2020. In January 2021, one DGB traded at $0.025 after a substantial rally. At the time of writing, one DigiByte token retails at $0.043. In October 2021 the price increased again to roughly $0.07. In Jan 2022 DigiByte’s price was around $0.05 and then price peaked again at approximately $0.125 in April the same year. In the year 2023 the price was around $0.02 in January and price range between $0.1 to $0.02 fo the rest of the year. DigiByte faced a slight increase to about $0.022 in January. Between June and July 2024,the price stabilized around $0.0076. In the following months, the price of DigiByte dropped sharply as it made a low below $0.006 in November. DGB price continued to consolidate below $0.009 in early 2025. As of June 2025, DigiByte trades at $0.00814, reflecting a modest rebound from its mid-2024 stabilization around $0.0076.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/digibyte-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|altcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T10:00:45,"Crypto Bulls See $1 Billion Squeeze as Bitcoin, Altcoins Crash","Data shows the cryptocurrency long investors have suffered a massive beating in the past day as Bitcoin and the altcoins have plunged. Bitcoin Briefly Broke Under $103,000 During The Crash The cryptocurrency market has been shocked in the past day as Bitcoin and altcoins have all gone through a drawdown of some degree. At present, BTC is down about 2%, but its decline was more severe earlier in the day. Below is a chart that shows how the asset’s recent performance has been like. From the graph, it’s apparent that Bitcoin briefly slipped below $103,000 during the crash. Following a rebound, the cryptocurrency’s price is now back at $104,800. The negative price action has generally been sharper for the other assets in the sector, with the likes of Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) observing losses exceeding 7%. The bearish wave in the market has come as tensions have spiked in the Middle East following Israel’s airstrikes on Iran, with fears of further escalation weighing on investor sentiment. Like with any other volatile event in the cryptocurrency sector, the latest sharp price action has also accompanied chaos on the derivatives side. Crypto Liquidations Have Crossed $1 Billion In Last 24 Hours According to data from CoinGlass , the cryptocurrency market has faced a massive amount of liquidations over the past day. “ Liquidation ” refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has gone underwater by a specific percentage (as defined by the platform). Here is a table that shows how the digital asset liquidation numbers have looked for the last 24 hours: As is visible above, the cryptocurrency sector has seen a total of $1.13 billion in liquidations inside this window. Out of these, $1 billion of the contracts involved were long positions. That is, they were betting on a bullish outcome for the market. Naturally, the latest price action would have caught these investors off-guard, which is why such a large number of them have been wrapped up in the liquidation event. An event like this where a large number of contracts get flushed is popularly known as a squeeze . Since longs occupied an overwhelming majority in the latest squeeze, the event would be called a long squeeze. Below is a table that shows how the contribution from the individual symbols has looked for this liquidation squeeze. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been top of the list like usual, with $451 million and $300 million in liquidations, respectively. Among the altcoins, Solana has stood out for its $53 million share in the squeeze.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bulls-1-billion-bitcoin-altcoins-crash/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|altcoins|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto bulls",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T10:00:27,"Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details","US President Donald Trump’s media group is making a big splash in crypto finance. A Chicago trading firm put up $100 million to buy 4 million shares in Trump Media & Technology Group. That move comes just nine weeks after US regulators closed a probe into the same firm. Based on reports, the deal is tied to TMTG’s plan to buy over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Big Bet On Trump Coin According to the filing, DRW Investments treats Bitcoin like any other corporate asset. The company – founded and controlled by trading mogul Don Wilson – said it has been active in crypto for more than a decade. It sees value in holding Bitcoin on its balance sheets. Buying into TMTG was, in its view, a straightforward way to back that idea.

Grumbach (@JakeMGrumbach) June 14, 2025 Institutional Backers Rally Jane Street leads the pack with a $375 million stake in the Trump Group. That makes it the largest backer so far. Other investors are also lining up. Based on reports, TMTG’s goal is to raise $2.5 billion and use much of that cash to buy Bitcoin. If all goes to plan, the firm could hold over 140,000 BTC at current prices. Regulatory Milestone Achieved On Friday, June 13, the SEC declared TMTG’s registration statement for its Bitcoin Treasury offering effective. That covers 56 million new shares of equity and 29 million in convertible notes. Clearing this step means the company can sell shares and raise the cash it needs. It also subjects TMTG to ongoing SEC reporting and oversight. Voice Of The Crypto Industry Meanwhile, a DRW spokesperson called for a fresh look at the SEC and CFTC. The firm argued that the current regulators don’t match the pace of global market changes. Over the years, DRW’s crypto arm, Cumberland, bought 70,000 BTC in a US government auction of Silk Road assets. That stash is worth about $7.7 billion today. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

2025-06-14T09:55:39,"Bitcoin Remains Defiant Amid Escalating Middle East Conflict and Trade War Fears","Bitcoin hovered around $105,100 on June 14, down 0.22% over the past 24 hours as traders digested geopolitical tension. Price action remained relatively tight, with BTC moving within a $2,090 range from $104,220 to $106,135. The largest moves occurred overnight in Asia trading, where Bitcoin briefly dipped below $104,200 before rebounding on high volume. Much of the recent volatility has been driven by developments in the Middle East. The Israel-Iran war, which some analysts fear could spread to other parts of the Middle East, combined with trade tensions between the U.S. and some of its key trading partners, has unsettled risk markets. More than $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations were recorded during the initial wave of conflict headlines, though bitcoin has shown resilience in the aftermath. Traders appear to be leaning bullish in the medium term, as BTC continues to hold a pattern of higher lows despite intraday wobbles. Profit-taking near $106,000 capped upside momentum, but support near $105,000 continues to draw buyers on dips. Market participants are watching this range closely, particularly as safe-haven demand and risk sentiment remain intertwined. While short-term headlines continue to drive volatility, the broader structure suggests BTC is consolidating rather than reversing. If support around $104,950 holds, Bitcoin may attempt another push above $106,200. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded in a $2,090 range from $104,182 to $106,272 over the past 24 hours. A key bounce occurred at $104,182 with 15,342 BTC traded during the recovery. Resistance formed near $106,200 amid consistent profit-taking. A rising trendline of higher lows remains intact. Psychological support at $105,000 is holding for now. Recent price range: $104,875 to $105,202 in the last hour. A sharp dip below $105K at 07:19 reversed quickly, with $105,200 acting as near-term resistance. Final 15-minute candles showed minor exhaustion, but volume patterns suggest accumulation on dips.

2025-06-14T09:52:48,"TRON Crypto Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Similar Wealth Potential Starting at $7","The post TRON Crypto Created Thousands of Millionaires: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Similar Wealth Potential Starting at $7 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When TRON (TRX) first took off, investors who believed in its fast-growing ecosystem turned small fortunes into sizable gains. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC‑S), now in Phase 7 of its presale at $7, replicates that momentum with updated fundamentals and broader accessibility. Forecasts set token value at $20 at listing — an almost certain 186% return — while deeper growth potential lies ahead. The mechanics that drove TRON’s early success are now fueling BTC‑S. Tokenomics Designed for Value Retention BTC‑S operates on a hard cap of 21 million tokens, with only 4.2 million made available during presale. Every token allocation and phase detail is public and verifiable — no hidden vaults, no stealth minting. This transparency ensures that each BTC‑S token purchased today keeps its value intact as supply remains fixed. Early buyers who secured tokens at $5 or $7 locked in positions under material scarcity. The fewer tokens available, the stronger each remaining one becomes. Mining Participation Without Barriers TRON’s rise leaned heavily on network activity. BTC‑S goes further by enabling participation through ordinary smartphones. Through the Nova App beta, users verified that idle device resources — storage and CPU — generate BTC‑S smoothly and sustainably. That means network contributors aren’t limited to technical insiders; anyone with a compatible phone can earn rewards and help secure the system. This widespread participation model mirrors TRON’s early engagement — except it’s built on everyday hardware. Trusted Transparency Through Audits Trust in presale tokens hinges on early verification. BTC‑S has met this requirement. A smart contract review by Cyberscope confirmed token logic aligns with stated rules. Mobile mining infrastructure received additional vetting from Freshcoins , confirming functionality and reliability. Developer identities passed a full KYC verification , eliminating the anonymity common in early-stage tokens. These layers of verification elevate BTC‑S from speculation to substance. Crypto strategist Ben Crypto recently analyzed BTC‑S, drawing lines from TRON’s early model to Bitcoin Solaris’s structural setup. His insights highlight the capped token supply, mobile-first mining, and audit-backed confidence as reliable signals for future gains. He projects BTC‑S could reach $100 within a year of listing — suggesting gains beyond the initial 186% jump. Real Participation Builds Real Value At $7, BTC‑S offers access comparable to TRON’s early phases, but with improved infrastructure. Pricing is set before the public market opens, establishing a baseline for early return. If listing occurs at $20, investors see an automatic 186% gain. If utility and adoption follow, the climb to $100 becomes realistically attainable. That’s more than speculation — it’s calculated outcome based on adoption and demand. In both TRON and BTC‑S cases, the key driver is user-led action. TRON grew through developer backing and community engagement. BTC‑S adds a layer of passive user contribution via mobile mining. Every device added, every token mined reduces circulating supply and raises demand. The result is value generated from activity, not just hype or media buzz. As more people download and use the Nova App, the demand curve grows organically. That’s a self-reinforcing loop rarely found in token models. Accelerated Wealth: A Rare Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has drawn over 11,000 investors and raised more than $3.8 million to date. Social channels are active. Mobile mining is live. Audits and KYC are in place. In a single stage, the project blends structural opportunity with execution. TRON’s early backers benefited from low entry points in a rising ecosystem. BTC‑S now delivers a comparable setup — with added certainty and accessibility. With Phase 7 nearing conclusion, final presale tokens remain limited. After that, tokens shift into public trading, which introduces volatility, broader buy-in, and reduced rewards for contributors. Early participants enjoy both pricing advantage and mining participation ahead of public launch. History shows that this timing matters — TRON’s early investors saw outsized returns because they acted before market tides shifted. BTC‑S offers the same timing advantage, modernized with structural clarity.

2025-06-14T09:50:24,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 63: Navigating the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 63: Navigating the Greed Zone The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic environment, often driven as much by emotion as by fundamental analysis. Understanding the prevailing sentiment is crucial for investors and traders alike. One of the most popular tools for gauging this collective mood is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this index has shown a significant shift, rising to 63 and firmly positioning itself within the ‘Greed’ zone. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a unique tool designed by Alternative.me to visualize the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It aggregates various data points to produce a single number between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). The core idea is that extreme fear can indicate a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter a falling market, while extreme greed can signal that the market is due for a correction. Why does this matter? Because human psychology plays a massive role in financial markets. Fear can lead to panic selling, driving prices down further than fundamentals might suggest. Greed can lead to irrational exuberance, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and speculative buying, pushing prices into bubble territory. The index provides a snapshot of this emotional temperature, helping participants potentially make more rational decisions by understanding the crowd’s current mindset. Breaking Down the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Score The index categorizes sentiment across a spectrum: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 63, as recently reported, falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ category. This indicates that market participants are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about current and future price movements. While not yet in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory, it suggests a strong positive bias is currently dominating the Crypto Market Sentiment . Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting opportunities for long-term investors. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have sometimes preceded market tops or significant pullbacks, as speculative excess becomes unsustainable. How is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Calculated? While often referred to in the context of the broader crypto market, the index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, given its market dominance. The calculation incorporates six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares current market volume and momentum to historical averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): Analyzes tweets and posts for specific terms related to crypto, tracking sentiment and engagement speed. High interaction and positive sentiment can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users about their market sentiment. (Note: As mentioned in the source, surveys are currently paused, which might slightly affect this component’s input, although the weighting is applied to the remaining active factors). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising dominance can indicate fear (as investors move to the perceived ‘safer’ asset, BTC) or simply strong performance in Bitcoin itself. Falling dominance can signal increasing greed as altcoins rally more aggressively. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble’, can signal fear, while terms related to buying or specific projects might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more holistic view of the underlying Crypto Market Sentiment than simply looking at price charts alone. What Does Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ Mean for You? A reading of 63 in the ‘Greed’ zone carries several implications for those involved in the market: Potential Implications: Increased Optimism: Participants are generally feeling positive about the market’s direction. Higher Risk Appetite: Investors may be more willing to take on risk, potentially moving into more speculative altcoins. FOMO Setting In: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive impulsive buying. Potential for Overheating: Markets driven purely by emotion and speculation can become detached from underlying value, increasing the risk of a sharp correction. While ‘Greed’ isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’, it serves as a yellow flag. It suggests caution is warranted. Prices may continue to rise, but the probability of a significant downturn increases as sentiment moves higher into the greed spectrum. Using the Crypto Fear and Greed Index in Your Crypto Investing Strategy The index is best used as one tool among many, not as a standalone signal. Here’s how it can fit into a broader Crypto Investing Strategy : Benefits: Sentiment Check: Provides a quick, aggregated view of market mood. Contrarian Indicator: Can help identify potential opportunities during ‘Extreme Fear’ (buy when others are fearful) or warn of potential tops during ‘Extreme Greed’ (be cautious when others are greedy). Historical Context: Comparing current readings to historical levels can offer perspective on where the market might be in its cycle. Challenges & Limitations: Not a Crystal Ball: The index cannot predict future price movements with certainty. A high greed score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does a high fear score guarantee a bottom. Lagging Indicator: It reflects *current* sentiment, which is often a reaction to recent price action, not necessarily a predictor of future action. Component Reliance: Changes in the calculation method or data sources (like paused surveys) can affect its reliability. Bitcoin-Centric: While indicative of the overall market, it’s heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin sentiment might differ. Actionable Insights: Combine with Analysis: Use the index alongside technical analysis (charts, patterns), fundamental analysis (project utility, adoption), and macroeconomic factors. Manage Risk: High greed scores are a good time to review your portfolio, potentially take some profits, set stop-losses, or reduce leverage. Avoid FOMO: When the index is high in the greed zone, resist the urge to chase rapidly rising prices. Stick to your predefined investment plan. Look for Opportunities in Fear: Conversely, low fear scores can signal potential buying opportunities if fundamentals remain strong. Think of the index as a temperature gauge for the market’s emotional state. It tells you if people are hot (greedy) or cold (fearful), but it doesn’t tell you *why* or *how long* that temperature will last. Historical Examples and the Greed Zone Looking back, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has often provided interesting insights. For instance, during the peak of the 2017 bull run and the late 2020/early 2021 rally, the index consistently registered in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (often above 90). These periods were followed by significant market corrections. Conversely, during major crashes, like March 2020 or the bear market lows of 2022, the index plummeted into ‘Extreme Fear’ (sometimes below 10), which in hindsight, represented strong accumulation zones for long-term holders. Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ at 63 isn’t as extreme as those historical peaks, but it places the market firmly in a state where caution should start outweighing excessive optimism. It’s a reminder that trees don’t grow to the sky and corrections are a natural part of market cycles. What Could Shift the Crypto Market Sentiment? The index is constantly reacting to market forces. Several factors could cause the Crypto Market Sentiment to shift from its current greedy state: Significant Price Drop: A sharp decline in Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies would quickly inject fear into the market. Negative News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, or major project failures can trigger widespread panic. Macroeconomic Changes: Shifts in global interest rates, inflation data, or recession fears can impact risk-on assets like crypto. Positive Developments: Conversely, positive news like institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs could push the index further into Extreme Greed. Monitoring these external factors alongside the index provides a more robust understanding of potential future movements. Conclusion: Navigating Greed with Caution The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 63 signifies that optimism and confidence are currently the dominant forces in the market, placing it firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. While this reflects positive price action and momentum, it also serves as an important reminder to temper enthusiasm with prudence. The index is a valuable sentiment tool, helping investors gauge the emotional temperature of the market and potentially act as a contrarian signal. However, it is not a standalone predictor. Successful navigation of the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ requires combining this sentiment insight with thorough research, technical analysis, fundamental understanding, and disciplined risk management as part of a well-defined Crypto Investing Strategy . Stay informed, stay cautious, and avoid letting greed dictate your decisions.

2025-06-14T09:48:28,"AI predicts Bitcoin price for July 1, 2025","Two artificial intelligence (AI) models are forecasting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will likely hold above the $110,000 mark by July 1. The outlook comes as Bitcoin stabilizes, following a pullback triggered by uncertainty tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. As of press time, BTC was trading at $105,124, down about 0.3% in the past 24 hours and more than 2% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $103,326 and the 200-day SMA of $87,532, a sign of strength in both the short and long term. On the other hand, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 54.22, indicating neutral momentum, with room for further upside without immediate correction pressure. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price Regarding the price outlook, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT to gauge where Bitcoin might head over the next two weeks. According to the model, BTC could trade around $114,000 by July 1, likely between $111,000 and $117,000. The forecast is based on solid technical momentum, favorable historical trends, and steady institutional inflows. ChatGPT noted that 2025, a post-halving year, often brings Bitcoin gains. With continued ETF demand and institutional inflows, upward pressure will be seen throughout Q2. It also flagged $102,000 as key support. A drop below could lead to $98,000, while strong momentum could drive BTC to $120,000. Bitcoin AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts Bitcoin price Meanwhile, Grok, the AI model developed by xAI , offered a slightly more conservative view. Based on the current consolidation between $102,000 and $108,000, Grok projects Bitcoin will reach around $111,500 by July 1. The model noted Bitcoin’s tendency to post short-term gains after periods of sideways movement, especially in a supportive macro environment with continued ETF inflows. Assuming no major disruptions, Grok sees a reasonable 6% climb from current levels. However, Grok also outlined alternative scenarios: If resistance at $108,000 holds, a pullback to $103,000 could occur. Conversely, a breakout could push the price up to $116,000. In summary, both AI models remain bullish heading into July. The key focus is whether Bitcoin can hold the $105,000 level, a critical point for sustaining its upward momentum.

2025-06-14T09:37:44,"Fidelity files S-1 for Solana spot ETF with staking options","Asset management firm and ETF issuer Fidelity has officially submitted an S-1 registration filing for a Solana spot ETF. The exchange-traded fund will also include staking options for users. Fidelity isn’t the only firm eyeing a SOL ETF, with a flurry of companies issuing SOL ETF S-1 amendments on Friday, including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck was the first U.S. company to file for a spot Solana ETF in June 2024 and was also the last to submit its amended S-1 filing for the day. Fidelity advances toward a spot SOL ETF Fidelity submitted its S-1 statement Friday to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm acknowledged that the proposed Fidelity Solana Fund would operate as a Delaware statutory trust. The ETF’s goal is to mirror SOL’s performance based on the Fidelity Solana Reference Rate Index, which calculates price data using a volume-weighted median price after 15 seconds. The index aggregates prices from eligible spot markets and reflects the real-time value of SOL in U.S. dollars. The ETF issuer revealed that the fund aims to keep SOL in custody and earn extra yield by staking some of its holdings through vetted providers. The resulting staking rewards will be treated as income and distributed accordingly. Fidelity has named a custodian who will store all SOL in segregated accounts on behalf of the trust. According to the company, most assets will be held in cold storage with limited SOL in hot wallets for transactions. The firm also plans to list shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange, though the ticker symbol remains undisclosed. According to Fidelity, shares will be created and redeemed in large blocks called Baskets, mainly by authorized participants using either SOL or cash. The asset management firm added that daily net asset value (NAV) will be calculated using the same index method applied to SOL pricing. The filing also revealed an annual sponsor fee tied to the fund’s SOL assets, though the percentage remains undisclosed. Fidelity said the fee will cover most standard operating expenses, except for unusual costs and a separate staking-related fee paid to the custodian from staking rewards. Fidelity’s affiliate, FD Funds Management LLC, will sponsor the product. The firm said the Trust will not use leverage, derivatives, or complex instruments, keeping the structure simple for traditional investors. According to the asset management company, the custodian will control all private keys, and the sponsor will oversee staking activities and manage security. The Trust’s assets, including staked SOL, are not protected by the FDIC or SIPC insurance. To initiate the momentum, a sponsor affiliate purchased a single Seed Share to set up the fund. Fidelity also clarified that the trust isn’t registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which means investors won’t receive the same regulatory protections given to traditional mutual funds or ETFs that fall under that law. The trust needs registration approval from the SEC before sales can commence. Fidelity has labeled the trust as an emerging growth company, allowing it to follow scaled-back reporting rules initially. SEC urges ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June The latest filing follows the U.S. SEC’s directive last week for spot Solana ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said at the time that the agency’s request indicates it’s more likely than before to approve some of the products, giving a timeline of two to four months for spot SOL ETFs to go live. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart doubts the Solana ETF approval will come as soon as next week. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were a lot of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” – James Seyffart , ETF Analyst at Bloomberg The regulator also reportedly asked issuers to update language surrounding in-kind redemptions and how issuers would approach staking. Firms have been advocating for the agency to approve Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs, which would earn holders staking yield. The SEC has approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as well as several blended crypto-equity funds. ETF issuers, including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, recently urged the agency to practice a first-to-file approach, where the SEC prioritizes greenlighting financial products based on the order of arrival Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This makes the system secure and resistant to fraud. About every four years, the reward miners get is cut in half in an event called ""halving."" There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, making it scarce like gold. In the current market, Bitcoin remains strong compared to other cryptocurrencies.

Key Takeaways: The SEC approved Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-linked registration, covering 85 million shares. TMTG says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities despite gaining shelf flexibility. CEO Devin Nunes says the firm aims to grow its media, fintech, and Bitcoin holdings in parallel. The decision, revealed in a June 13 filing , marks a major regulatory step for the company behind Truth Social, the platform founded by President Donald Trump and partially owned by him. According to the filing, the SEC declared effective TMTG’s S-3 registration statement, initially submitted on June 6. Trump Media Registers 85M Shares Linked to $2.3B Bitcoin Deal: SEC The document outlines the registration of roughly 56 million shares and an additional 29 million shares tied to convertible notes, forming part of the firm’s broader equity and debt agreements with approximately 50 investors. The total proceeds from these arrangements amount to $2.3 billion. Although the registration includes a universal shelf to allow TMTG greater capital-raising flexibility, the company said it has “no immediate plans” to issue new securities under the provision. The move appears more strategic than urgent, aligning with TMTG’s stated ambition to evolve beyond its media roots. TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes said the company is now pushing forward on multiple fronts. “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities,” Nunes said. “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” SEC APPROVES TRUMP MEDIA’S BITCOIN TREASURY DEAL pic.twitter.com/bybvEZ5TjS — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 13, 2025 Despite the regulatory win, TMTG shares dropped 2.06% on the day of the announcement, closing at $19.52. TMTG Confirms $2.5B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base. On May 28, Arkham Intelligence posted on X, “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” — referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. TMTG isn’t stopping there. On June 5, the company filed for approval to launch its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling even deeper ambitions in digital assets. According to the filing, the ETF would hold Bitcoin in custody and aim to mirror its market performance. Trump has publicly supported the expansion of crypto access and has pledged to make the United States a leading center for digital assets. Earlier this month, he hosted a private dinner for investors in his personal meme coin project at his golf club.

In a new interview on CNBC, Novogratz says Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. According to Novogratz, the rising number of institutional investors putting money into Bitcoin will further draw more investors into an asset with a fixed supply. “More and more people are realizing this is a story that they want to care about. And so once Larry Fink said BlackRock’s getting behind this, all that pushing the snowball uphill, it started rolling downhill. And now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth [funds] buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there are easier ways to get it. And so the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling downhill.” The Galaxy Digital CEO says Bitcoin could go up by over 9x from the current level as it increasingly becomes accepted as a store of value by younger generations. “The bull case becomes that over time, young people care about it more than old people. And so gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin. If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go – 10x. And so that’s a $1 million Bitcoin just to be where gold is. And I think gold should go from $3,000 to $10,000.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,662 at time of writing.

2025-06-14T09:05:01,"Unveiling Meta’s Significant AI Investment and Shifting Tech IPO Trends","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Meta’s Significant AI Investment and Shifting Tech IPO Trends The world of technology and finance is constantly evolving, with major players making strategic moves that ripple across industries. Recently, a significant development caught the attention of market watchers: Meta’s substantial investment in the AI data-labeling space. This move, alongside intriguing shifts in the public offering landscape, offers key insights for anyone tracking the pulse of innovation and investment. The Bitcoin World Equity podcast recently delved into these topics, providing a deep dive into what these developments signal for the future. Meta AI Investment: A Bold Move in the AI Race? Meta Platforms has reportedly made a significant Meta AI Investment , committing a substantial $14.3 billion to Scale AI, a leader in data labeling. However, this isn’t a straightforward acquisition. Meta is taking a 49% stake in the company and bringing Scale AI’s co-founder, Alexandr Wang, onto their team. This strategic partial ownership and talent acquisition highlight Meta’s urgency to accelerate its position in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape. The move signals Meta’s determination to keep pace with AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Google, although the exact strategy for leveraging this investment remains a subject of discussion. The Equity podcast hosts explored whether this Scale AI Deal represents a genuine game-changer for Meta’s AI capabilities or if it’s primarily aimed at adding a well-connected figure like Wang to their ranks at a time when Meta’s internal AI progress faces scrutiny. Navigating the Fintech IPO Market Beyond the realm of artificial intelligence, the financial technology sector continues to see activity in the public markets. The discussion turned to the Fintech IPO Market , specifically examining recent performance. A notable example is Chime’s initial public offering, which reportedly priced above initial expectations at $27 per share and saw a positive jump in early trading. This performance offers potential signals for the broader tech IPO landscape. Anthony Ha, one of the Equity podcast hosts, shared his perspective, offering some “not-so-hot takes” on what Chime’s IPO signals for overall Tech IPO Trends . The conversation explored whether this indicates renewed investor appetite or if specific sector strength is driving these outcomes. Understanding these nuances is crucial for evaluating the health and direction of technology companies seeking public funding. The Rise of Agentic AI Startups The podcast also touched upon emerging trends within the AI sector itself, particularly focusing on the types of companies gaining traction. Y Combinator’s recent Demo Day reportedly showcased a significant number of “agentic” AI Startups . These companies are focused on building autonomous software agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This focus on autonomous AI aligns with broader discussions around AI-driven task automation. A recent conversation with Fiverr’s CEO provided further context on how AI is impacting the gig economy and potentially transforming how tasks are assigned and completed. The rise of agentic AI startups suggests a future where software agents play an increasingly central role in both business processes and potentially, personal productivity. Beyond AI and IPOs: Other Tech Highlights The Equity podcast episode covered additional fascinating developments in the tech world: An archival interview with Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang offered insights into his early predictions for the future of artificial intelligence. A look at the quiet 18-month collaboration between Jony Ive’s design firm LoveFrom and electric vehicle maker Rivian on their first electric bike product, confirming its bike-like form factor. These diverse topics underscore the dynamic nature of the technology sector, where innovation spans from complex AI investments to consumer product design collaborations. Conclusion The recent news cycle, as discussed on the Bitcoin World Equity podcast, highlights pivotal moments in the tech and financial markets. Meta’s significant Meta AI Investment in Scale AI demonstrates the ongoing intensity of the AI race. Simultaneously, the performance of recent offerings in the Fintech IPO Market provides valuable data points for understanding current Tech IPO Trends . The emergence of agentic AI Startups from accelerators like Y Combinator points towards the next wave of AI-driven innovation.

2025-06-14T09:00:00,"Bitcoin pullback sparks $1B in long liquidations, KAIA and AB rally over 40%","Bitcoin bulls failed to reach a new all-time high this week, as fresh bearish macro developments triggered a late-week pullback. By late Asian trading hours on Friday, the total cryptocurrency market cap had dropped over 5% to $3.38 trillion, retreating from a three-week high set on June 11. Market sentiment also declined, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index falling 7 points to 53 on the same day, exiting Greed territory and returning to neutral levels. Most top-ranking altcoins surrendered their early-week gains, with only a few maintaining double-digit profits by the end of the week. Why did crypto crash? The week began with strong bullish momentum driven by optimism around renewed trade negotiations between the United States and China. Bitcoin briefly surged past $110,000 as risk appetite returned to global markets. However, sentiment quickly reversed as geopolitical instability in the Middle East escalated. Israel launched a large-scale military operation targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and other strategic assets, prompting fears of broader regional conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that strikes would continue until perceived threats were neutralized, raising the risk of prolonged hostilities. The uncertainty surrounding potential retaliatory actions from Iran and its allies triggered a broad sell-off across risk assets. Cryptocurrencies, which had rallied earlier in the week, were hit particularly hard as investors moved to de-risk their portfolios. Bitcoin fell as much as 5.6% to $102,700 on Bitstamp before slightly recovering to around $105,000 by late Friday. The downturn coincided with a surge in futures market liquidations, which totaled $1.15 billion over the past 24 hours. Long positions accounted for $1 billion of that amount, marking the largest daily liquidation event since February 25. In contrast, short liquidations were limited to $93 million. Bitcoin led the sell-off, recording $448.1 million in liquidations on June 13 alone. The scale of forced selling accelerated the price drop and amplified panic across the market, fueling further downside pressure. Despite the late-week correction, the broader macro backdrop remains supportive of long-term crypto upside. Easing tensions in U.S.–China trade relations have revived investor confidence in global risk markets, while recent U.S. inflation data showed continued cooling, reinforcing expectations of monetary policy stability. Core CPI for May came in below forecasts, reducing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. This has kept real yields stable and preserved appetite for risk-on assets, with Bitcoin still trading near historical highs and above the key support level at $104,000 despite short-term volatility. What’s next for Bitcoin? The outlook for Bitcoin remains mixed as analysts weigh the implications of this week’s volatility. Bitcoin dropped to $102,800 on Friday after geopolitical tensions escalated, but quickly rebounded to over $105,500, suggesting buyers remain active near key support. That support came at the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a level that has historically served as a launchpad for major rallies. A similar setup occurred in October 2024 when Bitcoin fell 8.8% during a prior Israel–Iran conflict, only to recover and gain over 80% by year-end. BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView. Given the structural similarities, some traders see the current correction as a healthy consolidation phase within a broader uptrend backed by improving macro signals. Further reinforcing this view, on-chain data shows an uptick in Bitcoin accumulation. Bitcoin also briefly entered oversold conditions on Friday, which technical traders view as a potential launch point for a short-term recovery. A sustained rebound could set the stage for a renewed push toward record highs. Another bullish theory comes from analyst Merlijn The Trader, who flagged a recurring fractal tied to liquidity grabs. In his chart analysis, Bitcoin appears to be following the same breakout sequence as before, clearing key resistance levels and trendlines just as it did ahead of its late 2024 rally past $100,000 amid Middle East tensions. In both cases, the price dipped briefly to flush out leveraged traders before surging higher. BTC/USD price trends. Source: Merlijn The Trader Other analysts, including widely followed trader Crypto Caesar, share a similar view and anticipate a short-term rebound. Nevertheless, one veteran has warned that Bitcoin’s recent rejection at $110,000 may signal the end of its local uptrend. In a series of posts on X, John Bollinger, the creator of the Bollinger Bands indicator, stated that the current price action confirms a “Three Pushes” pattern, typically seen at the end of sustained uptrends. Bollinger outlined how Bitcoin’s recovery from April lows near $75,000 unfolded in three distinct surges, each hitting the upper Bollinger Band and followed by brief consolidations. He noted that this structure has now been completed, and the failure to hold above all-time highs may usher in either a broader reversal or a prolonged consolidation phase. Traders watching for continued upside may need to account for a potential cooling period in the weeks ahead. When writing, Bitcoin was trading at $105,648, up 1% over the past week. Altcoins Altcoins faced significant volatility this week, with total market capitalisation peaking at $1.43 trillion before sliding to $1.2 trillion. The Altcoin Season Index climbed to 30 on June 10, marking a short-lived momentum shift, but has since eased back to 25. The top gainers for the week were as follows: Kaia Kaia (KAIA) has recorded a 45% increase over the past seven days, with its price reaching approximately $0.155 and its market cap rising to $940 million at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap The rally is primarily attributed to two significant developments. First, the Kaia team announced plans to introduce a Korean won–pegged stablecoin, a move that aligns with South Korea’s evolving regulatory framework under the proposed Digital Asset Basic Act, which supports the issuance of domestic stablecoins. Second, the network recently completed the native integration of Tether’s USDT, enhancing stablecoin functionality and improving liquidity within the Kaia ecosystem. AB Over the past week, AB (AB) has surged 40%, lifting its market capitalization to approximately $760 million as of the latest reporting. Source: CoinMarketCap AB’s strong performance this week followed its listing on Binance Alpha, Binance’s early-access platform, where a $1 million prize pool for trading activity boosted user engagement. Listings on Gate.io and Bitget soon followed, adding further momentum. The project also launched the AB Charity Foundation, introducing a philanthropic element to its ecosystem. Uniswap Uniswap (UNI) held onto 23% gains, trading at $7.49 at the time of writing, with a market cap of $4.71 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The key catalyst behind Uniswap’s recent bullish momentum was the launch of its new Smart Wallet. The rally was further supported by comments from SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who indicated the agency is considering an “innovation exemption” to ease regulatory barriers for DeFi platforms. The announcement has been seen as a potential catalyst for a renewed DeFi market cycle, positioning Uniswap to benefit as a leading protocol in the space.

2025-06-14T09:00:00,"Bitcoin’s Shaky Comeback: Will It Break $108K or Crash Again?","Bitcoin rebounds to $105K after 4% drop on June 13. Sentiment Index drops below 50%, showing a bearish trader mood. Resistance near $108K; support at $104.7K must hold firm. Bitcoin has climbed back above $105,000 at press time, but a deeper look at on-chain data suggests the recovery is fragile and lacks strong conviction from buyers. Bitcoin had gained around 1% after the sharp drop on June 13th, when it fell by 4%, slipping below $104,000 as rising tensions in the Middle East caused panic across the crypto market and wiped out billions of dollars in value. While this small price recovery is a relief for investors, experts warn that the market still looks shaky. A CryptoQuant analyst has observed that the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index, a tool that tracks market mood, has dropped to around 46%. This is below the neutral 50% mark, meaning traders are leaning slightly bearish. Bitcoin Stuck in a Range? The index had peaked above 80% in early June when the market was much more positive. But even though Bitcoin’s price bounced from $103K to $105K, trading activity hasn’t picked up enough to fully support the move.

2025-06-14T08:40:44,"Trump reports $57M earnings from World Liberty Financial","US President Donald Trump has revealed earning $57 million from World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture he is involved in alongside his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. According to a more than 200-page financial disclosure filed with the US Office of Government Ethics, Trump also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in WLF—granting him significant voting power within the company. The disclosure shows that WLF was Trump’s single largest income source among hundreds of assets, surpassing revenue from his books and real estate holdings. The filing is expected to intensify scrutiny over Trump’s growing ties to the crypto sector, with critics raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Trump earns significant income amid his pro-crypto stance World Liberty Financial announced in January that it has sold 21 billion tokens in a public sale, hitting its target of raising $ 1 billion. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2024 described the special envoy for Trump, Steve Witkoff, as a promoter for WLF. Public support from Trump has helped fuel a rally in crypto markets, sending the price of Bitcoin to over $100,000 a coin. In addition, under chair Paul Atkins, the SEC has dismissed several high-profile cases against crypto groups. Interestingly, Trump has often promoted his $TRUMP meme coin on social media. He also hosted a gala dinner for its largest holders last month. Last week, the Trump family media company said it was planning to launch its own exchange-traded fund to hold Bitcoin directly, and in May, it said it would raise $2.5 billion to establish a “Bitcoin treasury.” During a Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas in May, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr revealed that cryptocurrencies were cheaper, faster, more secure, and more transparent than traditional fiat currencies. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. World Liberty reveals Trump’s family as its major shareholder World Liberty, launched last fall, aims to make financial services reachable to people in cryptocurrencies without intermediaries like banks—a concept known as decentralized finance (DeFi). However, it has yet to release a public platform, and according to a review of the project, it has only a small staff. Nonetheless, World Liberty said in mid-March that it had raised $550 million by selling “governance tokens.” According to reliable sources, most sales occurred following Trump’s victory in November. The tokens, denoted by the symbol $WLFI, entitle holders to vote on proposed changes to a project’s underlying code and signal their perspective on its vision and future road maps. Still, they cannot be traded. It is worth noting that while World Liberty Financial took in more than half a billion dollars, President Donald Trump’s family seized control of the crypto venture and much of that money with it. This is supported by governance rules that industry experts believe disproportionately favor insiders. This was revealed after World Liberty announced in January that the Trump family had acquired the business as its fundraising gained momentum. Two of the co-founders of World Liberty, crypto entrepreneurs Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, have been replaced as the main leaders by a group with a 60% ownership stake from the Trump family. The Trump family claims 75% of the profits from token sales and 60% from World Liberty’s operations once they begin. This setup means the Trump family is set to receive around $400 million in fees. Following the mid-March sales, after the co-founders took their share, World Liberty only retained 5% of the $550 million raised to develop the platform. Trump’s family faces criticism over their shareholder capacity in WLF The way this project is organized, especially with the Trump family’s large share of revenue and the fact that governance tokens cannot be traded, makes World Liberty quite centralized compared to others in the industry. This conclusion comes from a review of practices at the five biggest DeFi lending platforms and interviews with four US professors who study crypto. Jim Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University who focuses on DeFi regulation , said he finds it hard to see any financial advantage for those holding these tokens. Additionally, David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee who recently studied World Liberty, noted that the project’s structure effectively keeps public investors or token holders from having any real financial involvement.
