2025-06-14T15:51:24,"Derivatives Bloodbath: $1.16B Liquidated Amid Global Turmoil","The crypto universe was rocked by a brutal tidal wave of liquidations worth $1.16 billion, as short-squeeze vulnerable leveraged longs were caught off guard by a one-two punch: increased Middle East tensions and hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Bitcoin led the way lower, dropping to $103,556 — its worst one-day performance in June—while Ethereum, Solana, and the rest of the majors lagged behind in a bout of compelled selling. Where the Pain Was Worst: Exchange Breakdown Binance was hit hardest in the carnage, with $458 million in liquidations — over 91% of longs. Bybit wasn't too far behind, at $375 million worth of liquidations, close to 94% of longs. OKX and Gate each lost over $125 million, with HTX, Coinex, BitMEX, and Bitfinex finishing off the list with dozens of millions more. These were mostly losses from speculators who were betting on a continued rally — only to be surprised by the sudden geopolitical and macroeconomic storm. Bitcoin lost $446 million in long liquidations alone, with Ethereum losing $303 million. Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all experienced tens of millions of forced sells, demonstrating just how widespread and severe the pain was across the market. Why Leveraged Longs Are Still High — and Vulnerable Despite repeated warnings, the leverage hunger has not abated. BTC and ETH funding rates have remained positive, which means the traders continue to be strongly speculating on the higher side — even as volatilities have risen. This ongoing optimism provided the context for a traditional liquidation cascade: when prices fell, stop-losses and margin calls triggered a domino effect, which fueled the sell-off and closed out more positions at each major support. How Liquidation Cascades Shape the Market With so many traders on one side of the ship, a little shake will send the market into chaos. The numbers indicate that the first $20 million in liquidations arrived within an hour after the breaking news, but as selling snowballed out of control, nearly $1 billion was lost in just 12 hours. This feedback mechanism — where all liquidation induces further selling — is why crypto corrections are so brutal and why heatmap tools are now an indispensable tool for risk management. “If BTC drops to $92K, bulls could lose $8B more. Watch the heatmap.” — @CoinGlass, June 13, 2025 Heatmaps not only show where the pain was — they show where it is likely to be next. According to recent data, if BTC dips to $92,500, over $8.4 billion of long positions would be liquidated, which would be a critical ”pain point” for bulls. A breakout higher towards $121,900 would short-squeeze, which could unleash a short squeeze of nearly $14 billion. Hedging Ahead of the FOMC: What Traders Can Do Now Since the Federal Reserve's FOMC sits on June 18, volatility has hardly ceased. Historically, FOMC announcement days are marked by sharp spikes in crypto market volatility since rate decisions and forward guidance are reacted to by traders. Many individuals are now reducing exposure, contracting stops, or buying put options to hedge against further downside. Institutional desks are seeing increasing demand for downside protection, with traders targeting deep out-of-the-money puts as insurance against another liquidation cascade. The broader macro environment — rising inflation, geopolitical tension, and uncertainty regarding the Fed's policy — makes risk management more critical than ever before. Traders need to watch the funding rates, heatmaps, and the all-important support levels, and stay alert for the sentiment shifts as the Fed announcement approaches. The Bottom Line The $1.16 billion liquidation event is a testament to the dangers of a highly levered, sentiment-driven market. As war news and inflation reads collide with packed derivatives bets, only the ones that manage risk and watch the heatmaps will make it through the next leg. With the FOMC lined up, expect more fireworks—and remember: in crypto, the only thing certain is volatility.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9570/derivatives-bloodbath-1-16-b-liquidated-amid-global-turmoil,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T15:38:28,"Once XRP Breaks Through This Red Zone, Analyst Says It Will Rip to the Upside","XRP may be poised for a major move , not in isolation, but in how it performs against Bitcoin. According to crypto analyst Xoom, a key resistance level on the XRP/BTC chart, dubbed the “red zone,” could soon give way. If that happens, XRP is expected to “rip to the upside,” marking a decisive shift in momentum after months of stagnation. Xoom’s latest insight, shared on X, highlights this crucial area that has consistently rejected XRP’s past attempts to break higher. Yet, this time, the setup looks different. With volume building and Bitcoin dominance showing early signs of cooling off, many believe XRP’s long-awaited surge relative to Bitcoin may be approaching. The Red Zone Xoom’s analysis zeroes in on a range on the XRP/BTC chart that typically lies between 0.000012 and 0.000015 BTC. This level has historically served as a strong resistance barrier, halting upward movement and sparking selloffs. However, every time XRP has managed to break through it, notably in 2017, 2021, and briefly in 2023, the result was a fast, powerful rally. Once XRP breaks through the red zone on XRP/BTC… it rips to the upside. pic.twitter.com/iuMTBDM3HJ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) June 14, 2025 The term “red zone” reflects not just the technical ceiling, but also the psychological weight this region carries for traders. Each failed attempt to push through has made the zone even more significant, and now, XRP is once again pressing up against it. According to Xoom, once this barrier is breached, there may be little standing in the way of a major upside move. XRP/BTC: Why It Matters While many focus on XRP’s price in U.S. dollars, the XRP/BTC pair often provides a clearer picture of its strength in the broader crypto market. A breakout here would signal that XRP is outperforming Bitcoin, something that historically attracts fresh capital from traders rotating out of BTC and into high-utility altcoins. A decisive break above the red zone would likely trigger increased trading volume, bullish momentum, and renewed institutional interest. It would also mark the end of XRP’s extended underperformance relative to Bitcoin, a trend that has weighed on investor confidence in recent months. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Momentum Meets Macro Catalysts A fundamental factor is that the drawn-out legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may soon come to a close. The parties have already refiled for settlement following Judge Torres’ procedural rejection of the first filing. A finalized resolution could act as a major catalyst, lifting legal uncertainty that has long suppressed XRP’s price action. Taken together, XRP’s improving fundamentals and the tightening XRP/BTC structure set the stage for a potential breakout. For Xoom and many others, the message is clear: once XRP breaks through this red zone, the move won’t be gradual. It will be swift, sharp, and likely to catch the market off guard. After months of pressure, XRP may finally be ready to explode . And if it does, as Xoom warns, it won’t just edge upward, it will rip.

In May, the Crypto timing model by Weiss Crypto Ratings, a cryptocurrency tracking and analysis platform, outlined a bullish outlook for the asset. A week later, the asset hit a new ATH with a price value of $111,886. This time, the model is painting yet another bullish case scenario for the cryptocurrency market. As seen on its official page on Twitter, now known as X, Weiss shared that its model forecasts an incoming trend pattern expected to occur in the last quarter of the year. The Crypto timing model points to November as when the market is most likely to experience a 4-year-cycle high. According to our Crypto Timing Model, we’ll likely see the 4-year-cycle high in November. — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) June 9, 2025 Is the 4-year market cycle still valid? For starters, Crypto has followed a 4-year pattern—a market movement pattern driven by the Bitcoin halving event. The trend typically ushers the market into periods of major losses and gains. As experienced during the 4-year cycle, an accumulation phase precedes a bear market, and a bullish phase follows right after. The 2011-2013 market cycle launched the trend, which has been observed for over a decade. Although experts claim that the presence of institutional investors has disrupted the cycle, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin and the broader market perform in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the big bull is trading at $103,091 at report time. The global crypto market correction brought a notable price pump recorded by a handful of top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin bulls appear to be making a much-needed recovery, as daily gains briefly surged, sending Bitcoin to an intraday high of $107,000 on June 9. Glassnode describes the price jump as a move “likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations,” adding that the negative funding rates from the previous week point to an increase in short appetite, resulting in today’s short squeeze.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/after-successfully-predicting-an-all-time-high-for-bitcoin-this-crypto-timing-model-points-to-rally-in-november/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare

In line with the bullish price predictions is a fresh outlook from a market expert focused on alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. According to João Wedson, the founder of crypto investment platform Alphractal and a verified author at Crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, the long-awaited altcoin season is already in motion. In a post shared on X, the analyst informs his 6,000 followers that a handful of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. As such, the market could soon witness a massive price rally within the broader altcoin market. “An Altcoin Season is happening right now! Altcoin Seasons can unfold within hours, days, or weeks — and we can’t afford to miss these opportunities.” He wrote. As displayed in the altcoin and Bitcoin index chart shared by the market expert, many altcoins appear to be trading at a higher volume than Bitcoin this June. More specifically, 47 of 56 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 900 minutes. The trend signals renewed interest in the altcoin market, suggesting a price rally might be closer than expected. However, the analyst maintains that the bears have not fully exited the market as market volatility is expected to continue. “Take advantage of it [the altcoin season], because the coming days will bring high volatility and great opportunities.” He added. XRP and Ether bulls remain wide awake despite heightened volatility Most altcoins within the top 50 category are trading in red at report time. However, leading altcoin Ether and XRP appear to have successfully retained gains from the previous week. Ether and XRP have emerged as the highest gainers, with 7-day gains of 2.62% and 3.85%, respectively.

Trading between $108,600 and $110,200, Bitcoin’s steady climb reflects strong institutional interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03. Having raised $10,600,000 with over 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders, this altcoin promises a 100% return at its $0.06 launch. Investors are buzzing about its potential to hit $5 post-launch. Let’s explore Bitcoin’s current dynamics and why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto pick. Bitcoin faces key resistance Bitcoin is battling resistance between $110,000 and $112,000. Prices hold steady above $108,000, with a 3% gain recently. Institutional inflows, particularly into crypto ETFs, fuel this momentum. Funds saw $167 billion in May, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Global economic shifts, like rising bond yields and a weaker dollar, push investors toward Bitcoin. Regulatory talks, including the CLARITY Act, signal a maturing crypto market. However, crypto charts show traders hedging against pullbacks, as negative funding rates hint at caution. If Bitcoin breaks $112,000, new highs are possible. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh opportunity in this vibrant market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds in phase 5 of its presale. Priced at $0.03, up 200% from the $0.01 opening phase, it guarantees a 100% return at the $0.06 launch. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price jump to $0.035, narrowing the early-entry window. The project has raised $10,600,000, with 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders onboard. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, a 9,900% increase from today’s price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s utility-driven model sets it apart in the crypto market. Furthermore, its innovative approach to lending captivates investors seeking high-yield opportunities. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income with dynamic interest rates. This ensures lenders gain more while borrowers pay less. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct, intermediary-free lending, promoting transparency and user control. Built on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin resists algorithmic instability, ensuring secure transactions. Layer-2 integration enhances speed and cuts fees, making it user-friendly. Consequently, this robust infrastructure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leader in crypto investment, offering practical solutions for modern DeFi challenges. Security and community engagement The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has finalized a Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and zero security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. The team also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. A $100,000 giveaway excites the community, splitting $10,000 among 10 winners. Eligible participants need a $50 presale investment and must complete all entry steps. This initiative strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal as a top crypto pick. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market due to its immediate utility. Unlike many tokens, its beta platform launches alongside the token, allowing instant asset deposits and interest earnings. Revenue from stablecoin borrowing supports the treasury, which buys back MUTM tokens, boosting demand without diluting supply. This strategic tokenomics drives long-term value. Bitcoin’s $110,000 resistance highlights market caution, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a bold alternative.

Key Takeaways: GameStop upsized its convertible note offering to $2.25B, with a 32.5% premium conversion price. The company holds 4,710 BTC but remains noncommittal about future crypto purchases. Proceeds may fund investments or acquisitions, with trading cards now a core revenue focus. The move comes just months after a similar $1.5 billion raise in April and follows the company’s recent entry into Bitcoin. Shares of the Texas-based retailer dropped 24% over the past week, closing Friday at $22.14, despite holding steady after the announcement. GameStop’s Zero-Coupon Notes Come with 32.5% Conversion Premium The notes, which bear no interest, carry a conversion price of around $28.91 per share — a 32.5% premium over the stock’s Thursday afternoon average. The structure mirrors the strategy employed by MicroStrategy, which has used premium note offerings to expand its Bitcoin holdings without immediate dilution. GameStop first disclosed it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin in March , pushing the stock above $28 at the time. Whether the company plans to expand its crypto reserves remains uncertain. CEO Ryan Cohen has made it clear that GameStop won’t emulate other firms or signal its buying patterns. In a recent interview, he declined to say whether more BTC purchases were planned. The press release kept options open, stating that proceeds would be used for “general corporate purposes,” including investments aligned with GameStop’s investment policy and “potential acquisitions.” $GME GameStop just locked in the terms for their convertible note offering.

GameStop’s previous crypto ventures have been mixed. The company launched an NFT marketplace during the last market cycle but shut it down early last year. At its annual shareholder meeting, Cohen pivoted focus toward trading cards—now making up nearly 30% of quarterly revenue. “We’re focusing on trading cards as a natural extension of our existing business,” he said. With capital in hand and crypto already on its books, GameStop could revisit Bitcoin when market conditions align. 223 Companies Hold Bitcoin A growing list of firms is embracing Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. Last week, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

2025-06-14T15:07:33,"Here’s What Experts Think Will Send Bitcoin Above its $111,970 All-Time High","As Bitcoin makes a slow but necessary recovery following last week’s market sell-off— a move that sent the asset back to the $100,000 price level, market participants are even more observant, outlining what it would take for the big bull to break past its previous all-time high. According to an on-chain analytical piece from Glassnode, Bitcoin could surge past its all-time high of $111,970, attained in May, to hit never-before-seen price levels, “should the market enter price discovery.” Notably, Bitcoin’s current price is determined by buying and selling activities. Factors such as supply and demand, liquidity, and market sentiment are some of the determining factors observed in the price discovery process for assets like Bitcoin. According to Glassnode’s analysis, a key support level is essential for Bitcoin to maintain underlying bullish pressure. The Short-term holder cost basis—the average acquisition price of Bitcoin by crypto investors who have held the asset for 115 days or less—interestingly doubles as the aforementioned support level. As seen in Glassnode’s report ; “The $97.6k Short-Term Holder cost basis continues to serve as a pivotal support level necessary for maintaining local bullish momentum.” In contrast, the bulls are primed to retest a new ATH if the nearest resistance level is broken in the near term. “On the upside, the $115.4k zone emerges as the first significant resistance should the market enter price discovery.” The report read. After failing to sustain momentum above the $101,000 price level last week, Bitcoin bulls are making a notable comeback. Recovery gains sustained this week sent the asset to $110,300. With Bitcoin around 1.5% away from its previous all-time high, renewed interest in the asset suggests that investment confidence has been strengthened for the near term. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at $108,729, while 7-day gains surged by 4.06%.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/heres-what-experts-think-will-send-bitcoin-above-its-111970-all-time-high/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

However, the more people stake, the lower the APY drops, so invest early for higher rewards. $SNORT’s price of only $0.0951 is another selling point, turning any early investment into a potential goldmine, provided the project performs well post-launch. And, based on the project’s meme potential and utility, our analysts predict a $0.94 $SNORT in 2025 . This is already an expected growth of 886% (or 9x) post-launch. Long-term, $SNORT could perform even better, given widespread adoption, community support, and optimal development. By 2030, $SNORT could easily go to $3.25 and beyond. This translates into an ROI of 3,317% (33x), turning a $100 investment into a $3,317 profit. And with an average staking APY of 100%, your portfolio could grow to ~$6,800 in a year These numbers are supported by Snorter Token’s roadmap, detailing a promising development cycle, and the whitepaper , which explains the project’s utility and scope. To buy $SNORT , visit the presale’s official page, connect your wallet (they recommend Best Wallet ), and buy with $ETH, $USDT, $USDC, $BNB, or fiat. Should You Buy Snorter Token ($SNORT)? Going by how the presale is going (whales are showing increasing interest) and the project’s utility long-term, Snorter Token looks like a winner in our books. What we know for sure is that, if Snorter Token lives up to its expectations and experiences widespread post-launch adoption, we should see $SNORT outperform in the charts long-term. Remember, this is not financial advice. You should always do your own research before investing (DYOR) and adopt robust risk management strategies along the way.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/snorter-token-presale-reaches-1-million-as-whales-rush-to-buy/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T15:00:55,"Trump’s Crypto Effect: How The 2024 Election Sparked A Terrible Market Trend Nobody Expected","The US 2024 election sent shockwaves through the crypto world, and not in the way most analysts predicted. As Donald Trump’s campaign reignited debates around digital assets, the market reacted with sharp, unsettling twists that caught even seasoned investors off guard. Still, in the middle of the market mayhem, one surprising player is lighting up the charts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is standing tall with a fiercely loyal community and sharp tech upgrades. Its jaw-dropping price of just $0.00000035 continues to turn heads. Add in an irresistible 80% bonus with the code FLOPPY80 , and it’s no wonder this underdog is fueling serious FOMO across the crypto scene. The Donald Trump Effect: Why The 2024 Election Sent Crypto Markets Into Overdrive When Donald Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, his return to the White House sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, significantly reshaping the trajectory of crypto and the broader market landscape. The 2024 election outcome triggered a drastic shift in market sentiment as Donald Trump adopted a decidedly pro-crypto stance, unveiling ambitious plans to make the US the “crypto capital”. He also appointed a crypto czar, dismantled restrictive regulations, and reportedly even used federal policy to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve—all signaling to the market that Donald Trump meant business with crypto. As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes $112,000, social data shows the most bullish crypto chatter since Donald Trump won the 2024 election, hinting at rising market euphoria and a potential crypto cooldown. Yet this market momentum carries risks, as hedge funds warn of a crypto bubble fueled by Donald Trump’s crypto agenda, with the 2024 election injecting fresh volatility into a market still adjusting to his return. In essence, the 2024 election has transformed the market dynamics of crypto, with Donald Trump at the center, rewriting rules around crypto, igniting price climbs, and challenging the market to balance excitement with caution. Forget The Noise: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Stands Tall In Donald Trump’s Crypto Turmoil With 80% Bonus While the broader crypto market reels from post-2024 election volatility tied to Donald Trump’s bold agenda, one unexpected altcoin is flipping the script— FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Defying the uncertain climate, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is capturing attention with a smart Floppynomics, AI-powered utility, and tax-free trading. Its clever blend of meme culture and community perks—like staking rewards, loyalty incentives, and SolidProof-audited security—offers a refreshing contrast to the current chaos. Even in a market rattled by Donald Trump-fueled speculation, FloppyPepe (FPPE) adds real-world value with: 1% rewards to holders • 1% donation to real-world causes • 1% burn for lasting scarcity The 80% bonus won’t last forever — code FLOPPY80 is live now, offering early access before the next price jump pushes latecomers to the sidelines. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Sets The Stage With Meme Tech, Market Utility, And Big Listings Ahead Beyond the 80% bonus, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is charging forward with a unique blend of AI tools and meme mastery, offering features like Meme-o-Matic for instant viral content on Telegram, FloppyX for trend-based video creation, and FloppyAI , which delivers real-time crypto insights to help users stay sharp in a rapidly shifting market. As the crypto market reels from post-2024 election volatility and Donald Trump’s bold return to the political stage, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is entering a breakout moment. With Phase 3 of its roadmap underway, the project is preparing for its Uniswap debut, set to open up smooth global trading. Meanwhile, aggressive plans for top-tier CEX listings aim to deepen liquidity, expand global reach, and solidify FloppyPepe (FPPE) as a serious player amid Donald Trump-era market uncertainty. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ignites The Market: Massive Presale Gains And A Bonus On The Line FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining serious traction, with nearly $2.4 million already raised and close to $1 million secured in its private sale, selling out in less than 24 hours. Currently priced at just $0.00000035, this meme-fueled AI token offers a rare chance to enter early with massive upside potential. The 80% bonus, still available with code FLOPPY80 , won’t last much longer as momentum continues to build.

2025-06-14T14:50:00,"Pocket Network, Status, MAP Protocol, Sky crypto price predictions","The crypto market made some improvements today, June 14, as investors bought the dip following Friday’s crash. Bitcoin price held steady above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens rose to $3.4 trillion. This article provides a forecast of top cryptocurrencies like Pocket Network (POKT), Status (SNT), MAP Protocol (MAPO), and Sky (SKY). Pocket Network price prediction POKT price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Pocket Network price bottomed at $0.008425 in April. This rebound happened after it went through a prolonged period of consolidation, which, in this case, was the accumulation period of the Wyckoff Theory. The POKT price then surged after Upbit, the biggest South Korean crypto exchange listed it. It also jumped after the developers rolled out a key upgrade .This surge pushed it to a high of $0.0975, its highest point since June 13 last year. Pocket Network price then pulled back amid profit-taking among crypto investors. It dropped to a low of $0.04650, its lowest point on June 9. This pullback was part of the formation of the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. This cup has a depth of about 90%. Therefore, measuring this distance from the cup’s upper side gives it a target of $0.1400, the highest swing since May 17. A drop below the support at $0.046 will invalidate the bullish view. Status price forecast SNT price chart | Source: TradingView The Status token price bottomed at $0.01598 in April as the crypto market crash happened. This was a notable level since it coincided with the lowest swing in August last year. It was the double-bottom point whose neckline was at $0.0849. Status token has moved above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since April 9. The uptrend will likely continue as long as it is above the two moving averages and the ascending trendline. The key point to watch will be at $0.056, the highest point on May 29, which is about 70% above the current level. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish view. MAP Protocol price technical analysis MAPO price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the MAP Protocol token dropped to $0.0039 in April and went through a consolidation as part of the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It then went parabolic on Friday, reaching a high of $0.010, its highest point on February 2. This surge happened after the token was added to Burrito Wallet, a leading wallet provider. MAP Protocol price remains above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Average. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards and moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the MAP Protocol token retreats in the next few days as investors take profits. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $0.0060. A move above $0.01 will invalidate the bearish MAPO forecast. Sky Protocol price forecast SKY price chart | Source: TradingView Sky Protocol, formerly known as Maker , bottomed at $0.032 in February this year. It has formed an ascending channel, comprising of a series of higher highs and higher lows since March 9. The current Sky price is slightly below the upper side of the channel. It has also moved slightly above the 50-day and 25-day EMA, while the MACD indicator has pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $0.10. The alternative scenario is where the Sky price retreats and retests the lower side of of the channel at $0.070.

The president filed his public financial disclosure to the US Office of Government Ethics, declaring that he holds 15.75B $WLFI tokens, the native cryptocurrency of WLF. Interestingly, though, no details were provided as to how this income was generated. Was it through sale or staking, or any other mechanism? We don’t know. Read to know more about WLF and Trump’s pro-crypto approach. We’ll also suggest the best altcoins you can buy now to rake in a handsome income yourself. Price jumps, staking, we’ve covered it all. Trump’s Crypto Empire: From Stablecoins to Meme Tokens World Liberty Financial is a decentralized project focusing on open and on-chain infrastructure with special attention to dollar-pegged stablecoins. It has also issued $USD1, a new stablecoin similar to $USDT and $USDC. The project has raised around $550M in token sales so far. It’s worth noting that the Trump family has a 75% share in the net revenues of this project, with 60% ownership in WLF Holdco LLC through DT Marks DEFI LLC. Overall, the Trump family owns 22.5B out of the total 100B $WLFI token supply. Besides WLFI, Trump had also launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, just before his appointment as the president. It was under him that the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in the US . He also announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve . In addition to being a boon for the crypto industry, Trump has made a decent return from crypto himself. If you want to become an ace crypto player just like him, here are some cryptos worth investing in right now . 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Altcoin to Buy If You’re Looking for Explode-Worthy Tokens Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best cryptos to buy now , seeing as it’s leading the DeFi revolution by being the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana. Solana’s troubles with scalability began soon after the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, two hyper-successful meme coins that flooded the blockchain with new investors. This resulted in periods of sudden spikes in transaction requests, which Solana couldn’t handle, serving up one failed transaction after another. Solaxy’s brand-new L2 for Solana will address this by offloading a chunk of the network’s transactions onto a sidechain. This will reduce the burden on Solana, allowing it to function like the good old days. Additionally, Solaxy has also designed its L2 to process multiple transactions simultaneously. This will reduce the per-transaction cost, further driving up Solana’s cost-efficiency. Now, here’s the real kicker: Solaxy is predicted to explode over 11,300% and reach $0.20 by 2030. If you wish to ride Solana’s newfound vigor and Solaxy’s promise, buy $SOLX now for just $0.001758. Oh, and the project has in total raised nearly $50M, so you’ll be buying into the best crypto presale of 2025. But hurry up because the presale ends in less than 2 days. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Revolutionizing Bitcoin with a Layer 2 Solution, Highest Staking Rewards If you’re looking for a new crypto that can earn you a significant amount of passive income via staking, look no further than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Currently in presale, $HYPER is offering early investors 613% p.a. as staking rewards. It’s worth mentioning, though, that this rate is dynamic and will keep decreasing as the presale progresses. So, buy Bitcoin Hyper as early as possible. One token is currently selling for just $0.011875, and besides staking rewards, you’ll also stand a chance to make around 2,100% in gains. That’s because $HYPER is predicted to shoot up to $0.253 by 2030 . Powered by a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER connects with Bitcoin Layer 1 through a Canonical Bridge. It works by converting L1 $BTC into L2 ‘wrapped’ $BTC, which can be used to access decentralized applications, Web3, and gaming dApps, as well as speed up transactions on them. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper wants to breathe new life into the aging Bitcoin blockchain by speeding up transactions, lowering fees, and offering improved DeFi access. 3. Jelly-My-Jelly ($JELLYJELLY) – Viral Meme Coin Starting Fresh Rally Jelly-My-Jelly is the brainchild of Venmo’s co-founder, Iqram Magdon-Ismail, and a crypto investor, Sam Lessin. It’s worth noting that the ‘utility’ behind $JELLYJELLY is that it offers token holders early-bird access to an upcoming video-sharing app that will supposedly be the fastest way to post clips from a video chat. However, it has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos , mainly due to hype and backing from the degen community. $JELLYJELLY is up more than 17% over the past seven days – and a chunky 57% over the past year – with each token currently available for a low price of $0.02902. Wrapping Up Donald Trump’s massive $57.3M income from World Liberty Financial tokens is undoubtedly a strong signal of crypto’s bold embrace at the highest level. If you wish to replicate Trump’s crypto success, look at high-potential tokens like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are subject to market risks. None of the above is financial advice, and you should only invest after doing your own research.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-mimic-trumps-57-4m-crypto-income-price-jumps-staking-and-other-rewards/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T14:37:04,"Bitcoin Holder GameStop Upsizes Convertible Debt Offering To $2.25 Billion Amid BTC Acquisition Plans","GameStop announced an increase in its previously disclosed offering of convertible senior notes. The company upsized its latest convertible debt offering to $2.25 billion from $1.75 billion , signaling a deeper commitment to establishing its corporate BTC treasury. GameStop Increases Note Sales To $2.25B For Potential Bitcoin Buys GameStop said in a press release published late on Thursday that it would be offering investors more convertible bonds, following a similar multi-billion-dollar raise in March. The $2.25 billion offering targets “qualified institutional buyers” and is expected to close on June 15, 2032, unless converted or repurchased earlier. The embattled video game retailer’s latest batch of convertible bonds, which will carry no interest, will have a conversion price of roughly $28.91 per share, which may change “in some events.” The conversion price of the notes represents a 32.5% premium compared to the company’s average stock price on June 12. GameStop will also allow initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $450 million in notes within 13 days of the initial issuance. Companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) have been able to boost the amount of Bitcoin they own per share by raising funds at a premium relative to their BTC stash and putting that cash into the benchmark crypto. The company, which owns over 582,000 BTC — nearly 3% of the token’s total possible supply — has seen its stock rocket by over 900% in the past year, in the wake of Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs. Whether GameStop will make another Bitcoin purchase is less clear. Though the company indicated that it intends to use the net proceeds of the latest convertible debt offering for “general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy,” which may signal more Bitcoin purchases from the video game behemoth. Following the March announcement of the Bitcoin treasury strategy, GameStop raised $1.5 billion through another convertible note offering. The company subsequently purchased 4,710 Bitcoins for roughly $500 million in May.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holder-gamestop-upsizes-convertible-debt-offering-to-2-25-billion-amid-btc-acquisition-plans/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

In new filings with the Massachusetts state government, Chase says at least four customers in the state are affected by multiple breaches. In two incidents, Chase says employees improperly accessed customers’ credit and debit card information and triggered fraudulent transactions, prompting the bank to close the affected cards, issue replacements, and reimburse the customers. In the other two incidents, the bank says it mistakenly posted transaction details, including names, addresses, account numbers, and transaction amounts, to other customers’ accounts. At this point, no misuse due to those errors has been detected. Meanwhile, Bank of America says documentation relating to at least one customer’s savings bonds was lost in transit on February 14th. Attempts to recover the documentation, according to the North Carolina-based lender, have proved unsuccessful. “According to our records, the information involved in this incident was related to your Savings Bonds and included your first and last name, address, Social Security number, and account number.” The lender says it is monitoring the customer’s banking account for any suspicious activity and is committed to resolving any unauthorized transactions. Lastly, TD Bank says a former employee improperly accessed a customer’s personal information between December of 2024 and January of 2025. The information may have included the customer’s name, address, phone number, social security number, account number, and transactional data. TD Bank says it’s monitoring the account for fraud and is offering the customer a complimentary two year membership to an identity theft protection and recovery service.

2025-06-14T14:30:00,"Rumble: Crypto Pivot Doesn't Move The Needle","Summary Rumble's user growth has stalled since late 2022, despite content deals and the 2024 election boost proving fleeting. Revenue totals remain far below expectations, and content partnerships like Barstool Sports failed to deliver meaningful user growth. The company's crypto pivot, including a Tether investment and upcoming wallet, is limited in scope and hasn't translated into business momentum. The stock trades at an expensive 22x 2026 sales estimates without profitability or real growth. Rumble Inc. ( RUM ) once offered the promise of developing into a major online video streaming player, but lately the company is focused on a crypto shift. The business has failed to garner any momentum due to other sites relaxing free speech concerns, originally driving the business model. My investment thesis remains ultra-Bearish on the stock due to the lack of growth and the very expensive valuation. Source: Finviz Online Video Stalling The stock popped on the company announcing pivots towards crypto, since Rumble hasn't actually accomplished anything in the non-video realm. The big question is whether the crypto business will actually amount to something. For Q1'25, Rumble only reported 59 million global monthly average users (MAUs), up from the last March quarter. In reality though, the online video platform hasn't seen any growth in users since the Q4'22 U.S. mid-terms. Source: Rumble Q1'25 10-Q Elon Musk bought Twitter back in October 2022 and the whole free speech benefits of the online video platform disappeared. Rumble has signed substantial content deals in the ensuing years without any meaningful change in the user base. Even in the 2024 Presidential elections with a Rumble user like Donald Trump winning the election, the platform only produced 68 million MAUs, versus 67 million in the prior Q4. Rumble reported Q1'25 revenues of $23 million, up a solid 34% from last Q1, but still far below all original forecasts for the business when completing the SPAC deal. Data by YCharts Rumble still spent $30 million in Q1 on cost of services, even with content costs down $3 million. The company spent substantial amounts on trying to build up the platform via minimum guarantees for new content, but most content creators have much higher followers on other media platforms. Barstool Sports is a prime example of a media outlet doing a deal with Rumble for content, yet the user base remained meager on the platform. The sports media company only has 60K followers on Rumble versus 6.5 million on Twitter/X and another 1.9 million on YouTube, causing a failure to re-up the agreement after a year. Rumble probably wisely signed some content deals to make the platform more legitimate, but organic content creators are what is ultimately needed. Barstool Sports was promised as a partner promoting Rumble as their video home, but the partnership didn't last. Crypto Pivot Going back to December, Rumble obtained a $775 million investment from Tether. Also, the company bought bitcoin during the March quarter and ended Q1 with a balance of 211 bitcoins with a current value of $22 million based on a price of $105K each. The crypto pivot is far from over with the intent to launch a crypto wallet in Q3. The Rumble Wallet is intended to compete with options from Coinbase ( COIN ), but the prime use is to pay content creators, especially in international locations. At the end of the day, Rumble has a very limited crypto pivot with a future Rumble Wallet more for payment transfers, though additional crypto features can be built out in the future. The company used the $775 million investment from Tether to immediately turnaround and acquire $525 million worth of shares at a price of $7.50, providing just $250 million in cash for the business. Source: Rumble Q1'25 10-Q Rumble has a diluted share count of around 400 million shares now, for a market cap of ~$3.5 billion. The consensus analyst forecasts for 2026 revenues of just $154 million, so the stock trades at nearly 22x sales estimates for a company still not profitable, nor growing at a very fast clip. The stock might have some support here around $8.50 with strong recent support down to $7. The key is that Rumble likely doesn't have much upside, at lease sustainable upside, without any actual business with growth. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Rumble is still priced like a booming business in either online video streaming and crypto, yet the company has generally stalled for a couple of years now.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794856-rumble-crypto-pivot-doesnt-move-the-needle?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDT","RUM",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T14:20:24,"France eyes Bitcoin mining as means to manage energy","A group of lawmakers has set out to make France consider Bitcoin mining, particularly as a means to manage its massive electricity system and strengthen its energy sovereignty. A legislative proposal to that end has been put forward in Paris, and its authors hope the government will accept to assess the potential of crypto-related activity in other areas as well. While countries around the world have either tried to suppress cryptocurrency mining, as was the case with China a few years ago, or let it grow, like the United States , for example, France is yet to make up its mind about the industry and what it wants from it. France trying to find its place in the crypto mining space Several members of the French parliament have decided to speed up the decision-making process in Paris. They are now suggesting the country should estimate the potential of Bitcoin mining, at least as a tool to improve the management of power generation. France may well be taking a step toward the pro-mining camp, the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin noted in an article on Saturday. The piece is devoted to the lawmakers’ attempt to trigger a debate on the matter in the National Assembly. On Friday, the group of parliamentarians presented a draft amendment to the law on “National programming and regulatory simplification in the energy sector” that requires the government to assess if France needs to develop domestic Bitcoin mining and report back to the legislature. The key goal of the motion is to study whether the minting of digital currencies could be employed as a means to better manage the EU nation’s electricity system, the largest in Europe. The sponsors of the bill elaborated: “This amendment aims to objectify, through an evaluation report submitted to the Parliament, the conditions under which Bitcoin mining could be used as a tool to serve the French electricity system.” France is the leading producer and exporter of electrical energy in the region, largely due to its massive nuclear power sector. The latter accounts for over 70% of its generated electricity, with renewables and fossil fuels providing the rest. Bitcoin mining can help utilize surplus electricity in France Another debate that has been going on in the French society is how to make the largely state-owned nuclear power industry more efficient. A big part of it is the need to optimize the management of the surplus electricity production. The authors of the new legislation believe that Bitcoin mining can provide a unique solution as “it is highly flexible” and “has no impact on the continuity of supply.” In that regard, they are highlighting some of its “technical advantages.” Crypto mining machines can be started and stopped quickly and activated on demand, depending on production and consumption peaks. Bitcoin farms can be installed near production facilities, even in the most isolated areas. Furthermore, the lawmakers are convinced that building a low-carbon crypto mining sector in France, under the supervision of public authorities, could bring abandoned industrial sites back to life and strengthen the country’s energy sovereignty while supporting innovation. The report sums up the positives of cryptocurrency mining in France: “In short: an activity that can adapt to the constraints of the electricity system, absorb energy surpluses, reduce negative prices on wholesale markets, and relieve the burden on nuclear power plants by avoiding overly frequent modulation cycles, which accelerate wear and tear on the installations.” While the upcoming parliamentary debate on the amendment is just a first step that needs to translate into concrete actions by the French government, “the evaluation process will help inform future policy choices based on energy sovereignty, industrial innovation, and network resilience,” the MPs remarked. The amendment has been developed in partnership with ADAN , France’s Association for the Development of Digital Assets. The industry organization has been a driving force behind proposals concerning the regulation, taxation, and mining of cryptocurrencies in the country. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Altcoin Season Index at 26 confirms Bitcoin dominance as altcoins lag in exchange activity. Over 30 U.S. altcoin ETF filings in 2025 fuel optimism for a potential “altcoin summer.” According to recent data, although the prices of cryptocurrencies have been fluctuating dramatically, altcoin holders have not panicked and have not rushed to withdraw their tokens from exchanges.

2025-06-14T14:12:40,"War Escalation Sends Bitcoin to $103K Amid Massive Liquidations","Bitcoin’s dramatic plunge to $103,000 on Friday sent shockwaves through global markets, as Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets triggered a sharp flight from risk assets. The escalation — marking the most significant military confrontation in the Middle East in years — sparked more than $1 billion in crypto liquidations, with over 246,000 traders wiped out in just hours. Yet, beneath the panic, on-chain data reveals a powerful countermove: large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” have quietly ramped up their accumulation, hinting that this crash may be setting the stage for a classic V-shaped recovery. War, Oil, and a Crypto Crash As news broke of Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile sites, global investors scrambled for safety. Gold surged past $3,400 an ounce, oil prices spiked nearly 8%, and equities from Europe to Asia tumbled. Bitcoin, often touted as “digital gold,” failed to play its safe-haven role in the immediate aftermath, plunging from $107,000 to a low of $103,000 before rebounding slightly as Asian markets opened. Ethereum and Solana followed suit, each losing 6–7% in a single session. The fear wasn’t just about bombs and missiles. Analysts warned that if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz — a chokepoint for 20% of the world’s oil shipments — energy prices could skyrocket and risk assets like crypto would “fall off a cliff”. The market’s reaction was swift and brutal: over $1.14 billion in positions were liquidated, with longs making up the vast majority of the losses. Binance alone saw a $201 million BTC-USDT position wiped out, underscoring the scale of the panic. But Who’s Buying the Dip? Whale Accumulation Tells a Different Story While retail traders fled, blockchain analytics tell a more nuanced story. According to CryptoQuant, newly created whale wallets — each holding over 1,000 BTC — have accumulated more than 600,000 BTC (roughly $63 billion) in the past three months, doubling their share of the circulating supply. These are not legacy holders, but fresh capital, likely from institutional investors positioning for a medium- to long-term rebound. In the hours after the crash, Glassnode tracked 17,000 BTC moving into accumulation addresses, echoing the whale behavior seen during the 2020 COVID crash and the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war. History Rhymes: Bitcoin’s War-Time Price Shocks and Rebounds Bitcoin’s reaction to war and crisis has always been volatile — but history suggests sharp drops are often followed by equally dramatic recoveries. During the 2020 COVID crash, BTC lost half its value in days, only to surge 583% over the next year. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Bitcoin initially dropped 20%, but rebounded 65% within two months. Even during the October 2024 Israel-Hamas flare-up, BTC fell 8.4% before rallying 22% in just 48 hours. This pattern — panic selling followed by whale accumulation and a strong rebound—has become a hallmark of Bitcoin’s behavior in times of crisis. Analysts now point to these precedents as reasons for optimism, even as geopolitical risks remain high. Technical Picture: Key Levels in Focus Technically, Bitcoin’s fate in the coming days hinges on a handful of critical levels. The $100,000 mark is not just a psychological barrier, but also aligns with the 50-day exponential moving average and recent support from early May. Should BTC hold above this zone, analysts expect a retest of the $110,000–$112,000 range, which marked the all-time high just weeks ago. A daily close above $106,500 would confirm bullish momentum and a potential V-shaped recovery, while a break below $100,000 could open the door to deeper losses, with $92,000 as the next major support. A Market at the Crossroads: Fear, Opportunity, and the Next Move Despite the chaos, Bitcoin’s ability to rebound above $104,000 by the end of the day hints at underlying resilience. Traditional markets, by contrast, saw steeper losses, with investors piling into gold and safe-haven currencies. As the dust settles, the focus now shifts to Iran’s response and the potential for further escalation — or de-escalation — in the region. For now, the data shows that while retail sentiment remains shaky, the “smart money” is quietly positioning for a rebound. If history is any guide, those who buy into fear may once again be rewarded — so long as global tensions don’t spiral further out of control.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9568/war-escalation-sends-bitcoin-to-103-k-amid-massive-liquidations,"BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T14:07:50,"Centralized Bitcoin (BTC) Treasuries Now Hold Nearly 1/3 of Total Supply","Centralized Bitcoin treasuries now hold 30.9% of the total circulating supply, according to a new report by Gemini. This concentration, which spans across 216 entities that include governments, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public and private companies, centralized exchanges, and DeFi contracts, ultimately indicates growing institutional maturity and adoption. The total amount of BTC held by major institutional and custodial entities has skyrocketed to 6,145,207 BTC today, which represents a whopping 924% increase over the past decade. This rapid growth demonstrates how centralized players have steadily accumulated a larger share of the network’s supply, reshaping Bitcoin’s ownership structure in favor of institutional dominance. Market Maturation According to a joint report by Gemini and Glassnode, just three entities dominate Bitcoin adoption across most institutional categories, holding between 65% and 90% of total BTC holdings. This concentration reflected how early entrants shaped the strategic direction and legitimacy of Bitcoin within institutional finance. On the other hand, private company holdings are more evenly distributed, which indicates a broader base of adoption at that level. While such dominance may decrease as institutional participation expands, the early leaders continue to play a central role in driving capital inflows and positioning Bitcoin as a credible macro asset in traditional finance. Custody has slowly shifted away from centralized exchanges toward ETFs, funds, and DeFi protocols, which now serve as primary gateways for spot market access. While balances on centralized exchanges have declined over the past two years, this does not signal a tightening supply. Instead, most of that Bitcoin has moved into custodial vehicles like US spot ETFs. The combined holdings of these spot custodians have remained relatively stable and range between 3.9 million and 4.2 million BTC since June 2021. This is indicative of a reallocation rather than a reduction in circulating supply. Despite the stability in total holdings, these custodians exert significant influence on price action, driven by their sensitivity to market shifts. Monthly inflows and outflows can swing dramatically, by as much as $10 billion, which makes these entities key players in BTC’s short-term trajectory, even as the overall structure of the spot market becomes more institutionalized and regulated. Sovereign BTC Treasuries Government-held Bitcoin reserves have grown significantly, particularly in the US, China, the U.K., and Germany, where most acquisitions come through legal enforcement rather than market purchases. The US stands out with more than 200,000 BTC, largely sourced from major law enforcement seizures. These include 69,369 BTC taken from the Silk Road case in November 2027 and 94,643 BTC recovered from the Bitfinex hack in February 2022. After a brief decline, a portion of the US government’s remaining balance was formally converted into a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) following an executive order by President Donald Trump on March 6th. In the UK, Bitcoin has been seized by the National Crime Agency through operations targeting cybercriminals. China, after banning crypto activities, confiscated over 194,000 BTC in November 2020 in its crackdown on the PlusToken Ponzi scheme. Germany also accumulated Bitcoin through criminal investigations, but officially liquidated all its holdings by April 29th. These sovereign holdings form a unique category in the crypto ecosystem: largely dormant, yet capable of influencing markets if moved.

2025-06-14T14:00:00,"HIVE Digital: Great Seasonality And A Bullish Chart Setup","Summary HIVE's price has dropped, but the value proposition is now even stronger with a bullish technical setup and clear line in the sand. Seasonality is favorable for HIVE in June and July, and revenue/earnings estimates have improved significantly since January. HIVE's mining capacity and efficiency are set to surge, with major growth expected in both Bitcoin mining and HPC/AI segments. Valuation is extremely attractive on both price-to-sales and tangible book value, supporting my reiterated strong buy rating. Back in January, I covered small-cap Bitcoin miner HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) , calling it a strong buy at the time. I had my reasons, including firm price support at $2.80. That didn’t work out, however, as the massive slide in equities globally into the April low saw HIVE blow right through $2.80 on the way to $1.26. Events like that are why we use stops, and why we don’t become bag holders. At any rate, this stock is well-off from where I called it a strong buy; has my view changed? Not really, and below I’ll detail why the value proposition is even better today than it was five months ago. An Extremely Bullish Setup I recognize my last call was wrong, and that’s fine; it happens. I noted the line in the sand was $2.80, and if you sold at that point, your losses were minimized. Today, my line in the sand is the rising 50-day SMA, which we can see below in blue. StockCharts That level is currently $1.77, which is 12 cents below where the stock closed on Friday. It’s also rising, so it will gradually drift higher as the days go on. I would not hold HIVE under that line. Now, why do I say this is extremely bullish? We have a series of higher lows, two rising moving averages, and the 20-day EMA ahead of the 50-day SMA. So long as the 50-day SMA holds on any pullbacks, this is a textbook uptrend setup. The momentum indicators are mixed. The PPO is bullish, the RSI is neutral, and the Chaikin Money Flow index is bearish. With that in mind, I’d become more bullish if we had a sustained move in the RSI ahead of 60, and a reading above zero on the CMF. But for now, the price chart itself is enough for me, and I really like this chart. Bullish Seasonality And A Stock That’s Just Too Cheap Before we look at the fundamentals, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention seasonality. HIVE has only been public for a few years, but have a look at June and July. Seeking Alpha Returns are hugely positive for this time of year, lending credence to the idea that if you’re going to own HIVE, you really couldn’t select a better time. The opposite is true of August and September, so that’s something to watch for, but the chart and seasonality are lining up nicely. Let’s kick things off with a look at where estimates stand. Seeking Alpha The last three revisions have been down, which is obviously not something we want. I will say, however, that when I covered HIVE in January, estimates for 2027 were for just 27 cents in earnings; that’s gone all the way to 41 cents today. Similarly, estimates for 2025 have risen from a loss of 24 cents to a loss of 16 cents. Revenue estimates have exploded higher as well, with 2026 sales rising from $221M to $360M today. In other words, unless these estimates are just nowhere close to reality, HIVE has gotten enormously cheaper in the last five months. HIVE has now also passed 10EH/s in peak hashrate. The company expects 11.5EH/s by the end of this month, on its way to 25EH/s by the end of its Q4. In addition to ramping to 25EH/s, efficiency is set to rise pretty significantly as well. Investor presentation Today’s efficiency is something like 18 J/TH, but it should improve to 16.5 later this year. That helps reduce mining costs, which boosts mining margins. Investor presentation This table is illustrative of what HIVE’s mining operations could look like once it’s fully built out at 25EH/s. At the current Bitcoin price, HIVE expects mining margin of about $330M annually. At $150K per Bitcoin, it’s more like $575M. HIVE’s margins are enormously dependent upon the price of Bitcoin, as is any company that mines anything (gold, silver, copper, etc.). If you’re bullish on HIVE, you are bullish on Bitcoin. As we’re looking at those mining margin numbers, let’s remind ourselves that HIVE’s market cap is $300M as of Friday’s close. We can see below that relative to other miners, HIVE is tiny today. That’s set to change as we reach the end of September, assuming HIVE’s 25EH/s capacity comes online as expected. Investor presentation Other miners are growing as well, but HIVE has the most relative growth coming based upon current info. Mining is a relative game, so HIVE is going to be much more competitive in a few months than it is today. The other piece of the equation here is that the company’s HPC and AI growth is set to be outstanding in the coming months. Investor presentation Annual recurring revenue in Q1 was $15M, but is set to be $100M by the end of this fiscal year. If HIVE gets anywhere near that, again, that’s a great growth lever for a stock with a $300M market cap. Is It Really That Cheap? HIVE’s valuation, as I mentioned above, has gotten much better. That’s true if you’re using 2027 EPS estimates, or if you’re looking at price-to-sales and tangible book value. Let’s start with P/S. TIKR Today, shares are at 1.16X forward sales. Its three-year average has been 2.56X, which is obviously a 120% premium to today’s price. I don’t see how there is any conclusion I can draw from this chart other than the stock is cheap. In addition, we can use tangible book value, and it’s unbelievably cheap there as well. TIKR The most recent TBV reported was $3.10 against a share price of $1.89. As we can see below, shares at 0.61X TBV is well below the 1.51X average. TIKR In conclusion, HIVE is absolutely very cheap. If growth plans in both Bitcoin mining and HPC come to fruition, HIVE should be even cheaper in the coming months. With a bullish setup in the chart, and what I view as a favorable fundamental backdrop aligned with a cheap valuation, I’m reiterating my strong buy rating on HIVE.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794874-hive-digital-great-seasonality-bullish-chart-setup?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","HIVE|HIVE:CA",cryptocompare

According to the Financial Times, this investment was made to support the company's Bitcoin move, which has exceeded $2 billion. The investment is notable because it comes just nine weeks after the SEC investigation into Wilson’s crypto company Cumberland concluded, after the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Cumberland in March that included allegations of being an “unregistered crypto broker.” Chicago-based DRW bought about 4 million shares of TMTG last month, according to investor records, marking one of the largest investments ever made by TMTG, which is also behind the Truth Social app. The company’s largest investor in the funding round for Bitcoin was reportedly Jane Street, with a stake of about $375 million. Related News: SEC Now Making Its Intentions Clear: High-Level Appointments Related to Cryptocurrencies DRW stated that they evaluated the investment decision based on “the benefits of holding Bitcoin in company balance sheets.” The statement said, “We have been strategically involved in the crypto asset ecosystem for decades. This transaction was evaluated entirely from this perspective.” Don Wilson has advocated for a restructuring of U.S. securities regulators, proposing the creation of “an entirely new regulatory agency” to replace the SEC and CFTC. “Wilson has long called for a clear regulatory framework,” a DRW spokesperson said. Wilson’s interest in crypto is not new. In 2015, he auctioned off 70,000 Bitcoins that the U.S. government had seized from the Silk Road. The assets are worth about $7.7 billion today.

Bitcoin, fresh from a climb to $110k, sank to almost $102k when reports of Israeli action inside Iran reached desks, and talk of deeper United States involvement amplified the slide. The drop has rekindled an old argument: can this code based asset eventually share the pedestal with bullion or blue chip assets? A growing group of strategists says yes. They view the setback as the latest echo of earlier shocks that cleared the runway for larger climbs. Each flare-up in the past left Bitcoin stronger than traditional shelters, and many expect a familiar script to unfold again.

As Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, gold broke above $1900 and Bitcoin slipped below $41,000. By early April, gold had lost that shine while Bitcoin hovered in the upper $46,000 zone, delivering the larger percentage gain and reclaiming the narrative. Analysts reading today’s tape note familiar clues. Exchange balances are shrinking, suggesting holders are moving coins to cold storage rather than capitulating. At midday Friday bids were already carrying the price back toward $105k, hinting that the rubber band has started its rebound. While there are definitely critics like Peter Schiff and many others who seem to disagree with Bitcoin being in the same league as metals like gold and silver, the sentiment seems to have been slowly shifting among major institutions already.

Questioned live on CNBC about issuing fresh debt to accumulate Bitcoin even near record levels, the MicroStrategy chair pointed to developers in Manhattan who borrow relentlessly to put new towers on land that is already expensive. That cycle, he said, is simply how productive economies grow. His company now holds a profit of over 80% on its Bitcoin treasury, evidence that the approach is more disciplined than reckless. If geopolitical tension eventually nudges governments toward neutral digital rails for settlement, Bitcoin could gain extra utility and value. Such a move has historically ignited follow-on rallies in altcoins, turning drawdowns like the current one into rare openings rather than red flags. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Stock Up On Potential Top Gainers Snorter Snorter is being built as a Telegram native sniper bot designed to execute token buys the instant liquidity is added. The project, launched a few weeks ago, aims to offer one of the fastest and most precise trading tools for Solana. It strips away every unnecessary step. There is no dashboard, no browser extension, just clean Telegram commands and the quickest execution possible through direct blockchain interaction. The upcoming features marketed by developers include a copy trading engine where users can automatically mirror the moves of high-performing wallets. The bot is also being prepared for multi-chain compatibility, starting with Solana and expanding into other ecosystems shortly after launch. It is being developed with a fee structure that aims to be lower than most competing bots, giving it a cost advantage alongside its technical speed. Snorter has not launched yet, but its presale traction suggests that interest is building fast. It is already gaining attention in trading groups and among Solana native communities that follow new tool drops closely. YouTuber Claybro called it a 100x potential crypto, adding to its existing virality across various social media platforms. When the bot does go live, it is likely to draw early users who thrive on volatility and who want to be first in line when new tokens deploy. For those who treat speed as strategy, Snorter may become an essential tool. The fact that it is still in presale means the timing is early and quite possibly right where the real upside begins. Solaxy Solaxy is approaching its final presale phase and there is only a short window left before the platform goes live. Having raised over $48 million, it has become one of the most successful meme-aligned crypto offerings in recent months. But Solaxy is more than just another successful memecoin presale. It comes with utility as a Layer Two network engineered to facilitate fast and secure transactions between Solana and Ethereum. It bypasses traditional bridges by building its own rails, giving users smoother interoperability with less risk. Its staking model is layered with flexible options. Short-term pools offer conservative yields, while longer lockups deliver sharply increased APY that rewards those willing to commit. Solaxy’s fee rebate model ensures that staking rewards are returned in SOLX itself, consolidating value instead of diluting it across multiple assets. The geopolitical volatility that dragged Bitcoin down has led many investors to reevaluate where real utility may emerge next. With Solaxy so close to launch, attention is already turning toward protocols that can immediately deliver on their use cases. In a post correction bounce, speed and infrastructure tend to lead the charge. Both are areas where Solaxy seems prepared. SUBBD SUBBD does not just give creators a platform, but also gives their fans a revenue stream. The project tokenizes the future income of influencers, musicians, and video creators, allowing users to buy fractional stakes in their ongoing success. When revenue is generated, it flows into a smart contract vault that automatically splits payouts between the creator and their early backers. This structure removes the gatekeeping often found in traditional media and turns fans into financial participants. It also includes a discovery engine that highlights up-and-coming talent using engagement trends, giving early supporters a head start on limited allocation offerings. The tokenomics reward long-term holders by distributing protocol fees back to stakers, along with exclusive access to new creator drops. Despite wider market pullbacks, the creator economy is proving to be unusually resilient. In times when trust in institutions wanes, especially during global crises, individual creators often gain influence. SUBBD’s system allows that influence to be monetized fairly and transparently. With Bitcoin already showing signs of recovery, capital could soon pivot back toward utility-first platforms, making SUBBD a strong candidate for renewed attention. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper , as the name suggests, boasts a Bitcoin-themed concept and design style. But while it looks like another meme coin, it exists to do something else entirely. The project attempts to move value quickly, affordably, and without layers of complexity getting in the way. The protocol is lean and designed for direct usage, handling transactions that confirm almost instantly without bloating fees or requiring external dependencies. This makes it especially suitable for small or frequent transfers, whether between individuals or applications. The architecture has been built around a clear loop of movement and reward. Every completed transaction sends a portion of its fee back into staking pools and liquidity buffers. This creates a self-feeding structure that strengthens as more people use it. There are no side tokens, no secondary chains, and no unfinished utilities. What exists is already functional and being refined through iterative community feedback. As markets enter phases of hesitation, utility often becomes the metric that matters most. Traders stop chasing hype and start looking at whether a token actually does what it claims. Bitcoin Hyper directly relies on movement to justify its value. Its velocity-focused structure rewards real participation, not just passive holding. When geopolitical pressure destabilizes traditional financial rails, options that offer fast direct settlement begin to matter. Bitcoin Hyper may not dominate headlines, but its infrastructure is capable of handling practical demand. If confidence shifts back toward utility-driven tokens, this one is already in position to absorb it. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is woven directly into a system that many users already rely on. The wallet itself supports over sixty chains, with full access to asset swaps, portfolio tracking, staking, and presale aggregation. It is already live, active, and adopted by a broad user base. The wallet’s recent feature in the New York Post did not trigger its rise, but it has helped fuel a more noticeable uptick in both usage and user interest, especially from those outside the immediate crypto circle. The token acts as an access layer rather than a marketing prop. Holding it gives users lower swap fees inside the app, higher yields on certain staking pools, and first entry positions into presales curated through the aggregator. Rather than trying to gamify rewards, Best Wallet keeps things practical. Staking the token simply boosts what the user can already do inside the wallet. The platform’s presale aggregator has drawn particular attention in recent months as users search for early stage tokens before major listings. In a space where speed often determines entry, this has become one of the more practical tools to have. As centralized exchanges face more scrutiny and markets react to global tension by pulling funds off platforms, wallets like this become the default solution. Best Wallet Token ties directly into that behavioral shift. With confidence returning slowly to crypto, systems that offer genuine control, transparency, and deep chain support could be the ones that benefit first. This token is already embedded at the center of that movement. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s recent dip has reignited comparisons with metals and real estate, the broader takeaway is that innovation-driven crypto projects often recover stronger and faster. From fast settlement protocols to creator-powered economies and high utility infrastructure, the space is already pivoting toward tokens that do more than sit idle. Each of the projects discussed above reflects that shift in its own way, offering distinct value beyond short-term speculation. As Bitcoin stabilizes and capital begins to move again, these are the types of ideas that tend to benefit first and sometimes most.

2025-06-14T13:47:02,"Ethereum Price Prediction: TradFi Inflows Could Impact ETH Price – What’s Next?","Ethereum is attracting serious institutional attention. In just 14 consecutive sessions, spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. have seen over $812 million in inflows, more than double Bitcoin’s total over the same period. According to Bloomberg , nine Ethereum ETFs are leading the charge, with funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH capturing a large slice of daily volumes. This sudden influx of TradFi capital, which included a $240 million spike on June 11 alone, indicates that hedge funds, RIAs, and asset managers are increasingly turning to Ethereum as their entry point into the crypto market. CoinShares notes that ETH-based investment products generated $296 million in the past week alone, marking its highest total since the 2024 U.S. election. As regulatory clarity improves and ETF accessibility widens, Ethereum appears poised to benefit from deepening institutional confidence. But so far, price hasn’t quite caught up. Ethereum Faces Technical Roadblocks Despite bullish sentiment, Ethereum price prediction remains stuck under key resistance zones. After bouncing from a low of $2,439, ETH has been unable to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement ($2,518) and the 50-day EMA around $2,614. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD momentum is recovering slightly, but the signal line still points to caution. Meanwhile, the downtrend line from early June continues to cap upside movement. Key levels to monitor: Bullish breakout: Close above $2,567 with strong volume could open the door to $2,614 and $2,647 Downside risk: A decline below $2,480 might uncover ETH to a retest of $2,439 or lower MACD confirmation: Needed to validate any breakout attempt Traders are watching these levels closely, as momentum builds around a potential move. Can Inflows Power a Breakout for Ethereum? While the price remains range-bound, the growing ETF inflow narrative may soon put pressure on the charts. Since June began, total inflows into Ethereum ETFs have climbed past $1.37 billion. That’s not a fluke; it’s a strong sign that Wall Street is gradually leaning into ETH exposure. But inflows alone won’t push ETH higher without technical confirmation. A breakout above the $2,567 mark, backed by volume and MACD crossover, would likely ignite bullish sentiment and accelerate retail follow-through. Bottom line: Ethereum is at a tipping point. TradFi inflows are bullish, but until ETH clears resistance, price remains locked in consolidation. Traders should track ETF volume trends and technical thresholds to stay ahead of potential breakouts or breakdowns. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) .

In a new report, the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says 2025 kicked off with an alarming number of smartphone attacks. “Attacks on Android devices involving malware, adware or potentially unwanted apps in the first quarter of 2025 increased to 12,184,351.” That’s up from 8,780,221 attacks in the last three months of 2024. Trojans, a type of malware that appears harmless but secretly performs malicious actions like stealing data or enabling unauthorized access, were the most common mobile threat, accounting for 39.56% of total detected threats. The sudden increase in attacks is largely attributable to the banking trojan known as Mamont, as well as scam apps. Other reasons for the attack surge include counterfeit versions of popular smartphones that come preloaded with an Android malware called Triada. “This growth was largely due to the activity of Mamont banking trojans and fake money scam apps, along with the discovery of fake popular brand smartphones that came preloaded with the Triada backdoor, capable of dynamically downloading any modules from a server.” Kaspersky also says there were 180,405 malicious and potentially unwanted Android app installation packages detected in the first quarter of 2025, up from 141,779 in the last quarter of 2024.

2025-06-14T13:17:08,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Dominance Soars Post-$1B Liquidation – Is BTC the Only Safe Haven?","Bitcoin dominance is rising after one of the sharpest shakeouts in recent memory, triggered by over $1 billion in leveraged liquidations across the crypto market. BTC is now stabilizing around $104,957, down just 0.17% in the last 24 hours, as traders reassess their risk appetite. According to data from Coinglass, more than 247,000 traders were liquidated in a 24-hour window. The most notable wipeout was a $200 million BTC long on Binance the largest single liquidation event of the year. Most of the damage occurred on Binance and Bybit, which together accounted for $834 million in liquidated positions. UPDATE: Over $1 billion were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $943.31M from long positions. pic.twitter.com/VllxE4f3KM — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 13, 2025 The overwhelming majority were longs, as traders overleveraged on bullish momentum fueled by Circle’s IPO momentum and renewed interest in U.S.-based DeFi protocols. These forced liquidations act as automatic margin calls. When traders fail to meet required collateral thresholds, exchanges close positions to protect the broader system. But in times of sharp volatility, these measures often snowball, leading to rapid price declines and widespread market capitulation. Bitcoin Dominance Climbs as Altcoins Falter While altcoins suffered steep losses, Bitcoin price prediction is in support above $104,000. The selloff appears to have driven investors back into BTC as a relative safe haven. Bitcoin dominance, a metric measuring BTC’s share of total crypto market cap has risen sharply, suggesting that traders are fleeing riskier assets in favor of the original cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Technically, BTC is hovering just above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $104,872 and sits on an ascending trendline that has supported price action since early June. The MACD histogram is flattening, showing early signs of bearish momentum waning. If bulls can reclaim the 50-period EMA near $106,351 and surpass the 0.5 Fib level at $106,788, a move toward $108,864 remains in play. This pattern suggests a possible higher low in the making, especially if the current consolidation zone holds. Small-bodied candles point to indecision and accumulation—typical behavior near the bottom of correction cycles. Short-Term Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes $108K if Momentum Builds Despite market turbulence, Bitcoin’s chart structure remains technically constructive. A move over the $106,350 level would indicate a short-term breakout, validating a reversal pattern and that could propel BTC toward $107,640 and $108,864. Trade Idea Recap: Entry: Above $106,350 with volume Stop: Below $104,000 Targets: $107,640 (initial), $108,864 (extended) With major altcoins bleeding and risk sentiment fragile, Bitcoin’s resilience could attract sidelined capital. Unless BTC breaks below $103,169, the broader uptrend remains intact. In the current environment, Bitcoin isn’t just a crypto—it’s the crypto safe haven. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) .

All dApps in the ecosystem, like HiveSwap, StaQ, and Butter Network, have all added substantial assets in their ecosystems. The biggest risk for MAPS Protocol price is that it has become highly overbought, with the Relative Strength Index jumping to 93.

It formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side was at $0.047 and the lower side was at $0.0051 or a 90% dip.

LUNC has also moved in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to an eventual comeback. A move above the neckline at $0.00007253 will point to more gains to the 50% retracement level at $0.0001135. Meanwhile, Bitcoin rallied past $105,000 at last check on Saturday. See below.

2025-06-14T13:08:00,"Seven Solana ETF Filings Hit SEC — But Is Approval Still a Long Shot?","Seven issuers filed or amended applications for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, marking the latest wave of institutional interest in the Layer 1 blockchain. Key Takeaways: Seven Solana ETF filings hit the SEC, including new entries and amendments from major issuers. Analysts say staking language in the filings could complicate approval timelines. Market optimism remains high, with Bloomberg projecting a 90% chance of approval by 2025. Despite the flurry of filings, analysts warn that approval remains far from guaranteed. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said . Analyst Warns Solana ETF May Face Long Road Like Bitcoin ETFs Drawing parallels to the protracted approval process for Bitcoin ETFs, he noted, “If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” Among the June 13 filings was Fidelity’s first S-1 registration for its Solana ETF. 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Canary Capital also submitted amendments to existing applications, while VanEck — the first firm to file for a Solana ETF back in June — rounded out the list with an amended filing of its own. Seyffart emphasized a key complication: staking. “All of them include staking language, I believe,” he said, underscoring that staking provisions, unlike past Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, could trigger regulatory pushback. While Ether ETF issuers are also seeking permission to offer staking features, the SEC has yet to sign off. They haven't yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn't seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch) — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 Still, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Bloomberg Intelligence in April placed 90% odds on a Solana ETF approval by 2025. And Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added fuel to speculation earlier this week, posting: “Get ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way.” Seyffart admitted the SEC could theoretically greenlight staking features for both Solana and Ether ETFs simultaneously, but added, “I have no insight into what will actually happen.” SEC Pushback on Staking ETFs Raises Doubts About Regulatory Direction Last week, the SEC raised new objections to ETF proposals from REX Financial and Osprey Funds that include staking mechanisms for Solana and Ether. The regulator argued these funds may not qualify as traditional ETFs under current rules, casting uncertainty over the future of staking-enabled investment products. Manthan Davé of Ripple-backed Palisade said the resistance shows the SEC struggling to reconcile existing frameworks with fast-evolving crypto technologies. Davé pointed out the contradiction in the SEC’s stance—acknowledging that staking may not be a securities activity, yet resisting products built around it. This inconsistency, he warned, risks stifling innovation and sending capital offshore. He called for clearer guidance and modernized classifications that account for how staking underpins blockchain security and value creation. Without it, the U.S. may continue to lose ground in the digital finance race.
