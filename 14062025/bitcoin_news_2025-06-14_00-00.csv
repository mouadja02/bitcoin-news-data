2025-06-13T21:52:52,"Weekly Crypto Regulation News Roundup: U.S. Inches Toward Clarity, Congress Advances Bills, and Senators Target Stablecoins","A consequential week in U.S. crypto regulation brought both progress and political friction as lawmakers advanced long-discussed bills and regulators hinted at long-awaited flexibility. Meanwhile, concerns over stablecoin influence—from Meta to Trump-linked assets—continue to dominate headlines and hearings. From Capitol Hill to the SEC’s own headquarters , movement on crypto policy seems to be accelerating, even as tension remains high between innovation and oversight. Blockchain Clarity Act Gains Momentum One of the most widely welcomed developments this week was the inclusion of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) within the broader CLARITY Act, a sweeping piece of legislation seeking to define the structure of U.S. digital asset markets. The Blockchain Regulatory Clarity Act (BRCA) has been included in the latest version of the CLARITY, prompting crypto groups to celebrate. #BRCA #CLARITYAct https://t.co/4JZejBoKb7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 The announcement was met with applause from a coalition of advocacy groups, including Coin Center, the DeFi Education Fund, Solana Policy Institute, and others. These organizations issued a joint statement celebrating the progress and expressing gratitude to Representatives French Hill, Bryan Steil, Tom Emmer, and Ritchie Torres for their bipartisan support. The BRCA is designed to offer a clearer regulatory framework for blockchain projects, particularly around the responsibilities of noncustodial software developers and network participants. For many in the industry, the incorporation of this bill into more comprehensive legislation is a welcome sign that U.S. lawmakers are finally listening to years of industry feedback. SEC Considers Innovation-Friendly Exemption Regulatory flexibility may also be on the horizon. At the final roundtable event in the SEC’s “Spring Sprint Toward Clarity” program, Commissioner Paul Atkins suggested that the agency is exploring a conditional exemption framework—dubbed the “innovation exemption”—that could allow blockchain projects to bring products to market without running afoul of outdated regulations. Atkins’ comments mark a departure from the previous hardline stance taken by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. While details remain scarce, Atkins’ willingness to entertain such a framework indicates a potential shift in how the SEC balances investor protection with market development. If implemented, the exemption could allow both registered and unregistered firms to launch services faster, assuming they meet specified conditions. Stablecoins Under Fire: Meta, Trump, and USD1 While clarity progressed on some fronts, scrutiny intensified elsewhere, particularly over stablecoins. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley issued a formal request to Binance and investment firm MGX, seeking detailed records of a $2 billion transaction involving the Trump-linked stablecoin USD1. Their inquiry focuses on potential political and financial conflicts of interest and is the latest in a string of investigations into stablecoin usage by both crypto-native and state-affiliated entities. Separately, Warren joined forces with Senator Richard Blumenthal to confront Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg over his company’s renewed push into stablecoin infrastructure. In a letter sent this week, the senators labeled Meta’s ambitions a “threat,” demanding full transparency around its development efforts and future plans. The inquiry lands just as Congress prepares to debate stablecoin-specific legislation, and could influence how regulatory frameworks take shape for major tech firms looking to enter the payments market. Ripple Inches Toward Resolution Meanwhile, Ripple and the SEC may be nearing the end of their protracted legal battle. This week, both parties filed a joint request asking a federal court to dissolve the longstanding injunction against Ripple and release the $125 million civil penalty currently held in escrow. They proposed that $50 million go to the SEC, with the remaining $75 million returned to Ripple. This request follows a rejected settlement offer from last month and indicates that both sides are eager to reach a final resolution. The court’s upcoming decision could serve as a bellwether for future enforcement cases involving other crypto firms, especially those who, like Ripple, have operated in regulatory gray zones for years. Connecticut Moves to Block Bitcoin Investment At the state level, Connecticut lawmakers took a decisive step in the opposite direction of federal progress. A newly passed bill now bars state agencies from investing in digital assets, including Bitcoin. Connecticut passed a bill on Tuesday that prohibits the state from investing in digital assets and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. #BitcoinReserve #Connecticut #Bitcoin https://t.co/XLDEAOLHaE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 The law also prohibits the state from creating a Bitcoin reserve and enforces stricter risk disclosures for crypto companies engaged in money transmission. Though passed without opposition, the bill reveals a cautious stance that contrasts with federal moves toward accommodation. As other states court blockchain investment, Connecticut is opting to retreat—a reminder that local politics still play a key role in shaping the future of digital finance in America. Final Thoughts Taken together, this week’s developments point to a new phase in U.S. crypto regulation—one defined by legislative momentum, regulatory introspection, and political oversight. As clarity around crypto regulation inches closer, so too does the battle over who gets to shape the future of digital money. While some push for frameworks that encourage innovation, others remain laser-focused on risk, control, and power.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape. Overview Cryptocurrency Celestia Token TIA Price $1.7 (-14%) Market cap $1.68 Billion Trading volume (24-hour) $87.3 Million Circulating supply 639.85 Million TIA All-time high $20.91; Feb 10, 2024 All-time low $2.03; Oct 31, 2023 24-hour high $2.03 24-hour low $1.73 TIA price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $1.7 Price Prediction $1.51 (-25.24%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Price Volatility 13.57% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $2.65 200-Day SMA $3.82 14-Day RSI 36.61 TIA price analysis: TIA price faces a bearish pressure toward $1.7 TIA price analysis shows bearish volatility toward $1.7 Resistance for TIA is present at $2.294 Support for TIA/USD is present at $1.478 The TIA price analysis for June 13 confirms that TIA is witnessing bearish volatility toward $1.7 level. Currently, bears are dominating the price chart around support lines. TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price struggles in gaining buying confidence Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising bearish threat momentum as sellers pushed the price toward $1.7. The higher highs triggered significant selloff, resulting in a drop below immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged to $31.44 million, showing a slight increase in trading activity today.

The SMA-14 level suggests higher volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility between $2 and $1.5, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD 4-hour chart.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.478, resulting in a correction to $1.030. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price attempted to hold above $2 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. However, buyers’ failure triggered a bearish rally toward $1.7. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction June 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction June 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits. Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment.

2025-06-13T21:14:28,"Expert to XRP Holders: Prepare for the Next 24 Hours","In a recent video shared on X, crypto analyst and influencer Levi of Crypto Crusaders issued a bold alert to XRP holders , urging them to brace for significant market activity within the next 24 hours. According to Levi, a confluence of high-level developments signals a major shift in XRP’s long-term trajectory — one that could mirror the early institutional adoption of Bitcoin. “Something just happened that caused me to open a long position on XRP,” Levi said. “I think we’re going to see some of the largest moves we have seen in the last few months.” Trident Digital’s $500 Million XRP Reserve Levi’s first major highlight was the strategic move by Trident Digital, a Singapore-based firm, to raise $500 million toward building what is poised to be the world’s first large-scale corporate XRP reserve. This development is significant not just for its scale, but also for its precedent. XRP HOLDERS PREPARE FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS! pic.twitter.com/V25frausWU — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 13, 2025 Levi noted, “Didn’t you know this has been going on with Bitcoin for a very long time? And this alone allows hundreds of billions of dollars over time to start flowing into Bitcoin — and I think the same thing can happen with XRP.” In essence, just as Bitcoin reserves formed the financial backbone for various corporate treasuries and hedge fund strategies, Levi believes XRP is now entering a similar institutional phase. The difference? XRP brings with it an integrated use case in real-world utility, particularly in cross-border payments. He continued, “All these corporations that are building the reserves will also have a use case for XRP… and I think that’s going to drive even more price action, I’m extremely excited about.” World Economic Forum and the $1 Billion XRP Ledger Fund In addition to Trident Digital’s initiative, Levi also pointed to confirmation from the World Economic Forum (WEF) of a $1 billion innovation fund tied to the XRP Ledger . According to him, this is a clear signal of mainstream institutional support for XRP and its underlying infrastructure. “We have some of the largest entities in the world getting directly involved with XRP,” Levi stated, emphasizing that this is no longer just retail speculation or small-scale pilot testing. The XRP Ledger is now attracting the type of institutional capital and global attention that many believe could reshape its market status. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This WEF fund, combined with the Trident reserve initiative, could unlock a domino effect in the crypto markets — one where liquidity, legitimacy, and large-scale adoption converge to drive a parabolic rise in value. Levi’s Trading Strategy and Market Sentiment Levi’s bullish stance is not just theoretical. He confirmed that he has already opened a long position on XRP and is preparing to double down if the asset dips further. “If it goes any lower, I’m getting ready to buy some more,” he revealed, adding, “That’s how I’m up more than 200% in the last couple of months.” Such confidence reflects growing sentiment among seasoned XRP analysts who see the current accumulation range as a rare opportunity. With the token currently trading above its 200-day moving average and XRP-related developments accelerating globally, many believe a major breakout could be imminent. With deep-pocketed institutions forming XRP reserves and billion-dollar innovation funds being directed toward its ecosystem, XRP appears to be entering a pivotal phase. The stage is being set not just for a price rally, but for XRP’s emergence as a dominant force in both digital finance and global payments. As Levi concluded, “The writing is definitely on the wall.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-13T21:12:52,"Coinbase Eyes $330B Corporate Bitcoin Wave; Warns of Imminent Systemic Shock","Coinbase Institutional has issued a bullish forecast for the crypto market in the second half of 2025, predicting new all-time highs for Bitcoin while warning about emerging systemic risks from the explosive growth in corporate Bitcoin adoption. The exchange’s latest monthly outlook reveals a shift in the corporate market. According to BitcoinTreasuries , 130 public companies now hold 820,542 BTC worth approximately $88 billion, up from just 89 companies in April. Source: BitcoinTreasuriesNet This corporate Bitcoin trend, created by new accounting rules effective in December 2024 , has resulted in what Coinbase describes as an “attack of the clones” scenario, where numerous firms are emulating MicroStrategy’s early Bitcoin treasury strategy through leveraged funding mechanisms. Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Accelerates Despite Risk Warnings The 2024-2025 regulatory shift opened the door for corporate adoption, with research firm Bernstein projecting that corporations could collectively allocate as much as $330 billion into Bitcoin by 2029 . However, Coinbase’s Global Head of Research, David Duong, warns that the emergence of publicly traded crypto vehicles (PTCVs) focused solely on Bitcoin accumulation introduces substantial systemic risks to the broader crypto ecosystem. As he said, these risks manifest as forced selling pressure from convertible bond maturities and motivated discretionary selling that could trigger market-wide liquidations. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) leads this charge, which has accumulated 580,955 BTC worth approximately $61.4 billion and continues its aggressive acquisition strategy with nine consecutive weeks of purchases. @Strategy snaps up $110M in Bitcoin, pushing its holdings to a record 582,000 BTC worth over $40B as prices near all-time highs. #Bitcoin #MSTR https://t.co/sIgdh1C8yP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 9, 2025 The company’s success has inspired a global phenomenon, with Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announcing an ambitious $5.4 billion capital raise to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027 , representing roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. This follows its rapid ascent to become the tenth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 8,888 BTC. UK-listed tech company @smarterwebuk has purchased an additional 45 $BTC for $4.7M, boosting their Bitcoin holdings by 55% as part of their 10-year digital asset strategy. #Bitcoin #UK https://t.co/JhMyJErzcd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 10, 2025 The momentum extends across multiple jurisdictions, with UK-listed firms joining the movement. The Smarter Web Company recently acquired an additional 45.32 BTC , boosting its holdings by 55% to 168.08 BTC. At the same time, other British companies, such as Abraxas Capital and Bluebird Mining Ventures, have announced major Bitcoin strategies. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding revealed plans to raise $800 million for Bitcoin treasury reserves, potentially making it the 11th-largest corporate holder. Regulatory Clarity and Market Dynamics Shape Optimistic Second-Half Outlook Despite systemic risk concerns, Coinbase maintains its bullish stance for the second half of the cryptocurrency market. The firm’s analysis indicates that recession fears have largely dissipated following early 2025 trade disruptions, with stronger-than-expected economic data suggesting either continued expansion or mild slowdown rather than severe contraction. Source: Coinbase This improved macro environment, combined with rising global liquidity metrics and diminishing tariff impacts, creates favorable conditions for continued Bitcoin appreciation while potentially benefiting store-of-value assets over altcoins if long-term yields rise due to deficit concerns. The regulatory shifts represent the most transformative development. The U.S. has abandoned its previous “regulation by enforcement” approach and favors a comprehensive framework for development. The U.S. Senate Set for Historic Stablecoin Showdown as GENIUS Act nears final vote. #Stablecoins #GeniusAct https://t.co/ZJ59XzuQcn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 Bipartisan momentum behind stablecoin legislation appears unstoppable. The Senate could approve the GENIUS Act as early as next week, followed by a House review of complementary bills establishing reserve requirements, compliance parameters, and consumer protections. Administration officials express confidence that unified legislation could reach President Trump’s desk before the August recess, potentially paving the way for broader crypto market structure bills like the CLARITY Act . The SEC’s handling of approximately 80 pending crypto ETF applications adds another layer of market-moving potential. Decisions on multi-asset funds are expected as early as July 2, in-kind creation mechanisms by October, and single-name altcoin ETFs throughout the fall. While Coinbase acknowledges that correlation with equities remains elevated, structural tailwinds, including sovereign adoption by countries like Venezuela and Russia for international trade, add to Bitcoin’s growing role as an uncorrelated store-of-value asset. This further supports the firm’s prediction of new all-time highs in the second half of 2025.

The EF argued that Storm should not be criminalized for advocating for privacy through writing a mere computer code. Notably, the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) lifted its sanctions against Tornado Cash on March 21, 2025, following a legal reversal by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the charges against Storm were not dropped and the trial is currently scheduled for July 14, 2025. As Coinpedia previously reported , Storm is fighting three main charges, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violating the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). Ethereum Foundation Fights for DeFi Freedom The case against Storm, which is estimated to cost $2 million in legal fees until the trial next month, has attracted significant attention in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. According to the EF, the attack on Storm for developing Tornado Cash is a direct attack on basic human rights on privacy. With the DeFi ecosystem seeking to override traditional financial systems, the trial on Storm will be crucial to the future growth prospects for the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, countries have been pushing to regulate the cryptocurrency market to retain their traditional powers, which have been debunked by the immense adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider altcoin market. “The DOJ wants to bury DeFi, saying I should’ve controlled it, added KYC, never built it. SDNY is trying to crush me, blocking every expert witness. If I lose, DeFi dies with me. The dream of financial freedom, the code I believed in—it all fades into darkness. I’m fighting, but the weight is unbearable.

Recent developments involving Iran and Israel are a prime example of how rising geopolitical risk can capture the attention of investors and market watchers alike. This isn’t just about regional politics; it’s about understanding the potential domino effect on everything from oil prices to, yes, the crypto market. What’s Happening with Iran Israel Tensions? The core of the recent news revolves around a stern warning issued by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. According to reports, including one shared by @solidintel_x on X, President Raisi stated that Iran is prepared to deliver a “legitimate and powerful response” to actions taken by Israel. He went further, warning that these actions would leave Israel with “deep regret.” This statement comes amidst a backdrop of escalating tensions between the two nations, who are long-standing adversaries. While the specific “actions” referred to by President Raisi were not detailed in the initial report, the language used signifies a potential for significant escalation. Such rhetoric is not uncommon in the complex relationship between Iran and Israel, but the severity of the warning naturally raises concerns about the possibility of direct confrontation or proxy conflicts intensifying in the region. Understanding the historical context is key. Iran and Israel have been engaged in a shadow war for years, marked by cyberattacks, covert operations, and support for opposing sides in regional conflicts. Any public statement threatening a “powerful response” indicates a potential shift or intensification in this ongoing dynamic. For global markets, including crypto, the primary concern is how this geopolitical risk might translate into broader instability. How Does Geopolitical Risk Impact the Crypto Market? It might seem counterintuitive that tensions in the Middle East could affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the global financial system is interconnected. Significant geopolitical events can trigger widespread reactions: Increased Uncertainty: Conflict or the threat of it creates uncertainty. Uncertainty often leads investors to become risk-averse, pulling money out of assets perceived as volatile. Flight to Safety Narratives: During times of crisis, certain assets are traditionally seen as ‘safe havens’ (like gold, or certain government bonds). In recent years, Bitcoin has sometimes been included in this conversation, although its volatility makes this a debated point. Impact on Traditional Markets: Geopolitical events can directly impact stock markets, oil prices, and fiat currencies. Since the crypto market is still heavily influenced by macro trends and traditional finance, these impacts can spill over. Regulatory Scrutiny: Global instability can sometimes lead governments to increase scrutiny or regulation on decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies, viewing them potentially as tools for illicit finance or capital flight. The potential for a wider Middle East conflict, even if indirect, introduces a layer of geopolitical risk that investors cannot ignore. This risk premium can influence market sentiment and trading behavior across the board. Could Bitcoin Be a Safe Haven Amidst Middle East Conflict? The narrative of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset is one that gains traction during periods of global market uncertainty or geopolitical turmoil. The theory is that because Bitcoin is decentralized, not controlled by any single government or central bank, it can serve as a store of value when traditional financial systems or fiat currencies are perceived to be at risk. During previous geopolitical flashpoints, we have seen instances where Bitcoin’s price reacted differently than traditional assets, sometimes showing resilience or even upward movement. However, it’s crucial to understand that this is not a guaranteed outcome. Bitcoin is still a relatively young and volatile asset class. Its price can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including: Overall market liquidity and risk appetite. Regulatory news from major economies. Technical factors and trading patterns. Sentiment driven by social media and news cycles. While the Middle East conflict adds to the narrative for Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional risks, it’s important to approach this idea with caution and acknowledge Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? The immediate crypto market impact of rising Iran Israel tensions is often seen in increased volatility. Traders and investors react to the news, leading to potential price swings. If the situation escalates, we might see a flight to perceived safety (potentially boosting Bitcoin’s price based on the safe haven narrative) or a broader risk-off sentiment that could lead to sell-offs across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Here are a few potential scenarios for the crypto market impact: Increased Volatility: Expect sharper price movements as markets react to news updates. Divergent Performance: Bitcoin might potentially decouple from traditional risk assets if the safe haven narrative dominates, while altcoins might suffer more significant losses. Heightened Scrutiny: Geopolitical events can sometimes bring unwanted attention to crypto from regulators concerned about its use in sanctions evasion or funding conflicts. It’s a complex interplay, and predicting market movements based solely on geopolitical events is challenging. However, being aware of the potential connections allows investors to better understand market reactions. Navigating Global Market Uncertainty: Actionable Insights For those invested in or looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, rising global market uncertainty due to events like the Iran Israel tensions requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources on both geopolitical developments and their analysis within financial markets. Understand the context of the Middle East conflict. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical risk adds another layer of volatility. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your comfort level regarding potential price swings. Diversification: While crypto is one asset class, diversification across different asset types can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Long-Term Perspective: For many crypto investors, a long-term view is crucial. Short-term geopolitical events can cause significant price fluctuations, but the long-term potential of the technology might remain unchanged. Don’t Panic React: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on headlines. Have a strategy and stick to it, adjusting only after careful consideration. Understanding the potential geopolitical impact on crypto isn’t about predicting the future with certainty, but about being prepared for various scenarios and managing risk effectively. Conclusion: Watching the Horizon President Raisi’s warning underscores the simmering Iran Israel tensions, a significant source of geopolitical risk in the Middle East. While the immediate outcome remains uncertain, the potential for escalation introduces global market uncertainty that can directly or indirectly affect the crypto market. The narrative around Bitcoin as a safe haven may gain prominence, but investors must remain aware of crypto’s inherent volatility. Staying informed about these developments and understanding their potential implications is vital for anyone navigating the interconnected worlds of geopolitics and decentralized finance. As the situation evolves, vigilance and a well-considered strategy will be your best guides.

2025-06-13T20:50:42,"Bitcoin Rally Alert: John Bollinger Signals Potential Exhaustion After $110K Resistance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Rally Alert: John Bollinger Signals Potential Exhaustion After $110K Resistance Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you been watching the incredible Bitcoin rally ? It’s been quite the ride, but a recent signal from a legendary figure in technical analysis has traders paying close attention. John Bollinger, the brilliant mind behind the widely used Bollinger Bands indicator, suggests that this powerful upward move might be losing steam, especially after encountering significant resistance around the $110,000 mark. Decoding the Signal: What John Bollinger Saw in the Bitcoin Rally According to reports, John Bollinger pointed to a specific pattern emerging on Bitcoin charts. He noted what’s often referred to as a ‘three pushes up’ pattern following a ‘W’-shaped bottom. If you’re new to technical analysis, this might sound a bit complex, but let’s break it down simply: W-shaped bottom: This is typically seen as a bullish reversal pattern, suggesting a potential upward move after a downtrend. It looks like a ‘W’ on the price chart. Three pushes up: After the W-shaped bottom, the price makes three distinct attempts or ‘pushes’ higher. The Signal: When these three pushes occur, especially after a significant run-up like the recent crypto market activity, it can often indicate ‘trend exhaustion’. Think of it like a runner sprinting – after three big bursts, they might start to tire out. This pattern, according to Bollinger’s analysis, suggests that the buyers who have been driving the price up might be losing momentum. The $110,000 level acted as a strong ceiling, and the inability to decisively break through it reinforces this idea of exhaustion. Why Are Bollinger Bands and John Bollinger So Important? For anyone involved in market analysis , the name John Bollinger is synonymous with one of the most popular and effective trading tools available: Bollinger Bands . These bands are lines plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average of a security’s price. They adapt to market volatility, widening during periods of high volatility and narrowing during low volatility periods. Traders use Bollinger Bands to: Identify potential overbought or oversold conditions. Spot potential price targets. Measure volatility. Look for ‘squeeze’ patterns (low volatility) that might precede a significant price move. John Bollinger isn’t just the creator; he’s a seasoned market technician whose insights carry significant weight in the trading community. When he points out a specific pattern or potential shift, many traders take notice, making his observations crucial for understanding potential future price movements in the crypto market . What Could This Mean for the Bitcoin Price Action? Bollinger’s signal of trend exhaustion doesn’t necessarily mean the price is going to crash immediately. He indicated two primary possibilities following this pattern: Reversal: The rally could end, leading to a significant price decline. Sideways Movement: The price could enter a period of consolidation, trading within a relatively narrow range as buyers and sellers battle it out. Both scenarios imply a pause or end to the strong upward momentum we’ve recently witnessed. For traders and investors, understanding this potential shift is key to managing risk and planning their next moves. The $110,000 level now stands out as a critical resistance point that the market struggled to overcome. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Crypto Market After Bollinger’s Signal So, what should you do with this information? Here are a few things to consider based on this Bitcoin rally analysis: Review Your Positions: If you’ve been riding the rally, consider whether it’s time to take some profits or tighten your stop-loss orders to protect against a potential reversal. Prepare for Volatility: Exhaustion can sometimes precede increased volatility as the market decides its next direction. Be prepared for potentially sharper price swings. Look for Confirmation: Bollinger’s signal is one piece of the puzzle. Look for confirmation from other technical indicators (like volume, RSI, MACD) or fundamental factors before making significant trading decisions. Consider Sideways Strategies: If the market enters a sideways phase, strategies like range trading might become more effective than simply buying dips. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further analysis from experts like John Bollinger and monitor key price levels. Remember, no indicator or analyst is right 100% of the time, especially in a dynamic market like crypto. Bollinger’s signal is a heads-up based on historical chart patterns, prompting caution and diligent market analysis . Challenges and Considerations While Bollinger’s insights are valuable, it’s important to remember the unique nature of the crypto market . It can be highly susceptible to news, social media sentiment, and rapid shifts in momentum. A pattern that works reliably in traditional markets might behave differently in crypto. False signals are always a possibility. Furthermore, the specific resistance level of $110,000 mentioned highlights a potential future scenario or a significant psychological barrier that was tested in the context of the analysis. Summary: The Bitcoin Rally at a Crossroads? John Bollinger’s observation of a ‘three pushes up’ pattern following a ‘W’-shaped bottom, particularly after failing to sustain momentum above $110,000, provides a strong signal that the recent Bitcoin rally might be reaching a point of exhaustion. This doesn’t guarantee a crash, but it certainly raises the probability of either a significant reversal or a period of consolidation. Traders and investors should approach the market with increased caution, perform their own due diligence, and consider how this potential shift aligns with their own trading strategies and risk tolerance. Keeping a close watch on key price levels and market sentiment will be crucial in the days and weeks ahead as the crypto market navigates this potential turning point.

Peter Schiff highlighted Bitcoin’s failure as a safe haven amid Israel-Iran tensions. Historical data shows Bitcoin often rebounds stronger after geopolitical events. Bitcoin experienced volatility on Friday following the airstrike by Israel on Iran. The intensification of conflicts shook the world markets, resulting in substantial corrections for the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, which was above $107,000 since June 9, briefly fell under $103,000. At the time of press, BTC is at $104,815 , showing a 2.23% decrease over the last 24 hours. The market’s performance amid geopolitical tensions has raised doubts about Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.

2025-06-13T20:40:42,"US Dollar: Persistent Confidence in Short Positions, BofA Reveals","BitcoinWorld US Dollar: Persistent Confidence in Short Positions, BofA Reveals In the dynamic world of finance, shifts in major currencies like the US Dollar ripple across markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these macro trends is crucial for investors navigating volatility. Recently, a notable perspective emerged from Bank of America (BofA) regarding prevailing market sentiment towards the greenback, specifically highlighting the continued conviction in Short Dollar Positions . Why the Confidence in Short Dollar Positions? When traders take a short position on a currency, they are essentially betting that its value will decrease relative to another currency or a basket of currencies. The fact that market participants are maintaining these bets against the US Dollar , according to the latest BofA Outlook , suggests underlying factors are reinforcing this view. This isn’t a fleeting trend; the confidence appears persistent. Several elements typically contribute to a bearish outlook on the US Dollar : Interest Rate Expectations: If markets anticipate the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates sooner or more aggressively than other central banks, the yield attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets can diminish, weakening the currency. Inflation Trends: High or persistent inflation can erode purchasing power, but market focus is often on how central banks respond. If the Fed is seen as less aggressive on inflation than others, it can pressure the dollar. Global Economic Growth: Stronger growth outside the U.S. can boost demand for other currencies and shift investment flows away from dollar safety. Risk Appetite: In periods of high market confidence or ‘risk-on’ sentiment, investors might move capital into riskier assets or currencies of faster-growing economies, reducing demand for the safe-haven US Dollar . Fiscal and Trade Balances: Large deficits can weigh on a currency over time. The BofA Outlook , reflecting client positioning and sentiment surveys, indicates that despite potential short-term fluctuations, the conviction among many participants holding Short Dollar Positions remains strong. This suggests the collective market view is that the factors favoring dollar weakness are likely to persist for some time. Understanding Market Sentiment in the Forex Market Market sentiment is the overall attitude of investors and traders towards a particular security, market, or economy. In the Forex Market , sentiment is a powerful force. It’s not just about economic data; it’s about how traders interpret that data and what they expect future events to be. A prevailing sentiment, like the confidence in Short Dollar Positions , can become a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent, as positioning reinforces the trend. The BofA Outlook serves as a gauge of this sentiment among a significant segment of institutional players. Their assessment that confidence is ‘intact’ implies that recent economic releases or market events haven’t significantly shaken the bearish view on the US Dollar that has been building. How Does This Affect the Forex Market and Beyond? The strength or weakness of the US Dollar has profound implications across the global financial system. In the Forex Market , it directly impacts major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. A weaker dollar means it takes more dollars to buy one unit of the other currency in the pair. Beyond traditional currencies, a weaker US Dollar can influence commodity prices (often priced in USD), making them cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially increasing demand. It can also affect international trade dynamics and corporate earnings for multinational companies. For cryptocurrency investors, a weaker US Dollar is often seen as a positive catalyst. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are sometimes viewed as alternative stores of value or hedges against traditional currency devaluation or inflation. When the dollar weakens, assets perceived as alternatives or risk-on plays can see increased interest. Actionable Insights from the BofA Outlook The key takeaway from the BofA Outlook for traders and investors is the persistence of the bearish sentiment towards the US Dollar . While sentiment can change rapidly, the report suggests the current positioning is robust. This doesn’t guarantee future dollar weakness, but it highlights the prevailing bias in the market. Traders holding Short Dollar Positions might feel validated, while those long the dollar might reconsider their strategy or hedge their exposure. New entrants to the Forex Market might look for opportunities in pairs where the dollar is the quote currency (e.g., EUR/USD, AUD/USD) or consider the potential impact on dollar-denominated assets. It is crucial, however, to remember that market sentiment is just one factor. Unexpected economic data, shifts in central bank communication, or geopolitical events can quickly alter the landscape and challenge even deeply held convictions like the current confidence in Short Dollar Positions . What Could Challenge This Sentiment? Despite the reported confidence, several factors could cause a shift in market sentiment regarding the US Dollar : Unexpectedly Strong U.S. Data: Persistent strong jobs reports or higher-than-expected inflation could force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer than anticipated, supporting the dollar. Weakness Elsewhere: Economic slowdowns or political instability in other major regions could drive capital back into the safe-haven US Dollar . Hawkish Fed Pivot: Clear communication from the Federal Reserve indicating a less dovish stance than priced in by the market would likely strengthen the dollar. Risk-Off Events: Major global crises or market crashes typically lead to a flight to safety, benefiting the dollar. The BofA Outlook reflects the current state, but monitoring these potential catalysts for change is essential for anyone trading in the Forex Market or assets influenced by dollar movements. Conclusion: Persistent Bets Against the Greenback The assessment from Bank of America underscores a significant theme in current financial markets: the continued, strong conviction among participants holding Short Dollar Positions . This persistent market sentiment is driven by a confluence of factors, including expectations around interest rates, global growth dynamics, and overall risk appetite. While the BofA Outlook highlights the robustness of this view, the ever-changing nature of the Forex Market means vigilance is required. Understanding this dominant sentiment provides valuable context for navigating not just currency markets but also related asset classes like commodities and cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-13T20:30:28,"Crypto degens are taking wagers on global conflict via Polymarket","As global tensions escalate following the Israel-Iran conflict and traditional investors seek safety in safe haven assets like gold, crypto punters are seeking action on the crypto-based betting platforms, Polymarket. The crypto betting platform rose to prominence for predicting President Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory before other traditional news outlets and polls. It has also become the leading venue for punters making bets on the escalating crisis between Israel and Iran, becoming something of a high-stakes casino for the geopolitical drama in the Middle East. Crypto punters wager on the Israel-Iran conflict and outcomes As geopolitical tensions rise, Polymarket has become an unlikely casino, where crypto degens are taking wagers on global conflict. Its top active markets are centered on the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. Polymarket predicted an 88% chance of Israel striking Iran in June, a 71% chance of the strike hitting Iranian nuclear facilities, and an astonishing 99% chance of the strike happening by Friday, the 13th. Following the accurate prediction of the strike, punters took to Polymarket to place more wagers. This resulted in the top prediction markets being dominated by the wagers placed on the conflict. The market went as high as a 99% chance that Iran would strike Israel in June, pulling in over $1 million in volume. Iran struck Israel in a military attack later on the same day, June 13. Source: Polymarket It also estimates a 42% chance of the U.S. taking military action against Iran before July. That market has now pulled in over $1.7 million in volume. Source: Polymarket Another market that has sprung up with the Middle East conflict is the spike in the price of Brent crude. It currently predicts a 44% chance that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, which could further lead to global oil prices skyrocketing. Source: Polymarket Another market that could soon gain momentum is the prediction about whether Iran will confirm the possession of a nuclear weapon by 2025. This follows Israel’s claims that its preemptive strikes were on Iran’s nuclear facilities. This market has gained over $154,000 in volume. Source: Polymarket These markets operate in a regulatory grey area. After being fined $1.4 million by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2022, Polymarket banned U.S. users from its platform. Placing wagers on real-time geopolitical crises raises ethical concerns. Critics argue that it could be seen as trivializing suffering and incentivizing misinformation. Also, there are concerns of market manipulation, with the CFTC saying prediction markets are vulnerable to manipulation. Israel-Iran conflict shakes global financial markets On Friday, 13, 2025, Israel declared a special emergency following preemptive strikes on Iran, which are reported to have hit Iranian nuclear facilities and killed top Iranian generals. This event sent ripples through the global financial market. With fears of broader conflicts arising, assets such as gold are seeing inflows. An ounce of gold has gained 1.2% to $3,444.70. Bitcoin dropped sharply, falling below $103,000 as investors fled risk assets; however, it quickly gained $105,700, a little bit off its intraday high. Brent crude surged about 14% intraday, settling at about $75.54/barrel, driven by fears of disruption around the Strait of Hormuz, which is responsible for about a fifth of global consumption flows and bordered by Iran, which also happens to be one of the world’s largest exporters of oil. Global stocks were hit ; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.4%, with the Dow industrials losing about 600 points. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-13T20:15:00,"Solana price prediction 2025-2031: Trends and insights for investors","Key takeaways Solana’s price can reach a maximum of $367.80 and an average trading value of $331.81 in 2025. By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $757.91, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,249.89 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $147.32 (-6.96%) Market Cap $77.64 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $6.45 Billion Circulating Supply 520.28 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $160.43 24-hour Low $141.44 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Neutral 50-Day SMA $160.92 200-Day SMA $175.91 Price Prediction $321.69 (117.52%) F & G Index 14.55 (extreme fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 14-Day RSI 39.78 Solana price analysis: SOL faces bearish pressure below $150 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows a bearish trend below $150. Resistance for SOL is at $150. Support for SOL/USD is at $145. The price analysis of Solana for June 13 shows that SOL tried and failed at crossing past the $160 level. The price is still trading at $147 but may retrace further. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL fails to cross past $160 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart, as the bulls could not climb past the $160 level, and the price headed towards $140. The bulls still hold strong at the level but the exhaustion might cause SOL to retrace further. Solana price 1-day chart analysis : SOL falls to $150 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 40.13, showing room for further downwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line dives downwards, suggesting declining bullish momentum. Moreover, the MACD histogram shows rising bearish pressure in the cryptocurrency market as bulls struggle to hold above $145.00. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum halts SOL at $160 The 4-hour chart for Solana reveals a steady fall as the bulls failed to rise past the $160 price level, and SOL fell to the $143.00 mark before recovering towards the $150 level. The high trading volume has caused high volatility in the last few days. Solana price analysis : SOL struggles in initiating uptrend From a technical perspective, the MACD shows growing bearish momentum at -1.82, with the indicator showing rising bearish momentum with recent candles. This suggests that the bulls are yet to find a foothold at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 36.12, indicating that Solana has little room for further movement in downwards direction across the short term and the selloff may continue towards $140. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 144.54 BUY SMA 5 $ 153.34 SELL SMA 10 $ 153.73 SELL SMA 21 $ 160.89 SELL SMA 50 $ 162.43 SELL SMA 100 $ 146.46 BUY SMA 200 $ 163.21 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 159.54 SELL EMA 5 $ 156.00 SELL EMA 10 $ 146.63 BUY EMA 21 $ 138.91 BUY EMA 50 $ 144.14 BUY EMA 100 $ 159.52 SELL EMA 200 $ 168.03 SELL What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT 4-hour price chart: TradingView The Solana price analysis across the daily and 4-hour charts indicates a notable decay after rising towards the $160 price level. The 4-hour chart reinforces this downward trend with a bearish dominance in the MACD and the RSI falling into unfavorable territory, signaling potential continued downward momentum as SOL retraces to $144. The bulls find strong support at $145 suggesting the price may bounce back. The bullish market sentiment supports the notion and the increasing trade volume is also bullish. However, if the price falls below $145, the next support is at $140. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana failed to rise past the $160 price level, and the following selloff caused a drop to $140 before recovering towards the $147 level. However, the increasing bearish pressure might create a drop below $145. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-06-13T20:00:53,"Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke","Ethereum’s price action this week has been very notable, with the leading altcoin breaking above $2,800 again for the first time in four months. Ethereum managed to break above the $2,800 mark for the first time since February, briefly touching $2,870 before pulling back slightly. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin’s 2021 Cycle? Here’s The Target Two separate analyses by crypto strategist Crypto Patel on the social media platform X suggests Ethereum is now on the right track. The first, based on an 8-hour chart, highlights a rally toward $4,000. The second, using a long-term two-week timeframe, outlines a bullish setup that could send Ethereum soaring to $10,000 and beyond. Ethereum’s Breakout From Sideways Consolidation Zone In a recent analysis shared on X, a crypto analyst known as Crypto Patel highlighted Ethereum’s attempt to break out of its established range. Using the 8-hour candlestick chart, he pointed out how the Ethereum had spent many weeks since early May trading between clear support at $2,366 and resistance around $2,734. The breakout seen on the chart occurred just above this resistance zone, when Ethereum briefly pushed past $2,800 before facing some rejection. If this breakout holds above $2,800, Ethereum could initiate a steep upward rally toward the $3,500 to $4,000 region in the coming weeks. Crypto Patel noted the importance of watching whether Ethereum sustains above the $2,750 breakout line, as a successful confirmation could trigger an influx of bullish momentum. Ethereum’s To $10,000 In The Long-Term In a follow-up post analyzing a much larger timeframe, Crypto Patel shared a two-week candlestick chart that mapped Ethereum’s longer-term structure since 2018. The chart revealed a well-defined bullish setup, including a bounce from a key bullish order block around $1,400 in April. This bounce acted as a support level, with the resulting candlestick being a bullish one that broke through another order block between $1,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Patel pointed out that Ethereum is now showing signs of a long-term bullish continuation pattern. With support levels already locked in for the next bear market, the analyst projected a target above $10,000, citing a 438% upside potential from current price levels. The chart also marks $2,500 as a structural pivot point, with Ethereum’s ongoing upward trajectory expected to strengthen if this support level continues to hold. Therefore, the path to $10,000 will depend on Ethereum’s ability to turn its recent resistance break into sustained momentum. The $2,800 region must now serve as a support base rather than a resistance ceiling. However, this has failed to really materialize in the past 24 hours, as Ethereum is currently down by a massive 9.6%. The ensuing price action has seen the leading altcoin now back trading within this consolidation range. Failure to hold above $2,500 could cascade to more losses over the weekend until it closes on $2,366 again and probably initiate another bounce from here.

2025-06-13T20:00:43,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Add Over 880K BTC In 30 Days – Conviction Growing","Bitcoin faced a wave of intense selling pressure earlier today after reports confirmed a direct military strike by Israel on Iranian targets, escalating tensions in the Middle East. The news triggered widespread volatility across global markets, sending oil and gold higher while equities and crypto assets reeled under risk-off sentiment. Despite the shockwave, BTC is holding relatively strong above the $104,000 mark, suggesting resilience from market participants even as caution dominates the landscape. As fear spreads, investors are now questioning whether Bitcoin can maintain key support levels or if more downside is imminent. However, on-chain data paints a different picture. According to insights from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) added 881,578 BTC over the past 30 days — a significant accumulation streak. This behavior reflects strong conviction among seasoned participants, reinforcing the view that long-term demand remains intact despite short-term turmoil. With volatility expected to persist as geopolitical risk unfolds, Bitcoin’s next move will be critical. For now, the combination of macroeconomic uncertainty and sustained long-term accumulation sets the stage for a pivotal moment in the broader market cycle. All eyes are on whether BTC can turn this turbulence into a base for future strength. Bitcoin Long-Term Accumulation Surge Amid Global Tensions Bitcoin surged to $110,000 just two days ago, coming within striking distance of its $112,000 all-time high. However, heightened geopolitical tensions—especially following the Israel-Iran conflict—have sent markets into a state of risk-off volatility. BTC has since retraced to $104,000, a 7% drop from its local high, but the price action remains notably resilient. Bitcoin continues to trade above critical support levels, and the broader trend suggests that bulls may still have momentum on their side. The $112,000 zone remains the key level to flip, as a decisive breakout there would push BTC into price discovery and signal the start of a new explosive phase for the entire crypto market. For now, the market waits for confirmation, as Bitcoin consolidates below resistance in a high-stakes environment. Despite the volatility, strong on-chain fundamentals are keeping investor sentiment intact. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, long-term holders have added 881,578 BTC to their wallets over the past 30 days—a massive wave of accumulation. This cohort is typically composed of more experienced investors, signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s medium-to-long-term trajectory. While global uncertainty continues to dominate headlines, Bitcoin’s ability to hold the $104K level, combined with this aggressive long-term accumulation, suggests that any pullback may be short-lived. If bulls regain momentum and reclaim $110K, the next stop could be uncharted territory beyond the all-time high. The next few days will likely define the tempo for the rest of the quarter. BTC Finds Support After Sharp Rejection From $110K Resistance The 4-hour Bitcoin chart reveals a sharp rejection from the $110K zone earlier this week, followed by a swift decline to $104K. The price is currently holding just above a critical support level around $103,600—a zone that previously served as a launchpad in early June. The $109,300 resistance remains the key level to break for continuation toward all-time highs, but until then, the trend remains vulnerable to downside volatility. Price action shows increased volume on the recent sell-off, signaling heightened investor reaction to the geopolitical tensions triggered by the Israel-Iran conflict. However, the bounce off the $103,600 level suggests that bulls are defending this area, and it continues to serve as a key structural support. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are now converging between $106,000 and $106,500, adding confluence as a short-term resistance cluster. A clean break above that region could open the door for a retest of $109,300. If BTC fails to hold the $103,600 level, however, the market could revisit the $100K psychological mark.

Bitcoin’s chart is repeating a “descending broadening wedge” pattern from past rallies. These two distinct signals are both pointing to a potential upcoming crypto rally. Two key market signals – a price reversal in gold and a recurring historical pattern in Bitcoin’s chart, are leading analysts to forecast that the crypto market could be preparing for its next major upward movement. The analyses suggest that despite the latest consolidation, underlying technical structures are pointing to a bullish future for both Bitcoin and the broader altcoin sector.

2025-06-13T19:44:47,"Bitcoin, Ethereum Hit Hard by Geopolitical Tensions: Binance Funding Rates Signal Deep Bearish Shift","In the early hours of Friday, June 13th, the cryptocurrency market faced intense downward pressure following a surprise military strike by Israel on Iran. The geopolitical shock sent global risk assets tumbling, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing a sharp drop below the crucial $2,600 support level. Geopolitical Shock According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, this sudden plunge triggered a cascade of long liquidations on Binance, where data from liquidation heatmaps revealed concentrated wipeouts in the $2,650-$2,430 range. Many traders had opened long positions at around $2,800, expecting continued upside, only to be caught off guard by the sell-off. As prices fell through key levels, stop-losses and liquidation orders were triggered en masse, which resulted in a rapid flush of overleveraged positions. Bitcoin also felt the impact, as Binance’s funding rates for BTC perpetual contracts fell to deeply negative levels not seen since June 8. This drop in funding rates reflects a market-wide shift in sentiment, which means that traders are now heavily shorting BTC amid fears of continued downside. The panic-driven trading behavior suggests extreme caution across crypto markets, and derivatives data are pointing to increased bearish expectations. However, the aggressive liquidation of ETH longs and the return of negative BTC funding rates may indicate an overly pessimistic market stance. Such conditions often precede a potential price rebound, as excessive leverage is cleared out and markets stabilize. While uncertainty remains high due to the geopolitical backdrop, the removal of speculative build-up could create a healthier setup for recovery. Flight to Safety Grips Markets In a note released Friday, QCP Capital also echoed these concerns and stated that the digital asset complex remains tightly tethered to geopolitical tail risks, and markets now appear to be poised to trade “headline to headline.” Bitcoin fell around 3% while Ethereum posted a sharper 9% drop, as risk sentiment evaporated across Asia and safe-haven assets like oil and gold surged. Interestingly, crypto volatility spiked, with front-end BTC risk reversals flipping decisively in favor of puts, which indicated a sharp rise in demand for downside protection. While over $1 billion in long liquidations rattled major crypto assets, Bitcoin’s relatively muted decline indicated underlying institutional support. However, the firm warned that any escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict could threaten oil supply corridors and add to inflationary pressure, thereby complicating the Fed’s rate trajectory. Exacerbating the uncertainty, a widespread internet outage involving Google Cloud and Cloudflare added further stress to equities and tech-linked crypto sentiment. With Tehran’s response pending, the outlook for crypto remains fragile, which is currently not shaped by fundamentals but by geopolitical volatility and macro headline flow.

2025-06-13T19:41:22,"Whales scoop up Bitcoin while retail traders grow bearish","Whales are buying up BTC during periods when retail traders express bearish sentiment. Institutions, whales and other large-scale buyers keep shaking down retail, taking signs from social media. Retail sentiment on BTC goes counter to the inflows of smart money. Based on Sentiment data, social media chatter often signals bearish attitudes among retail buyers. Santiment tracked messaging across X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster, seeking out the mention of extremely low predictions below $70K, as well as bullish predictions for a rally above $120K. According to Santiment, the peak signal arrived around the time of the April 8 price crash, where retail predicted a fall to $70K. Whales and institutions only accelerated their buying. Since May, BTC has also exhibited a signal of predominant market takers , indicating a domination of buying demand. For the second time since 2022 market takers have continued buying up coins during a rally, showing peak exuberance. Previous periods of market taker activity happened at lower price ranges, with more conservative accumulation. This time, buyers are still highly active near peak valuations. Most of the sellers originated from the wallet cohort that held for 3-6 months, based on the hodl waves indicator. Experienced traders often choose a dual strategy of holding and trading to accumulate more BTC. Overall, no holders are pressured to sell, as over 98% of addresses are in profit, and long-term accumulators and miners have a much lower average entry price. Whales still accumulate at any price range The latest episode of bearish predictions lasted from June 4 to June 6, when BTC fell to just above $101,000. During that time, bear-posting accelerated, predicting another dip to a lower range. Despite the temporary price drop, accumulation from whales and large-scale wallets did not skip a beat, with near-peak inflows . Even during the recent sideways trading around $104,000, crowd sentiment remains bearish, while smart money is bullish on BTC. $BTC Sentiment CROWD = Bearish 🟥 MP = Bullish 🟩 Check out sentiment and other crypto stats at https://t.co/HQDyBNuzek pic.twitter.com/aOm2ImXyvk — Market Prophit (@MarketProphit) June 13, 2025 Retail traders have often heard the adage of not selling their coins to whales, ETFs or institutions. However, the ability to realize profits at a higher price was appealing to retail and their share of holdings decreased. The ratio of retail to whale holdings has been sliding in most of 2025, from 2.1 points to 2.0 points. The ratio has been rising in all of the history of BTC, since institutions only arrived in the past two years. BTC retail holders gradually declined in 2025, with the balance shifting toward institutions and whale buyers. | Source: MacroMicro The addition of corporate treasuries further added buyers capable of mopping up all newly mined BTC. Institutions and buyers with borrowed funds can afford to risk even near the price top, while retailers are more wary due to crashes from the previous bull cycles. The current bull cycle also looks different, with a more gradual BTC price expansion. At the same time, the types of investors are shifting, and BTC continues to change hands. Retail traders are also wary of overall demand, as institutional buying and ETF demand have also reversed. During some of the rallies, whales also sold BTC for profit and re-bought lower. Profit-taking was only slower during the latest rally above $109,000.

Based on the agreement, the real estate platform-turned Solana treasury company will have the right—but not the obligation—to sell up to $5 billion in shares to stock up on the altcoin . 1/ Today, we announce that DeFi Development Corp. (Nasdaq: $DFDV ) has secured a $5 BILLION equity line. This gives DFDV the flexibility to raise capital when it’s most strategic, fueling continued accumulation of $SOL and accelerating growth in $SOL Per Share (SPS). pic.twitter.com/3ep3QxuRTT — DeFi Dev Corp. (@defidevcorp) June 12, 2025 The purchase is set to have a trickle effect, opting to “raise capital gradually, when it’s strategically advantageous, rather than locking in one-time pricing during volatile markets.” However, accumulation could begin sooner rather than later. With Solana still trading 50% below its February all-time highs, current levels may offer a compelling entry point. With a recent SEC request for SOL ETF issuers to submit amended S-1 filings within a week, putting approval on track for July, the doors may soon open to inflows from traditional markets. Solana Price Analysis: Could Institutional Demand Push a New SOL High? Demand from traditional investment markets could give Solana the push it needs to break out of a massive cup-and-handle pattern forming since 2021. The Solana price currently trades within the descending channel forming the handle, with its last upward attempt falling short, it remains locked in a downtrend. SOL / USDT 1-week chart, 2021 cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. That said, with potential support at the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level—a zone typically viewed as a prime accumulation range—$140 could prove a potential bottom for the next leg up. This level also aligns with the lower support of a smaller ascending channel forming since the mid-April market bottom. A bounce here would affirm the structure and establish a key confluence zone for a breakout attempt. In the weakest bullish scenario, a confirmed cup-and-handle breakout projects a technical target of $430, in line with the 3.618 Fibbonaci level—a 128% gain from current levels. While momentum indicators have weakened, they have yet to flip decidedly bearish. The MACD line still holds a narrow lead above the signal line, and the RSI has stalled just below neutral at 45. While their current downtrends are both indicative of building bearish momenumn, the balance remains delicate. Neither buyers nor sellers have full control. A potential SOL ETF approval in July—and the institutional demand it may unlock—could tip the scales in favor of a bullish continuation. $ETH Staking ETF is just around the corner. $SOL spot ETF is expected to be approved in 3-5 weeks. The setup for a massive altcoin season is there. Bulls about to full send alts to Valhalla. pic.twitter.com/pyIhFrBStE — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) June 11, 2025 While this bullish case is a far cry from overtaking Bitcoin, it sets a long-term precedent that could set Solana on the path to flip Ethereum to challenge the leading cryptocurrency. In the meantime, continued sell pressure could see the ascending channel break down, forming a new downtrend to retest lower supports or the handle’s base. Traders Have 3 Days to Make the Most of the Next Solana Rally New ICO Solaxy ($SOLX) could be the biggest beneficiary of a Solana price breakout as its first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution, filling a critical gap in the ecosystem. Solana has long lacked this capability, limiting its DeFi and cross-chain use case—until now. By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs, while offering seamless interoperability across both blockchains. With almost $50 million in its ongoing presale , investors are already rallying behind the project. When demand for Solana returns, it could be the one to reap the fresh ecosystem liquidity. There are just under 3 days before the phase ends, unlocking the untapped demand of exchanges. You can keep up with Solaxy on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Solaxy website .

2025-06-13T19:08:33,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Burn Rate Skyrockets 112,839% in 24 Hours – $1 SHIB Possible?","The Shiba Inu price (SHIB) has gone down by 7.1% in the past 24 hours as global markets react to Israel-Iran tensions. Trading volumes have surged by nearly 72% and currently account for more than 5% of the token’s circulating supply. Other tokens in this category like Pepe (PEPE) and SPX6900 (SPX) have experienced much more dramatic pullbacks of 20.2% and 17.5% during this same period respectively. Despite this latest weakness, one metric could favor a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast . According to Shib Burn , a website that tracks how many Shiba Inu tokens are burned in real time, the token’s burn rate experienced a 112,839% increase in just 24 hours as nearly 112 million SHIB were put out of circulation during this period. SHIB tokens are burned automatically when transactions like swaps occur within this blockchain. This significant amount of burned tokens implies that transaction volumes skyrocketed lately, possibly as sales picked up their pace during this recent pullback. That said, this number of burned is just a tiny fraction of the token’s circulating supply of nearly 590 trillion SHIB. In the near term though, it may help shrink the available supply to cushion SHIB’s decline. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Could Rise to $0.00001500 If It Bounces Off This Key Support Looking at the daily chart, the price action broke below its trend line support a few days ago and, since then, SHIB has been dropping quite sharply. The price already tried to move above its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) once and failed to do so. SHIB continues to trade below its 200-day EMA as well, which favors a bearish mid-term outlook. However, as the token approaches a key support at $0.00001050, the price could bounce off this level and find a way back to retest its former trend line support, which coincides with the 200-day EMA at $0.00001546. Traders should keep an eye on how the price action behaves once the price gets to that support as a strong bounce could favor a bullish short-term Shiba Inu price prediction. So, maybe not $1 for SHIB for now but the token does offer some promising upside if this key support holds. In the meantime, one of the most promising crypto presales of the year has arrived. Its name is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) and it is the first layer-2 scaling protocol for the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Hyper Surpasses $1M Raised Just 15 Days After Its Launch Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) aims to unlock billions of dollars of untapped potential within the Bitcoin blockchain by enabling investors, developers, and users to execute transactions safely through a layer-2 side chain. This project leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and uses smart contracts to automatically settle transactions made through its L2. It then bundles them into a single transaction sent to Bitcoin’s L1. This makes Bitcoin-based dApps scalable and cheaper to launch and operate and it opens up the door for the launch of meme coins and DeFi applications. Once the solution becomes widely adopted, the demand for $HYPER will explode. To buy this token at its discounted presale price, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

In the past 24 hours, BTC price dropped over 3 percent to trade about $105k on Friday, June 13, 2025, during the mid-North American trading session. The wider altcoin market experienced a similar drop, resulting in more than $1.1 billion rekt from crypto leveraged markets in the last 24 hours. As a result, crypto traders have been mixed with some remaining optimistic while some waiting for a clear signal to re-enter. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Issues a Bold Bitcoin Prediction The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a stablecoins summer following the ongoing regulatory goodwill from major jurisdictions, led by the United States. As the global money supply (M2) grows exponentially, more institutional investors have proliferated into the stablecoins market, thus significantly improving the crypto liquidity. Following the Bitcoin and wider altcoin drop in the past few days, Matt Hougan, the CIO at Bitwise, highlighted that an accumulation is more likely in the coming weeks before a parabolic rally before the end of this year. “I think this is the ‘Summer of Accumulation’, a moment for long-term investors to build positions ahead of an epic EOY run,” Hougan noted . What the Chart is Saying? After enjoying an impressive rally following the end of the trade wars in the past two months, BTC price experienced a significant resistance level of about $112k. The flagship coin failed to rally beyond $112k and has since retraced to a crucial buy zone of around $105k. In the four-hour timeframe, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD line KAS been hinting at potential reversal. Furthermore, the RSI has been hovering around the oversold levels and the MACD’s histogram has been hinting at declining selling pressure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-price-drop-to-105k-divides-crypto-traders-what-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), which have low liquidity compared to Bitcoin, were among the assets that lost the most value in this process. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest asset in the cryptocurrency market, is trading sideways at $105,600 at the time of writing, despite falling by as much as 3%. “The crypto market is reacting negatively to the news of Israel’s attack on Iran, in line with other risk assets. Technically, support is expected at $101,000, but geopolitical developments will determine price action in the short term,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets. Related News: Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Offers $100 Million Bitcoin (BTC) and ADA Swap Proposal! Will ADA Price Drop? Following the developments, investors turned to safe havens such as government bonds, while stocks fell, oil prices rose more than 9% and gold gained value. “While Bitcoin is sometimes traded as a macroeconomic hedge, in high-risk moments like military conflict, investors prioritize liquidity over narrative. Positions are closed to generate cash, dollars are diverted, and leverage is reduced in volatile assets,” said Sean McNulty, head of derivatives Asia-Pacific at FalconX Ltd. IG analyst Tony Sycamore said there was likely to be a “further deterioration in risk appetite” heading into the weekend. *This is not investment advice.

After slumping to the $102,600 mark, bitcoin BTC rebounded to around $106,000 before fading lower in the U.S. afternoon hours with reports about a fresh wave of airstrikes targeting Iran. The top cryptocurrency was down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, changing hands at $105,200 and still less than 6% shy of its all-time high price. Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins — has lost 4.4% in the same period of time. Tokens such as ether ETH, avalanche AVAX and toncoin TON were the hardest hit, slumping between 6% and 8%. Crypto stocks, however, aren’t doing too hot. Most equities are in the red, especially bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), down 5% and 4% respectively. A notable exception is stablecoin issuer Circle (CIRCL), which is still benefiting from the windfall of its recent IPO; the stock is up 13% today, with news of retail giants Amazon and Walmart reportedly exploring stablecoins adding to the momentum. Traditional markets don’t seem overwhelmingly concerned by the war. While gold is up 1.3%, potentially gearing up for new all-time highs, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are only down 0.4% each. What's next for bitcoin? ""Nice bounce thus far and lack of follow-through lower,"" well-followed crypto trader Skew said in a Friday X post . Market participants will likely remain cautious through the weekend with BTC tightly correlated with traditional markets amid heightened geopolitical risks, Skew added. On the longer timeframe, some analysts see risks of a deeper pullback. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen noted that BTC's drop below $106,000 translates to a failed breakout, and traders should wait for more favorable setups before rushing to buy the dip. He highlighted the $100,000-$101,000 zone as key support, warning that a break below could mark a return to the broader consolidation phase similar to last summer. John Glover, chief investment officer at bitcoin lender Ledn, argued that bitcoin entered a corrective phase from its record highs that could see the largest digital asset drop to $88,000-$93,000. He said the $90,000 level could offer a favorable entry for opportunistic investors before BTC resumes its uptrend.

The firm recently added 56.87 BTC to its holdings, spending about ¥887 million, equivalent to about $6 million. This latest move pushes Remixpoint’s total Bitcoin stash past 1,000 BTC, a major milestone for the company. This move reflects a growing trend among businesses worldwide, adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as part of long-term financial strategies. Remixpoint Increases Bitcoin Holdings Remixpoint’s purchase of 56.87 BTC was made at an average price of $104,000 per coin. This latest buy pushes Remixpoint’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,038.27 BTC, marking the first time the firm has held over 1,000 BTC in its reserve. The market value of Remixpoint’s crypto assets is now around ¥17.25 billion, valued at $115 million. Bitcoin alone makes up about ¥16.1 billion, valued at $107 million of this amount. The Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed company currently holds an unrealized profit of ¥2.32 billion. This highlights its belief in Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The money for the recent purchase came from a stock acquisition rights exercise completed on June 10. A Growing Trend in Japan and Beyond Remixpoint is not the only Japanese company increasing its exposure to Bitcoin. Metaplanet, another Tokyo-listed firm, now holds 8,888 BTC, valued at over $921 million.

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, remains the biggest corporate holder, holding about 3% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply . Financial institutions are also getting involved. Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, recently launched a structured bond linked to Bitcoin. This shows that digital assets are becoming more accepted in mainstream finance.

According to Coinbase, traditional finance serves as a barrier to success for smaller businesses, with crypto assets being the solution. “Startups struggling to hire and reliably pay global talent, small family-owned businesses taken through the wringer by credit card fees, interest rates and chargebacks, a new restaurant’s books wrecked by long settlement cycles – all factors that eat into the efficiency and earning potential of almost all businesses today. Crypto and stablecoins solve this exact problem for all of the above with fast, global, and low-cost money movement.” Coinbase Business will offer business owners a quick and easy way to settle payments using digital assets, trade and manage their crypto portfolios, earn passive income via stablecoin rewards, streamline accounting using third-party software, and onboard new users. “We’re bringing [our] security, scale, and compliance to everyday businesses with Coinbase Business – a modern financial stack built with the speed and scale of crypto.

2025-06-13T18:40:31,"Former Wex exchange chief to face charges in the U.S.","Officials in Poland have agreed to hand over the former chief executive of Wex, once Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to the United States. The Russian national was arrested in Warsaw at the end of 2024 at a U.S. request issued within a criminal case over alleged fraud and money laundering. Former Wex exchange chief to face charges in the U.S. Polish authorities have approved the extradition of Dmitry Vasiliev, former director of the now defunct Russian digital asset exchange Wex, to the United States, Russia’s official news agency reported late on Thursday, quoting his lawyer, Alexander Surzhin. In an interview, Surzhin explained that the Russian national will be transferred to U.S. custody as part of the case that was initiated against Alexander Vinnik, co-founder of the infamous BTC-e exchange, succeeded by Wex. The lawyer told Tass: “The Polish Minister of Justice has signed a permission to extradite to the United States my client, Dmitry Vasiliev, who was detained in Warsaw last year as part of an American investigation into a criminal case, in which Alexander Vinnik was also a defendant.” Surzhin, who represents Vasiliev at the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ), expects that his client may find himself in the United States in the near future to face charges that may bring him a 25-year prison sentence. Vasiliev’s odyssey takes him to America after Vinnik’s return to Russia Wex’s ex-head was arrested in Warsaw in December 2024. At the time, the Polish police said they were acting on a U.S. request, adding that the Russian was in custody awaiting the completion of the extradition procedure. A statement quoted by Reuters detailed: “Dmitry V. is suspected of numerous frauds, money transfers and money laundering in connection with running one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.” But that wasn’t Vasiliev’s first time in jail. Polish law enforcement detained him in 2021 when he was wanted by and subsequently sent to Kazakhstan . The Central Asian nation was accusing him of fraud related to the crypto exchange he had been running. Earlier that year, Vasiliev was apprehended in Italy but released several weeks later, with Italian authorities citing faults in the extradition request. Then in 2022, he was also arrested in Croatia, according to local media reports, which revealed that Zagreb acted on a red warrant issued by Interpol. The case in Kazakhstan was based on the accusations of three crypto investors who alleged that in 2018, the Russian took their dollars but never sent them the Bitcoin they wanted to buy. It was closed in October 2024 after the court established that they were too incompetent to work with crypto wallets. Another chapter in the Vinnik-Wex-BTC-e saga Wex launched in September 2017 after BTC-e shut down earlier that year. The former was considered the successor of the latter, as it took over its customer database. Vasiliev was managing the new trading platform until its collapse in 2018. His arrests were preceded by the disappearance of almost $500 million from accounts hosted on Wex, including some that belonged to European investors. BTC-e’s alleged operator, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece in 2017. He was later extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December 2020. Vinnik was then handed over to the U.S. in 2022, where he was held accountable for laundering up to $9 billion through the exchange. In May 2024, he pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Eventually, the United States exchanged Vinnik, in a prisoner swap with Moscow under President Trump, for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who had been held in a Russian prison since 2021 and had received a 14-year sentence for allegedly carrying medical cannabis in his luggage. Earlier in June this year, Bloomberg Law reported that another suspected BTC-e operator, Belarusian national Aliaksandr Klimenka, has asked a U.S. judge to dismiss the case against him, arguing he could no longer have Vinnik testify on his behalf since his return to Russia.

2025-06-13T18:32:11,"As BTC swings, smart money eye RUVI with audit incoming and $1.7M raised","Bitcoin’s well-documented price volatility has always been a double-edged sword for investors. While its swings create significant opportunities for short-term growth, they also introduce a level of risk that can deter those seeking more stable long-term returns. This volatility has prompted smart investors to look for emerging projects with strong fundamentals. One name rising to the top of these alternative opportunities is Ruvi AI, an innovative blockchain platform powered by artificial intelligence. With over $1.7 million raised in its ongoing presale, a global partnership with WEEX Exchange, and an incoming third-party audit, Ruvi AI is proving to be more than just hype. Here’s why industry analysts believe this project is set to skyrocket. Bitcoin’s volatility drives investors to alternatives Bitcoin’s significant price fluctuations are nothing new.

2025-06-13T18:05:54,"SUI Drops 10% to $3.02, but Is a Turnaround Forming After Buyers Step In Near $3?","Sui (SUI) SUI dropped 9.64% to $3.0211 on June 13, extending a steep overnight correction that saw the token fall from $3.34 to an intraday low of $2.9556. The breakdown at $3.20 — a previously firm support zone—unleashed heavy sell pressure and marked a turning point in short-term sentiment, with over 50 million tokens traded during the selloff. After briefly breaching the $3.00 level, SUI found support around $2.997, where buyer interest began to surface. Price has since recovered into a narrow $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band, though momentum remains fragile. Lower highs continue to form, suggesting that sellers are still in control unless bulls can reclaim levels above $3.05 with conviction. The sharp move follows a wave of broader crypto weakness and a brief spike in BTC prices tied to U.S. inflation data earlier this week. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, SUI’s price behavior appears primarily technical: the $3.20 breakdown triggered cascading stop-losses and panic selling, while psychological support near $3.00 has temporarily stemmed the decline. Volume patterns suggest cautious accumulation, with a notable spike at 14:00 UTC when over 1.2 million tokens changed hands. However, unless buyers can reclaim key resistance levels, the current bounce may prove short-lived. A confirmed close above $3.05 would be the first step toward invalidating the current downtrend. Technical Analysis Highlights UI dropped from $3.343 to $2.9556 in 24 hours, a 12.9% decline before partial recovery. Sell pressure intensified after the $3.20 breakdown at 00:00 UTC, with 50M+ tokens traded. Price has stabilized in a $3.00–$3.05 consolidation band. A minor recovery lifted price from $2.997 to $3.017 in the most recent hour. Volume at 14:00 UTC topped 1.2M, signaling short-term accumulation near support. Resistance sits at $3.05; support remains firm at $2.94.

2025-06-13T18:05:52,"Here Are the Possible Bearish Targets for Bitcoin After BTC Fails To Break Out Above Major Level, According to Crypto Analyst","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may pull back after failing to hold a key support level. In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 116,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC may revisit the lower bound of a trading range at the $100,000 level, after a possible weekend bounce. “Possible scenario for BTC following Thursday’s $106,600 failure. Pull back/consolidate on Friday, weekend rally (because that’s what retail does) into $106,000-$107,000, and then revisit the $100,000 lows. Invalidation on a sustained break (high time frames) above $107,000… Personally, I wouldn’t be a buyer here, not after losing $106,600. It’s shorts only for me, but only if BTC gives me the opportunity on a bounce.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also says that BTC whales exiting long positions in favor of building short positions against retail is causing the flagship crypto asset to weaken. “Whales were shorting into retail strength all day Thursday. It was a scam BTC pump from the start.” Lastly, the analyst warns that the USDT dominance chart (USDT.D) may start flashing bearish for Bitcoin. Many traders closely watch the USDT.D chart as it shows how much of the crypto market cap is comprised of the stablecoin USDT. A bullish USDT.D chart is generally considered bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it indicates traders are unloading their crypto holdings in favor of the stablecoin. “Not ready to call it just yet, but the USDT.D weekly chart is starting to look primed for another push back to 5%. I’ll wait for Friday’s two-day close to get a more definitive answer on this idea, but it looks decent so far. (Tether dominance moves inversely to BTC and ETH).” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,658 at time of writing, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, USDT.D is at 4.79% at time of writing.

Bitcoin sank 5%, slipping under the $104,000 mark. Altcoins fared worse, with losses ranging from 6% to 9%. Based on reports from Coinglass, more than $1 billion was wiped out in liquidations, over $1 billion of which were long positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears Rising Tensions Shake Global Markets According to market watchers, the strike prompted a swift move into safe assets. S&P 500 futures tumbled 1.9%, while oil and gold jumped sharply. WTI crude climbed more than 12%, reaching about $77 per barrel. Gold surged past $3,400 an ounce as investors sought shelter. Crypto Traders Feel The Heat Arthur Hayes, the ex-CEO of BitMEX, warned of rough waters ahead. “Hold on to your butts out there, degens,” he wrote after the crash. He also pointed to US President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs as an added layer of risk. Ethereum slid 8% down to $2,505, right at a key support level. Other coins fell up to 10% in just a few hours.

Oil prices have climbed about 30% since May lows, analysts say. Anyone betting on lower inflation or early rate cuts may have to rethink things. Gold’s climb suggests that many feel uneasy about what comes next. Even so, some expect this spike to calm once tensions ease. What Comes Next For Crypto Short-term views remain mixed. Some traders see this as a knee-jerk reaction and expect a rebound once headlines fade. Others warn that the US CPI release later this week could add another twist. Inflation data could either fuel more selling or pave the way for relief if numbers come in cooler than expected. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Just 0.2% Of Global Wealth — And That’s Why It’s Not Too Late: Analyst Volatility is back with a vengeance. Over the past weeks, markets were already on edge amid chatter of higher interest rates and global conflicts. Now, with the Middle East front in focus again, big swings may stay in place. Analysts even suggest Bitcoin could dip to $95,000 if selling continues to gather steam. A $1 billion wave of liquidations isn’t small. At the same time, the speed of the move may leave some traders hoping for a quick bounce. Watching safe-haven assets, US economic data, and any new developments in the Iran-Israel tensions will be key in the hours and days ahead.
