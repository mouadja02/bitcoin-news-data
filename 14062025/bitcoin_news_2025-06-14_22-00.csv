2025-06-14T19:00:37,"Investors Are Fleeing Ethereum, On‑Chain Numbers Reveal","With investor demand seemingly on the rise, the Ethereum price looked set to cross the psychological $3,000 level over the past week. However, this dream hit a major stumbling block after geopolitical tensions quickly escalated in the late hours of Thursday, June 13. It didn’t take much time for Israel’s airstrike against Iran to impact the global financial markets, with crypto prices succumbing to a fresh wave of downward pressure. Specifically, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost about 6% of its value in the past 24 hours. Is Capital Flowing Out Of ETH Into BTC? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha shared fresh insights into the wave of volatility that recently hit the cryptocurrency market. The crypto pundit noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin were particularly impacted by the recent global happenings. Related Reading: A Rare Bitcoin Signal Is Flashing: Could the Bull Run Just Be Getting Started? Firstly, Taha noted the decline in the Ethereum Open Interest (OI) on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the ETH OI metric experienced a significant 19% dip in the past 24 hours, coinciding with a decrease in price. The Open Interest indicator estimates the total amount of money flowing into derivatives of a specific cryptocurrency at any given time. A falling OI value is often considered a bearish signal, as it suggests a decline in investor confidence and positive sentiment. According to Taha, this latest abrupt decline in the Ethereum Open Interest points to a wave of panic-induced selling, with investors instinctively exiting their long positions. “Traders likely rushed to close their long positions, either manually in fear of deeper losses or automatically via forced liquidations as stop-loss triggers were hit,” the analyst said. Taha drew a parallel relationship between the falling Ethereum Open Interest and the flow of Bitcoin out of Coinbase, the largest centralized exchange in the United States. CryptoQuant data shows a significant withdrawal of 7,000 BTC from the trading platform in the past day. According to Taha, this substantial exchange outflow of Bitcoin, coinciding precisely with the Ethereum OI decline, suggests fresh buying and that large investors may be strategically repositioning for accumulation. This trend might not be particularly positive for ETH, as it shows that capital might be rotating back into the premier cryptocurrency. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,546, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T19:00:04,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Jumps as Over 537M SHIB Set Ablaze","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most well-known memecoins, has significantly increased its burn rate over the past 24 hours. More than 537 million worth of SHIB coins have been taken out of circulation. This caused the burn rate to jump by 3,484%, a massive increase from the day before. This turn of events has made the SHIB community more hopeful for the token’s future. This came after the SHIB ecosystem improved its decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. Massive Token Burn Fuels Shiba Inu Price Jump Burning coins usually helps reduce the total supply, making the remaining coins more valuable. Following this large burn, SHIB’s price increased by 4.12%, trading at $0.000012, and its total market value crossed $7.2 billion. This price bounce came shortly after SHIB dropped by 10% earlier in the week. This drop was caused mainly by a bigger dip in the crypto market, which reacted to rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Furthermore, Shibburn tracking platform shows that the recent increase in SHIB’s burn rate continues a trend seen earlier this week. In a notable move, one wallet alone burned over 500 million SHIB in the past 12 hours. The Shiba Inu community has used token burning to help support long-term value. As SHIB’s price went up, its future open interest rose by over 4%, reaching $141.85 million. According to Coinglass data, traders are showing more confidence in SHIB’s short-term performance. A rise in open interest usually means more trading activity and a stronger belief in the token’s direction. This geopolitical tension also shook the entire crypto market. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) dropped 2.8% after the incident , falling from $106,042 to $103,053. However, the flagship crypto seems to be back on a bullish path. According to CoinMarketCap data, it is trading at $105,092 at the time of writing, up 0.27% in the past 24 hours. SHIB Whale Activity Drops Despite Price Uptick Even though the token burn and price rise are good signs, data shows that large-scale SHIB holders are pulling back . In the past 24 hours, large transaction volume has dropped 65%. Wallets with at least $100,000 worth of SHIB have seen a significant slowdown in activity. This points to weakening interest among big investors, possibly due to recent market uncertainty. On June 6, the enormous transaction volume hit 17.63 trillion SHIB. However, this has dropped to just 948.59 billion SHIB, showing that many big investors are pulling away. Experts say if larger investors continue to reduce their holdings, it may put downward pressure on the SHIB price. Still, if the burn rate remains high and market confidence improves, SHIB could regain strength.

2025-06-14T19:00:02,"Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio Outlines Meme Stock Trading Strategy, Says Investors Are Not Paying Enough Attention to the ‘Most Important Thing’","Billionaire hedge fund legend Ray Dalio thinks investors aren’t paying attention to obvious factors in meme stock trading. Dalio says in a new post on X that there’s always a “current most popular meme” that everyone believes in but is bound to lose its status. “These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don’t take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don’t pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing.” Dalio says this behavior sets the stage for potential market missteps, especially in the current economic climate. At this time, it is typical for almost everyone to be looking to make money by buying assets that they believe will go up (rather than betting on them going down), and they quite often use leverage.” Dalio’s meme trading advice follows dire warnings he’s recently issued about the US economy. Earlier this month, Dalio argued in an interview on PBS that the government needs to lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-14T18:45:30,"NBA Legend Shaquille O’Neal To Settle FTX Endorsement Lawsuit for $1,800,000","New court filings show that NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal will settle a lawsuit related to the endorsement of defunct crypto exchange FTX for $1.8 million. According to recent court documents, the retired superstar is settling a lawsuit where he’s accused of promoting FTX, which went bankrupt in 2022 after its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found to be mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds as well as defrauding investors. “This proposed settlement… results from the tremendous efforts of the parties, with negotiations informed by previous mediations and settlement agreements which were reached in this action. Defendant O’Neal has agreed to provide $1,800,000 in monetary relief in exchange for reaching this early settlement, which amount will be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the settlement.” However, the agreement between the parties is still pending approval from the court. O’Neal and other marquee celebrities – such as fellow NBA superstar Stephen Curry, NFL quarterbacks Tom Brady and Trevor Lawrence, MLB pitcher Shohei Ohtani, Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, and supermodel Gisele Bündchen – were all accused of failing to perform due diligence before promoting FTX in a class action lawsuit filed in 2022. O’Neal, who received $750,000 to endorse the crypto exchange, first agreed to a settlement in April, though the amount at the time was undisclosed. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of his crimes in 2023 and was sentenced to 25 years behind bars in 2024.

2025-06-14T18:41:17,"Bitcoin’s Stability Tested Following Trump’s ‘Very Alarming’ Remarks on Middle East Tension","Reports have emerged about a hours-long phone conversation between the heads of state of the US and Russia, where topics ranged from the growing tension in the Middle East to Donald Trump’s birthday. According to some publications, the POTUS described the Israel-Iran situation as “very alarming,” as there’s no closure in sight. BREAKING: President Trump tells Putin that the situation in the Middle East is “very alarming.” — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 14, 2025 Recall the events that transpired between the two nations located in the Middle East as Israel hit Iran first on Friday morning, killing over 70 people in the process, including high-end generals and nuclear scientists. Iran responded last night, but the damage was significantly less. Although Trump previously expressed hope that Iran could be closer to signing a nuclear deal now, he and Putin were reportedly concerned about the recent escalation, as the conflict is nowhere near a resolution. Nevertheless, both still “did not rule out a return to negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program,” reported the Moscow Times, citing a statement from the Kremlin. Israel’s attack against Iran earlier this week had an immediate and profound impact on the cryptocurrency market, with BTC slumping from a Thursday peak of $108,500 to under $103,000 on Friday morning. Iran’s response failed to influence the market in a similar manner, but BTC is back in the red after Trump’s most recent remarks. Some analysts warned that the largest cryptocurrency could plunge below $80,000 if the sell-off intensifies and it fails to maintain the $100,000 support. BTCUSD.

2025-06-14T18:17:03,"Analyst sets Bitcoin’s next buying opportunity after BTC ‘started to cascade south’","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has entered a volatile phase, and according to cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe, this could soon present a new buying opportunity. His outlook follows recent losses that dragged the broader market lower, triggered by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. After failing to hold above $106,000, Bitcoin began what Poppe described as a “cascade south,” slicing through liquidity zones and prompting a wave of sell-offs, he noted in a June 14 X post. A brief bounce followed, but the recovery was quickly rejected at the same $106,000 level, now acting as firm resistance. The leading digital currency had regained bullish momentum earlier, only to lose it after a liquidity sweep and sharp rejection at a local high. Now, the $101,500 to $102,500 range could serve as either a launchpad for recovery or a setup for further downside. To this end, Poppe noted that a fresh rally could take shape if Bitcoin holds above $102,500 and consolidates. But if selling pressure intensifies, he sees the $98,000 to $99,000 zone as a strong candidate for a high-probability long entry. $BTC has a very similar picture. We couldn't hold above $106K and then we started to cascade south taking all the liquidity. Bounce upwards, instant rejection at that crucial level. Two options; – Sub $100K buy opportunity if this continues to fall. – Price holds around… pic.twitter.com/dOCjnBBtOP — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 14, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s volume profile supports this view, highlighting heavy selling after the failed breakout. A lower support zone could also be a trap for late short positions, offering an ideal re-entry point for bullish traders. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch In a separate June 14 analysis, RLinda noted that Bitcoin is consolidating within a broad range between $100,600 and $110,400. The Middle East geopolitical tension spike briefly disrupted its bullish structure, pushing the price down to $102,500 before a sharp recovery. That rebound reinforced support at $102,500, with $106,200 now a key resistance level. Despite market uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to hold above critical support. According to the analyst, short-term trading strategies remain viable if the cryptocurrency stays within the $100,600 to $102,500 range. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

The class action lawsuit accused the retail giant of breaking the federal Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) by handing sensitive information over to Facebook. Specifically, GameStop is accused of using a Facebook tracking pixel on its website that quietly and automatically sent customers’ personal information, including video game purchase details, to Facebook without consent. The $4.5 million settlement applies to people who purchased a game from the company’s online store from August 18th, 2020 through April 17th, 2025. At the time of the purchase, eligible customers must have been members of Facebook and maintained a public Facebook profile using their actual name. The settlement website to file a claim is here . The exact number of people affected by the settlement is unclear, and affected customers are set to receive up to $5 cash or a $10 voucher – suggesting hundreds of thousands may be eligible. GameStop has not admitted any wrongdoing in the settlement, and the company has pledged to permanently remove the tracking pixel to prevent future unauthorized data sharing.

The revelation came through a detailed financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which was viewed by the Financial Times. The 200-page report identifies World Liberty Financial as one of Trump’s most significant sources of income, with the president holding 15.75 billion governance tokens. Rather than purchasing the tokens, Trump received them as part of promotional activities related to the platform. Token Holdings Raise Conflict-of-Interest Concerns The report also details Trump’s transactions with other crypto-related companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, although these companies reported minimal income. While swearing that the filing’s contents are “true, complete, and correct,” ethical concerns have been raised by critics. Trump removed David Huitema, head of the Office of Government Ethics, from office earlier this year, which raised further controversy over his crypto dealings. The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, has eased enforcement actions against crypto firms — a move some say directly benefits Trump’s online venture. World Liberty Financial: $1B Raised, A-List Backers World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform, conducted a token offering last year that raised $1 billion through the sale of 21 billion tokens. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “promoter” for the project, 2024 SEC filings show. Criticisms from both sides of the aisle have been raised over whether Trump’s ongoing profit from crypto investments presents a conflict of interest, especially when creating policy impacting the industry. DRW Investments Shores Up Trump’s Digital Dreams Major financial backing has come from DRW Investments, led by Chicago trader Don Wilson. DRW invested $100 million in Trump Media just weeks after its affiliate Cumberland received SEC enforcement relief from the new administration. This support enables Trump Media’s plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury strategy and the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investigations Underway Representative Jamie Raskin has launched a congressional probe into a private dinner Trump hosted for anchor investors in his meme coin, adding pressure on an already controversial crypto portfolio.

2025-06-14T17:30:42,"Bitcoin Breaks Macro Rules: Risk Appetite Grows Despite Hawkish Signals","Bitcoin is trading just above the pivotal $103,600 level, a critical support zone that has acted as a key threshold for bulls throughout this cycle. If it fails to hold, analysts warn that BTC could swiftly drop below $100,000, triggering a broader correction across the crypto market. This comes as global markets react to escalating geopolitical risk—Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, prompting immediate retaliation and fueling volatility across commodities, equities, and digital assets. Despite the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to show relative strength, holding above the $100K psychological level even as investors flee risk assets. Top analyst Darkfost highlights a unique dynamic in this cycle: the unusual decoupling between Bitcoin and bond yields. Historically, rising US Treasury yields have coincided with crypto drawdowns. However, in the current environment, Bitcoin has continued to trend upward, even as yields sit near some of the highest levels in its history. According to crypto analyst Darkfost, Bitcoin’s bullish momentum appears to be increasingly influenced by weakness in the US Dollar Index (DXY). Each time the dollar retreats, BTC has shown strong acceleration, suggesting global liquidity flows may be favoring Bitcoin as an alternative macro hedge. The next few days will be crucial. Bitcoin Shows Resilience Amid Geopolitical Risk After failing to break above the $112,000 resistance, Bitcoin dropped over 6%, sparking concern that bears may push the price below critical support. However, despite the volatility, BTC remains resilient—holding above the $103,600 mark—even as the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran rattles global markets. Darkfost emphasizes the growing importance of macroeconomic indicators like the DXY and US Treasury yields. These metrics increasingly dictate institutional sentiment and global liquidity flows. Traditionally, when both the DXY and yields climb, capital exits risk assets, leading to sharp corrections in Bitcoin and broader crypto markets. Historically, this macro environment has marked the onset of bear markets for BTC. Conversely, when the DXY and yields begin to stall or fall, investor confidence in risk assets tends to return. Such periods often coincide with monetary easing or speculation over future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve—conditions that ignite bullish momentum in the crypto space. What makes this cycle unique, according to Darkfost, is Bitcoin’s divergence from rising yields. Despite yields reaching multi-year highs, BTC has continued trending upward, particularly when the DXY softens. This decoupling signals a possible structural shift in how Bitcoin behaves relative to traditional financial metrics. One explanation for this anomaly is the evolving perception of Bitcoin as a macro hedge and store of value. With inflation concerns and sovereign debt risks on the rise, institutional capital may now be treating BTC not merely as a speculative asset, but as a hedge against systemic risk. If this narrative continues gaining traction, Bitcoin could carve out a new role within the global financial landscape—one that redefines its relationship with macro forces. Bulls Defend Critical Support Amid Renewed Volatility Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,300 after a volatile session triggered by geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty. The chart shows that BTC briefly dipped below the $103,600 support level—a key horizontal demand zone—but managed to reclaim it swiftly, suggesting strong interest from buyers at lower levels. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are clustered between $105,950 and $106,600, and currently act as dynamic resistance. For Bitcoin to regain bullish momentum, it must break above this confluence of moving averages and reclaim the $106,600–$107,000 zone. Failing to do so could open the door to another retest of the $103,600 level, which has been tested multiple times since early May. Volume spiked during the most recent drop, indicating capitulation or forced selling, often followed by short-term recoveries. However, buyers will want to see sustained strength above $106,000 to consider this a true reversal rather than a relief bounce.

According to Glassnode , XRP’s 30-day percentage change in realized cap—a metric that measures the total value of coins moved at their last price—has jumped +4.2%. Solana has only seen +1% growth over the same period. $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 This divergence means capital is rotating into XRP faster than Solana, implying short-term accumulation by traders who are positioning for a breakout. Realized cap is especially useful during times of uncertainty, as it shows wealth that has actually moved on-chain rather than speculative market value. A higher realized cap growth often correlates with more network activity and investor confidence. For context: XRP 30D Realized Cap: +4.2% SOL 30D Realized Cap: +1% The big jump in XRP’s realized capital could be seen as a sign of shifting sentiment among retail and institutional traders alike, possibly ahead of regulatory clarity or broader crypto market momentum. XRP Technical Analysis Says Be Cautious Despite the on-chain strength, XRP’s chart is still cautionary. It’s trading at $2.13, down 0.70% in the last 24 hours and stuck below a descending trendline that has rejected every bullish attempt since early June. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Price action failed to reclaim the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart (now at $2.19), and XRP has printed a lower high. Red-bodied candles with rejection wicks at $2.18 show continued resistance. The MACD has a slight bullish crossover, but the histogram is fading, so not much momentum for now. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $2.18, $2.22 Support: $2.09, $2.0474, $2.0042 EMA Barrier: 50-EMA at $2.19 XRP price prediction remains bearish unless XRP breaks above the descending trendline and confirms strength above $2.22; traders may continue to see downside pressure. XRP Trade Setups to Watch As XRP consolidates under resistance, traders have clearly defined levels to monitor for both bullish and bearish strategies. Short Trade Idea: Entry: Rejection near $2.18 Stop: Above $2.22 Targets: $2.0936, $2.0474 Long Trade Setup: Entry: Breakout and close above $2.22 Stop: Below $2.18 Targets: $2.27, $2.3365 For now, the fundamentals suggest investor interest is heating up, but price must follow through with a clean breakout to confirm the next leg higher. Until then, XRP remains at a technical crossroads.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to $105,300, up by 2.4% from its lowest point on Friday, and 5% above this month’s lowest point. SoSoValue data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $301 million on Friday, even as Bitcoin’s price dropped to nearly $100,000. This pushed total weekly ETF inflows to $1.3 billion—a sharp reversal from the previous week’s $128 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF, whose ticker symbol is IBIT, had daily inflows of $238 million on Friday, bringing its cumulative figure to $49.7 billion. It now has $70 billion in assets, making it the fastest-growing ETF in finance.

Fidelity’s FBTC ETF has had over $11 billion in inflows, while Bitwise’s BITB has had $2 billion since inception. A possible reason why Wall Street investors bought Bitcoin’s dip is that it maintains strong fundamentals. BlackRock’s data shows that Bitcoin beats the stock market after a major geopolitical event such as the Iran and Israel attacks . Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has plunged from 1.5 million in January to 1.1 million today. Falling Bitcoin supplies at a time of falling supplies will likely boost the price in the long term.

The Brazilian government, which currently presides over the alliance, announced on Friday that Vietnam would join BRICS as a “partner country.” Partner countries, a category the bloc established last year, aren’t full-fledged members but are invited to participate in the BRICS summit and can endorse the alliance’s declarations. Vietnam is the 10th partner country, joining Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan. BRICS held its initial summit in 2009 was originally just called BRIC, which stood for its four founding members: Brazil, Russia, India and China. The acronym changed to BRICS after South Africa joined the following year. In 2024, it expanded membership to other nations, including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia joined in early 2025. Brazil also claims that Saudi Arabia is part of the bloc, but the Middle Eastern country has reportedly eschewed formal membership in the intercontinental economic alliance to avoid antagonizing the US. Brazil says current BRICS priorities include “facilitating economic transactions between bloc countries, such as the use of local currencies; the development of international payment platforms; cooperation in government procurement; and the promotion of trade facilitation measures, among others.” In 2023, the alliance reportedly began working on creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets to circumvent reliance on the US dollar, though officials from several of the bloc’s member countries claimed in early 2025 that they weren’t pushing for de-dollarization.

2025-06-14T16:48:33,"U.S. Treasury Quietly Pours $20,000,000,000 Into Record-Breaking Bond Buyback Operation – Is Stealth QE Underway?","The U.S. Treasury Department has now poured $20 billion into a major Treasury buyback operation in the span of two weeks. The Treasury’s June 3rd and June 10th buybacks , which are historic in size, allow the agency to repurchase securities maturing between May and July of this year. The move has triggered social media speculation that a stealth quantitative easing operation is now underway, with the Treasury mimicking the Federal Reserve’s money-printing tactics to stimulate the economy. Skeptics argue that by repurchasing illiquid bonds with borrowed funds, the Treasury is subtly propping up the bond market to maintain confidence in an overextended system. But Bianco Research’s Jim Bianco says claims that the Treasury’s moves are a form of quiet QE are way off the mark. “Everyone is calling Treasury buybacks “stealth QE.” They misunderstand. This is the Treasury, not the Fed… The Treasury cannot “print.” The Treasury borrows new more liquid “on-the-run” bonds and uses the proceeds to buyback old illiquid “off-the-run” bonds. Buybacks do not “create money,” rather they improve the overall quality of the bond market. Buybacks support the bond market in that they make it more liquid so it reduces the (lack of) liquidity premium. But that’s only a few basis points.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently touted the agency’s “big toolkit” to support the bond market if needed, citing buybacks as a strategic option to enhance liquidity and stabilize conditions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.261, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.321. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.194, resulting in a correction to $0.159. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.2. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus.

2025-06-14T16:05:29,"VanEck Exec Calls Out Small-Cap Firms Over Crypto Investment Claims","Matthew Sigel, a digital asset expert at VanEck, has recently voiced concerns about a rising trend among small-cap companies. These firms are announcing plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP. However, many have weak financial positions and extremely low market values. According to Sigel, these announcements are not genuine business strategies but appear to be efforts to boost stock prices through misleading information. VanEck Exec Spotlight Crypto Treasury Anomaly Several companies with market capitalizations under $100 million have made bold claims about buying large amounts of digital currencies. Some of these companies have promised to invest between $300 million and $800 million in crypto, even though their total value is much lower. These claims have sparked doubts among analysts and investors. Sigel highlighted Trident Digital Tech as an example. Recently, the company, valued at just $16 million, announced plans to raise $500 million to acquire XRP . The gap between its value and stated goal has caused many to question whether the announcement is possible. Sigel Likened Crypto Treasuries Plans To a Pump and Dump Scheme The VanEck Executive points out several warning signs. Most companies making these bold claims have no known track record in the crypto industry. They usually lack the funding needed to carry out such large investments. In many cases, these announcements come when the crypto market is rising. Segel suggests they are timed to take advantage of investor excitement. He warned that these patterns match the behavior seen in pump-and-dump schemes. President Trump was accused of this tactic in January. In this scheme, insiders push up stock prices with exaggerated news and then sell their shares for a profit. This leaves regular investors with overvalued stock and heavy losses. A Broader Industry Trend The problem is not limited to one or two companies. Addentax Group, a Chinese clothing company worth only a few million dollars, said it plans to buy $800 million worth of Bitcoin and TRUMP tokens. Likewise, DeFi Development Corp announced it would sell $5 billion in shares to purchase Solana . After the announcement, its market cap jumped from $7 million to $379 million, demonstrating how such statements can instantly influence investor behavior. Other companies, including Classover Holdings and Webus International, have made similar promises. Each claimed it would raise hundreds of millions to buy digital assets despite their total value of less than $100 million. Industry analysts are warning investors not to take such announcements at face value. Investors are advised to examine the company’s financial reports and ability to raise funds before making any investment decisions.

2025-06-14T16:00:12,"Why Bitcoin Price Continues To Rise Despite Soaring Treasury Yields  — Analyst","Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has maintained a somewhat healthy momentum, forging minor swing highs and lows in its bull run revival. Interestingly, this early-week upward movement has been corrected following the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. All in all, the overall positive outlook for the premier cryptocurrency has remained, even though it has been observed to be against historical perspective. An on-chain analyst on social media platform X has delved into this strange phenomenon in the BTC market and the possible reasons behind it. Bitcoin’s Historical Correlations With Macro Instruments In a recent post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost broke down what, until recently, used to be conventional expectations in the Bitcoin market relative to broader macroeconomics. The crypto pundit mentioned that investors consider key indicators when trying to decipher what institutional sentiments and the broader state of global liquidity may be like. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts – Can Demand Hold? The key indicators investors highlighted in this analysis include the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies, and the US Treasury Yields, which basically represent the return investors earn on United States government bonds. According to Darkfost, the above chart illustrates a well-known macro principle: when both the DXY and bond yields are on the rise, capital tends to flee risk assets (one of which is Bitcoin). As a result, the premier cryptocurrency becomes susceptible to corrective movements. According to the on-chain analyst, this principle is backed by historical trends, as bear markets in crypto have coincided with strong uptrends in both yields and the DXY. On the other hand, when there is a loss of momentum in DXY and yields, investor appetite tends to shift towards risk. The reason for this, Darkfost explained, could be expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which fuel bullish sentiment across crypto markets. BTC Breaks Conventional Macro Logic In the post on X, Darkfost then went on to point out that the current BTC cycle has been unusual. The online pundit reported that there has been a decoupling between the Bitcoin price and bond yields, which manifests as a seeming annulment of the usual macro principles. The analyst noted that the Bitcoin price continues to maintain its upward movement, despite yields reaching some of their highest levels in Bitcoin’s history. But this holds, he was sure to note, when the DXY declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 What this anomaly suggests, Darkfost inferred, is that Bitcoin has taken on a new role within the macro landscape, one that increases its perception as a store of value. To take it further, this means that BTC, as of now, may react a little less conventionally to the macro forces believed to influence the crypto market. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price sits just beneath $106,000, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T15:51:24,"Derivatives Bloodbath: $1.16B Liquidated Amid Global Turmoil","The crypto universe was rocked by a brutal tidal wave of liquidations worth $1.16 billion, as short-squeeze vulnerable leveraged longs were caught off guard by a one-two punch: increased Middle East tensions and hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Bitcoin led the way lower, dropping to $103,556 — its worst one-day performance in June—while Ethereum, Solana, and the rest of the majors lagged behind in a bout of compelled selling. Where the Pain Was Worst: Exchange Breakdown Binance was hit hardest in the carnage, with $458 million in liquidations — over 91% of longs. Bybit wasn't too far behind, at $375 million worth of liquidations, close to 94% of longs. OKX and Gate each lost over $125 million, with HTX, Coinex, BitMEX, and Bitfinex finishing off the list with dozens of millions more. These were mostly losses from speculators who were betting on a continued rally — only to be surprised by the sudden geopolitical and macroeconomic storm. Bitcoin lost $446 million in long liquidations alone, with Ethereum losing $303 million. Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all experienced tens of millions of forced sells, demonstrating just how widespread and severe the pain was across the market. Why Leveraged Longs Are Still High — and Vulnerable Despite repeated warnings, the leverage hunger has not abated. BTC and ETH funding rates have remained positive, which means the traders continue to be strongly speculating on the higher side — even as volatilities have risen. This ongoing optimism provided the context for a traditional liquidation cascade: when prices fell, stop-losses and margin calls triggered a domino effect, which fueled the sell-off and closed out more positions at each major support. How Liquidation Cascades Shape the Market With so many traders on one side of the ship, a little shake will send the market into chaos. The numbers indicate that the first $20 million in liquidations arrived within an hour after the breaking news, but as selling snowballed out of control, nearly $1 billion was lost in just 12 hours. This feedback mechanism — where all liquidation induces further selling — is why crypto corrections are so brutal and why heatmap tools are now an indispensable tool for risk management. “If BTC drops to $92K, bulls could lose $8B more. Watch the heatmap.” — @CoinGlass, June 13, 2025 Heatmaps not only show where the pain was — they show where it is likely to be next. According to recent data, if BTC dips to $92,500, over $8.4 billion of long positions would be liquidated, which would be a critical ”pain point” for bulls. A breakout higher towards $121,900 would short-squeeze, which could unleash a short squeeze of nearly $14 billion. Hedging Ahead of the FOMC: What Traders Can Do Now Since the Federal Reserve's FOMC sits on June 18, volatility has hardly ceased. Historically, FOMC announcement days are marked by sharp spikes in crypto market volatility since rate decisions and forward guidance are reacted to by traders. Many individuals are now reducing exposure, contracting stops, or buying put options to hedge against further downside. Institutional desks are seeing increasing demand for downside protection, with traders targeting deep out-of-the-money puts as insurance against another liquidation cascade. The broader macro environment — rising inflation, geopolitical tension, and uncertainty regarding the Fed's policy — makes risk management more critical than ever before. Traders need to watch the funding rates, heatmaps, and the all-important support levels, and stay alert for the sentiment shifts as the Fed announcement approaches. The Bottom Line The $1.16 billion liquidation event is a testament to the dangers of a highly levered, sentiment-driven market. As war news and inflation reads collide with packed derivatives bets, only the ones that manage risk and watch the heatmaps will make it through the next leg. With the FOMC lined up, expect more fireworks—and remember: in crypto, the only thing certain is volatility.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9570/derivatives-bloodbath-1-16-b-liquidated-amid-global-turmoil,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Previously, individuals selling up to R$35,000 (around $6,300) worth of crypto per month were exempt from taxation. Before the change, gains above that were taxed progressively, reaching as high as 22.5% for volumes over $5.4 million. The new rule replaces this system with a flat tax, meaning smaller investors will face higher tax burdens while large holders may see their bills shrink, local news outlet Portal do Bitcoin reports. The tax will apply regardless of where the assets are held, including in overseas exchanges or self-custodial wallets. Losses can be offset, but only within a rolling five-quarter window, a rule that will become stricter starting in 2026. The government says the overhaul is aimed at boosting tax revenue after walking back a proposed hike to the IOF financial transaction tax, which had drawn industry and congressional criticism.

2025-06-14T15:38:28,"Once XRP Breaks Through This Red Zone, Analyst Says It Will Rip to the Upside","XRP may be poised for a major move , not in isolation, but in how it performs against Bitcoin. According to crypto analyst Xoom, a key resistance level on the XRP/BTC chart, dubbed the “red zone,” could soon give way. If that happens, XRP is expected to “rip to the upside,” marking a decisive shift in momentum after months of stagnation. Xoom’s latest insight, shared on X, highlights this crucial area that has consistently rejected XRP’s past attempts to break higher. Yet, this time, the setup looks different. With volume building and Bitcoin dominance showing early signs of cooling off, many believe XRP’s long-awaited surge relative to Bitcoin may be approaching. The Red Zone Xoom’s analysis zeroes in on a range on the XRP/BTC chart that typically lies between 0.000012 and 0.000015 BTC. This level has historically served as a strong resistance barrier, halting upward movement and sparking selloffs. However, every time XRP has managed to break through it, notably in 2017, 2021, and briefly in 2023, the result was a fast, powerful rally. Once XRP breaks through the red zone on XRP/BTC… it rips to the upside. pic.twitter.com/iuMTBDM3HJ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) June 14, 2025 The term “red zone” reflects not just the technical ceiling, but also the psychological weight this region carries for traders. Each failed attempt to push through has made the zone even more significant, and now, XRP is once again pressing up against it. According to Xoom, once this barrier is breached, there may be little standing in the way of a major upside move. XRP/BTC: Why It Matters While many focus on XRP’s price in U.S. dollars, the XRP/BTC pair often provides a clearer picture of its strength in the broader crypto market. A breakout here would signal that XRP is outperforming Bitcoin, something that historically attracts fresh capital from traders rotating out of BTC and into high-utility altcoins. A decisive break above the red zone would likely trigger increased trading volume, bullish momentum, and renewed institutional interest. It would also mark the end of XRP’s extended underperformance relative to Bitcoin, a trend that has weighed on investor confidence in recent months. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Momentum Meets Macro Catalysts A fundamental factor is that the drawn-out legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may soon come to a close. The parties have already refiled for settlement following Judge Torres’ procedural rejection of the first filing. A finalized resolution could act as a major catalyst, lifting legal uncertainty that has long suppressed XRP’s price action. Taken together, XRP’s improving fundamentals and the tightening XRP/BTC structure set the stage for a potential breakout. For Xoom and many others, the message is clear: once XRP breaks through this red zone, the move won’t be gradual. It will be swift, sharp, and likely to catch the market off guard. After months of pressure, XRP may finally be ready to explode . And if it does, as Xoom warns, it won’t just edge upward, it will rip.

2025-06-14T15:36:51,"After Successfully Predicting an All-Time High for Bitcoin, this Crypto Timing model Points to Rally in November","A Crypto timing model that successfully predicted Bitcoin’s rise to a new price high outlines another bullish case scenario for the cryptocurrency market. In May, the Crypto timing model by Weiss Crypto Ratings, a cryptocurrency tracking and analysis platform, outlined a bullish outlook for the asset. A week later, the asset hit a new ATH with a price value of $111,886. This time, the model is painting yet another bullish case scenario for the cryptocurrency market. As seen on its official page on Twitter, now known as X, Weiss shared that its model forecasts an incoming trend pattern expected to occur in the last quarter of the year. The Crypto timing model points to November as when the market is most likely to experience a 4-year-cycle high. According to our Crypto Timing Model, we’ll likely see the 4-year-cycle high in November. — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) June 9, 2025 Is the 4-year market cycle still valid? For starters, Crypto has followed a 4-year pattern—a market movement pattern driven by the Bitcoin halving event. The trend typically ushers the market into periods of major losses and gains. As experienced during the 4-year cycle, an accumulation phase precedes a bear market, and a bullish phase follows right after. The 2011-2013 market cycle launched the trend, which has been observed for over a decade. Although experts claim that the presence of institutional investors has disrupted the cycle, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin and the broader market perform in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the big bull is trading at $103,091 at report time. The global crypto market correction brought a notable price pump recorded by a handful of top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin bulls appear to be making a much-needed recovery, as daily gains briefly surged, sending Bitcoin to an intraday high of $107,000 on June 9. Glassnode describes the price jump as a move “likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations,” adding that the negative funding rates from the previous week point to an increase in short appetite, resulting in today’s short squeeze.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/after-successfully-predicting-an-all-time-high-for-bitcoin-this-crypto-timing-model-points-to-rally-in-november/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare

In line with the bullish price predictions is a fresh outlook from a market expert focused on alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. According to João Wedson, the founder of crypto investment platform Alphractal and a verified author at Crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, the long-awaited altcoin season is already in motion. In a post shared on X, the analyst informs his 6,000 followers that a handful of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. As such, the market could soon witness a massive price rally within the broader altcoin market. “An Altcoin Season is happening right now! Altcoin Seasons can unfold within hours, days, or weeks — and we can’t afford to miss these opportunities.” He wrote. As displayed in the altcoin and Bitcoin index chart shared by the market expert, many altcoins appear to be trading at a higher volume than Bitcoin this June. More specifically, 47 of 56 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 900 minutes. The trend signals renewed interest in the altcoin market, suggesting a price rally might be closer than expected. However, the analyst maintains that the bears have not fully exited the market as market volatility is expected to continue. “Take advantage of it [the altcoin season], because the coming days will bring high volatility and great opportunities.” He added. XRP and Ether bulls remain wide awake despite heightened volatility Most altcoins within the top 50 category are trading in red at report time. However, leading altcoin Ether and XRP appear to have successfully retained gains from the previous week. Ether and XRP have emerged as the highest gainers, with 7-day gains of 2.62% and 3.85%, respectively. At report time, Ether is valued at $2,528, while XRP trades at $2.16 per coin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/47-out-of-56-altcoins-just-crushed-bitcoin-performance-in-900-minutes-xrp-ether-to-rock-altseason-explosion/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Altcoins|News|Ethereum News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

Changes in Global M2 explain 89% of Bitcoin’s price movements with a 12-week lag. Bitcoin’s long-term price is driven by liquidity cycles, not speculation or short-term news. Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor, has reignited the debate over the driving force behind Bitcoin’s price. He claims that the price action of Bitcoin strongly correlates with Global liquidity flows, specifically the money supply (M2). Pal suggests that Bitcoin’s long-term price behavior is more likely to follow liquidity cycles. It is less influenced by short-term news and market speculation.

Trading between $108,600 and $110,200, Bitcoin’s steady climb reflects strong institutional interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03. Having raised $10,600,000 with over 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders, this altcoin promises a 100% return at its $0.06 launch. Investors are buzzing about its potential to hit $5 post-launch. Let’s explore Bitcoin’s current dynamics and why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto pick. Bitcoin faces key resistance Bitcoin is battling resistance between $110,000 and $112,000. Prices hold steady above $108,000, with a 3% gain recently. Institutional inflows, particularly into crypto ETFs, fuel this momentum. Funds saw $167 billion in May, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Global economic shifts, like rising bond yields and a weaker dollar, push investors toward Bitcoin. Regulatory talks, including the CLARITY Act, signal a maturing crypto market. However, crypto charts show traders hedging against pullbacks, as negative funding rates hint at caution. If Bitcoin breaks $112,000, new highs are possible. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh opportunity in this vibrant market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds in phase 5 of its presale. Priced at $0.03, up 200% from the $0.01 opening phase, it guarantees a 100% return at the $0.06 launch. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price jump to $0.035, narrowing the early-entry window. The project has raised $10,600,000, with 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders onboard. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, a 9,900% increase from today’s price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s utility-driven model sets it apart in the crypto market. Furthermore, its innovative approach to lending captivates investors seeking high-yield opportunities. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income with dynamic interest rates. This ensures lenders gain more while borrowers pay less. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct, intermediary-free lending, promoting transparency and user control. Built on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin resists algorithmic instability, ensuring secure transactions. Layer-2 integration enhances speed and cuts fees, making it user-friendly. Consequently, this robust infrastructure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leader in crypto investment, offering practical solutions for modern DeFi challenges. Security and community engagement The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has finalized a Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and zero security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. The team also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. A $100,000 giveaway excites the community, splitting $10,000 among 10 winners. Eligible participants need a $50 presale investment and must complete all entry steps. This initiative strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal as a top crypto pick. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market due to its immediate utility. Unlike many tokens, its beta platform launches alongside the token, allowing instant asset deposits and interest earnings. Revenue from stablecoin borrowing supports the treasury, which buys back MUTM tokens, boosting demand without diluting supply. This strategic tokenomics drives long-term value. Bitcoin’s $110,000 resistance highlights market caution, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a bold alternative. With crypto prices rising and investor interest spiking, now is the time to explore this altcoin. Join the presale to secure your stake in the best crypto to buy now.

2025-06-14T15:17:00,"GameStop Upsizes Convertible Note Offering to $2.25B — How Could BTC Benefit?","GameStop has increased its convertible note offering to $2.25 billion, up from the $1.75 billion announced earlier this week, according to a Thursday evening press release . Key Takeaways: GameStop upsized its convertible note offering to $2.25B, with a 32.5% premium conversion price. The company holds 4,710 BTC but remains noncommittal about future crypto purchases. Proceeds may fund investments or acquisitions, with trading cards now a core revenue focus. The move comes just months after a similar $1.5 billion raise in April and follows the company’s recent entry into Bitcoin. Shares of the Texas-based retailer dropped 24% over the past week, closing Friday at $22.14, despite holding steady after the announcement. GameStop’s Zero-Coupon Notes Come with 32.5% Conversion Premium The notes, which bear no interest, carry a conversion price of around $28.91 per share — a 32.5% premium over the stock’s Thursday afternoon average. The structure mirrors the strategy employed by MicroStrategy, which has used premium note offerings to expand its Bitcoin holdings without immediate dilution. GameStop first disclosed it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin in March , pushing the stock above $28 at the time. Whether the company plans to expand its crypto reserves remains uncertain. CEO Ryan Cohen has made it clear that GameStop won’t emulate other firms or signal its buying patterns. In a recent interview, he declined to say whether more BTC purchases were planned. The press release kept options open, stating that proceeds would be used for “general corporate purposes,” including investments aligned with GameStop’s investment policy and “potential acquisitions.” $GME GameStop just locked in the terms for their convertible note offering. Upsized to $2.25 billion from the original $1.75B, with 0.00% interest, meaning bondholders don’t get paid unless they convert. GameStop gave buyers the right to purchase up to $450M more in notes… pic.twitter.com/qnN4pVLM39 — Han Akamatsu 赤松 (@Han_Akamatsu) June 13, 2025 While vague, the language leaves the door open for further digital asset moves. GameStop’s previous crypto ventures have been mixed. The company launched an NFT marketplace during the last market cycle but shut it down early last year. At its annual shareholder meeting, Cohen pivoted focus toward trading cards—now making up nearly 30% of quarterly revenue. “We’re focusing on trading cards as a natural extension of our existing business,” he said. With capital in hand and crypto already on its books, GameStop could revisit Bitcoin when market conditions align. 223 Companies Hold Bitcoin A growing list of firms is embracing Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. Last week, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

2025-06-14T15:07:33,"Here’s What Experts Think Will Send Bitcoin Above its $111,970 All-Time High","As Bitcoin makes a slow but necessary recovery following last week’s market sell-off— a move that sent the asset back to the $100,000 price level, market participants are even more observant, outlining what it would take for the big bull to break past its previous all-time high. According to an on-chain analytical piece from Glassnode, Bitcoin could surge past its all-time high of $111,970, attained in May, to hit never-before-seen price levels, “should the market enter price discovery.” Notably, Bitcoin’s current price is determined by buying and selling activities. Factors such as supply and demand, liquidity, and market sentiment are some of the determining factors observed in the price discovery process for assets like Bitcoin. According to Glassnode’s analysis, a key support level is essential for Bitcoin to maintain underlying bullish pressure. The Short-term holder cost basis—the average acquisition price of Bitcoin by crypto investors who have held the asset for 115 days or less—interestingly doubles as the aforementioned support level. As seen in Glassnode’s report ; “The $97.6k Short-Term Holder cost basis continues to serve as a pivotal support level necessary for maintaining local bullish momentum.” In contrast, the bulls are primed to retest a new ATH if the nearest resistance level is broken in the near term. “On the upside, the $115.4k zone emerges as the first significant resistance should the market enter price discovery.” The report read. After failing to sustain momentum above the $101,000 price level last week, Bitcoin bulls are making a notable comeback. Recovery gains sustained this week sent the asset to $110,300. With Bitcoin around 1.5% away from its previous all-time high, renewed interest in the asset suggests that investment confidence has been strengthened for the near term. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at $108,729, while 7-day gains surged by 4.06%.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/heres-what-experts-think-will-send-bitcoin-above-its-111970-all-time-high/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
