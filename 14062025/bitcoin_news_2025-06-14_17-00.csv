2025-06-14T14:37:34,"Best Altcoins to Mimic Trump’s $57.3M Crypto Income – Price Jumps, Staking, and Other Rewards","Donald Trump has disclosed an income of $57.3M from World Liberty Financial tokens. The president filed his public financial disclosure to the US Office of Government Ethics, declaring that he holds 15.75B $WLFI tokens, the native cryptocurrency of WLF. Interestingly, though, no details were provided as to how this income was generated. Was it through sale or staking, or any other mechanism? We don’t know. Read to know more about WLF and Trump’s pro-crypto approach. We’ll also suggest the best altcoins you can buy now to rake in a handsome income yourself. Price jumps, staking, we’ve covered it all. Trump’s Crypto Empire: From Stablecoins to Meme Tokens World Liberty Financial is a decentralized project focusing on open and on-chain infrastructure with special attention to dollar-pegged stablecoins. It has also issued $USD1, a new stablecoin similar to $USDT and $USDC. The project has raised around $550M in token sales so far. It’s worth noting that the Trump family has a 75% share in the net revenues of this project, with 60% ownership in WLF Holdco LLC through DT Marks DEFI LLC. Overall, the Trump family owns 22.5B out of the total 100B $WLFI token supply. Besides WLFI, Trump had also launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, just before his appointment as the president. It was under him that the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in the US . He also announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve . In addition to being a boon for the crypto industry, Trump has made a decent return from crypto himself. If you want to become an ace crypto player just like him, here are some cryptos worth investing in right now . 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Altcoin to Buy If You’re Looking for Explode-Worthy Tokens Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best cryptos to buy now , seeing as it’s leading the DeFi revolution by being the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana. Solana’s troubles with scalability began soon after the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, two hyper-successful meme coins that flooded the blockchain with new investors. This resulted in periods of sudden spikes in transaction requests, which Solana couldn’t handle, serving up one failed transaction after another. Solaxy’s brand-new L2 for Solana will address this by offloading a chunk of the network’s transactions onto a sidechain. This will reduce the burden on Solana, allowing it to function like the good old days. Additionally, Solaxy has also designed its L2 to process multiple transactions simultaneously. This will reduce the per-transaction cost, further driving up Solana’s cost-efficiency. Now, here’s the real kicker: Solaxy is predicted to explode over 11,300% and reach $0.20 by 2030. If you wish to ride Solana’s newfound vigor and Solaxy’s promise, buy $SOLX now for just $0.001758. Oh, and the project has in total raised nearly $50M, so you’ll be buying into the best crypto presale of 2025. But hurry up because the presale ends in less than 2 days. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Revolutionizing Bitcoin with a Layer 2 Solution, Highest Staking Rewards If you’re looking for a new crypto that can earn you a significant amount of passive income via staking, look no further than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Currently in presale, $HYPER is offering early investors 613% p.a. as staking rewards. It’s worth mentioning, though, that this rate is dynamic and will keep decreasing as the presale progresses. So, buy Bitcoin Hyper as early as possible. One token is currently selling for just $0.011875, and besides staking rewards, you’ll also stand a chance to make around 2,100% in gains. That’s because $HYPER is predicted to shoot up to $0.253 by 2030 . Powered by a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER connects with Bitcoin Layer 1 through a Canonical Bridge. It works by converting L1 $BTC into L2 ‘wrapped’ $BTC, which can be used to access decentralized applications, Web3, and gaming dApps, as well as speed up transactions on them. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper wants to breathe new life into the aging Bitcoin blockchain by speeding up transactions, lowering fees, and offering improved DeFi access. 3. Jelly-My-Jelly ($JELLYJELLY) – Viral Meme Coin Starting Fresh Rally Jelly-My-Jelly is the brainchild of Venmo’s co-founder, Iqram Magdon-Ismail, and a crypto investor, Sam Lessin. It’s worth noting that the ‘utility’ behind $JELLYJELLY is that it offers token holders early-bird access to an upcoming video-sharing app that will supposedly be the fastest way to post clips from a video chat. However, it has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos , mainly due to hype and backing from the degen community. $JELLYJELLY is up more than 17% over the past seven days – and a chunky 57% over the past year – with each token currently available for a low price of $0.02902. Wrapping Up Donald Trump’s massive $57.3M income from World Liberty Financial tokens is undoubtedly a strong signal of crypto’s bold embrace at the highest level. If you wish to replicate Trump’s crypto success, look at high-potential tokens like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are subject to market risks. None of the above is financial advice, and you should only invest after doing your own research.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-mimic-trumps-57-4m-crypto-income-price-jumps-staking-and-other-rewards/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T14:37:04,"Bitcoin Holder GameStop Upsizes Convertible Debt Offering To $2.25 Billion Amid BTC Acquisition Plans","GameStop announced an increase in its previously disclosed offering of convertible senior notes. The company upsized its latest convertible debt offering to $2.25 billion from $1.75 billion , signaling a deeper commitment to establishing its corporate BTC treasury. GameStop Increases Note Sales To $2.25B For Potential Bitcoin Buys GameStop said in a press release published late on Thursday that it would be offering investors more convertible bonds, following a similar multi-billion-dollar raise in March. The $2.25 billion offering targets “qualified institutional buyers” and is expected to close on June 15, 2032, unless converted or repurchased earlier. The embattled video game retailer’s latest batch of convertible bonds, which will carry no interest, will have a conversion price of roughly $28.91 per share, which may change “in some events.” The conversion price of the notes represents a 32.5% premium compared to the company’s average stock price on June 12. GameStop will also allow initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $450 million in notes within 13 days of the initial issuance. Companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) have been able to boost the amount of Bitcoin they own per share by raising funds at a premium relative to their BTC stash and putting that cash into the benchmark crypto. The company, which owns over 582,000 BTC — nearly 3% of the token’s total possible supply — has seen its stock rocket by over 900% in the past year, in the wake of Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs. Whether GameStop will make another Bitcoin purchase is less clear. Though the company indicated that it intends to use the net proceeds of the latest convertible debt offering for “general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy,” which may signal more Bitcoin purchases from the video game behemoth. Following the March announcement of the Bitcoin treasury strategy, GameStop raised $1.5 billion through another convertible note offering. The company subsequently purchased 4,710 Bitcoins for roughly $500 million in May.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holder-gamestop-upsizes-convertible-debt-offering-to-2-25-billion-amid-btc-acquisition-plans/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

In new filings with the Massachusetts state government, Chase says at least four customers in the state are affected by multiple breaches. In two incidents, Chase says employees improperly accessed customers’ credit and debit card information and triggered fraudulent transactions, prompting the bank to close the affected cards, issue replacements, and reimburse the customers. In the other two incidents, the bank says it mistakenly posted transaction details, including names, addresses, account numbers, and transaction amounts, to other customers’ accounts. At this point, no misuse due to those errors has been detected. Meanwhile, Bank of America says documentation relating to at least one customer’s savings bonds was lost in transit on February 14th. Attempts to recover the documentation, according to the North Carolina-based lender, have proved unsuccessful. “According to our records, the information involved in this incident was related to your Savings Bonds and included your first and last name, address, Social Security number, and account number.” The lender says it is monitoring the customer’s banking account for any suspicious activity and is committed to resolving any unauthorized transactions. Lastly, TD Bank says a former employee improperly accessed a customer’s personal information between December of 2024 and January of 2025. The information may have included the customer’s name, address, phone number, social security number, account number, and transactional data. TD Bank says it’s monitoring the account for fraud and is offering the customer a complimentary two year membership to an identity theft protection and recovery service.

2025-06-14T14:30:18,"Bitcoin Volatility Returns As Altcoin Inflows Stay Low – Calm Before The Storm?","Bitcoin has lost momentum after failing to hold above the $110K mark, retracing into the $104K–$105K range following increased geopolitical instability. The escalation of conflict between Israel and Iran on Friday triggered a wave of panic across global markets, resulting in massive long liquidations and heightened selling pressure in crypto. Despite the price drop, new data from CryptoQuant suggests that the overall market may still be resilient. According to the analytics platform, increasing price volatility has not yet translated into a significant spike in inflows to exchanges. This signals that most market participants, particularly long-term holders, are not rushing to sell. For Bitcoin, holding above the $103.6K support zone remains crucial. If bulls manage to stabilize here, it could set the stage for another push toward the all-time high at $112K. The market now watches closely for either a breakdown or confirmation of support before deciding the next major trend. Bitcoin Holds Firm Above $100K Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty Despite the wave of negative sentiment triggered by renewed conflict in the Middle East, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate resilience by holding firmly above the critical $100,000 mark. The recent escalation between Israel and Iran, coupled with broader macroeconomic fears—including rising inflation and persistent pressure from US Treasury yields—has injected fresh uncertainty into financial markets. Yet, Bitcoin’s ability to absorb the shock and maintain key support levels is a sign of underlying strength in the current cycle. Many analysts believe that Bitcoin is setting the stage for a major expansion phase. A decisive breakout above the $112K all-time high could launch BTC into price discovery, marking the beginning of an explosive bullish leg. Bulls appear to remain in control, but market participants are cautious given the rising systemic risks globally. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, shared timely insights indicating that the recent increase in price volatility has not yet translated into heightened selling activity. Moreno points out that exchange inflows—particularly from altcoins—remain relatively low. This is significant because, historically, local market tops have been preceded by sharp spikes in altcoin deposits to exchanges, signaling investor fear and profit-taking behavior. Currently, that dynamic is absent. This suggests that the market is not experiencing broad capitulation or panic selling. Instead, long-term holders and large players appear to be sitting tight, positioning for what could be the next leg higher. While risks remain, Bitcoin’s current price action continues to support the thesis of sustained strength and the potential for a breakout rally, provided macro conditions don’t deteriorate further. All eyes now remain on BTC’s ability to reclaim $110K and test the psychological barrier of $112K. BTC Tests Key Support Zone Below $109K The daily chart shows Bitcoin consolidating between the $103,600 and $109,300 levels after rejecting the $112K all-time high earlier this month. The recent volatility, triggered by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, caused BTC to drop below the $106K level, briefly tagging the $103,600 support zone. However, buyers quickly stepped in, pushing the price back into the $105K–$106K area. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has provided short-term support around $103,400, aligning closely with horizontal demand. Meanwhile, the 100- and 200-day SMAs at $93,966 and $95,650 remain well below the current price, showing that the broader uptrend is intact. Volume spiked during the drop, hinting at panic selling, but the subsequent recovery suggests strong buying interest near $ 103,000. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the $109,300 resistance and attempt a breakout toward $112K. A breakdown below $103,600, however, would invalidate the bullish structure and open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $96K–$98K zone. Until then, BTC remains range-bound within a high-stakes consolidation. A daily close above or below these key levels will likely define Bitcoin’s next directional move. Bulls are holding the line — but for how long?

2025-06-14T14:30:00,"Rumble: Crypto Pivot Doesn't Move The Needle","Summary Rumble's user growth has stalled since late 2022, despite content deals and the 2024 election boost proving fleeting. Revenue totals remain far below expectations, and content partnerships like Barstool Sports failed to deliver meaningful user growth. The company's crypto pivot, including a Tether investment and upcoming wallet, is limited in scope and hasn't translated into business momentum. The stock trades at an expensive 22x 2026 sales estimates without profitability or real growth. Rumble Inc. ( RUM ) once offered the promise of developing into a major online video streaming player, but lately the company is focused on a crypto shift. The business has failed to garner any momentum due to other sites relaxing free speech concerns, originally driving the business model. My investment thesis remains ultra-Bearish on the stock due to the lack of growth and the very expensive valuation. Source: Finviz Online Video Stalling The stock popped on the company announcing pivots towards crypto, since Rumble hasn't actually accomplished anything in the non-video realm. The big question is whether the crypto business will actually amount to something. For Q1'25, Rumble only reported 59 million global monthly average users (MAUs), up from the last March quarter. In reality though, the online video platform hasn't seen any growth in users since the Q4'22 U.S. mid-terms. Source: Rumble Q1'25 10-Q Elon Musk bought Twitter back in October 2022 and the whole free speech benefits of the online video platform disappeared. Rumble has signed substantial content deals in the ensuing years without any meaningful change in the user base. Even in the 2024 Presidential elections with a Rumble user like Donald Trump winning the election, the platform only produced 68 million MAUs, versus 67 million in the prior Q4. Rumble reported Q1'25 revenues of $23 million, up a solid 34% from last Q1, but still far below all original forecasts for the business when completing the SPAC deal. Data by YCharts Rumble still spent $30 million in Q1 on cost of services, even with content costs down $3 million. The company spent substantial amounts on trying to build up the platform via minimum guarantees for new content, but most content creators have much higher followers on other media platforms. Barstool Sports is a prime example of a media outlet doing a deal with Rumble for content, yet the user base remained meager on the platform. The sports media company only has 60K followers on Rumble versus 6.5 million on Twitter/X and another 1.9 million on YouTube, causing a failure to re-up the agreement after a year. Rumble probably wisely signed some content deals to make the platform more legitimate, but organic content creators are what is ultimately needed. Barstool Sports was promised as a partner promoting Rumble as their video home, but the partnership didn't last. Crypto Pivot Going back to December, Rumble obtained a $775 million investment from Tether. Also, the company bought bitcoin during the March quarter and ended Q1 with a balance of 211 bitcoins with a current value of $22 million based on a price of $105K each. The crypto pivot is far from over with the intent to launch a crypto wallet in Q3. The Rumble Wallet is intended to compete with options from Coinbase ( COIN ), but the prime use is to pay content creators, especially in international locations. At the end of the day, Rumble has a very limited crypto pivot with a future Rumble Wallet more for payment transfers, though additional crypto features can be built out in the future. The company used the $775 million investment from Tether to immediately turnaround and acquire $525 million worth of shares at a price of $7.50, providing just $250 million in cash for the business. Source: Rumble Q1'25 10-Q Rumble has a diluted share count of around 400 million shares now, for a market cap of ~$3.5 billion. The consensus analyst forecasts for 2026 revenues of just $154 million, so the stock trades at nearly 22x sales estimates for a company still not profitable, nor growing at a very fast clip. The stock might have some support here around $8.50 with strong recent support down to $7. The key is that Rumble likely doesn't have much upside, at lease sustainable upside, without any actual business with growth. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Rumble is still priced like a booming business in either online video streaming and crypto, yet the company has generally stalled for a couple of years now.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794856-rumble-crypto-pivot-doesnt-move-the-needle?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDT","RUM",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T14:20:24,"France eyes Bitcoin mining as means to manage energy","A group of lawmakers has set out to make France consider Bitcoin mining, particularly as a means to manage its massive electricity system and strengthen its energy sovereignty. A legislative proposal to that end has been put forward in Paris, and its authors hope the government will accept to assess the potential of crypto-related activity in other areas as well. While countries around the world have either tried to suppress cryptocurrency mining, as was the case with China a few years ago, or let it grow, like the United States , for example, France is yet to make up its mind about the industry and what it wants from it. France trying to find its place in the crypto mining space Several members of the French parliament have decided to speed up the decision-making process in Paris. They are now suggesting the country should estimate the potential of Bitcoin mining, at least as a tool to improve the management of power generation. France may well be taking a step toward the pro-mining camp, the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin noted in an article on Saturday. The piece is devoted to the lawmakers’ attempt to trigger a debate on the matter in the National Assembly. On Friday, the group of parliamentarians presented a draft amendment to the law on “National programming and regulatory simplification in the energy sector” that requires the government to assess if France needs to develop domestic Bitcoin mining and report back to the legislature. The key goal of the motion is to study whether the minting of digital currencies could be employed as a means to better manage the EU nation’s electricity system, the largest in Europe. The sponsors of the bill elaborated: “This amendment aims to objectify, through an evaluation report submitted to the Parliament, the conditions under which Bitcoin mining could be used as a tool to serve the French electricity system.” France is the leading producer and exporter of electrical energy in the region, largely due to its massive nuclear power sector. The latter accounts for over 70% of its generated electricity, with renewables and fossil fuels providing the rest. Bitcoin mining can help utilize surplus electricity in France Another debate that has been going on in the French society is how to make the largely state-owned nuclear power industry more efficient. A big part of it is the need to optimize the management of the surplus electricity production. The authors of the new legislation believe that Bitcoin mining can provide a unique solution as “it is highly flexible” and “has no impact on the continuity of supply.” In that regard, they are highlighting some of its “technical advantages.” Crypto mining machines can be started and stopped quickly and activated on demand, depending on production and consumption peaks. Bitcoin farms can be installed near production facilities, even in the most isolated areas. Furthermore, the lawmakers are convinced that building a low-carbon crypto mining sector in France, under the supervision of public authorities, could bring abandoned industrial sites back to life and strengthen the country’s energy sovereignty while supporting innovation. The report sums up the positives of cryptocurrency mining in France: “In short: an activity that can adapt to the constraints of the electricity system, absorb energy surpluses, reduce negative prices on wholesale markets, and relieve the burden on nuclear power plants by avoiding overly frequent modulation cycles, which accelerate wear and tear on the installations.” While the upcoming parliamentary debate on the amendment is just a first step that needs to translate into concrete actions by the French government, “the evaluation process will help inform future policy choices based on energy sovereignty, industrial innovation, and network resilience,” the MPs remarked. The amendment has been developed in partnership with ADAN , France’s Association for the Development of Digital Assets. The industry organization has been a driving force behind proposals concerning the regulation, taxation, and mining of cryptocurrencies in the country.

Altcoin Season Index at 26 confirms Bitcoin dominance as altcoins lag in exchange activity.

2025-06-14T14:12:40,"War Escalation Sends Bitcoin to $103K Amid Massive Liquidations","Bitcoin’s dramatic plunge to $103,000 on Friday sent shockwaves through global markets, as Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets triggered a sharp flight from risk assets. The escalation — marking the most significant military confrontation in the Middle East in years — sparked more than $1 billion in crypto liquidations, with over 246,000 traders wiped out in just hours. Yet, beneath the panic, on-chain data reveals a powerful countermove: large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” have quietly ramped up their accumulation, hinting that this crash may be setting the stage for a classic V-shaped recovery. War, Oil, and a Crypto Crash As news broke of Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile sites, global investors scrambled for safety. Gold surged past $3,400 an ounce, oil prices spiked nearly 8%, and equities from Europe to Asia tumbled. Bitcoin, often touted as “digital gold,” failed to play its safe-haven role in the immediate aftermath, plunging from $107,000 to a low of $103,000 before rebounding slightly as Asian markets opened. Ethereum and Solana followed suit, each losing 6–7% in a single session. The fear wasn’t just about bombs and missiles. Analysts warned that if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz — a chokepoint for 20% of the world’s oil shipments — energy prices could skyrocket and risk assets like crypto would “fall off a cliff”. The market’s reaction was swift and brutal: over $1.14 billion in positions were liquidated, with longs making up the vast majority of the losses. Binance alone saw a $201 million BTC-USDT position wiped out, underscoring the scale of the panic. But Who’s Buying the Dip? Whale Accumulation Tells a Different Story While retail traders fled, blockchain analytics tell a more nuanced story. According to CryptoQuant, newly created whale wallets — each holding over 1,000 BTC — have accumulated more than 600,000 BTC (roughly $63 billion) in the past three months, doubling their share of the circulating supply. These are not legacy holders, but fresh capital, likely from institutional investors positioning for a medium- to long-term rebound. In the hours after the crash, Glassnode tracked 17,000 BTC moving into accumulation addresses, echoing the whale behavior seen during the 2020 COVID crash and the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war. History Rhymes: Bitcoin’s War-Time Price Shocks and Rebounds Bitcoin’s reaction to war and crisis has always been volatile — but history suggests sharp drops are often followed by equally dramatic recoveries. During the 2020 COVID crash, BTC lost half its value in days, only to surge 583% over the next year. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Bitcoin initially dropped 20%, but rebounded 65% within two months. Even during the October 2024 Israel-Hamas flare-up, BTC fell 8.4% before rallying 22% in just 48 hours. This pattern — panic selling followed by whale accumulation and a strong rebound—has become a hallmark of Bitcoin’s behavior in times of crisis. Analysts now point to these precedents as reasons for optimism, even as geopolitical risks remain high. Technical Picture: Key Levels in Focus Technically, Bitcoin’s fate in the coming days hinges on a handful of critical levels. The $100,000 mark is not just a psychological barrier, but also aligns with the 50-day exponential moving average and recent support from early May. Should BTC hold above this zone, analysts expect a retest of the $110,000–$112,000 range, which marked the all-time high just weeks ago. A daily close above $106,500 would confirm bullish momentum and a potential V-shaped recovery, while a break below $100,000 could open the door to deeper losses, with $92,000 as the next major support. A Market at the Crossroads: Fear, Opportunity, and the Next Move Despite the chaos, Bitcoin’s ability to rebound above $104,000 by the end of the day hints at underlying resilience. Traditional markets, by contrast, saw steeper losses, with investors piling into gold and safe-haven currencies. As the dust settles, the focus now shifts to Iran’s response and the potential for further escalation — or de-escalation — in the region. For now, the data shows that while retail sentiment remains shaky, the “smart money” is quietly positioning for a rebound. If history is any guide, those who buy into fear may once again be rewarded — so long as global tensions don’t spiral further out of control.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9568/war-escalation-sends-bitcoin-to-103-k-amid-massive-liquidations,"BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T14:07:50,"Centralized Bitcoin (BTC) Treasuries Now Hold Nearly 1/3 of Total Supply","Centralized Bitcoin treasuries now hold 30.9% of the total circulating supply, according to a new report by Gemini. This concentration, which spans across 216 entities that include governments, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public and private companies, centralized exchanges, and DeFi contracts, ultimately indicates growing institutional maturity and adoption. The total amount of BTC held by major institutional and custodial entities has skyrocketed to 6,145,207 BTC today, which represents a whopping 924% increase over the past decade. This rapid growth demonstrates how centralized players have steadily accumulated a larger share of the network’s supply, reshaping Bitcoin’s ownership structure in favor of institutional dominance. Market Maturation According to a joint report by Gemini and Glassnode, just three entities dominate Bitcoin adoption across most institutional categories, holding between 65% and 90% of total BTC holdings. This concentration reflected how early entrants shaped the strategic direction and legitimacy of Bitcoin within institutional finance. On the other hand, private company holdings are more evenly distributed, which indicates a broader base of adoption at that level. While such dominance may decrease as institutional participation expands, the early leaders continue to play a central role in driving capital inflows and positioning Bitcoin as a credible macro asset in traditional finance. Custody has slowly shifted away from centralized exchanges toward ETFs, funds, and DeFi protocols, which now serve as primary gateways for spot market access. While balances on centralized exchanges have declined over the past two years, this does not signal a tightening supply. Instead, most of that Bitcoin has moved into custodial vehicles like US spot ETFs. The combined holdings of these spot custodians have remained relatively stable and range between 3.9 million and 4.2 million BTC since June 2021. This is indicative of a reallocation rather than a reduction in circulating supply. Despite the stability in total holdings, these custodians exert significant influence on price action, driven by their sensitivity to market shifts. Monthly inflows and outflows can swing dramatically, by as much as $10 billion, which makes these entities key players in BTC’s short-term trajectory, even as the overall structure of the spot market becomes more institutionalized and regulated. Sovereign BTC Treasuries Government-held Bitcoin reserves have grown significantly, particularly in the US, China, the U.K., and Germany, where most acquisitions come through legal enforcement rather than market purchases. The US stands out with more than 200,000 BTC, largely sourced from major law enforcement seizures. These include 69,369 BTC taken from the Silk Road case in November 2027 and 94,643 BTC recovered from the Bitfinex hack in February 2022. After a brief decline, a portion of the US government’s remaining balance was formally converted into a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) following an executive order by President Donald Trump on March 6th. In the UK, Bitcoin has been seized by the National Crime Agency through operations targeting cybercriminals. China, after banning crypto activities, confiscated over 194,000 BTC in November 2020 in its crackdown on the PlusToken Ponzi scheme. Germany also accumulated Bitcoin through criminal investigations, but officially liquidated all its holdings by April 29th. These sovereign holdings form a unique category in the crypto ecosystem: largely dormant, yet capable of influencing markets if moved.

2025-06-14T14:00:00,"HIVE Digital: Great Seasonality And A Bullish Chart Setup","Summary HIVE's price has dropped, but the value proposition is now even stronger with a bullish technical setup and clear line in the sand. Seasonality is favorable for HIVE in June and July, and revenue/earnings estimates have improved significantly since January. HIVE's mining capacity and efficiency are set to surge, with major growth expected in both Bitcoin mining and HPC/AI segments. Valuation is extremely attractive on both price-to-sales and tangible book value, supporting my reiterated strong buy rating. Back in January, I covered small-cap Bitcoin miner HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) , calling it a strong buy at the time. I had my reasons, including firm price support at $2.80. That didn’t work out, however, as the massive slide in equities globally into the April low saw HIVE blow right through $2.80 on the way to $1.26. Events like that are why we use stops, and why we don’t become bag holders. At any rate, this stock is well-off from where I called it a strong buy; has my view changed? Not really, and below I’ll detail why the value proposition is even better today than it was five months ago. An Extremely Bullish Setup I recognize my last call was wrong, and that’s fine; it happens. I noted the line in the sand was $2.80, and if you sold at that point, your losses were minimized. Today, my line in the sand is the rising 50-day SMA, which we can see below in blue. StockCharts That level is currently $1.77, which is 12 cents below where the stock closed on Friday. It’s also rising, so it will gradually drift higher as the days go on. I would not hold HIVE under that line. Now, why do I say this is extremely bullish? We have a series of higher lows, two rising moving averages, and the 20-day EMA ahead of the 50-day SMA. So long as the 50-day SMA holds on any pullbacks, this is a textbook uptrend setup. The momentum indicators are mixed. The PPO is bullish, the RSI is neutral, and the Chaikin Money Flow index is bearish. With that in mind, I’d become more bullish if we had a sustained move in the RSI ahead of 60, and a reading above zero on the CMF. But for now, the price chart itself is enough for me, and I really like this chart. Bullish Seasonality And A Stock That’s Just Too Cheap Before we look at the fundamentals, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention seasonality. HIVE has only been public for a few years, but have a look at June and July. Seeking Alpha Returns are hugely positive for this time of year, lending credence to the idea that if you’re going to own HIVE, you really couldn’t select a better time. The opposite is true of August and September, so that’s something to watch for, but the chart and seasonality are lining up nicely. Let’s kick things off with a look at where estimates stand. Seeking Alpha The last three revisions have been down, which is obviously not something we want. I will say, however, that when I covered HIVE in January, estimates for 2027 were for just 27 cents in earnings; that’s gone all the way to 41 cents today. Similarly, estimates for 2025 have risen from a loss of 24 cents to a loss of 16 cents. Revenue estimates have exploded higher as well, with 2026 sales rising from $221M to $360M today. In other words, unless these estimates are just nowhere close to reality, HIVE has gotten enormously cheaper in the last five months. HIVE has now also passed 10EH/s in peak hashrate. The company expects 11.5EH/s by the end of this month, on its way to 25EH/s by the end of its Q4. In addition to ramping to 25EH/s, efficiency is set to rise pretty significantly as well. Investor presentation Today’s efficiency is something like 18 J/TH, but it should improve to 16.5 later this year. That helps reduce mining costs, which boosts mining margins. Investor presentation This table is illustrative of what HIVE’s mining operations could look like once it’s fully built out at 25EH/s. At the current Bitcoin price, HIVE expects mining margin of about $330M annually. At $150K per Bitcoin, it’s more like $575M. HIVE’s margins are enormously dependent upon the price of Bitcoin, as is any company that mines anything (gold, silver, copper, etc.). If you’re bullish on HIVE, you are bullish on Bitcoin. As we’re looking at those mining margin numbers, let’s remind ourselves that HIVE’s market cap is $300M as of Friday’s close. We can see below that relative to other miners, HIVE is tiny today. That’s set to change as we reach the end of September, assuming HIVE’s 25EH/s capacity comes online as expected. Investor presentation Other miners are growing as well, but HIVE has the most relative growth coming based upon current info. Mining is a relative game, so HIVE is going to be much more competitive in a few months than it is today. The other piece of the equation here is that the company’s HPC and AI growth is set to be outstanding in the coming months. Investor presentation Annual recurring revenue in Q1 was $15M, but is set to be $100M by the end of this fiscal year. If HIVE gets anywhere near that, again, that’s a great growth lever for a stock with a $300M market cap. Is It Really That Cheap? HIVE’s valuation, as I mentioned above, has gotten much better. That’s true if you’re using 2027 EPS estimates, or if you’re looking at price-to-sales and tangible book value. Let’s start with P/S. TIKR Today, shares are at 1.16X forward sales. Its three-year average has been 2.56X, which is obviously a 120% premium to today’s price. I don’t see how there is any conclusion I can draw from this chart other than the stock is cheap. In addition, we can use tangible book value, and it’s unbelievably cheap there as well. TIKR The most recent TBV reported was $3.10 against a share price of $1.89. As we can see below, shares at 0.61X TBV is well below the 1.51X average. TIKR In conclusion, HIVE is absolutely very cheap. If growth plans in both Bitcoin mining and HPC come to fruition, HIVE should be even cheaper in the coming months. With a bullish setup in the chart, and what I view as a favorable fundamental backdrop aligned with a cheap valuation, I’m reiterating my strong buy rating on HIVE.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794874-hive-digital-great-seasonality-bullish-chart-setup?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","HIVE|HIVE:CA",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T13:55:07,"New Developments Regarding Donald Trump’s $2 Billion Bitcoin Move","DRW Investments, controlled by American financier Don Wilson, invested around $100 million in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), owned by the Trump family. According to the Financial Times, this investment was made to support the company's Bitcoin move, which has exceeded $2 billion. The investment is notable because it comes just nine weeks after the SEC investigation into Wilson’s crypto company Cumberland concluded, after the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Cumberland in March that included allegations of being an “unregistered crypto broker.” Chicago-based DRW bought about 4 million shares of TMTG last month, according to investor records, marking one of the largest investments ever made by TMTG, which is also behind the Truth Social app. The company’s largest investor in the funding round for Bitcoin was reportedly Jane Street, with a stake of about $375 million. Related News: SEC Now Making Its Intentions Clear: High-Level Appointments Related to Cryptocurrencies DRW stated that they evaluated the investment decision based on “the benefits of holding Bitcoin in company balance sheets.” The statement said, “We have been strategically involved in the crypto asset ecosystem for decades. This transaction was evaluated entirely from this perspective.” Don Wilson has advocated for a restructuring of U.S. securities regulators, proposing the creation of “an entirely new regulatory agency” to replace the SEC and CFTC. “Wilson has long called for a clear regulatory framework,” a DRW spokesperson said. Wilson’s interest in crypto is not new. In 2015, he auctioned off 70,000 Bitcoins that the U.S. government had seized from the Silk Road. The assets are worth about $7.7 billion today. DRW also has a number of funds tied to digital assets, including transactions related to MicroStrategy’s rebranded Bitcoin-focused entity “Strategy.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-14T13:49:42,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Israel v Iran News Crash Bitcoin Price - Recovery Next?","Escalating violence in the Middle East and ongoing clashes on the Russian Ukrainian front have drained enthusiasm from nearly every market. Bitcoin, fresh from a climb to $110k, sank to almost $102k when reports of Israeli action inside Iran reached desks, and talk of deeper United States involvement amplified the slide. The drop has rekindled an old argument: can this code based asset eventually share the pedestal with bullion or blue chip assets? A growing group of strategists says yes. They view the setback as the latest echo of earlier shocks that cleared the runway for larger climbs. Each flare-up in the past left Bitcoin stronger than traditional shelters, and many expect a familiar script to unfold again. Metals Rise First Yet Bitcoin Finishes Ahead Market history shows a reflex that rarely changes. Headlines of conflict push capital into metal vaults, where spot gold often pops, silver steadies, and Bitcoin stumbles. Early this week gold prices spiked past $3400 while Bitcoin slid under $103k. Traders who watch these rotations recall that the opening move seldom crowns the long term winner. ⚠️New War Escalation: What does this mean for #Bitcoin ?👇Markets are rattled:💥 $1.15B in crypto liquidations🛢 Oil up 13% on the news📉 Initial fear reaction in $BTC But here’s what happened last time tensions flared:Oil & Gold spiked short-termBitcoin dipped first...… pic.twitter.com/iup2osrHKy — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) June 13, 2025 February 2022 offers a clear template. As Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, gold broke above $1900 and Bitcoin slipped below $41,000. By early April, gold had lost that shine while Bitcoin hovered in the upper $46,000 zone, delivering the larger percentage gain and reclaiming the narrative. Analysts reading today’s tape note familiar clues. Exchange balances are shrinking, suggesting holders are moving coins to cold storage rather than capitulating. At midday Friday bids were already carrying the price back toward $105k, hinting that the rubber band has started its rebound. While there are definitely critics like Peter Schiff and many others who seem to disagree with Bitcoin being in the same league as metals like gold and silver, the sentiment seems to have been slowly shifting among major institutions already. [CNBC] Michael Saylor dismisses claims that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, comparing it to Manhattan real estate. He argues that just as developers issue debt to build more as property values rise, issuing debt or equity to buy Bitcoin is part of a functioning economy $MSTR pic.twitter.com/lEeIIJ8Ggj — BecauseBitcoin.com (@BecauseBitcoin) December 17, 2024 Michael Saylor sees the same setup through a real estate lens. Questioned live on CNBC about issuing fresh debt to accumulate Bitcoin even near record levels, the MicroStrategy chair pointed to developers in Manhattan who borrow relentlessly to put new towers on land that is already expensive. That cycle, he said, is simply how productive economies grow. His company now holds a profit of over 80% on its Bitcoin treasury, evidence that the approach is more disciplined than reckless. If geopolitical tension eventually nudges governments toward neutral digital rails for settlement, Bitcoin could gain extra utility and value. Such a move has historically ignited follow-on rallies in altcoins, turning drawdowns like the current one into rare openings rather than red flags. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Stock Up On Potential Top Gainers Snorter Snorter is being built as a Telegram native sniper bot designed to execute token buys the instant liquidity is added. The project, launched a few weeks ago, aims to offer one of the fastest and most precise trading tools for Solana. It strips away every unnecessary step. There is no dashboard, no browser extension, just clean Telegram commands and the quickest execution possible through direct blockchain interaction. The upcoming features marketed by developers include a copy trading engine where users can automatically mirror the moves of high-performing wallets. The bot is also being prepared for multi-chain compatibility, starting with Solana and expanding into other ecosystems shortly after launch. It is being developed with a fee structure that aims to be lower than most competing bots, giving it a cost advantage alongside its technical speed. Snorter has not launched yet, but its presale traction suggests that interest is building fast. It is already gaining attention in trading groups and among Solana native communities that follow new tool drops closely. YouTuber Claybro called it a 100x potential crypto, adding to its existing virality across various social media platforms. When the bot does go live, it is likely to draw early users who thrive on volatility and who want to be first in line when new tokens deploy. For those who treat speed as strategy, Snorter may become an essential tool. The fact that it is still in presale means the timing is early and quite possibly right where the real upside begins. Solaxy Solaxy is approaching its final presale phase and there is only a short window left before the platform goes live. Having raised over $48 million, it has become one of the most successful meme-aligned crypto offerings in recent months. But Solaxy is more than just another successful memecoin presale. It comes with utility as a Layer Two network engineered to facilitate fast and secure transactions between Solana and Ethereum. It bypasses traditional bridges by building its own rails, giving users smoother interoperability with less risk. Its staking model is layered with flexible options. Short-term pools offer conservative yields, while longer lockups deliver sharply increased APY that rewards those willing to commit. Solaxy’s fee rebate model ensures that staking rewards are returned in SOLX itself, consolidating value instead of diluting it across multiple assets. The geopolitical volatility that dragged Bitcoin down has led many investors to reevaluate where real utility may emerge next. With Solaxy so close to launch, attention is already turning toward protocols that can immediately deliver on their use cases. In a post correction bounce, speed and infrastructure tend to lead the charge. Both are areas where Solaxy seems prepared. SUBBD SUBBD does not just give creators a platform, but also gives their fans a revenue stream. The project tokenizes the future income of influencers, musicians, and video creators, allowing users to buy fractional stakes in their ongoing success. When revenue is generated, it flows into a smart contract vault that automatically splits payouts between the creator and their early backers. This structure removes the gatekeeping often found in traditional media and turns fans into financial participants. It also includes a discovery engine that highlights up-and-coming talent using engagement trends, giving early supporters a head start on limited allocation offerings. The tokenomics reward long-term holders by distributing protocol fees back to stakers, along with exclusive access to new creator drops. Despite wider market pullbacks, the creator economy is proving to be unusually resilient. In times when trust in institutions wanes, especially during global crises, individual creators often gain influence. SUBBD’s system allows that influence to be monetized fairly and transparently. With Bitcoin already showing signs of recovery, capital could soon pivot back toward utility-first platforms, making SUBBD a strong candidate for renewed attention. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper , as the name suggests, boasts a Bitcoin-themed concept and design style. But while it looks like another meme coin, it exists to do something else entirely. The project attempts to move value quickly, affordably, and without layers of complexity getting in the way. The protocol is lean and designed for direct usage, handling transactions that confirm almost instantly without bloating fees or requiring external dependencies. This makes it especially suitable for small or frequent transfers, whether between individuals or applications. The architecture has been built around a clear loop of movement and reward. Every completed transaction sends a portion of its fee back into staking pools and liquidity buffers. This creates a self-feeding structure that strengthens as more people use it. There are no side tokens, no secondary chains, and no unfinished utilities. What exists is already functional and being refined through iterative community feedback. As markets enter phases of hesitation, utility often becomes the metric that matters most. Traders stop chasing hype and start looking at whether a token actually does what it claims. Bitcoin Hyper directly relies on movement to justify its value. Its velocity-focused structure rewards real participation, not just passive holding. When geopolitical pressure destabilizes traditional financial rails, options that offer fast direct settlement begin to matter. Bitcoin Hyper may not dominate headlines, but its infrastructure is capable of handling practical demand. If confidence shifts back toward utility-driven tokens, this one is already in position to absorb it. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is woven directly into a system that many users already rely on. The wallet itself supports over sixty chains, with full access to asset swaps, portfolio tracking, staking, and presale aggregation. It is already live, active, and adopted by a broad user base. The wallet’s recent feature in the New York Post did not trigger its rise, but it has helped fuel a more noticeable uptick in both usage and user interest, especially from those outside the immediate crypto circle. The token acts as an access layer rather than a marketing prop. Holding it gives users lower swap fees inside the app, higher yields on certain staking pools, and first entry positions into presales curated through the aggregator. Rather than trying to gamify rewards, Best Wallet keeps things practical. Staking the token simply boosts what the user can already do inside the wallet. The platform’s presale aggregator has drawn particular attention in recent months as users search for early stage tokens before major listings. In a space where speed often determines entry, this has become one of the more practical tools to have. As centralized exchanges face more scrutiny and markets react to global tension by pulling funds off platforms, wallets like this become the default solution. Best Wallet Token ties directly into that behavioral shift. With confidence returning slowly to crypto, systems that offer genuine control, transparency, and deep chain support could be the ones that benefit first. This token is already embedded at the center of that movement. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s recent dip has reignited comparisons with metals and real estate, the broader takeaway is that innovation-driven crypto projects often recover stronger and faster. From fast settlement protocols to creator-powered economies and high utility infrastructure, the space is already pivoting toward tokens that do more than sit idle. Each of the projects discussed above reflects that shift in its own way, offering distinct value beyond short-term speculation. As Bitcoin stabilizes and capital begins to move again, these are the types of ideas that tend to benefit first and sometimes most.

2025-06-14T13:47:02,"Ethereum Price Prediction: TradFi Inflows Could Impact ETH Price – What’s Next?","Ethereum is attracting serious institutional attention. In just 14 consecutive sessions, spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. have seen over $812 million in inflows, more than double Bitcoin’s total over the same period. According to Bloomberg , nine Ethereum ETFs are leading the charge, with funds like BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH capturing a large slice of daily volumes. This sudden influx of TradFi capital, which included a $240 million spike on June 11 alone, indicates that hedge funds, RIAs, and asset managers are increasingly turning to Ethereum as their entry point into the crypto market. CoinShares notes that ETH-based investment products generated $296 million in the past week alone, marking its highest total since the 2024 U.S. election. As regulatory clarity improves and ETF accessibility widens, Ethereum appears poised to benefit from deepening institutional confidence. But so far, price hasn’t quite caught up. Ethereum Faces Technical Roadblocks Despite bullish sentiment, Ethereum price prediction remains stuck under key resistance zones. After bouncing from a low of $2,439, ETH has been unable to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement ($2,518) and the 50-day EMA around $2,614. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD momentum is recovering slightly, but the signal line still points to caution. Meanwhile, the downtrend line from early June continues to cap upside movement. Key levels to monitor: Bullish breakout: Close above $2,567 with strong volume could open the door to $2,614 and $2,647 Downside risk: A decline below $2,480 might uncover ETH to a retest of $2,439 or lower MACD confirmation: Needed to validate any breakout attempt Traders are watching these levels closely, as momentum builds around a potential move. Can Inflows Power a Breakout for Ethereum? While the price remains range-bound, the growing ETF inflow narrative may soon put pressure on the charts. Since June began, total inflows into Ethereum ETFs have climbed past $1.37 billion. That’s not a fluke; it’s a strong sign that Wall Street is gradually leaning into ETH exposure. But inflows alone won’t push ETH higher without technical confirmation. A breakout above the $2,567 mark, backed by volume and MACD crossover, would likely ignite bullish sentiment and accelerate retail follow-through. Bottom line: Ethereum is at a tipping point. TradFi inflows are bullish, but until ETH clears resistance, price remains locked in consolidation. Traders should track ETF volume trends and technical thresholds to stay ahead of potential breakouts or breakdowns. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit.

In a new report, the cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says 2025 kicked off with an alarming number of smartphone attacks. “Attacks on Android devices involving malware, adware or potentially unwanted apps in the first quarter of 2025 increased to 12,184,351.” That’s up from 8,780,221 attacks in the last three months of 2024. Trojans, a type of malware that appears harmless but secretly performs malicious actions like stealing data or enabling unauthorized access, were the most common mobile threat, accounting for 39.56% of total detected threats. The sudden increase in attacks is largely attributable to the banking trojan known as Mamont, as well as scam apps. Other reasons for the attack surge include counterfeit versions of popular smartphones that come preloaded with an Android malware called Triada. “This growth was largely due to the activity of Mamont banking trojans and fake money scam apps, along with the discovery of fake popular brand smartphones that came preloaded with the Triada backdoor, capable of dynamically downloading any modules from a server.” Kaspersky also says there were 180,405 malicious and potentially unwanted Android app installation packages detected in the first quarter of 2025, up from 141,779 in the last quarter of 2024.

2025-06-14T13:17:08,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Dominance Soars Post-$1B Liquidation – Is BTC the Only Safe Haven?","Bitcoin dominance is rising after one of the sharpest shakeouts in recent memory, triggered by over $1 billion in leveraged liquidations across the crypto market. BTC is now stabilizing around $104,957, down just 0.17% in the last 24 hours, as traders reassess their risk appetite. According to data from Coinglass, more than 247,000 traders were liquidated in a 24-hour window. The most notable wipeout was a $200 million BTC long on Binance the largest single liquidation event of the year. Most of the damage occurred on Binance and Bybit, which together accounted for $834 million in liquidated positions. UPDATE: Over $1 billion were liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $943.31M from long positions. pic.twitter.com/VllxE4f3KM — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 13, 2025 The overwhelming majority were longs, as traders overleveraged on bullish momentum fueled by Circle’s IPO momentum and renewed interest in U.S.-based DeFi protocols. These forced liquidations act as automatic margin calls. When traders fail to meet required collateral thresholds, exchanges close positions to protect the broader system. But in times of sharp volatility, these measures often snowball, leading to rapid price declines and widespread market capitulation. Bitcoin Dominance Climbs as Altcoins Falter While altcoins suffered steep losses, Bitcoin price prediction is in support above $104,000. The selloff appears to have driven investors back into BTC as a relative safe haven. Bitcoin dominance, a metric measuring BTC’s share of total crypto market cap has risen sharply, suggesting that traders are fleeing riskier assets in favor of the original cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Technically, BTC is hovering just above the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $104,872 and sits on an ascending trendline that has supported price action since early June. The MACD histogram is flattening, showing early signs of bearish momentum waning. If bulls can reclaim the 50-period EMA near $106,351 and surpass the 0.5 Fib level at $106,788, a move toward $108,864 remains in play. This pattern suggests a possible higher low in the making, especially if the current consolidation zone holds. Small-bodied candles point to indecision and accumulation—typical behavior near the bottom of correction cycles. Short-Term Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes $108K if Momentum Builds Despite market turbulence, Bitcoin’s chart structure remains technically constructive. A move over the $106,350 level would indicate a short-term breakout, validating a reversal pattern and that could propel BTC toward $107,640 and $108,864. Trade Idea Recap: Entry: Above $106,350 with volume Stop: Below $104,000 Targets: $107,640 (initial), $108,864 (extended) With major altcoins bleeding and risk sentiment fragile, Bitcoin’s resilience could attract sidelined capital. Unless BTC breaks below $103,169, the broader uptrend remains intact. In the current environment, Bitcoin isn’t just a crypto—it’s the crypto safe haven. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit.

It rose to a high of $0.010, its highest point since Feb. 2, and 153% above its lowest point this year. This increase has pushed its market cap to over $53 million. MAP Protocol price led the charge MAP chart | Source: TradingView MAP Protocol is a layer-2 network for Bitcoin, allowing peer-to-peer cross-chain transactions. Its token surged as the total value locked in the network jumped. Its TVL jumped to $23.3 million on Saturday, the highest point since February. All dApps in the ecosystem, like HiveSwap, StaQ, and Butter Network, have all added substantial assets in their ecosystems. The biggest risk for MAPS Protocol price is that it has become highly overbought, with the Relative Strength Index jumping to 93. This means that the token may have a big dive as investors book profits.

The Solana meme coin has jumped by over 1,245% from its lowest point this year, giving it a market cap of over $70 million. Useless Coin, unlike MAPS Protocol, has no utility, and its price is soaring mainly because of hype and FOMO among crypto investors. Technicals suggest that the USELESS token has more gains ahead. It formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side was at $0.047 and the lower side was at $0.0051 or a 90% dip. Measuring the same distance from the cup’s upper side gives it a target of $0.090, a few points above the current level.

This jump happened after the LUNC token burn rose by over 234 million in the last seven days, bringing the cumulative burn to 410 billion.

LUNC has also moved in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, pointing to an eventual comeback. A move above the neckline at $0.00007253 will point to more gains to the 50% retracement level at $0.0001135. Meanwhile, Bitcoin rallied past $105,000 at last check on Saturday. See below.

2025-06-14T13:08:00,"Seven Solana ETF Filings Hit SEC — But Is Approval Still a Long Shot?","Seven issuers filed or amended applications for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, marking the latest wave of institutional interest in the Layer 1 blockchain. Key Takeaways: Seven Solana ETF filings hit the SEC, including new entries and amendments from major issuers. Analysts say staking language in the filings could complicate approval timelines. Market optimism remains high, with Bloomberg projecting a 90% chance of approval by 2025. Despite the flurry of filings, analysts warn that approval remains far from guaranteed. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said . Analyst Warns Solana ETF May Face Long Road Like Bitcoin ETFs Drawing parallels to the protracted approval process for Bitcoin ETFs, he noted, “If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” Among the June 13 filings was Fidelity’s first S-1 registration for its Solana ETF. 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Canary Capital also submitted amendments to existing applications, while VanEck — the first firm to file for a Solana ETF back in June — rounded out the list with an amended filing of its own. Seyffart emphasized a key complication: staking. “All of them include staking language, I believe,” he said, underscoring that staking provisions, unlike past Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, could trigger regulatory pushback. While Ether ETF issuers are also seeking permission to offer staking features, the SEC has yet to sign off. They haven't yet. But I would not be surprised if they were to eventually do that. But right now it doesn't seem like they will be in the first wave (whenever these launch) — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 Still, market sentiment appears to be shifting. Bloomberg Intelligence in April placed 90% odds on a Solana ETF approval by 2025. And Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added fuel to speculation earlier this week, posting: “Get ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way.” Seyffart admitted the SEC could theoretically greenlight staking features for both Solana and Ether ETFs simultaneously, but added, “I have no insight into what will actually happen.” SEC Pushback on Staking ETFs Raises Doubts About Regulatory Direction Last week, the SEC raised new objections to ETF proposals from REX Financial and Osprey Funds that include staking mechanisms for Solana and Ether. The regulator argued these funds may not qualify as traditional ETFs under current rules, casting uncertainty over the future of staking-enabled investment products. Manthan Davé of Ripple-backed Palisade said the resistance shows the SEC struggling to reconcile existing frameworks with fast-evolving crypto technologies. Davé pointed out the contradiction in the SEC’s stance—acknowledging that staking may not be a securities activity, yet resisting products built around it. This inconsistency, he warned, risks stifling innovation and sending capital offshore. He called for clearer guidance and modernized classifications that account for how staking underpins blockchain security and value creation. Without it, the U.S. may continue to lose ground in the digital finance race.

2025-06-14T12:55:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Global Tensions Could Drive BTC Lower","Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $102,832 on Friday as escalating Middle East tensions kept the markets on tenterhooks. Rising uncertainty and tensions could also limit future rallies. The flagship cryptocurrency is down almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,103. Despite the decline and bearish sentiment in the overall market, BTC found buyers at lower levels, highlighting the market’s desire to buy the dip. BlackRock Holds 3% Of All Bitcoin BlackRock’s foray into the Bitcoin market through its flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) heralded a new era in institutional adoption and accumulation of Bitcoin. IBIT has registered exponential growth since its launch, with BlackRock accumulating over 662,500 BTC , 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply, giving it over $72 billion in Bitcoin exposure at current prices. BlackRock’s IBIT reached $70 billion in just 341 days, making it the fastest-growing ETF in history. The world’s largest asset manager’s Bitcoin holdings now eclipse many centralized exchanges and even major corporate holders like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Only Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million BTC outnumbers IBIT, but the gap is quickly narrowing. If inflows continue at the current pace, BlackRock’s IBIT will soon become the single-largest holder of Bitcoin. BlackRock views Bitcoin as a crucial component of long-term, diversified portfolios, embracing its volatility as a tradeoff for potential upside. BlackRock is betting that broader adoption of the asset will stabilize price volatility over time. Improve price discovery, increase liquidity, and narrow spreads. The asset manager’s adoption and decision to accumulate over 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply through IBIT is a turning point in Bitcoin’s perception and how it is traded and regulated. Anthony Pompliano To Launch Bitcoin-Buying Vehicle Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is in talks to launch a new Bitcoin-buying vehicle that will raise $750 million to fund purchases. Pompliano is widely expected to become the CEO of ProCapBTC, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that will merge with publicly traded black cheque vehicle Columbus Circle Capital 1. ProCapBTC will look to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt as part of its merger, backed by Cohen & Company Investment Bank. The deal could be announced as early as next week. However, the terms of the deal are yet to be finalized. Columbus Circle Capital 1 is a blank cheque company formed to effect a merger, share exchange and purchase, asset acquisition, reorganization, or similar combinations with one or more businesses. In May, the company raised $250 million through an initial public offering sponsored by Cohen & Company Capital Markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum after it crossed $110,000 on Monday. Bearish sentiment had taken hold by Wednesday as the price slipped below $110,000, falling to $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday and Friday as Middle East tensions escalated after Israel launched missiles against Iran, targeting its military and nuclear installations. The price plunged to a low of $102,832 on Friday but recovered to reclaim $106,000 and settle at $106,100. As tensions surged, BTC dipped while oil prices rose by 5%, with historical data suggesting the dip could be a buying opportunity. BTC’s performance during geopolitical tensions offers a compelling investment case. André Dragosch, the head of research at Bitwise Europe, highlighted this potential in a post on X, highlighting data from geopolitical events since 2010. According to the data, BTC averaged a price increase of almost 65% within 50 days, with a median gain of 17.3%. Blockstream CEO Adam Back reinforced this view to counter gold advocate Peter Schiff’s skepticism. BTC plunged to a low of $103,768 on Monday (June 2) but rebounded to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,902. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436.

According to the Financial Times, citing a 200-page filing, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics discloses that one of Trump’s largest revenue sources among hundreds of financial interests is his crypto venture. The filing shows Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in World Liberty Financial. Instead of a direct investment, the tokens were obtained through his promotional activities on the network. The report also shows that Trump holds positions in holding companies linked to digital ventures, such as CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, though these entities reported little to no income. The document includes Trump’s certification that the information provided is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge,” and is subject to review by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Earlier this year, Trump removed David Huitema as director of the Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch.

Trump’s crypto fortune fuels conflict-of-interest concerns According to 2024 SEC filings, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, was a “promoter” of the World Liberty Financial initiative. The venture operates as a decentralized finance platform offering cryptocurrency lending and trading services. Since it launched last year, World Liberty Financial sold 21 billion tokens in a public offering, generating $1 billion in funding. Trump’s involvement appears legal on the surface, but Democrats and some Republicans have flagged Trump’s willingness to profit while in office as a conflict of interest —particularly since the president holds substantial crypto stakes while influencing policy. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has dropped several high-profile enforcement cases against cryptocurrency companies since taking office. This has created a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry, one in which Trump has seemingly granted investors access to the executive branch if they’re Official Trump ( TRUMP ) owners. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top House Democrat, recently opened a probe into the private dinner Trump hosted for top investors in his meme coin. In addition to World Liberty Financial, Trump Media & Technology Group declared its intention to raise $2.5 billion for a “bitcoin treasury” strategy and to introduce a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

2025-06-14T12:34:49,"Crypto Will Replace the “Dead” 60/40 Portfolio, Says Abra CEO Barhydt","The post Crypto Will Replace the “Dead” 60/40 Portfolio, Says Abra CEO Barhydt appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As bonds sink and Bitcoin soars, the traditional 60/40 investment strategy, 60% stocks, 40% bonds, is showing its age. Abra CEO Bill Barhydt says it’s time for something new. And that something, he believes, is crypto. In a recent interview with Bitcoin.com News , Barhydt explained why financial advisors are starting to shift away from bonds and towards digital assets, signaling a major change in how wealth is being managed. Bonds Fade as Bitcoin Booms It’s no secret that bonds have underperformed in recent years. Bloomberg’s U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned just 1.25% in 2024, and over the past five years, it’s actually gone negative, down 0.05%. “The ‘40’ in 60/40 isn’t working,” Barhydt said, referring to the bond portion of the traditional model. He sees crypto as a better hedge against inflation and market swings, something that more advisors are starting to recognize. That shift in thinking is breaking long-held rules about portfolio diversification. Advisors Are Warming Up to Crypto Barhydt recently attended the 7th Annual Vision Conference in Arlington, Texas, hosted by the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP). The event drew hundreds of financial advisors and the attitude toward crypto was very different from what he saw a few years ago. “Five years ago, people thought crypto was just magic Internet money,” he said. “Now, advisors want to offer it to their clients.” DACFP founder and longtime financial expert Ric Edelman didn’t hold back either. During the event, he told attendees, “The 60/40 model is dead.” His recommendation? A new model that puts 70% to 100% of a portfolio into stocks and crypto, with bonds making up no more than 30% and in some cases, none at all. I’ll be speaking at the Vision Conference today. I’ll be showing an audience of the leading RIAs in the country how to get their clients off zero. The 60/40 allocation is dead. Abra now has the only viable solution for wealth advisors to offer clients a broad range of… https://t.co/DSfl4JBHHR — Bill Barhydt (@billbarX) June 10, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Faces $190M Liquidation—But Signs Hint at Upcoming Rally , Abra’s Bet on Crypto Wealth Abra didn’t start out as a crypto wealth platform. It began as a Bitcoin remittance app, helping people send money using crypto. But under Barhydt’s leadership, it evolved. Today, Abra offers spot trading, lending, borrowing, and yield services – all designed for investors who want exposure to digital assets. Barhydt’s background is just as varied – he’s worked at the CIA, NASA, Netscape, and Goldman Sachs. Now, he’s focused on helping advisors tap into crypto in a smarter, more strategic way. Barhydt emphasized that “Bitcoin presents the best financial chance of our era.” Crypto Is No Longer Optional With bonds losing their appeal and Bitcoin hitting record highs, more financial advisors are exploring crypto as a serious part of their strategy. Abra wants to be the platform they turn to as this shift continues. The message from Barhydt and Edelman is clear: The old rules no longer apply. Crypto is no longer a fringe bet – it’s becoming a core part of the modern investment portfolio. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T12:01:56,"How gold took its shine as the world’s undisputed safe haven asset","Gold just made its biggest comeback in modern economic history. The ancient metal, long dismissed by economists and dumped by central banks after the collapse of the gold standard in the 1970s, has now climbed to the second most-held reserve asset on the planet—right behind the US dollar. Governments that once sold their gold for decades are now buying it again. And not in small amounts. Over the past three years, net central bank purchases have been over 1,000 tonnes annually, a record pace. That demand pushed gold above the euro in global reserves for the first time ever. The last time central banks held this much gold was back in 1965 during the Bretton Woods system. Trump’s policies trigger dollar doubts Donald Trump’s second term lit the fuse. His trade wars , unpredictable foreign policy, and fiscal blowouts drove investors and foreign governments to question the strength of the US dollar and Treasury bonds. The dollar, once the default haven in global crises, just dropped to a three-year low against the euro and pound. John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council, didn’t overcomplicate it. “It’s Trump, in a word,” he said . “It’s the risk and uncertainty from the new US administration.” Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs and increasing debt raised concerns over US fiscal discipline. His attacks on the Federal Reserve and US courts have only made things worse. Meanwhile, the price of gold has surged. This April, it hit a new intraday high of over $3,000 per troy ounce, beating the previous all-time high set in 1980. That marked a 30% rise just in 2025. After Israel bombed Iran, investors jumped into gold again, pushing prices close to that peak. For many, this wasn’t just another crisis hedge. It was a full-blown retreat from traditional safe assets like bonds. Central banks in Asia and beyond load up Most of the heavy buying came from countries outside the US and Europe. Central banks in China, Turkey, and India have been leading the charge. These governments are trying to reduce their exposure to the dollar in case they ever face sanctions similar to what Russia dealt with after the Ukraine invasion. Their goal isn’t high returns. They’re simply stacking assets that can’t be frozen, sanctioned, or printed out of thin air. With few other currencies offering enough liquidity or political neutrality, central banks are settling for gold. Oh, but demand comes with problems. When traders rushed to import gold into New York earlier this year over tariff fears, it clogged up the system. At the Bank of England, the world’s second-biggest gold vault, queues to withdraw metal stretched on for weeks. Bank staff couldn’t keep up with the requests. Eventually, Trump clarified that gold wouldn’t face tariffs. The old belief that US Treasuries were the safest place to park reserves doesn’t hold like it used to. Even private fund managers are sounding alarms. A recent Bank of America survey found that 45% of them think gold is overvalued right now—the highest number since 2008. Still, for the second month in a row, gold was called the “most crowded trade” in markets. Everyone seems to be in it, even the skeptics. Kenneth Rogoff, professor at Harvard and former IMF chief economist, said the narrative around crypto replacing gold doesn’t hold up anymore. “People often say bitcoin is the new gold. I say, ‘No, gold is the new gold.’” But not everyone’s rooting for a return to the gold standard. Economists argue that pegging currencies to a fixed asset caused more harm than good during past downturns, including the Great Depression. It limited governments’ ability to react to crises. That’s why even those who are bullish on gold don’t see it replacing the dollar anytime soon. Still, the fear is real. And the demand is real. So yeah, for now, gold is doing what it’s always done best—sit still, stay quiet, and hold its value while the rest of the world freaks out. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-14T11:50:13,"Solana ETF Hopes Rise, But Approval Unlikely Next Week, Say Analysts","Seven asset managers submitted filings for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 13, signaling growing momentum for altcoin ETFs. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart cautioned that a swift approval is unlikely, despite optimism from market participants. In a post on X, Seyffart noted that there needs to be a regulatory back-and-forth before any green light. “If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were A LOT of filings over the preceding couple months before launch,” he wrote. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were eventually approved in January 2024, over a decade after the first application by Gemini’s Winklevoss twins in 2013. All Eyes on Staking Language in Solana Filings The filings from major players—Fidelity Investments, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck—all include language around staking, which has become a key area of regulatory focus. Fidelity submitted a new S-1 form, while others amended earlier filings. VanEck, which initiated the first U.S. Solana ETF application in early June 2024, submitted its amended version last. Seyffart confirmed , “All of them include staking language, I believe.” While experience with prior Bitcoin and Ether ETF approvals could help speed up procedural elements, he emphasized that staking remains an unresolved issue with no precedent yet set. The SEC is also reviewing proposals to add staking features to already-approved spot Ether ETFs. Staking, which allows holders of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum to earn rewards, has raised questions about whether it constitutes a securities offering—a gray area that regulators have yet to define clearly. SOL, ETH ETFs Could See Staking Decisions Together Seyffart speculated that both Solana and Ether ETFs could potentially receive staking approvals simultaneously. “They could theoretically be launched with staking at the same time,” he said, while clarifying he has “no insight into what will actually happen.” Bloomberg Intelligence raised its estimate for Solana ETF approval in 2025 to 90% back in April. Meanwhile, in January, Consensys founder Joe Lubin expressed optimism that staking features for Ether ETFs could be authorized “soon.” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added to the excitement, suggesting an “altcoin ETF summer” could be on the horizon, with Solana poised to take the lead.

The latest data reveals a truly encouraging trend that speaks volumes about the current market sentiment and the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Continue Strong Streak According to recent data from Farside Investors, June 13th marked a notable day for the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market. These funds collectively saw a substantial net inflow totaling $301.7 million . What makes this figure particularly significant is that it represents the fifth consecutive trading day where these ETFs have experienced net positive inflows. This consistent buying pressure is a key indicator that investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated products remains robust. Understanding net inflows is crucial. It means that on this particular day, the total amount of money flowing into these ETFs from new investments or purchases of shares exceeded the amount flowing out from redemptions or sales of shares. A streak of consecutive net inflows suggests sustained positive sentiment and accumulation rather than fleeting interest. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Contributions While the overall figure is impressive, looking at the individual performance of the various US Spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a clearer picture of where the money is going. Here’s a breakdown of the top contributors on June 13th: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a massive $239 million in net inflows. This continues BlackRock’s dominance in attracting capital into the Bitcoin space via their ETF product. Fidelity’s FBTC: Following BlackRock, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw healthy net inflows of $25.2 million . Fidelity has consistently been one of the strongest performers alongside BlackRock since the ETFs launched. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) added $14.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating steady interest in their offering. Grayscale’s GBTC: In a significant shift from earlier trends, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) recorded net inflows of $9.1 million . For months after the conversion to an ETF, GBTC experienced significant outflows, largely due to its higher fees compared to competitors. Recent inflows suggest that this selling pressure may be easing, and some investors might even be re-entering or finding value in GBTC. Grayscale’s BTC (Mini): Grayscale’s new, lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) also saw inflows, bringing in $7.5 million . This new fund is designed to offer a more competitive fee structure. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) rounded out the list of positive contributors with $6 million in net inflows. It’s worth noting that data for ARK 21Shares’ ARKB was not yet available at the time of the report. The remaining US Spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked by Farside Investors showed no change in their holdings for the day. What Does This Streak of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Signify? The consistent inflow trend, particularly the five-day streak, is a powerful signal for the market. Here’s why it matters: Sustained Demand: It indicates that the demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated, accessible products is not a one-off event but a sustained trend. Institutional Interest: While retail investors certainly participate, the significant amounts flowing into funds like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC are often attributed to larger institutions, wealth managers, and financial advisors allocating capital on behalf of their clients. This suggests increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption. Market Validation: The success and continued growth of these ETFs provide further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset in traditional financial circles. Potential Price Impact: While not the only factor, consistent net inflows represent buying pressure on Bitcoin itself, as ETF issuers purchase BTC to back the new shares being created. This can contribute positively to Bitcoin’s price performance over time. Easing GBTC Pressure: The fact that GBTC is now seeing inflows, even modest ones, suggests that the large selling pressure from that fund, which weighed on the market for a period, may be subsiding. This period contrasts with earlier phases following the January launch, where initial euphoria was followed by some volatility and periods of net outflows, particularly from GBTC. The current streak suggests a more stable and growing base of demand. The Broader Context: Cryptocurrency ETF Landscape The success of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is also influencing the broader Cryptocurrency ETF landscape. It highlights the demand for regulated crypto investment products and could pave the way for other single-asset or basket crypto ETFs in the future, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared. Investors are clearly looking for familiar, regulated wrappers to access the potential upside of the crypto market. While the focus is currently on Bitcoin, the infrastructure and investor comfort level being built by these products could eventually benefit other digital assets seeking ETF approval. What’s Next? Keeping an Eye on the Data For investors and market watchers, monitoring the daily inflow and outflow data for these US Spot Bitcoin ETFs remains a crucial activity. Continued strong inflows would likely be interpreted as a bullish signal for Bitcoin and reflect ongoing demand from traditional finance. Conversely, a return to significant outflows could indicate shifting sentiment or macroeconomic pressures. Other factors to watch include regulatory developments, changes in global economic conditions, and significant price movements in Bitcoin itself, all of which can influence ETF flows. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive trend, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, remains volatile. ETF flows can change direction quickly. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact demand for these products. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Strong Vote of Confidence The streak of five consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the $301.7 million figure on June 13th, is a powerful indicator of growing confidence and sustained demand for Bitcoin via the US Spot Bitcoin ETF structure. Led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, these funds are successfully bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. The data suggests that institutional adoption is not just a buzzword but a tangible trend driving significant capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem. As these inflows continue, they provide a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s position as a recognized and increasingly accepted investment asset.

2025-06-14T11:40:19,"Crypto Market Faces $190M Liquidation—But Signs Hint at Upcoming Rally","The post Crypto Market Faces $190M Liquidation—But Signs Hint at Upcoming Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market just went through another heavy blow, with over $190 million lost in liquidations in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin fell hard yesterday , due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions triggered in the Middle East. Some altcoins are showing signs of life, short sellers are being wiped out, and analysts believe a bounce could be coming. So, is this the start of a comeback? Bitcoin Crashes Amid Global Tension On one of the worst days this June, Bitcoin dropped nearly 4%, crashing to around $102,664. This drop was mainly due to rising tensions in the Middle East , which triggered panic across markets. As a result, the crypto space saw over $1 billion in leveraged positions wiped out in just one day. But within 24 hours, things began to change. While the market is still shaky, many coins have started to rise again. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 14 June, 2025 , Short Traders Take the Bigger Hit Today, another $190.25 million in leveraged trades were liquidated. But this time, short positions took the bigger hit, losing $107 million, while long positions saw losses of $83.1 million. In the meantime, when short trades were liquidated, traders rushed to buy back their positions, which pushed prices higher. That’s exactly what happened today. In the last 24 hours, over 58,000 traders were liquidated, with the total losses hitting $191.32 million. The largest single liquidation was worth $6.26 million on Binance, involving Bitcoin. Altcoins and Memecoins Start to Move While Bitcoin is still settling, some altcoins and meme tokens are quietly climbing. Shiba Inu gained 4%, Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped 4.5%, Litecoin (LTC) rose 3%, Pi Network (Pi) increased 4.2%, and PEPE saw a 3.6% bump. On the other hand, some analysts believe this correction might be a setup for the next big rally. An expert pointed to a similar situation in April 2024, when Bitcoin jumped 15% just 11 days after a conflict between Israel and Iran. Two months later, it had surged 48%. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin is trading around $105,000, up slightly in the past 24 hours, but overall market sentiment remains cautious following recent dips. Why are cryptos down?
