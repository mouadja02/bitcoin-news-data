Bitcoin Solaris (BTC‑S), now in Phase 7 of its presale at $7, replicates that momentum with updated fundamentals and broader accessibility. Forecasts set token value at $20 at listing — an almost certain 186% return — while deeper growth potential lies ahead. The mechanics that drove TRON’s early success are now fueling BTC‑S. Tokenomics Designed for Value Retention BTC‑S operates on a hard cap of 21 million tokens, with only 4.2 million made available during presale. Every token allocation and phase detail is public and verifiable — no hidden vaults, no stealth minting. This transparency ensures that each BTC‑S token purchased today keeps its value intact as supply remains fixed. Early buyers who secured tokens at $5 or $7 locked in positions under material scarcity. The fewer tokens available, the stronger each remaining one becomes. Mining Participation Without Barriers TRON’s rise leaned heavily on network activity. BTC‑S goes further by enabling participation through ordinary smartphones. Through the Nova App beta, users verified that idle device resources — storage and CPU — generate BTC‑S smoothly and sustainably. That means network contributors aren’t limited to technical insiders; anyone with a compatible phone can earn rewards and help secure the system. This widespread participation model mirrors TRON’s early engagement — except it’s built on everyday hardware. Trusted Transparency Through Audits Trust in presale tokens hinges on early verification. BTC‑S has met this requirement. A smart contract review by Cyberscope confirmed token logic aligns with stated rules. Mobile mining infrastructure received additional vetting from Freshcoins , confirming functionality and reliability. Developer identities passed a full KYC verification , eliminating the anonymity common in early-stage tokens. These layers of verification elevate BTC‑S from speculation to substance. Crypto strategist Ben Crypto recently analyzed BTC‑S, drawing lines from TRON’s early model to Bitcoin Solaris’s structural setup. His insights highlight the capped token supply, mobile-first mining, and audit-backed confidence as reliable signals for future gains. He projects BTC‑S could reach $100 within a year of listing — suggesting gains beyond the initial 186% jump. Real Participation Builds Real Value At $7, BTC‑S offers access comparable to TRON’s early phases, but with improved infrastructure. Pricing is set before the public market opens, establishing a baseline for early return. If listing occurs at $20, investors see an automatic 186% gain. If utility and adoption follow, the climb to $100 becomes realistically attainable. That’s more than speculation — it’s calculated outcome based on adoption and demand. In both TRON and BTC‑S cases, the key driver is user-led action. TRON grew through developer backing and community engagement. BTC‑S adds a layer of passive user contribution via mobile mining. Every device added, every token mined reduces circulating supply and raises demand. The result is value generated from activity, not just hype or media buzz. As more people download and use the Nova App, the demand curve grows organically. That’s a self-reinforcing loop rarely found in token models. Accelerated Wealth: A Rare Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has drawn over 11,000 investors and raised more than $3.8 million to date. Social channels are active. Mobile mining is live. Audits and KYC are in place. In a single stage, the project blends structural opportunity with execution. TRON’s early backers benefited from low entry points in a rising ecosystem. BTC‑S now delivers a comparable setup — with added certainty and accessibility. With Phase 7 nearing conclusion, final presale tokens remain limited. After that, tokens shift into public trading, which introduces volatility, broader buy-in, and reduced rewards for contributors. Early participants enjoy both pricing advantage and mining participation ahead of public launch. History shows that this timing matters — TRON’s early investors saw outsized returns because they acted before market tides shifted. BTC‑S offers the same timing advantage, modernized with structural clarity.

2025-06-14T09:50:24,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 63: Navigating the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index Hits 63: Navigating the Greed Zone The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic environment, often driven as much by emotion as by fundamental analysis. Understanding the prevailing sentiment is crucial for investors and traders alike. One of the most popular tools for gauging this collective mood is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this index has shown a significant shift, rising to 63 and firmly positioning itself within the ‘Greed’ zone. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a unique tool designed by Alternative.me to visualize the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It aggregates various data points to produce a single number between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). The core idea is that extreme fear can indicate a potential buying opportunity for those brave enough to enter a falling market, while extreme greed can signal that the market is due for a correction. Why does this matter? Because human psychology plays a massive role in financial markets. Fear can lead to panic selling, driving prices down further than fundamentals might suggest. Greed can lead to irrational exuberance, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and speculative buying, pushing prices into bubble territory. The index provides a snapshot of this emotional temperature, helping participants potentially make more rational decisions by understanding the crowd’s current mindset. Breaking Down the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Score The index categorizes sentiment across a spectrum: 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed A reading of 63, as recently reported, falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ category. This indicates that market participants are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about current and future price movements. While not yet in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory, it suggests a strong positive bias is currently dominating the Crypto Market Sentiment . Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting opportunities for long-term investors. Conversely, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have sometimes preceded market tops or significant pullbacks, as speculative excess becomes unsustainable. How is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Calculated? While often referred to in the context of the broader crypto market, the index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, given its market dominance. The calculation incorporates six key factors, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to average values. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares current market volume and momentum to historical averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greedy or optimistic behavior. Social Media (15%): Analyzes tweets and posts for specific terms related to crypto, tracking sentiment and engagement speed. High interaction and positive sentiment can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users about their market sentiment. (Note: As mentioned in the source, surveys are currently paused, which might slightly affect this component’s input, although the weighting is applied to the remaining active factors). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising dominance can indicate fear (as investors move to the perceived ‘safer’ asset, BTC) or simply strong performance in Bitcoin itself. Falling dominance can signal increasing greed as altcoins rally more aggressively. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin bubble’, can signal fear, while terms related to buying or specific projects might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more holistic view of the underlying Crypto Market Sentiment than simply looking at price charts alone. What Does Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ Mean for You? A reading of 63 in the ‘Greed’ zone carries several implications for those involved in the market: Potential Implications: Increased Optimism: Participants are generally feeling positive about the market’s direction. Higher Risk Appetite: Investors may be more willing to take on risk, potentially moving into more speculative altcoins. FOMO Setting In: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive impulsive buying. Potential for Overheating: Markets driven purely by emotion and speculation can become detached from underlying value, increasing the risk of a sharp correction. While ‘Greed’ isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’, it serves as a yellow flag. It suggests caution is warranted. Prices may continue to rise, but the probability of a significant downturn increases as sentiment moves higher into the greed spectrum. Using the Crypto Fear and Greed Index in Your Crypto Investing Strategy The index is best used as one tool among many, not as a standalone signal. Here’s how it can fit into a broader Crypto Investing Strategy : Benefits: Sentiment Check: Provides a quick, aggregated view of market mood. Contrarian Indicator: Can help identify potential opportunities during ‘Extreme Fear’ (buy when others are fearful) or warn of potential tops during ‘Extreme Greed’ (be cautious when others are greedy). Historical Context: Comparing current readings to historical levels can offer perspective on where the market might be in its cycle. Challenges & Limitations: Not a Crystal Ball: The index cannot predict future price movements with certainty. A high greed score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does a high fear score guarantee a bottom. Lagging Indicator: It reflects *current* sentiment, which is often a reaction to recent price action, not necessarily a predictor of future action. Component Reliance: Changes in the calculation method or data sources (like paused surveys) can affect its reliability. Bitcoin-Centric: While indicative of the overall market, it’s heavily weighted towards Bitcoin. Altcoin sentiment might differ. Actionable Insights: Combine with Analysis: Use the index alongside technical analysis (charts, patterns), fundamental analysis (project utility, adoption), and macroeconomic factors. Manage Risk: High greed scores are a good time to review your portfolio, potentially take some profits, set stop-losses, or reduce leverage. Avoid FOMO: When the index is high in the greed zone, resist the urge to chase rapidly rising prices. Stick to your predefined investment plan. Look for Opportunities in Fear: Conversely, low fear scores can signal potential buying opportunities if fundamentals remain strong. Think of the index as a temperature gauge for the market’s emotional state. It tells you if people are hot (greedy) or cold (fearful), but it doesn’t tell you *why* or *how long* that temperature will last. Historical Examples and the Greed Zone Looking back, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has often provided interesting insights. For instance, during the peak of the 2017 bull run and the late 2020/early 2021 rally, the index consistently registered in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (often above 90). These periods were followed by significant market corrections. Conversely, during major crashes, like March 2020 or the bear market lows of 2022, the index plummeted into ‘Extreme Fear’ (sometimes below 10), which in hindsight, represented strong accumulation zones for long-term holders. Being in the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ at 63 isn’t as extreme as those historical peaks, but it places the market firmly in a state where caution should start outweighing excessive optimism. It’s a reminder that trees don’t grow to the sky and corrections are a natural part of market cycles. What Could Shift the Crypto Market Sentiment? The index is constantly reacting to market forces. Several factors could cause the Crypto Market Sentiment to shift from its current greedy state: Significant Price Drop: A sharp decline in Bitcoin or other major cryptocurrencies would quickly inject fear into the market. Negative News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange hacks, or major project failures can trigger widespread panic. Macroeconomic Changes: Shifts in global interest rates, inflation data, or recession fears can impact risk-on assets like crypto. Positive Developments: Conversely, positive news like institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, or technological breakthroughs could push the index further into Extreme Greed. Monitoring these external factors alongside the index provides a more robust understanding of potential future movements. Conclusion: Navigating Greed with Caution The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 63 signifies that optimism and confidence are currently the dominant forces in the market, placing it firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone. While this reflects positive price action and momentum, it also serves as an important reminder to temper enthusiasm with prudence. The index is a valuable sentiment tool, helping investors gauge the emotional temperature of the market and potentially act as a contrarian signal. However, it is not a standalone predictor. Successful navigation of the ‘Greed Zone Crypto’ requires combining this sentiment insight with thorough research, technical analysis, fundamental understanding, and disciplined risk management as part of a well-defined Crypto Investing Strategy . Stay informed, stay cautious, and avoid letting greed dictate your decisions.

2025-06-14T09:48:28,"AI predicts Bitcoin price for July 1, 2025","Two artificial intelligence (AI) models are forecasting that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will likely hold above the $110,000 mark by July 1. The outlook comes as Bitcoin stabilizes, following a pullback triggered by uncertainty tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. As of press time, BTC was trading at $105,124, down about 0.3% in the past 24 hours and more than 2% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $103,326 and the 200-day SMA of $87,532, a sign of strength in both the short and long term. On the other hand, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 54.22, indicating neutral momentum, with room for further upside without immediate correction pressure. ChatGPT predicts Bitcoin price Regarding the price outlook, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT to gauge where Bitcoin might head over the next two weeks. According to the model, BTC could trade around $114,000 by July 1, likely between $111,000 and $117,000. The forecast is based on solid technical momentum, favorable historical trends, and steady institutional inflows. ChatGPT noted that 2025, a post-halving year, often brings Bitcoin gains. With continued ETF demand and institutional inflows, upward pressure will be seen throughout Q2. It also flagged $102,000 as key support. A drop below could lead to $98,000, while strong momentum could drive BTC to $120,000. Bitcoin AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts Bitcoin price Meanwhile, Grok, the AI model developed by xAI , offered a slightly more conservative view. Based on the current consolidation between $102,000 and $108,000, Grok projects Bitcoin will reach around $111,500 by July 1. The model noted Bitcoin’s tendency to post short-term gains after periods of sideways movement, especially in a supportive macro environment with continued ETF inflows. Assuming no major disruptions, Grok sees a reasonable 6% climb from current levels. However, Grok also outlined alternative scenarios: If resistance at $108,000 holds, a pullback to $103,000 could occur. Conversely, a breakout could push the price up to $116,000. In summary, both AI models remain bullish heading into July. The key focus is whether Bitcoin can hold the $105,000 level, a critical point for sustaining its upward momentum.

2025-06-14T09:37:44,"Fidelity files S-1 for Solana spot ETF with staking options","Asset management firm and ETF issuer Fidelity has officially submitted an S-1 registration filing for a Solana spot ETF. The exchange-traded fund will also include staking options for users. Fidelity isn’t the only firm eyeing a SOL ETF, with a flurry of companies issuing SOL ETF S-1 amendments on Friday, including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. VanEck was the first U.S. company to file for a spot Solana ETF in June 2024 and was also the last to submit its amended S-1 filing for the day. Fidelity advances toward a spot SOL ETF Fidelity submitted its S-1 statement Friday to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm acknowledged that the proposed Fidelity Solana Fund would operate as a Delaware statutory trust. The ETF’s goal is to mirror SOL’s performance based on the Fidelity Solana Reference Rate Index, which calculates price data using a volume-weighted median price after 15 seconds. The index aggregates prices from eligible spot markets and reflects the real-time value of SOL in U.S. dollars. The ETF issuer revealed that the fund aims to keep SOL in custody and earn extra yield by staking some of its holdings through vetted providers. The resulting staking rewards will be treated as income and distributed accordingly. Fidelity has named a custodian who will store all SOL in segregated accounts on behalf of the trust. According to the company, most assets will be held in cold storage with limited SOL in hot wallets for transactions. The firm also plans to list shares on the Cboe BZX Exchange, though the ticker symbol remains undisclosed. According to Fidelity, shares will be created and redeemed in large blocks called Baskets, mainly by authorized participants using either SOL or cash. The asset management firm added that daily net asset value (NAV) will be calculated using the same index method applied to SOL pricing. The filing also revealed an annual sponsor fee tied to the fund’s SOL assets, though the percentage remains undisclosed. Fidelity said the fee will cover most standard operating expenses, except for unusual costs and a separate staking-related fee paid to the custodian from staking rewards. Fidelity’s affiliate, FD Funds Management LLC, will sponsor the product. The firm said the Trust will not use leverage, derivatives, or complex instruments, keeping the structure simple for traditional investors. According to the asset management company, the custodian will control all private keys, and the sponsor will oversee staking activities and manage security. The Trust’s assets, including staked SOL, are not protected by the FDIC or SIPC insurance. To initiate the momentum, a sponsor affiliate purchased a single Seed Share to set up the fund. Fidelity also clarified that the trust isn’t registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which means investors won’t receive the same regulatory protections given to traditional mutual funds or ETFs that fall under that law. The trust needs registration approval from the SEC before sales can commence. Fidelity has labeled the trust as an emerging growth company, allowing it to follow scaled-back reporting rules initially. SEC urges ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June The latest filing follows the U.S. SEC’s directive last week for spot Solana ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said at the time that the agency’s request indicates it’s more likely than before to approve some of the products, giving a timeline of two to four months for spot SOL ETFs to go live. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart doubts the Solana ETF approval will come as soon as next week. “I think there needs to be a back and forth with the SEC and issuers to iron out details, so I doubt it. If anyone remembers the Bitcoin ETF launch, there were a lot of filings over the preceding couple months before launch.” – James Seyffart , ETF Analyst at Bloomberg The regulator also reportedly asked issuers to update language surrounding in-kind redemptions and how issuers would approach staking. Firms have been advocating for the agency to approve Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs, which would earn holders staking yield. The SEC has approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as well as several blended crypto-equity funds. ETF issuers, including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, recently urged the agency to practice a first-to-file approach, where the SEC prioritizes greenlighting financial products based on the order of arrival KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fidelity-spot-solana-etf-is-1-filing/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Solana|21Shares|Fidelity|Grayscale|SEC|SOL|USD|VanEck",cryptocompare

This makes the system secure and resistant to fraud. About every four years, the reward miners get is cut in half in an event called ""halving."" There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, making it scarce like gold. In the current market, Bitcoin remains strong compared to other cryptocurrencies.

Key Takeaways: The SEC approved Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-linked registration, covering 85 million shares. TMTG says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities despite gaining shelf flexibility. CEO Devin Nunes says the firm aims to grow its media, fintech, and Bitcoin holdings in parallel. The decision, revealed in a June 13 filing , marks a major regulatory step for the company behind Truth Social, the platform founded by President Donald Trump and partially owned by him. According to the filing, the SEC declared effective TMTG’s S-3 registration statement, initially submitted on June 6. Trump Media Registers 85M Shares Linked to $2.3B Bitcoin Deal: SEC The document outlines the registration of roughly 56 million shares and an additional 29 million shares tied to convertible notes, forming part of the firm’s broader equity and debt agreements with approximately 50 investors. The total proceeds from these arrangements amount to $2.3 billion. Although the registration includes a universal shelf to allow TMTG greater capital-raising flexibility, the company said it has “no immediate plans” to issue new securities under the provision. The move appears more strategic than urgent, aligning with TMTG’s stated ambition to evolve beyond its media roots. TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes said the company is now pushing forward on multiple fronts. “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities,” Nunes said. “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” SEC APPROVES TRUMP MEDIA’S BITCOIN TREASURY DEAL pic.twitter.com/bybvEZ5TjS — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) June 13, 2025 Despite the regulatory win, TMTG shares dropped 2.06% on the day of the announcement, closing at $19.52. TMTG Confirms $2.5B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base. On May 28, Arkham Intelligence posted on X, “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” — referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. TMTG isn’t stopping there. On June 5, the company filed for approval to launch its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), signaling even deeper ambitions in digital assets. According to the filing, the ETF would hold Bitcoin in custody and aim to mirror its market performance. Trump has publicly supported the expansion of crypto access and has pledged to make the United States a leading center for digital assets. Earlier this month, he hosted a private dinner for investors in his personal meme coin project at his golf club.

And so the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling downhill.” The Galaxy Digital CEO says Bitcoin could go up by over 9x from the current level as it increasingly becomes accepted as a store of value by younger generations. “The bull case becomes that over time, young people care about it more than old people. And so gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin. If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go – 10x. And so that’s a $1 million Bitcoin just to be where gold is. And I think gold should go from $3,000 to $10,000.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,662 at time of writing.

Claiming that current market conditions support Bitcoin’s upward surge, Kang argued that a deep correction is unlikely before the largest cryptocurrency reaches at least $140,000 to $160,000.

2025-06-14T09:05:01,"Unveiling Meta’s Significant AI Investment and Shifting Tech IPO Trends","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Meta’s Significant AI Investment and Shifting Tech IPO Trends The world of technology and finance is constantly evolving, with major players making strategic moves that ripple across industries. Recently, a significant development caught the attention of market watchers: Meta’s substantial investment in the AI data-labeling space. This move, alongside intriguing shifts in the public offering landscape, offers key insights for anyone tracking the pulse of innovation and investment. The Bitcoin World Equity podcast recently delved into these topics, providing a deep dive into what these developments signal for the future. Meta AI Investment: A Bold Move in the AI Race? Meta Platforms has reportedly made a significant Meta AI Investment , committing a substantial $14.3 billion to Scale AI, a leader in data labeling. However, this isn’t a straightforward acquisition. Meta is taking a 49% stake in the company and bringing Scale AI’s co-founder, Alexandr Wang, onto their team. This strategic partial ownership and talent acquisition highlight Meta’s urgency to accelerate its position in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape. The move signals Meta’s determination to keep pace with AI heavyweights like OpenAI and Google, although the exact strategy for leveraging this investment remains a subject of discussion. The Equity podcast hosts explored whether this Scale AI Deal represents a genuine game-changer for Meta’s AI capabilities or if it’s primarily aimed at adding a well-connected figure like Wang to their ranks at a time when Meta’s internal AI progress faces scrutiny. Navigating the Fintech IPO Market Beyond the realm of artificial intelligence, the financial technology sector continues to see activity in the public markets. The discussion turned to the Fintech IPO Market , specifically examining recent performance. A notable example is Chime’s initial public offering, which reportedly priced above initial expectations at $27 per share and saw a positive jump in early trading. This performance offers potential signals for the broader tech IPO landscape. Anthony Ha, one of the Equity podcast hosts, shared his perspective, offering some “not-so-hot takes” on what Chime’s IPO signals for overall Tech IPO Trends . The conversation explored whether this indicates renewed investor appetite or if specific sector strength is driving these outcomes. Understanding these nuances is crucial for evaluating the health and direction of technology companies seeking public funding. The Rise of Agentic AI Startups The podcast also touched upon emerging trends within the AI sector itself, particularly focusing on the types of companies gaining traction. Y Combinator’s recent Demo Day reportedly showcased a significant number of “agentic” AI Startups . These companies are focused on building autonomous software agents capable of performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. This focus on autonomous AI aligns with broader discussions around AI-driven task automation. A recent conversation with Fiverr’s CEO provided further context on how AI is impacting the gig economy and potentially transforming how tasks are assigned and completed. The rise of agentic AI startups suggests a future where software agents play an increasingly central role in both business processes and potentially, personal productivity. Beyond AI and IPOs: Other Tech Highlights The Equity podcast episode covered additional fascinating developments in the tech world: An archival interview with Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang offered insights into his early predictions for the future of artificial intelligence. A look at the quiet 18-month collaboration between Jony Ive’s design firm LoveFrom and electric vehicle maker Rivian on their first electric bike product, confirming its bike-like form factor. These diverse topics underscore the dynamic nature of the technology sector, where innovation spans from complex AI investments to consumer product design collaborations. Conclusion The recent news cycle, as discussed on the Bitcoin World Equity podcast, highlights pivotal moments in the tech and financial markets. Meta’s significant Meta AI Investment in Scale AI demonstrates the ongoing intensity of the AI race. Simultaneously, the performance of recent offerings in the Fintech IPO Market provides valuable data points for understanding current Tech IPO Trends . The emergence of agentic AI Startups from accelerators like Y Combinator points towards the next wave of AI-driven innovation. Staying informed on these key developments is essential for navigating the future of technology and investment.

2025-06-14T09:00:00,"Bitcoin pullback sparks $1B in long liquidations, KAIA and AB rally over 40%","Bitcoin bulls failed to reach a new all-time high this week, as fresh bearish macro developments triggered a late-week pullback. By late Asian trading hours on Friday, the total cryptocurrency market cap had dropped over 5% to $3.38 trillion, retreating from a three-week high set on June 11. Market sentiment also declined, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index falling 7 points to 53 on the same day, exiting Greed territory and returning to neutral levels. Most top-ranking altcoins surrendered their early-week gains, with only a few maintaining double-digit profits by the end of the week. Why did crypto crash? The week began with strong bullish momentum driven by optimism around renewed trade negotiations between the United States and China. Bitcoin briefly surged past $110,000 as risk appetite returned to global markets. However, sentiment quickly reversed as geopolitical instability in the Middle East escalated. Israel launched a large-scale military operation targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and other strategic assets, prompting fears of broader regional conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that strikes would continue until perceived threats were neutralized, raising the risk of prolonged hostilities. The uncertainty surrounding potential retaliatory actions from Iran and its allies triggered a broad sell-off across risk assets. Cryptocurrencies, which had rallied earlier in the week, were hit particularly hard as investors moved to de-risk their portfolios. Bitcoin fell as much as 5.6% to $102,700 on Bitstamp before slightly recovering to around $105,000 by late Friday. The downturn coincided with a surge in futures market liquidations, which totaled $1.15 billion over the past 24 hours. Long positions accounted for $1 billion of that amount, marking the largest daily liquidation event since February 25. In contrast, short liquidations were limited to $93 million. Bitcoin led the sell-off, recording $448.1 million in liquidations on June 13 alone. The scale of forced selling accelerated the price drop and amplified panic across the market, fueling further downside pressure. Despite the late-week correction, the broader macro backdrop remains supportive of long-term crypto upside. Easing tensions in U.S.–China trade relations have revived investor confidence in global risk markets, while recent U.S. inflation data showed continued cooling, reinforcing expectations of monetary policy stability. Core CPI for May came in below forecasts, reducing pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. This has kept real yields stable and preserved appetite for risk-on assets, with Bitcoin still trading near historical highs and above the key support level at $104,000 despite short-term volatility. What’s next for Bitcoin? The outlook for Bitcoin remains mixed as analysts weigh the implications of this week’s volatility. Bitcoin dropped to $102,800 on Friday after geopolitical tensions escalated, but quickly rebounded to over $105,500, suggesting buyers remain active near key support. That support came at the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a level that has historically served as a launchpad for major rallies. A similar setup occurred in October 2024 when Bitcoin fell 8.8% during a prior Israel–Iran conflict, only to recover and gain over 80% by year-end. BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView. Given the structural similarities, some traders see the current correction as a healthy consolidation phase within a broader uptrend backed by improving macro signals. Further reinforcing this view, on-chain data shows an uptick in Bitcoin accumulation. Bitcoin also briefly entered oversold conditions on Friday, which technical traders view as a potential launch point for a short-term recovery. A sustained rebound could set the stage for a renewed push toward record highs. Another bullish theory comes from analyst Merlijn The Trader, who flagged a recurring fractal tied to liquidity grabs. In his chart analysis, Bitcoin appears to be following the same breakout sequence as before, clearing key resistance levels and trendlines just as it did ahead of its late 2024 rally past $100,000 amid Middle East tensions. In both cases, the price dipped briefly to flush out leveraged traders before surging higher. BTC/USD price trends. Source: Merlijn The Trader Other analysts, including widely followed trader Crypto Caesar, share a similar view and anticipate a short-term rebound. Nevertheless, one veteran has warned that Bitcoin’s recent rejection at $110,000 may signal the end of its local uptrend. In a series of posts on X, John Bollinger, the creator of the Bollinger Bands indicator, stated that the current price action confirms a “Three Pushes” pattern, typically seen at the end of sustained uptrends. Bollinger outlined how Bitcoin’s recovery from April lows near $75,000 unfolded in three distinct surges, each hitting the upper Bollinger Band and followed by brief consolidations. He noted that this structure has now been completed, and the failure to hold above all-time highs may usher in either a broader reversal or a prolonged consolidation phase. Traders watching for continued upside may need to account for a potential cooling period in the weeks ahead. When writing, Bitcoin was trading at $105,648, up 1% over the past week. Altcoins Altcoins faced significant volatility this week, with total market capitalisation peaking at $1.43 trillion before sliding to $1.2 trillion. The Altcoin Season Index climbed to 30 on June 10, marking a short-lived momentum shift, but has since eased back to 25. The top gainers for the week were as follows: Kaia Kaia (KAIA) has recorded a 45% increase over the past seven days, with its price reaching approximately $0.155 and its market cap rising to $940 million at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap The rally is primarily attributed to two significant developments. First, the Kaia team announced plans to introduce a Korean won–pegged stablecoin, a move that aligns with South Korea’s evolving regulatory framework under the proposed Digital Asset Basic Act, which supports the issuance of domestic stablecoins. Second, the network recently completed the native integration of Tether’s USDT, enhancing stablecoin functionality and improving liquidity within the Kaia ecosystem. AB Over the past week, AB (AB) has surged 40%, lifting its market capitalization to approximately $760 million as of the latest reporting. Source: CoinMarketCap AB’s strong performance this week followed its listing on Binance Alpha, Binance’s early-access platform, where a $1 million prize pool for trading activity boosted user engagement. Listings on Gate.io and Bitget soon followed, adding further momentum. The project also launched the AB Charity Foundation, introducing a philanthropic element to its ecosystem. Uniswap Uniswap (UNI) held onto 23% gains, trading at $7.49 at the time of writing, with a market cap of $4.71 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The key catalyst behind Uniswap’s recent bullish momentum was the launch of its new Smart Wallet. The rally was further supported by comments from SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who indicated the agency is considering an “innovation exemption” to ease regulatory barriers for DeFi platforms. The announcement has been seen as a potential catalyst for a renewed DeFi market cycle, positioning Uniswap to benefit as a leading protocol in the space.

2025-06-14T09:00:00,"Bitcoin’s Shaky Comeback: Will It Break $108K or Crash Again?","Bitcoin rebounds to $105K after 4% drop on June 13. Sentiment Index drops below 50%, showing a bearish trader mood. Resistance near $108K; support at $104.7K must hold firm. Bitcoin has climbed back above $105,000 at press time, but a deeper look at on-chain data suggests the recovery is fragile and lacks strong conviction from buyers. Bitcoin had gained around 1% after the sharp drop on June 13th, when it fell by 4%, slipping below $104,000 as rising tensions in the Middle East caused panic across the crypto market and wiped out billions of dollars in value. While this small price recovery is a relief for investors, experts warn that the market still looks shaky. A CryptoQuant analyst has observed that the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index, a tool that tracks market mood, has dropped to around 46%. This is below the neutral 50% mark, meaning traders are leaning slightly bearish. Bitcoin Stuck in a Range? The index had peaked above 80% in early June when the market was much more positive. But even though Bitcoin’s price bounced from $103K to $105K, trading activity hasn’t picked up enough to fully support the move.

2025-06-14T08:40:44,"Trump reports $57M earnings from World Liberty Financial","US President Donald Trump has revealed earning $57 million from World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture he is involved in alongside his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. According to a more than 200-page financial disclosure filed with the US Office of Government Ethics, Trump also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in WLF—granting him significant voting power within the company. The disclosure shows that WLF was Trump’s single largest income source among hundreds of assets, surpassing revenue from his books and real estate holdings. The filing is expected to intensify scrutiny over Trump’s growing ties to the crypto sector, with critics raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Trump earns significant income amid his pro-crypto stance World Liberty Financial announced in January that it has sold 21 billion tokens in a public sale, hitting its target of raising $ 1 billion. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2024 described the special envoy for Trump, Steve Witkoff, as a promoter for WLF. Public support from Trump has helped fuel a rally in crypto markets, sending the price of Bitcoin to over $100,000 a coin. In addition, under chair Paul Atkins, the SEC has dismissed several high-profile cases against crypto groups. Interestingly, Trump has often promoted his $TRUMP meme coin on social media. He also hosted a gala dinner for its largest holders last month. Last week, the Trump family media company said it was planning to launch its own exchange-traded fund to hold Bitcoin directly, and in May, it said it would raise $2.5 billion to establish a “Bitcoin treasury.” During a Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas in May, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr revealed that cryptocurrencies were cheaper, faster, more secure, and more transparent than traditional fiat currencies. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. World Liberty reveals Trump’s family as its major shareholder World Liberty, launched last fall, aims to make financial services reachable to people in cryptocurrencies without intermediaries like banks—a concept known as decentralized finance (DeFi). However, it has yet to release a public platform, and according to a review of the project, it has only a small staff. Nonetheless, World Liberty said in mid-March that it had raised $550 million by selling “governance tokens.” According to reliable sources, most sales occurred following Trump’s victory in November. The tokens, denoted by the symbol $WLFI, entitle holders to vote on proposed changes to a project’s underlying code and signal their perspective on its vision and future road maps. Still, they cannot be traded. It is worth noting that while World Liberty Financial took in more than half a billion dollars, President Donald Trump’s family seized control of the crypto venture and much of that money with it. This is supported by governance rules that industry experts believe disproportionately favor insiders. This was revealed after World Liberty announced in January that the Trump family had acquired the business as its fundraising gained momentum. Two of the co-founders of World Liberty, crypto entrepreneurs Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, have been replaced as the main leaders by a group with a 60% ownership stake from the Trump family. The Trump family claims 75% of the profits from token sales and 60% from World Liberty’s operations once they begin. This setup means the Trump family is set to receive around $400 million in fees. Following the mid-March sales, after the co-founders took their share, World Liberty only retained 5% of the $550 million raised to develop the platform. Trump’s family faces criticism over their shareholder capacity in WLF The way this project is organized, especially with the Trump family’s large share of revenue and the fact that governance tokens cannot be traded, makes World Liberty quite centralized compared to others in the industry. This conclusion comes from a review of practices at the five biggest DeFi lending platforms and interviews with four US professors who study crypto. Jim Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University who focuses on DeFi regulation , said he finds it hard to see any financial advantage for those holding these tokens. Additionally, David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee who recently studied World Liberty, noted that the project’s structure effectively keeps public investors or token holders from having any real financial involvement.

BSV has traded under the 200-day EMA band since early 2025, indicating a bearish trend. Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chartMany ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030. Table of Contents Overview Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 BSV Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2026-2030 BSV Coin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2027 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2028 BSV Crypto Price Prediction 2029 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV Token BSV Price $ 30.98629177 3.45% Market cap $ 615,967,488.6149 Circulating Supply 19,878,709.3750 Trading Volume $ 49,976,416.7151 All-time high $491.64 on 16th April 2021 All-time low $23.30 on 10th June 2024 Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 Based on the historical data, price analysis, and broader market sentiments, the BSV price is expected to surge by the end of 2025. With an average of $86 , the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 BSV Price Prediction 2025 In 2024’s second half, an ascending broadening wedge pattern was developed by BSV’s price action. This was followed by a strong buying movement witnessed in Q4 2024, which began from the wedge’s lower border to its upper border. Many experts viewed that continuation of bullish momentum could lead to new levels higher, but the upper border closely aligned with a strong resistance zone, and that repelled its price trajectory downwards to 2025’s first half, eroding over 60% of its gains. Despite BSV price’s effort to rise higher in Q2 of 2025, the bullish strength fell short to push prices higher, as a result, BSV ended up in another declining wedge. Many had anticipated that BSV would reach the round number of $50, but it failed to meet that target by the end of April, dampening investor morale. The last seen good momentum was in Q4 2024 and which is now sorely missed by BSV investors. In April, BSV reached as high as $47 but faced rejection at the resistance block and proceeded to form lower lows. The recent bearish crossover between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA signals increasing bearish pressure in the short term. Despite several optimistic factors in Q2 2025, price action stayed muted. If BSV continues to decline within a downward wedge, then BSV’s price could drop further toward the $24 level. However, there’s a key turning point—if BSV manages to break out of this falling wedge pattern and flip the 200-day EMA band or break above the $40 price level, the trend could shift bullish. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA band might give BSV the momentum it needs to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. Furthermore, if this breakout is supported by increased adoption and BSV successfully clears the $50 resistance, the crypto could gain the momentum required to target $65 by the end of 2025.

2025-06-14T08:30:19,"No ‘Easy Street’: CFTC Acting Chair Shares New Crypto Approach Under Trump Admin","In a recent interview at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chair shared the future of the agency’s crypto regulation under the pro-industry administration. CFTC Won’t Criminalize Crypto On Thursday, CFTC’s acting chair, Caroline Pham, told Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi that regulations won’t be easy on anybody, including the crypto industry, despite the end of the “regulation by enforcement” approach under the new administration. Pham explained that “There is no easy street for anybody, and regulators aren’t easy,” adding that the agency’s shift toward a pro-innovation, pro-growth strategy doesn’t mean companies can bend the law and get away with it. She clarified that the CFTC’s new approach won’t “twist the law to criminalize an asset class or a technology,” like the past administration. Instead, it will focus on catching fraudsters and scammers in the market. “That’s always been our core mission is to prevent fraud, manipulation, and abuse in our markets and to help victims,” Pham affirmed. In the interview, the regulatory agency’s chair explained her previous comments about “uberizing crypto,” sharing that it means effectively integrating digital assets into daily life so that banning or criminalizing it becomes nearly impossible, like Uber did with the transportation industry. “When something becomes so big, so accepted, so part of our lives, you can’t really take it away then. The public, the people, voters, they won’t let you,” she affirmed, noting that the ride-sharing app revolutionized the industry, which resulted in a lot of people unsuccessfully trying to fight it. Pham considers that the “uberization” of the industry must be the goal to prevent crypto from being unfairly criminalized as a concept or a technology. “The way that you do that is by bringing it to the people, and the people will speak, and voters will speak,” she stated. Restoring Regulatory Clarity Speaking about the previous administration, Pham noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC “really went beyond what the law says and what the statute says,” which has been a common criticism of the US watchdogs. She condemned how the agency reinterpreted existing laws that applied to traditional markets to go after what they perceived as “bad or evil,” like crypto and blockchain technology, without considering the unintended consequences it could have on the global economy and global markets. When we start to change the rules for (…) the 700 trillion notional global derivatives markets because we’re trying to be creative and flex it to go after what we perceive to be a bad or evil, you know, crypto or blockchain, that is really breaking the fabric of our global markets. This is why “restoring the well-settled legal precedents, how the CFTC has applied and interpreted the law for decades, to restore that regulatory clarity” has been a priority under her leadership. Notably, Pham has repeatedly called for regulatory clarity for the crypto industry, proposing to revive the joint advisory committee between the CFTC and the SEC. Earlier this year, the regulatory agencies were reportedly discussing their options to effectively collaborate on digital assets regulations, after the launch of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/no-easy-street-cftc-acting-chair-shares-new-crypto-approach-under-trump-admin/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Caroline Pham|CFTC|CFTC Chair|crypto adoption|crypto industry|Crypto Regulations|regulation by Enforcement|SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce|Trump administration|Uber|US SEC|US watchdogs",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T08:30:16,"This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash – Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast","The Dogecoin price has crashed alongside the rest of the crypto market, and this has led to the break of a very important support level. This crash below $0.18 has signaled a turn in the tide, and this could trigger the next wave of declines. A crypto analyst had previously predicted this market decline, calling it before it began. However, it is not all bad news for the meme coin as longer timeframes offer more bullish options as time goes by. Dogecoin Price Still Bullish On The Long-Term Crypto analyst Master Ananda forecasted in a TradingView post where the Dogecoin price could be headed next. At the time of the post, the Dogecoin price was still trading close to the $0.2 level, and the market was still on an upward trajectory. While positive sentiment seemed to be returning to the market at that time, the analyst was calling out the possibility of a pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Master Ananda explained that the Dogecoin price was still quite bearish, but this was only on the short-term timeframe. This leaves out only the long-term timeframe for the bullishness, and so far, the meme coin’s market trend seems to be playing out the way the crypto analyst predicted. He called for a correction, using the April 2025 low as a basis and the lower highs that had formed as a result. This had begun back in December 2024 when the Dogecoin price had begun putting in lower highs, suggesting that there was bearishness building up in the market. Presently, as the Dogecoin price has dropped back below the $0.18 support, the analyst simply pointed out that it was a continuation of the decline that had begun on May 11 after the market recovery. While this is bearish for the short-term, suggesting there could be a bit more correction to go, the analyst doesn’t expect it to last long. Where Could The DOGE Price Go From Here As for the bottom of the current Dogecoin price correction, Master Ananda expects the price to bottom above the April 7 lows, which were above $0.13. This would put the meme coin at around $0.15 before the bottom is in, and then the recovery is expected to begin. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Just Flashed A Golden Cross Amid Crypto Market Recovery The crypto analyst urged investors, especially those holding spot bags, to wait for the dust to settle. After this, he expects the altcoin to turn bullish again. For traders going short, he advises caution and not to hold the trade for too long, as the range is short. “We are very likely to get a higher low compared to 7-April,” Master Ananda predicted. “If too many leveraged positions are open though and the market wants to remove those, there can be a long wick that pierces support for the action to recover the next day.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/analyst-dogecoin-price-crash/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Dogecoin|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T08:06:31,"BTC Price Unfazed by Iran’s Retaliation Attack Against Israel, HYPE Rockets 8% (Weekend Watch)","Bitcoin’s price experienced substantial volatility yesterday when Israel struck Iran, but the asset has remained a lot calmer today when the roles reversed. Many altcoins have started to recover from the Friday crash, including HYPE, which has risen back above $42. BTC Calm Despite Attacks The business week started on the right foot for BTC as the asset broke out of last weekend’s consolidation range and shot above $110,000 on Monday. Although it was stopped there, it managed to remain close to that level for the next couple of days. More positive news emerged on Wednesday, including a trade deal between the US and China as well as better-than-expected CPI data, but BTC failed to maintain its run. Just the opposite, it lost some ground and went back down to under $107,000. The bulls took it north to $108,500 on Thursday, but the geopolitical tension in the Middle East skyrocketed that night as Israel fired countless missiles against Iran, killing over 70 people in the process. Bitcoin’s prices reacted immediately with a price plunge that drove it south by over five grand since Thursday’s peak to under $103,000. Nevertheless, it recovered some ground on Friday and even challenged $106,000 at one point. It couldn’t breach that level but still trades above $105,000 now, which is somewhat surprising as Iran retaliated against Israel last night. Still, there are some warning signs about its future price trajectory if it fails to remain above $100,000. For now, though, its market cap has jumped to almost $2.1 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Rebound Most altcoins suffered yesterday but are with minor gains on a daily scale. Ethereum has returned above $2,500 after a small increase, while Ripple’s cross-border token has defended the $2.15 support. SOL, DOGE, ADA, and AVAX are also slightly in the green, while BCH and SHIB have posted more impressive gains. However, HYPE has stolen the show once again from the larger-cap alts, having surged by almost 8%. As a result, the asset now trades close to its all-time high of roughly $43. Other notable gainers from the past day include WBT, Fartcoin, PI, and ICP. The total crypto market cap has recovered over $60 billion and is back to $3.4 trillion on CG.

2025-06-14T08:04:03,"SharpLink Gaming Makes $463M Ethereum Bet Amid Stock Plunge, Sparking “MicroStrategy Moment” for ETH","In a surprising turn of events, SharpLink Gaming has revealed the acquisition of an astounding 176,271 Ethereum (ETH) , worth around $463 million. The announcement, which came just hours after the company’s stock crashed 66% during pre-market trading, has sent ripples through the financial and crypto communities. SharpLink stands now as one of the most significant corporate holders of ETH. Comparisons have been immediately drawn between SharpLink and MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021. Even though the earlier collapse of SharpLink’s share price was eyebrow-raising, their ETH acquisition should be taken seriously. For one thing, it adds an intriguing twist to SharpLink’s long-term strategy to transform itself into a player in the digital assets space. Observers have noted that the timing of the acquisition—in the same week that SharpLink’s stock was getting docked for perceived shortcomings—might just be an instance of management trying to shore up an under-heralded story. Or it might just be an instance, as we often see in crypto, of centralization (hi, holding 38 million ETH!) breeding a not very good idea (hi, trying to be a player in a decentralized space). A Billion-Dollar War Chest and More ETH Likely on the Way SharpLink’s move is growing even more significant when viewed in the broader context of what the company is doing. SharpLink is currently in the process of raising a $1 billion funding round. It has already deployed into Ethereum nearly half of that total. Still, with over $500 million to play with, it could shift even more capital into expanding its Ethereum holdings. The Microstrategy moment for Ethereum has finally happened. Just now, SharpLink Gaming has announced an acquisition of 176,271 ETH worth $463 million. Interestingly, SharpLink Gaming crashed today 66% in pre-market and now they have come up with an announcement. Don't forget… pic.twitter.com/DR6Hlv2EdT — Cipher X (@Cipher2X) June 13, 2025 Speculation has now begun among analysts as to whether this is just the first step in a multi-phase acquisition strategy. If Ethereum’s price rises to the $2,800-$3,000 range over the next few weeks, as many bullish traders anticipate, it could well validate SharpLink’s gamble and maybe even kick off a broader trend among mid-cap tech companies to look for alternative reserve assets. SharpLink’s somewhat less publicized ETH play still has the potential to set off a second wave of institutional crypto accumulation. SharpLink might be too small a player in the Ethereum space for its investment to truly impact the trajectory of institutions accumulating ETH, but if it were to somehow wind up with either an obscene amount of ETH or some Ethereum-based technology, it could potentially affect the accumulation curve. This development also raises questions about SharpLink’s long-term intentions. Is the company pivoting toward a become Ethereum-centric financial entity, or is this simply a high-risk, high-reward treasury strategy to recover from market realities? As of now, the firm hasn’t put any bigger plans on the table, but its ETH buying spree suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum’s viability as a future fine tech. A Turning Point for Corporate Crypto Strategy? SharpLink’s shift might signal a fresh new look at an overarching crypto strategy among corporates—one that stretches beyond Bitcoin. Up until now, Bitcoin has largely dominated institutional treasuries, thanks to its perceived “digital gold” status and its first-mover advantage. But now, Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and emerging “Web3” technologies have more and more institutions looking its way. Following SharpLink’s buy-in, if Ethereum’s price were to appreciate considerably, other companies might start seeing ETH as more than just an asset for speculation, but rather as a serious component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. This could have some pretty earth-shattering effects on Ethereum—more corporate procurement, for one thing, makes ETH less available and more desirable, and that can take price appreciation not just to new highs but also into the next bull cycle. The speculation has already started in the market over which companies might follow the lead of SharpLink. Prospective candidates range from tech startups with loaded balance sheets to gaming firms, to fintechs. The door has now been opened for Ethereum to play a much larger and more impactful role in corporate finance strategies. Similarly to MicroStrategy’s experience with Bitcoin, SharpLink’s Ethereum investment will ultimately play out based on three factors: execution, timing, and market conditions. But one thing is certain: the game has changed, and Ethereum just had its “MicroStrategy moment.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $106,203.76 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 104,912.71330667 -0.02% Market cap $ 2,085,454,915,109.96 Circulating Supply 19,878,000.00 Trading Volume $ 47,442,184,593.8184 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2, especially in April and May 2025. Bitcoin saw a strong and steady rally, driven by easing trade war tensions, pushing the price to a new all-time high of $ 112 K. Now, the question remains, Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June?. In early June, BTC is trying to hold support near the previous swing low of May after pulling back from its peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks sparked a short-term bounce from the 50-day EMA’s dynamic support. But on June 10th, momentum was halted, linked directly to rising geopolitical tensions, especially between Israel and Iran . However, Bitcoin is still facing resistance from a multi-month supply block, and is once again inching towards support near the previous swing low of May. if bearish pressure increases, the swing support zone becomes critical. A breakdown below this level could drag the price down to the $100K–$95K range in the near term. On the flip side, if it reverses from the swing support zone and manages to break June’s swing high, then the odds of clearing $112K are possible, and above this level, a certain strong momentum could take BTC price to a new high towards $120K by the end of June. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-06-14T07:52:33,"Ethereum ETFs See Surging Demand as Inflows Hit Five Times the Weekly Average","Demand for Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is on the rise, and this may be a watershed moment for the largest altcoin to gain institutional adoption. Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of 154,000 ETH over the past week, which is five times their previous weekly average. If investors—including institutions—were not paying attention to Ethereum before now, they certainly are now. $ETH spot ETFs are heating up. This week alone, they’ve seen 154K #ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average. For context: the biggest single-day $ETH inflow this month was 77K #ETH on June 11th. pic.twitter.com/8Xlerbc6GX — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 The standout moment was June 11, the day on which ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of ETH for the month, with 77,000 ETH poured in. Not only was the scale of the figure quite notable, but it also suggested something interesting: A rebalancing in the ETF world between Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the longest time, Bitcoin has been the ETF darling, with inflows flowing to the tune of tens of thousands of BTC. But suddenly, it looks like Ethereum has caught up quite nicely. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have not seen nearly the same level of reception. This week’s total of 7,800 BTC inflows—while somewhat above average—pales in comparison to the peak we saw in May, when daily inflows reached as high as 7,900 BTC on May 23. Though Bitcoin reigns as the dominant asset in the world of crypto investments, Ethereum’s recent performance hints at rising interest in its broader ecosystem and long-term utility. Ethereum Futures Open Interest Tops $20 Billion In a further show of strength for Ethereum, cash-margined ETH futures open interest hit a record high this week, sailing past 20 billion dollars. This development indicates an upsurge in not-so-subtle trading activity, and an uptick in trading that Ethereum is a Thriving market for futures and options trading that the platform Ethereum is a park for possibilities that is often seen as a precursor to the implementation of the shift to Ethereum 2.0. Open interest is rising, and that signals the traders are gearing up for future moves. More and more, those moves don’t seem to involve direct ownership of ether, and in fact, traders appear to be perfectly content gaining exposure via stablecoins and other collateralized forms of banking. This aligns with another trend: the rise of derivatives in crypto trading. These are becoming a key short-term market driver. The increase in leverage does not seem to be an isolated or speculative occurrence. The concurrent upsurge in ETF inflows indicates that both institutional investors in the Ethereum spot market and traders in the futures market who are using leverage have a high level of confidence in Ethereum’s performance in the near term. Bitcoin Maintains Stability But Loses the Spotlight Despite Ethereum’s explosion of activity, Bitcoin ETFs continue to perform, if not steadily, then without much drama. This week, the ETFs reported inflows of 7,800 BTC, which is just an eyebrow-raising number without the context of what it means. The context is that these inflows are pretty much the same as what we saw last week and the week before that, at least in terms of not having any kind of noticeable increases or decreases. $ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high – topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/XP3KmhkdJ1 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 12, 2025 Certainly, Ethereum ETF potential chatter is way more exciting than anything directly linked to Bitcoin, but that doesn’t mean Bitcoin ETFs aren’t doing their own exciting things, at least in a sense that it’s almost as if they’re functioning like a stablecoin at this point. Bitcoin still commands the lion’s share of attention among traditional financial players, not surprisingly because it is the original and, by far, the most recognized cryptocurrency. That said, Ethereum’s wider and more dynamic range of use cases—something that spans decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and infrastructure for layer-2 solutions—seems to be grabbing the notice of institutions that are looking for an even broader base of exposure to blockchain applications. Inflow data may also show a difference between ETH and BTC because of the larger market cycles and portfolio strategies—part of the natural evolution of an investable asset. Bitcoin, having already undergone a significant rotation of capital earlier this year post-ETF approval, was already benefitting from a more apparent positioning by institutional investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum is apparently only starting to see this same effect and benefit. Conclusion: A New Phase for Ethereum on Wall Street The sharp increase in inflows into ETH ETFs, together with inflows into futures that are setting all-time records, indicates that Ethereum is generating interest among a diverse array of investors. Whether these investors want longer-term exposure via a spot ETF or to express a directional view using high-leverage futures contracts, Ethereum is emerging as a go-to asset for many. Although Bitcoin is still the foundation for getting exposure to the world of cryptocurrencies, it is becoming increasingly clear that Ethereum is the true value proposition. Institutional investors now understand that Ethereum is not simply a representative alternative to Bitcoin. This is partly because the regulatory situation for cryptocurrencies has improved, and products like Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have matured. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-14T07:38:57,"Charles Hoskinson Proposes $100M ADA Treasury Shift to Boost Cardano DeFi","The post Charles Hoskinson Proposes $100M ADA Treasury Shift to Boost Cardano DeFi appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent YouTube video, Charles Hoskinson shared a major update on Cardano’s financial direction. He proposed using $100 million worth of ADA to strengthen stablecoin liquidity and bring Bitcoin into the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Low Stablecoin Liquidity Holds Cardano Back He started off by pointing out that Cardano does not have enough stablecoin liquidity. There is only about $33 million in stablecoins supporting over $330 million in total value locked (TVL). In comparison, Ethereum and Solana have way more stablecoin support, and Cardano is falling behind. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 Hoskinson Proposes Bold Move- To fix this, Hoskinson is proposing a bold move: take 5–10% of the $1.2 billion Cardano treasury and convert it into a mix of native stablecoins like USDA, USDM, iUSD, and even some Bitcoin to help start Bitcoin-based DeFi on Cardano. The goal here is to generate yield from these assets like a sovereign wealth fund (like Norway or Abu Dhabi) and reinvest the profits back into ADA. This move could boost yields, improve liquidity, and speed up stablecoin adoption on Cardano. It may also help native stablecoins get listed on more exchanges and position Cardano as a strong player in the DeFi space. Will This Hurt ADA? Hoskinson believes that the $100 million move will not hurt ADA’s price. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands daily without visibly affecting the cryptocurrency’s price,” he said. He says that the market is strong and liquid enough to handle it, especially if done gradually using time-weighted average price algorithms and OTC trades. Governance in Progress Cardano is still figuring out how to handle governance. Charles wants the treasury fund plan ready for discussion at the Rare Evo Conference in August. He has already written a 40-page document outlining the idea and shared it with internal teams. Further, the team will gather feedback from Cardano’s DeFi projects and prepare a full proposal, possibly by the conference. Cardano Aims for Cross-Chain Growth and $1B Treasury Hoskinson says Cardano’s treasury will eventually become multi-asset. As more chains connect to Cardano, their fees could also flow into the treasury, building a large, diverse portfolio to support cross-chain growth. If the strategy works out, it could be a game-changer for Cardano. Stablecoin liquidity could rise to 33–40% of TVL, making the ecosystem much healthier. The treasury could grow to over $1 billion in stablecoins and Bitcoin. Cardano’s DeFi could become much more competitive on the global stage.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/charles-hoskinson-proposes-100m-ada-treasury-shift-to-boost-cardano-defi/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Following last week’s market recovery from a correctional phase, which was majorly triggered by Bitcoin’s bounce, several altcoins with Aero regained strength and posted notable gains after 7 days of buying. Unfortunately, the buying cooled off due to a new sell order days back. That caused a serious reduction in the past days, and the market is now bleeding out again, following a negative sentiment. The bleeding came as a result of Bitcoin’s drops, and as we can see, it has shown no signs of stopping yet. However, altcoin like Aero defies the odds and is now posting gains on the day. It currently appears strong and shows signs of bullishness on the daily chart with a higher high and higher low pattern in the past months. The latest bullish signal is supported by the $0.47 level. If it continues to play out, we can expect a major increase in the coming days. Surpassing the previous high should validate a big price movement in the future. Inversely, if Aero fails to advance higher, a dip below last week’s low could trigger a fresh breakdown to the yearly low before deciding where to head next. For now, the market is still in favour of the bulls. AERO’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The immediate resistance level for buying right now is $0.8. If Aero breaks above it, the next line of resistance would be $1, along with the $1.5 resistance level. There’s room for a pullback at $0.56. If the price drops below the $0.47 support level, the next support to keep in mind would be $0.375.

2025-06-14T07:23:13,"Bitcoin’s Price Could Plunge Below $80K Amid Rising Tension and Large Holder Sell-Offs: Analyst Warns","It has been over two months since BTC’s price struggles that pushed it south hard, and the asset plummeted to under $75,000. This enhanced selling pressure transpired during the darkest hours of the global trade war started by US President Donald Trump. Although that political tension has improved a lot since then, with the US striking deals with many countries, including its main rival, China , there’s more uncertainty that has blown off in the past few days. This time, it’s a lot more harmful and has already taken many lives. Operation Rising Lion, launched by Israel on June 13, targeted more than 100 strategic military and nuclear sites in Iran, including facilities in Natanz and Fordow. The most recent reports suggest that the number of killed is nearing 100, which includes senior commanders and scientists, while the injured list is well above 300. Iran responded with Operation Vow of Truth 3, firing countless waves of missiles last night at central Israel, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and some targets north. The reported casualties are at least three, while dozens have been injured. While Israel and US President Trump categorized the initial strike as “ preemptive ,” aiming to disrupt Iran’s nuclear progress as the country refuses to sign such a deal, Tehran described its retaliation as defending its sovereignty against direct aggression. Impact on Bitcoin As it happened during the trade war, BTC’s price reacted immediately yesterday to Israel’s attack. In a matter of hours, it plunged from a daily peak of $108,500 to under $103,000. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $105,000, and it hasn’t been significantly influenced by Iran’s response. However, uncertainty persists, and the situation could escalate, potentially leading to further trouble. As such, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that bitcoin needs to stay within a six-digit price territory; otherwise, it risks plummeting back to under $80,000. #Bitcoin $BTC needs to hold above $100,000 to stay on track for a breakout from this channel.

As reported earlier this week, some of the long-term BTC investors had started to dispose of small portions of their holdings, but that was even before the attacks occurred. Martinez noted after the first strike that some of the largest BTC whales—those with more than 1,000 bitcoins—have begun “trimming” their positions. If these sell-offs continue or intensify, they will not only increase the selling pressure on BTC but can also be mimicked by smaller investors.

Buffett, who plans on ending his legendary 60 year tenure at the end of 2025, has placed more than 70% of the firm’s assets into just seven stocks. The stocks reflect Buffett’s time-tested method of handpicking assets for their resilience and consumer appeal – while Berkshire continues to hoard a staggering $347.7 billion in cash. Here’s a look at where the Oracle of Omaha is placing his bets before the curtains on his legendary career close. • Apple ($58.9 billion allocated): Apple remains Berkshire’s top holding, although Buffett has sold more than half of the firm’s stake in the tech giant since 2023. • American Express ($43.6 billion allocated): A bet on the financial giant’s premium customer base and payment network. • Coca-Cola ($28.4 billion allocated): A longtime Buffett favorite with global brand recognition and consistent dividends. • Bank of America ($27.8 billion allocated): A top holding despite Buffett significantly trimming his stake and reducing bank investments overall. • Chevron ($17.3 billion allocated): An energy giant offering strong dividends, aligning with Buffett’s love for reliable cash flows. • Occidental Petroleum ($12.3 billion allocated): Buffett’s longstanding bet on energy continues with this oil and gas leader. • Kraft Heinz ($8.4 billion allocated): Another consumer goods giant and longtime Buffett favorite. Buffett has selected Greg Abel to be his successor next year, entrusting him to continue Berkshire’s legacy of prudent investing and long-term value creation.

2025-06-14T07:00:48,"Bitcoin To See ‘Choppy’ Next Few Weeks, Will BTC Retest The Range Lows?","After hitting a one-week low on Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim the key $104,000-$105,000 area as support, but some analysts have warned that a visit to its range’s lows could be in BTC’s short-term future if volatility continues. Related Reading: ONDO To Repeat 2024’s ‘Parabolic’ Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon Bitcoin to Continue Choppy Performance On Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin dropped 5.5% to the $102,000 support fueled by the news of the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid the market pullback, the flagship crypto failed to hold its $108,000-$110,000 three-day range, falling to the mid-zone of its post-November breakout range. Notably, BTC had just recovered from last week’s retest of the $100,000 level, reclaiming the key $106,800 area as support earlier this week. Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency “saw a clear trigger on that retest of the range high,” driven by the headlines of the Middle East turmoil, as it is “still quite a volatile and headline-driven market currently.” Bitcoin took the liquidity above and below its local price range, the analyst explained, adding that it is “already starting to trade more like the choppy (pre) summer environment” he had forecasted. Despite the drop, the analyst highlighted that the range high remains the key level for a larger move up: I think the range high is a key area for the Bulls to hold on to. If not, I think there’s a case to be made for a local high to be put in and for the market to move back further within this range. At this point, I’m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possibly beyond). However, he suggested investors be cautious until BTC price breaks back above the range high convincingly and holds it as support on the higher timeframes. “Don’t chop yourself up in the next few weeks/months,” he warned. Volatility Could Send BTC To Range Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on BTC’s 4H chart, noting that if the price didn’t bounce from the previous descending resistance, reclaimed a week ago, it could further drop into the mid-zone of its range. According to the analysis, if it loses the mid-range, BTC could risk a retest of the range lows, around the $90,000-$92,000 area. Similarly, market watcher Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin could fill the lower CME gaps if the war narrative intensifies. BTC opened two CME gaps between the end of April and the start of May, situated at the $92,500 and $97,300 levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the trader considers that this could serve as a discount entry for investors, as BTC “already left higher CME gaps open,” signaling that a rebound to the levels is likely. Moreover, he noted that Bitcoin is displaying the same structure as last year, which could hint at a massive rally brewing. In 2024, the cryptocurrency faced rejection from a multi-month descending resistance following its all-time high (ATH) rally, which set the Range high level. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead? According to the post, after the liquidity grab, BTC broke out of the key downtrend line, was rejected from the range high, and retested the descending resistance as support before a new rally. In 2025, Bitcoin appears to be following this path, currently retesting the descending resistance after the breakout. “If you know the pattern, you know what comes next,” he concluded.

2025-06-14T06:59:15,"Are Cardano Whales Dumping ADA Due to Charles Hoskinson’s Latest Proposal?","TL;DR Cardano whales have changed their behavior toward the asset by starting to dispose of massive ADA quantities. The asset’s price experienced some notable volatility as of late, not just because of the ongoing geopolitical tension but also due to Hoskinson’s latest proposal. Whales Sell CryptoPotato reported at the start of the business week that large ADA holders, those with investments of somewhere between 100 million and a billion tokens, have continued to accumulate. In the span of just 48 hours, they expanded their holdings by 120 million ADA. However, they seem to have changed their attitude once again since then. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez informed that these large entities have disposed of more than 270 million ADA in just a week. In terms of USD value, this stash is worth over $170 million. Whales have sold over 270 million #Cardano $ADA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/SKd94mj99J — Ali (@ali_charts) June 13, 2025 Such big sell-offs increase the selling pressure of the underlying asset and are typically followed by smaller investors doing the same. ADA’s price felt the consequences in the past few days as it plunged from $0.71 to under $0.62 before it recovered some ground to the current $0.636. Some analysts warned that ADA could drop further to around $0.5 if it doesn’t invalidate a head and shoulders pattern that it’s currently breaking down. While the most evident reason behind this price crash could be related to the escalating geopolitical tension between Iran, Israel, and the US, there’s another possibility that involves more internal changes. ADA for BTC? Charles Hoskinson, the brain behind the Cardano ecosystem, proposed earlier this week that the treasury should exchange $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the network’s DeFi capabilities. The responses were mixed, with some praising the move, while others warned that it could increase the selling pressure on ADA even more. However, Hoskinson was quick to refute these rumors, indicating that there’s enough OTC demand from institutions for ADA to cover any potential pressure. “The belief that Cardano DeFi is improving will offset the sale volume of ADA from a modest divestment (and yes, this is modest.)” This is the madness of trying to do anything with the treasury. People who have never traded large amounts of Ada presume that any trade will result in catastrophic harm to the price, using ChatGPT as the source for their claims.

According to an SEC filing dated June 13, the agency “declared effective” TMTG’s Form S-3 registration statement, which the company filed on June 6. This form allows U.S. corporations to register a variety of securities, including stocks, options and different debt instruments. On the same day, TMTG also filed its final prospectus with the SEC. As outlined in the filing, TMTG registered the resale of roughly 56 million shares, along with another 29 million shares tied to convertible notes. These debt and equity agreements involved about 50 investors and generated the full $2.3 billion that the company plans to hold in Bitcoin. The registration statement also establishes a universal shelf, giving TMTG added flexibility to raise funds or issue securities in the future. Despite this, the firm has stated it has “no immediate plans” to sell any securities under the shelf. Chief Executive and President Devin Nunes commented on the filing, saying, “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities.” He further added, “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” TMTG’s stock dipped on the same trading day On the same trading day, TMTG’s shares dipped 2.06 percent, closing at $19.52, according to Google Finance data . Stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. Source: Google Finance This move follows TMTG’s May 27 announcement that it had raised $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, a deal the company had initially denied in earlier reports. Nunes described Bitcoin a financial freedom instrument at that time, adding that Trump Media would keep the cryptocurrency as a key asset. He said, “Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Beyond its treasury holdings, TMTG is also pursuing a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain analytics firm Arkham noted in a May 28 post on X that “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” Later on June 5, TMTG filed the launch of a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC, stating, “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of Bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust.

2025-06-14T05:30:39,"Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls","Data shows the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen weekly inflows five times the recent average, while Bitcoin has seen a slowdown in momentum. Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The “spot ETFs” refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset. This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can ‘invest’ into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin’s version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum’s in mid-2024. Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter’s spot ETFs have looked during the past month. From the graph, it’s visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors. “This week alone, they’ve seen 154K ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average,” notes Glassnode. “For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.” While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn’t been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs. This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed. ETH Price While Ethereum has been seeing consistent ETF inflows, its price has still underperformed against Bitcoin over the past day as it has dropped to $2,540, a decline of 7% compared to BTC’s 2% loss.

2025-06-14T05:15:21,"EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses","The post EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Europe rolls out its new MiCA rules , major crypto companies are lining up to get licensed and operate across the EU. But some regulators are worried that things are moving too fast. According to Reuters , Gemini, the crypto platform founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is about to receive a license in Malta, the EU’s smallest country. This would give them the green light to operate across all 27 member states. This comes shortly after Malta approved licenses for OKX and Crypto.com, just weeks after MiCA came into effect. Malta’s Fast-Track Approvals Face Scrutiny Malta’s fast approvals are raising eyebrows among EU regulators, especially under the watch of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s AMF has warned that weak oversight could lead to a “race to the bottom.” One official even raised concerns over whether countries with smaller regulatory teams, like Malta, can provide adequate oversight. ESMA is now reviewing Malta’s process and is expected to release a report soon. In response, Malta’s regulator said that it has issued four licenses so far, and credited its speed to its past experience and the “in-depth understanding acquired over the years.” Malta’s regulator said it follows strict anti-money laundering rules. OKX also called the process rigorous and said that compliance is a top priority. Coinbase Eyes Luxembourg License Elsewhere, Luxembourg is soon expected to approve a license for Coinbase, the first U.S. crypto firm in the S&P 500. While its team there may be small, Coinbase has 200 staff in Europe, and it plans to hire 20 more in Luxembourg by the end of the year. Luxembourg pushed back on claims that it is being too lenient on crypto. It suggested that other countries might just be trying to win over crypto firms. Notably, Coinbase’s move is seen as a setback for Ireland, whose central bank once compared crypto to a Ponzi scheme. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal , EU Split on MiCA Enforcement At the centre of the issue is keeping the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market in check. MiCA is designed to bring crypto under the same regulatory standards as traditional finance, but if countries apply the rules differently, it could weaken MiCA’s overall impact. Countries are still divided in the EU over how to enforce crypto rules. There are ongoing talks about giving more power to ESMA. ESMA’s chief Verena Ross wants stronger oversight, but some countries are hesitant to increase their authority. How these early licenses are handled will likely set the tone for how the EU balances crypto growth and investor protection going forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It reveals that Trump earned over $57 million from World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm linked to his family, and holds a huge amount of WLFI tokens. The report also lists several other sources of income, showing just how much Trump is profiting across various ventures. Here’s a breakdown of the key earnings. Trump’s Stronghold In Crypto The disclosure , made public by the Office of Government Ethics, revealed that Trump earned $57.35 million from selling tokens linked to his family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens, making this one of his biggest income sources so far. Apart from this, last week Forbes reported that Donald Trump’s net worth has climbed to $5.6 billion. Interestingly, nearly half of his liquid assets are now tied to crypto. In less than a year, Trump has made over $1.2 billion from crypto-related ventures alone. Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise. All of it makes the president money, but how much? (Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 — Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 Interestingly, Trump’s involvement here shows a change in attitude. He was once critical of digital currencies, but now seems to be embracing them, especially when the profits are this high. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media Gets SEC Nod for Bitcoin Treasury Filing: What Next? , Big Profits Beyond Crypto Apart from crypto, Trump continues to make millions from his well-known real estate empire. His Florida properties—including Mar-a-Lago, Doral, and Jupiter—brought in over $217 million. He also cashed in on his brand name. The disclosure shows: $3 million from a coffee table book. $2.8 million from Trump watches. $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances. $1.15 million from NFT licensing and royalties. $1 million from collectible guitars. Add to that another $700,000+ from speaking gigs—and it’s clear Trump’s income streams remain diverse and many more. Debts and Legal Troubles Still Loom The filing also lists over $100 million in unpaid real estate loans. Trump is still battling several legal cases, including the $454 million civil fraud judgment and $88 million defamation payout, though both are currently paused due to appeals. Despite these liabilities, Trump’s crypto earnings stand out. They show that even traditional political figures are now diving into digital assets, and walking away with millions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
