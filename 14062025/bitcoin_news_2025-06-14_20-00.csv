The class action lawsuit accused the retail giant of breaking the federal Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) by handing sensitive information over to Facebook. Specifically, GameStop is accused of using a Facebook tracking pixel on its website that quietly and automatically sent customers’ personal information, including video game purchase details, to Facebook without consent. The $4.5 million settlement applies to people who purchased a game from the company’s online store from August 18th, 2020 through April 17th, 2025. At the time of the purchase, eligible customers must have been members of Facebook and maintained a public Facebook profile using their actual name. The settlement website to file a claim is here . The exact number of people affected by the settlement is unclear, and affected customers are set to receive up to $5 cash or a $10 voucher – suggesting hundreds of thousands may be eligible. GameStop has not admitted any wrongdoing in the settlement, and the company has pledged to permanently remove the tracking pixel to prevent future unauthorized data sharing.

2025-06-14T17:32:00,"Trump Reports $57M Crypto Windfall as Ethics Concerns Mount","Trump Reveals $57M Crypto Windfall through World Liberty Financial U.S. President Donald Trump has disclosed $57.4 million in revenue from World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm invested in by his sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump. The revelation came through a detailed financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which was viewed by the Financial Times. The 200-page report identifies World Liberty Financial as one of Trump’s most significant sources of income, with the president holding 15.75 billion governance tokens. Rather than purchasing the tokens, Trump received them as part of promotional activities related to the platform. Token Holdings Raise Conflict-of-Interest Concerns The report also details Trump’s transactions with other crypto-related companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, although these companies reported minimal income. While swearing that the filing’s contents are “true, complete, and correct,” ethical concerns have been raised by critics. Trump removed David Huitema, head of the Office of Government Ethics, from office earlier this year, which raised further controversy over his crypto dealings. The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, has eased enforcement actions against crypto firms — a move some say directly benefits Trump’s online venture. World Liberty Financial: $1B Raised, A-List Backers World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform, conducted a token offering last year that raised $1 billion through the sale of 21 billion tokens. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “promoter” for the project, 2024 SEC filings show. Criticisms from both sides of the aisle have been raised over whether Trump’s ongoing profit from crypto investments presents a conflict of interest, especially when creating policy impacting the industry. DRW Investments Shores Up Trump’s Digital Dreams Major financial backing has come from DRW Investments, led by Chicago trader Don Wilson. DRW invested $100 million in Trump Media just weeks after its affiliate Cumberland received SEC enforcement relief from the new administration. This support enables Trump Media’s plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury strategy and the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investigations Underway Representative Jamie Raskin has launched a congressional probe into a private dinner Trump hosted for anchor investors in his meme coin, adding pressure on an already controversial crypto portfolio.

2025-06-14T17:30:05,"XRP Price Prediction: Why XRP’s Realized Capital Surge Outperforms Solana’s Price Action","XRP has taken the lead over Solana in realized capital growth, indicating renewed investor confidence. According to Glassnode , XRP’s 30-day percentage change in realized cap—a metric that measures the total value of coins moved at their last price—has jumped +4.2%. Solana has only seen +1% growth over the same period. $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 This divergence means capital is rotating into XRP faster than Solana, implying short-term accumulation by traders who are positioning for a breakout. Realized cap is especially useful during times of uncertainty, as it shows wealth that has actually moved on-chain rather than speculative market value. A higher realized cap growth often correlates with more network activity and investor confidence. For context: XRP 30D Realized Cap: +4.2% SOL 30D Realized Cap: +1% The big jump in XRP’s realized capital could be seen as a sign of shifting sentiment among retail and institutional traders alike, possibly ahead of regulatory clarity or broader crypto market momentum. XRP Technical Analysis Says Be Cautious Despite the on-chain strength, XRP’s chart is still cautionary. It’s trading at $2.13, down 0.70% in the last 24 hours and stuck below a descending trendline that has rejected every bullish attempt since early June. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Price action failed to reclaim the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart (now at $2.19), and XRP has printed a lower high. Red-bodied candles with rejection wicks at $2.18 show continued resistance. The MACD has a slight bullish crossover, but the histogram is fading, so not much momentum for now. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $2.18, $2.22 Support: $2.09, $2.0474, $2.0042 EMA Barrier: 50-EMA at $2.19 XRP price prediction remains bearish unless XRP breaks above the descending trendline and confirms strength above $2.22; traders may continue to see downside pressure. XRP Trade Setups to Watch As XRP consolidates under resistance, traders have clearly defined levels to monitor for both bullish and bearish strategies. Short Trade Idea: Entry: Rejection near $2.18 Stop: Above $2.22 Targets: $2.0936, $2.0474 Long Trade Setup: Entry: Breakout and close above $2.22 Stop: Below $2.18 Targets: $2.27, $2.3365 For now, the fundamentals suggest investor interest is heating up, but price must follow through with a clean breakout to confirm the next leg higher. Until then, XRP remains at a technical crossroads.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to $105,300, up by 2.4% from its lowest point on Friday, and 5% above this month’s lowest point. SoSoValue data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $301 million on Friday, even as Bitcoin’s price dropped to nearly $100,000. This pushed total weekly ETF inflows to $1.3 billion—a sharp reversal from the previous week’s $128 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF, whose ticker symbol is IBIT, had daily inflows of $238 million on Friday, bringing its cumulative figure to $49.7 billion. It now has $70 billion in assets, making it the fastest-growing ETF in finance. You might also like: AVAX price down 9.75% on geopolitical tensions, but technicals saw it coming The SPDR Gold Trust, which was launched in 2004, has accumulated $103 billion in assets. This means that IBIT may flip the biggest gold ETF in the next few months or in 2026 if the trend continues. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF has had over $11 billion in inflows, while Bitwise’s BITB has had $2 billion since inception. A possible reason why Wall Street investors bought Bitcoin’s dip is that it maintains strong fundamentals. BlackRock’s data shows that Bitcoin beats the stock market after a major geopolitical event such as the Iran and Israel attacks . Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has plunged from 1.5 million in January to 1.1 million today. Falling Bitcoin supplies at a time of falling supplies will likely boost the price in the long term.

This chart shows that Bitcoin formed a rounded bottom between Dec. 17 and March 2021. Since November 2021, Bitcoin has been forming another rounded bottom. The price remains slightly below the ascending trendline connecting the upper side of these rounded bottoms. Therefore, the coin may be about to exit an eight-year trendline, which could push it much higher in the long term.

The Brazilian government, which currently presides over the alliance, announced on Friday that Vietnam would join BRICS as a “partner country.” Partner countries, a category the bloc established last year, aren’t full-fledged members but are invited to participate in the BRICS summit and can endorse the alliance’s declarations. Vietnam is the 10th partner country, joining Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan. BRICS held its initial summit in 2009 was originally just called BRIC, which stood for its four founding members: Brazil, Russia, India and China. The acronym changed to BRICS after South Africa joined the following year. In 2024, it expanded membership to other nations, including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia joined in early 2025. Brazil also claims that Saudi Arabia is part of the bloc, but the Middle Eastern country has reportedly eschewed formal membership in the intercontinental economic alliance to avoid antagonizing the US. Brazil says current BRICS priorities include “facilitating economic transactions between bloc countries, such as the use of local currencies; the development of international payment platforms; cooperation in government procurement; and the promotion of trade facilitation measures, among others.” In 2023, the alliance reportedly began working on creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets to circumvent reliance on the US dollar, though officials from several of the bloc’s member countries claimed in early 2025 that they weren’t pushing for de-dollarization.

2025-06-14T16:48:33,"U.S. Treasury Quietly Pours $20,000,000,000 Into Record-Breaking Bond Buyback Operation – Is Stealth QE Underway?","The U.S. Treasury Department has now poured $20 billion into a major Treasury buyback operation in the span of two weeks. The Treasury’s June 3rd and June 10th buybacks , which are historic in size, allow the agency to repurchase securities maturing between May and July of this year. The move has triggered social media speculation that a stealth quantitative easing operation is now underway, with the Treasury mimicking the Federal Reserve’s money-printing tactics to stimulate the economy. Skeptics argue that by repurchasing illiquid bonds with borrowed funds, the Treasury is subtly propping up the bond market to maintain confidence in an overextended system. But Bianco Research’s Jim Bianco says claims that the Treasury’s moves are a form of quiet QE are way off the mark. “Everyone is calling Treasury buybacks “stealth QE.” They misunderstand. This is the Treasury, not the Fed… The Treasury cannot “print.” The Treasury borrows new more liquid “on-the-run” bonds and uses the proceeds to buyback old illiquid “off-the-run” bonds. Buybacks do not “create money,” rather they improve the overall quality of the bond market. Buybacks support the bond market in that they make it more liquid so it reduces the (lack of) liquidity premium. But that’s only a few basis points.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently touted the agency’s “big toolkit” to support the bond market if needed, citing buybacks as a strategic option to enhance liquidity and stabilize conditions.

Our Manta price forecast expects Manta price to surge to a maximum level of $3.6 in 2025. In 2030, Manta price prediction expects Manta price to record a maximum level of $22.28. Launched in September 2023, Manta Network gained significant attention within the cryptocurrency community after its token generation event, leading to trending status on major coin aggregators and news outlets. Beyond the initial buzz, Manta Network presents innovative technology through a modular zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup for Ethereum , featuring Solidity smart contracts and a decentralized identity layer one network focusing on compliance.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume dropped to $1.8 million, showing a decline in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.214, surging by over 5.8% in the last 24 hours. Manta price chart The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but hovers around 39, showing that bears are still controlling the momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. However, buyers aim for a surge by sending the price above the EMA20 trend line. MANTA price chart The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.261, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.321. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.194, resulting in a correction to $0.159. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.2. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction June 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In June, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.37. The average price is expected to be around $0.25. Manta Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Manta Price Prediction June 2025 $0.17 $0.25 $0.37 Manta price prediction 2025 Due to the impact of Bitcoin’s halving, Bitcoin and leading altcoins could reach new highs in 2025.

2025-06-14T16:05:29,"VanEck Exec Calls Out Small-Cap Firms Over Crypto Investment Claims","Matthew Sigel, a digital asset expert at VanEck, has recently voiced concerns about a rising trend among small-cap companies. These firms are announcing plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP. However, many have weak financial positions and extremely low market values. According to Sigel, these announcements are not genuine business strategies but appear to be efforts to boost stock prices through misleading information. VanEck Exec Spotlight Crypto Treasury Anomaly Several companies with market capitalizations under $100 million have made bold claims about buying large amounts of digital currencies. Some of these companies have promised to invest between $300 million and $800 million in crypto, even though their total value is much lower. These claims have sparked doubts among analysts and investors. Sigel highlighted Trident Digital Tech as an example. Recently, the company, valued at just $16 million, announced plans to raise $500 million to acquire XRP . The gap between its value and stated goal has caused many to question whether the announcement is possible. Sigel Likened Crypto Treasuries Plans To a Pump and Dump Scheme The VanEck Executive points out several warning signs. Most companies making these bold claims have no known track record in the crypto industry. They usually lack the funding needed to carry out such large investments. In many cases, these announcements come when the crypto market is rising. Segel suggests they are timed to take advantage of investor excitement. He warned that these patterns match the behavior seen in pump-and-dump schemes. President Trump was accused of this tactic in January. In this scheme, insiders push up stock prices with exaggerated news and then sell their shares for a profit. This leaves regular investors with overvalued stock and heavy losses. A Broader Industry Trend The problem is not limited to one or two companies. Addentax Group, a Chinese clothing company worth only a few million dollars, said it plans to buy $800 million worth of Bitcoin and TRUMP tokens. Likewise, DeFi Development Corp announced it would sell $5 billion in shares to purchase Solana . After the announcement, its market cap jumped from $7 million to $379 million, demonstrating how such statements can instantly influence investor behavior. Other companies, including Classover Holdings and Webus International, have made similar promises. Each claimed it would raise hundreds of millions to buy digital assets despite their total value of less than $100 million. Industry analysts are warning investors not to take such announcements at face value. Investors are advised to examine the company’s financial reports and ability to raise funds before making any investment decisions.

2025-06-14T16:00:21,"Here’s Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price Crashed Over 10%","The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices have recorded significant losses this week, sparking a bearish sentiment towards the top meme coins. This price crash has come amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price Crashed CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices have recorded significant losses over the last seven days. The price decline largely occurred on June 13 following Israel’s attack on Iran, which again escalated tensions in the Middle East. This development immediately sparked fear across the markets, sending the top meme coins spiralling. The market further took a hit on the same day with Iran’s retaliatory strikes against Israel . Since then, both countries have continued to exchange fire, with blasts heard in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. This has raised concerns that it could escalate into a full-blown war, which is bearish for the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices . Moreover, Oil prices are skyrocketing as a result of the Israel-Iran tensions, which is also bearish for the top meme coins. Rising oil prices can cause inflation to rise, which will force the US Federal Reserve to either keep interest rates steady or even raise them. This Quantitative Tightening (QT) measure restricts liquidity flow and could negatively impact the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Amid this price crash, Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s open interest has dropped by over 2% to $1.78 billion. This is bringing the meme coin close to its December 2024 lows when it crashed from its local high of $0.45. DOGE’s derivative trading volume has also crashed 37%, indicating a lack of interest in the meme coin among crypto traders. Most traders are also shorting Dogecoin at the moment, with the long-to-short ratio at 0.9. CoinGlass data also paints a bearish picture for the Shiba Inu price. SHIB’s derivatives trading volume has crashed over 38% to $173 million. The long-to-short ratio is at 0.9, indicating that most traders are shorting the meme coin. However, the open interest is up almost 1% to $142 million, which is a positive for Shiba Inu. DOGE And SHIB Could Reverse From Current Levels Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggested that Dogecoin may have bottomed at its current price level. In an X post , he stated that the meme coin reached the end of wave 4 corrective move, just before a huge move in wave 5. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally above $0.65 on this move as it eyes a new all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, crypto analyst InvestingHaven recently made a case for the Shiba Inu price . In an X post , he noted that SHIB held its ultra-strong $0.000012345 level during key time windows, which aligns with the forecasted annual lows at $0.0000133. The analyst added that the chart now shows signs of a potential W-reversal and that a successful W-reversal could send SHIB to around $0.0000666.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/why-dogecoin-and-shib-crashed/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Coinglass|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Fed|Federal Reserve|InvestingHaven|meme coin|QT|Quantitative Tightening|shib|Shiba Inu|Trader Tardigrade|W-Reversal Pattern",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T16:00:12,"Why Bitcoin Price Continues To Rise Despite Soaring Treasury Yields  — Analyst","Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has maintained a somewhat healthy momentum, forging minor swing highs and lows in its bull run revival. Interestingly, this early-week upward movement has been corrected following the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. All in all, the overall positive outlook for the premier cryptocurrency has remained, even though it has been observed to be against historical perspective. An on-chain analyst on social media platform X has delved into this strange phenomenon in the BTC market and the possible reasons behind it. Bitcoin’s Historical Correlations With Macro Instruments In a recent post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost broke down what, until recently, used to be conventional expectations in the Bitcoin market relative to broader macroeconomics. The crypto pundit mentioned that investors consider key indicators when trying to decipher what institutional sentiments and the broader state of global liquidity may be like. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts – Can Demand Hold? The key indicators investors highlighted in this analysis include the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies, and the US Treasury Yields, which basically represent the return investors earn on United States government bonds. According to Darkfost, the above chart illustrates a well-known macro principle: when both the DXY and bond yields are on the rise, capital tends to flee risk assets (one of which is Bitcoin). As a result, the premier cryptocurrency becomes susceptible to corrective movements. According to the on-chain analyst, this principle is backed by historical trends, as bear markets in crypto have coincided with strong uptrends in both yields and the DXY. On the other hand, when there is a loss of momentum in DXY and yields, investor appetite tends to shift towards risk. The reason for this, Darkfost explained, could be expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which fuel bullish sentiment across crypto markets. BTC Breaks Conventional Macro Logic In the post on X, Darkfost then went on to point out that the current BTC cycle has been unusual. The online pundit reported that there has been a decoupling between the Bitcoin price and bond yields, which manifests as a seeming annulment of the usual macro principles. The analyst noted that the Bitcoin price continues to maintain its upward movement, despite yields reaching some of their highest levels in Bitcoin’s history. But this holds, he was sure to note, when the DXY declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 What this anomaly suggests, Darkfost inferred, is that Bitcoin has taken on a new role within the macro landscape, one that increases its perception as a store of value. To take it further, this means that BTC, as of now, may react a little less conventionally to the macro forces believed to influence the crypto market. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price sits just beneath $106,000, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T15:51:24,"Derivatives Bloodbath: $1.16B Liquidated Amid Global Turmoil","The crypto universe was rocked by a brutal tidal wave of liquidations worth $1.16 billion, as short-squeeze vulnerable leveraged longs were caught off guard by a one-two punch: increased Middle East tensions and hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Bitcoin led the way lower, dropping to $103,556 — its worst one-day performance in June—while Ethereum, Solana, and the rest of the majors lagged behind in a bout of compelled selling. Where the Pain Was Worst: Exchange Breakdown Binance was hit hardest in the carnage, with $458 million in liquidations — over 91% of longs. Bybit wasn't too far behind, at $375 million worth of liquidations, close to 94% of longs. OKX and Gate each lost over $125 million, with HTX, Coinex, BitMEX, and Bitfinex finishing off the list with dozens of millions more. These were mostly losses from speculators who were betting on a continued rally — only to be surprised by the sudden geopolitical and macroeconomic storm. Bitcoin lost $446 million in long liquidations alone, with Ethereum losing $303 million. Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all experienced tens of millions of forced sells, demonstrating just how widespread and severe the pain was across the market. Why Leveraged Longs Are Still High — and Vulnerable Despite repeated warnings, the leverage hunger has not abated. BTC and ETH funding rates have remained positive, which means the traders continue to be strongly speculating on the higher side — even as volatilities have risen. This ongoing optimism provided the context for a traditional liquidation cascade: when prices fell, stop-losses and margin calls triggered a domino effect, which fueled the sell-off and closed out more positions at each major support. How Liquidation Cascades Shape the Market With so many traders on one side of the ship, a little shake will send the market into chaos. The numbers indicate that the first $20 million in liquidations arrived within an hour after the breaking news, but as selling snowballed out of control, nearly $1 billion was lost in just 12 hours. This feedback mechanism — where all liquidation induces further selling — is why crypto corrections are so brutal and why heatmap tools are now an indispensable tool for risk management. “If BTC drops to $92K, bulls could lose $8B more. Watch the heatmap.” — @CoinGlass, June 13, 2025 Heatmaps not only show where the pain was — they show where it is likely to be next. According to recent data, if BTC dips to $92,500, over $8.4 billion of long positions would be liquidated, which would be a critical ”pain point” for bulls. A breakout higher towards $121,900 would short-squeeze, which could unleash a short squeeze of nearly $14 billion. Hedging Ahead of the FOMC: What Traders Can Do Now Since the Federal Reserve's FOMC sits on June 18, volatility has hardly ceased. Historically, FOMC announcement days are marked by sharp spikes in crypto market volatility since rate decisions and forward guidance are reacted to by traders. Many individuals are now reducing exposure, contracting stops, or buying put options to hedge against further downside. Institutional desks are seeing increasing demand for downside protection, with traders targeting deep out-of-the-money puts as insurance against another liquidation cascade. The broader macro environment — rising inflation, geopolitical tension, and uncertainty regarding the Fed's policy — makes risk management more critical than ever before. Traders need to watch the funding rates, heatmaps, and the all-important support levels, and stay alert for the sentiment shifts as the Fed announcement approaches. The Bottom Line The $1.16 billion liquidation event is a testament to the dangers of a highly levered, sentiment-driven market. As war news and inflation reads collide with packed derivatives bets, only the ones that manage risk and watch the heatmaps will make it through the next leg. With the FOMC lined up, expect more fireworks—and remember: in crypto, the only thing certain is volatility.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9570/derivatives-bloodbath-1-16-b-liquidated-amid-global-turmoil,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Previously, individuals selling up to R$35,000 (around $6,300) worth of crypto per month were exempt from taxation. Before the change, gains above that were taxed progressively, reaching as high as 22.5% for volumes over $5.4 million. The new rule replaces this system with a flat tax, meaning smaller investors will face higher tax burdens while large holders may see their bills shrink, local news outlet Portal do Bitcoin reports. The tax will apply regardless of where the assets are held, including in overseas exchanges or self-custodial wallets. Losses can be offset, but only within a rolling five-quarter window, a rule that will become stricter starting in 2026. The government says the overhaul is aimed at boosting tax revenue after walking back a proposed hike to the IOF financial transaction tax, which had drawn industry and congressional criticism.

2025-06-14T15:38:28,"Once XRP Breaks Through This Red Zone, Analyst Says It Will Rip to the Upside","XRP may be poised for a major move , not in isolation, but in how it performs against Bitcoin. According to crypto analyst Xoom, a key resistance level on the XRP/BTC chart, dubbed the “red zone,” could soon give way. If that happens, XRP is expected to “rip to the upside,” marking a decisive shift in momentum after months of stagnation. Xoom’s latest insight, shared on X, highlights this crucial area that has consistently rejected XRP’s past attempts to break higher. Yet, this time, the setup looks different. With volume building and Bitcoin dominance showing early signs of cooling off, many believe XRP’s long-awaited surge relative to Bitcoin may be approaching. The Red Zone Xoom’s analysis zeroes in on a range on the XRP/BTC chart that typically lies between 0.000012 and 0.000015 BTC. This level has historically served as a strong resistance barrier, halting upward movement and sparking selloffs. However, every time XRP has managed to break through it, notably in 2017, 2021, and briefly in 2023, the result was a fast, powerful rally. Once XRP breaks through the red zone on XRP/BTC… it rips to the upside. pic.twitter.com/iuMTBDM3HJ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) June 14, 2025 The term “red zone” reflects not just the technical ceiling, but also the psychological weight this region carries for traders. Each failed attempt to push through has made the zone even more significant, and now, XRP is once again pressing up against it. According to Xoom, once this barrier is breached, there may be little standing in the way of a major upside move. XRP/BTC: Why It Matters While many focus on XRP’s price in U.S. dollars, the XRP/BTC pair often provides a clearer picture of its strength in the broader crypto market. A breakout here would signal that XRP is outperforming Bitcoin, something that historically attracts fresh capital from traders rotating out of BTC and into high-utility altcoins. A decisive break above the red zone would likely trigger increased trading volume, bullish momentum, and renewed institutional interest. It would also mark the end of XRP’s extended underperformance relative to Bitcoin, a trend that has weighed on investor confidence in recent months. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Momentum Meets Macro Catalysts A fundamental factor is that the drawn-out legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may soon come to a close. The parties have already refiled for settlement following Judge Torres’ procedural rejection of the first filing. A finalized resolution could act as a major catalyst, lifting legal uncertainty that has long suppressed XRP’s price action. Taken together, XRP’s improving fundamentals and the tightening XRP/BTC structure set the stage for a potential breakout. For Xoom and many others, the message is clear: once XRP breaks through this red zone, the move won’t be gradual. It will be swift, sharp, and likely to catch the market off guard. After months of pressure, XRP may finally be ready to explode . And if it does, as Xoom warns, it won’t just edge upward, it will rip.

In May, the Crypto timing model by Weiss Crypto Ratings, a cryptocurrency tracking and analysis platform, outlined a bullish outlook for the asset. A week later, the asset hit a new ATH with a price value of $111,886. This time, the model is painting yet another bullish case scenario for the cryptocurrency market. As seen on its official page on Twitter, now known as X, Weiss shared that its model forecasts an incoming trend pattern expected to occur in the last quarter of the year. The Crypto timing model points to November as when the market is most likely to experience a 4-year-cycle high. According to our Crypto Timing Model, we’ll likely see the 4-year-cycle high in November. — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) June 9, 2025 Is the 4-year market cycle still valid? For starters, Crypto has followed a 4-year pattern—a market movement pattern driven by the Bitcoin halving event. The trend typically ushers the market into periods of major losses and gains. As experienced during the 4-year cycle, an accumulation phase precedes a bear market, and a bullish phase follows right after. The 2011-2013 market cycle launched the trend, which has been observed for over a decade. Although experts claim that the presence of institutional investors has disrupted the cycle, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin and the broader market perform in the months ahead. Meanwhile, the big bull is trading at $103,091 at report time. The global crypto market correction brought a notable price pump recorded by a handful of top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Bitcoin bulls appear to be making a much-needed recovery, as daily gains briefly surged, sending Bitcoin to an intraday high of $107,000 on June 9. Glassnode describes the price jump as a move “likely fuelled by a wave of short liquidations,” adding that the negative funding rates from the previous week point to an increase in short appetite, resulting in today’s short squeeze.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/after-successfully-predicting-an-all-time-high-for-bitcoin-this-crypto-timing-model-points-to-rally-in-november/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare

In line with the bullish price predictions is a fresh outlook from a market expert focused on alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. According to João Wedson, the founder of crypto investment platform Alphractal and a verified author at Crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, the long-awaited altcoin season is already in motion. In a post shared on X, the analyst informs his 6,000 followers that a handful of altcoins outperform Bitcoin. As such, the market could soon witness a massive price rally within the broader altcoin market. “An Altcoin Season is happening right now! Altcoin Seasons can unfold within hours, days, or weeks — and we can’t afford to miss these opportunities.” He wrote. As displayed in the altcoin and Bitcoin index chart shared by the market expert, many altcoins appear to be trading at a higher volume than Bitcoin this June. More specifically, 47 of 56 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 900 minutes. The trend signals renewed interest in the altcoin market, suggesting a price rally might be closer than expected. However, the analyst maintains that the bears have not fully exited the market as market volatility is expected to continue. “Take advantage of it [the altcoin season], because the coming days will bring high volatility and great opportunities.” He added. XRP and Ether bulls remain wide awake despite heightened volatility Most altcoins within the top 50 category are trading in red at report time. However, leading altcoin Ether and XRP appear to have successfully retained gains from the previous week. Ether and XRP have emerged as the highest gainers, with 7-day gains of 2.62% and 3.85%, respectively.

Changes in Global M2 explain 89% of Bitcoin’s price movements with a 12-week lag. Bitcoin’s long-term price is driven by liquidity cycles, not speculation or short-term news. Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor, has reignited the debate over the driving force behind Bitcoin’s price. He claims that the price action of Bitcoin strongly correlates with Global liquidity flows, specifically the money supply (M2). Pal suggests that Bitcoin’s long-term price behavior is more likely to follow liquidity cycles. It is less influenced by short-term news and market speculation. Bitcoin’s Price Linked to Global Liquidity Growth According to the analysis, 89% of the movements in the price of Bitcoin can be attributed to changes in the Global M2.

Trading between $108,600 and $110,200, Bitcoin’s steady climb reflects strong institutional interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03. Having raised $10,600,000 with over 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders, this altcoin promises a 100% return at its $0.06 launch. Investors are buzzing about its potential to hit $5 post-launch. Let’s explore Bitcoin’s current dynamics and why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a top crypto pick. Bitcoin faces key resistance Bitcoin is battling resistance between $110,000 and $112,000. Prices hold steady above $108,000, with a 3% gain recently. Institutional inflows, particularly into crypto ETFs, fuel this momentum. Funds saw $167 billion in May, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Global economic shifts, like rising bond yields and a weaker dollar, push investors toward Bitcoin. Regulatory talks, including the CLARITY Act, signal a maturing crypto market. However, crypto charts show traders hedging against pullbacks, as negative funding rates hint at caution. If Bitcoin breaks $112,000, new highs are possible. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh opportunity in this vibrant market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing crowds in phase 5 of its presale. Priced at $0.03, up 200% from the $0.01 opening phase, it guarantees a 100% return at the $0.06 launch. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price jump to $0.035, narrowing the early-entry window. The project has raised $10,600,000, with 550 million tokens sold and 12,000 holders onboard. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, a 9,900% increase from today’s price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s utility-driven model sets it apart in the crypto market. Furthermore, its innovative approach to lending captivates investors seeking high-yield opportunities. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income with dynamic interest rates. This ensures lenders gain more while borrowers pay less. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct, intermediary-free lending, promoting transparency and user control. Built on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin resists algorithmic instability, ensuring secure transactions. Layer-2 integration enhances speed and cuts fees, making it user-friendly. Consequently, this robust infrastructure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leader in crypto investment, offering practical solutions for modern DeFi challenges. Security and community engagement The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team has finalized a Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and zero security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. The team also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. A $100,000 giveaway excites the community, splitting $10,000 among 10 winners. Eligible participants need a $50 presale investment and must complete all entry steps. This initiative strengthens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal as a top crypto pick. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market due to its immediate utility. Unlike many tokens, its beta platform launches alongside the token, allowing instant asset deposits and interest earnings. Revenue from stablecoin borrowing supports the treasury, which buys back MUTM tokens, boosting demand without diluting supply. This strategic tokenomics drives long-term value. Bitcoin’s $110,000 resistance highlights market caution, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a bold alternative.

Key Takeaways: GameStop upsized its convertible note offering to $2.25B, with a 32.5% premium conversion price. The company holds 4,710 BTC but remains noncommittal about future crypto purchases. Proceeds may fund investments or acquisitions, with trading cards now a core revenue focus. The move comes just months after a similar $1.5 billion raise in April and follows the company’s recent entry into Bitcoin. Shares of the Texas-based retailer dropped 24% over the past week, closing Friday at $22.14, despite holding steady after the announcement. GameStop’s Zero-Coupon Notes Come with 32.5% Conversion Premium The notes, which bear no interest, carry a conversion price of around $28.91 per share — a 32.5% premium over the stock’s Thursday afternoon average. The structure mirrors the strategy employed by MicroStrategy, which has used premium note offerings to expand its Bitcoin holdings without immediate dilution. GameStop first disclosed it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin in March , pushing the stock above $28 at the time. Whether the company plans to expand its crypto reserves remains uncertain. CEO Ryan Cohen has made it clear that GameStop won’t emulate other firms or signal its buying patterns. In a recent interview, he declined to say whether more BTC purchases were planned. The press release kept options open, stating that proceeds would be used for “general corporate purposes,” including investments aligned with GameStop’s investment policy and “potential acquisitions.” $GME GameStop just locked in the terms for their convertible note offering. Upsized to $2.25 billion from the original $1.75B, with 0.00% interest, meaning bondholders don’t get paid unless they convert. GameStop gave buyers the right to purchase up to $450M more in notes… pic.twitter.com/qnN4pVLM39 — Han Akamatsu 赤松 (@Han_Akamatsu) June 13, 2025 While vague, the language leaves the door open for further digital asset moves. GameStop’s previous crypto ventures have been mixed. The company launched an NFT marketplace during the last market cycle but shut it down early last year. At its annual shareholder meeting, Cohen pivoted focus toward trading cards—now making up nearly 30% of quarterly revenue. “We’re focusing on trading cards as a natural extension of our existing business,” he said. With capital in hand and crypto already on its books, GameStop could revisit Bitcoin when market conditions align. 223 Companies Hold Bitcoin A growing list of firms is embracing Bitcoin as a balance sheet hedge or strategic investment. Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. Last week, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong.

2025-06-14T15:07:33,"Here’s What Experts Think Will Send Bitcoin Above its $111,970 All-Time High","As Bitcoin makes a slow but necessary recovery following last week’s market sell-off— a move that sent the asset back to the $100,000 price level, market participants are even more observant, outlining what it would take for the big bull to break past its previous all-time high. According to an on-chain analytical piece from Glassnode, Bitcoin could surge past its all-time high of $111,970, attained in May, to hit never-before-seen price levels, “should the market enter price discovery.” Notably, Bitcoin’s current price is determined by buying and selling activities. Factors such as supply and demand, liquidity, and market sentiment are some of the determining factors observed in the price discovery process for assets like Bitcoin. According to Glassnode’s analysis, a key support level is essential for Bitcoin to maintain underlying bullish pressure. The Short-term holder cost basis—the average acquisition price of Bitcoin by crypto investors who have held the asset for 115 days or less—interestingly doubles as the aforementioned support level. As seen in Glassnode’s report ; “The $97.6k Short-Term Holder cost basis continues to serve as a pivotal support level necessary for maintaining local bullish momentum.” In contrast, the bulls are primed to retest a new ATH if the nearest resistance level is broken in the near term. “On the upside, the $115.4k zone emerges as the first significant resistance should the market enter price discovery.” The report read. After failing to sustain momentum above the $101,000 price level last week, Bitcoin bulls are making a notable comeback. Recovery gains sustained this week sent the asset to $110,300. With Bitcoin around 1.5% away from its previous all-time high, renewed interest in the asset suggests that investment confidence has been strengthened for the near term. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is trading at $108,729, while 7-day gains surged by 4.06%.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/heres-what-experts-think-will-send-bitcoin-above-its-111970-all-time-high/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

As Donald Trump’s campaign reignited debates around digital assets, the market reacted with sharp, unsettling twists that caught even seasoned investors off guard. Still, in the middle of the market mayhem, one surprising player is lighting up the charts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is standing tall with a fiercely loyal community and sharp tech upgrades. Its jaw-dropping price of just $0.00000035 continues to turn heads. Add in an irresistible 80% bonus with the code FLOPPY80 , and it’s no wonder this underdog is fueling serious FOMO across the crypto scene. The Donald Trump Effect: Why The 2024 Election Sent Crypto Markets Into Overdrive When Donald Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, his return to the White House sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, significantly reshaping the trajectory of crypto and the broader market landscape. The 2024 election outcome triggered a drastic shift in market sentiment as Donald Trump adopted a decidedly pro-crypto stance, unveiling ambitious plans to make the US the “crypto capital”. He also appointed a crypto czar, dismantled restrictive regulations, and reportedly even used federal policy to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve—all signaling to the market that Donald Trump meant business with crypto. As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes $112,000, social data shows the most bullish crypto chatter since Donald Trump won the 2024 election, hinting at rising market euphoria and a potential crypto cooldown. Yet this market momentum carries risks, as hedge funds warn of a crypto bubble fueled by Donald Trump’s crypto agenda, with the 2024 election injecting fresh volatility into a market still adjusting to his return. In essence, the 2024 election has transformed the market dynamics of crypto, with Donald Trump at the center, rewriting rules around crypto, igniting price climbs, and challenging the market to balance excitement with caution. Forget The Noise: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Stands Tall In Donald Trump’s Crypto Turmoil With 80% Bonus While the broader crypto market reels from post-2024 election volatility tied to Donald Trump’s bold agenda, one unexpected altcoin is flipping the script— FloppyPepe (FPPE) .

As the crypto market reels from post-2024 election volatility and Donald Trump’s bold return to the political stage, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is entering a breakout moment. With Phase 3 of its roadmap underway, the project is preparing for its Uniswap debut, set to open up smooth global trading. Meanwhile, aggressive plans for top-tier CEX listings aim to deepen liquidity, expand global reach, and solidify FloppyPepe (FPPE) as a serious player amid Donald Trump-era market uncertainty. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Ignites The Market: Massive Presale Gains And A Bonus On The Line FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining serious traction, with nearly $2.4 million already raised and close to $1 million secured in its private sale, selling out in less than 24 hours. Currently priced at just $0.00000035, this meme-fueled AI token offers a rare chance to enter early with massive upside potential.

2025-06-14T14:50:00,"Pocket Network, Status, MAP Protocol, Sky crypto price predictions","The crypto market made some improvements today, June 14, as investors bought the dip following Friday’s crash. Bitcoin price held steady above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens rose to $3.4 trillion. This article provides a forecast of top cryptocurrencies like Pocket Network (POKT), Status (SNT), MAP Protocol (MAPO), and Sky (SKY). Pocket Network price prediction POKT price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Pocket Network price bottomed at $0.008425 in April. This rebound happened after it went through a prolonged period of consolidation, which, in this case, was the accumulation period of the Wyckoff Theory. The POKT price then surged after Upbit, the biggest South Korean crypto exchange listed it. It also jumped after the developers rolled out a key upgrade .This surge pushed it to a high of $0.0975, its highest point since June 13 last year. Pocket Network price then pulled back amid profit-taking among crypto investors. It dropped to a low of $0.04650, its lowest point on June 9. This pullback was part of the formation of the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. This cup has a depth of about 90%. Therefore, measuring this distance from the cup’s upper side gives it a target of $0.1400, the highest swing since May 17. A drop below the support at $0.046 will invalidate the bullish view. Status price forecast SNT price chart | Source: TradingView The Status token price bottomed at $0.01598 in April as the crypto market crash happened. This was a notable level since it coincided with the lowest swing in August last year. It was the double-bottom point whose neckline was at $0.0849. Status token has moved above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since April 9. The uptrend will likely continue as long as it is above the two moving averages and the ascending trendline. The key point to watch will be at $0.056, the highest point on May 29, which is about 70% above the current level. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish view. MAP Protocol price technical analysis MAPO price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the MAP Protocol token dropped to $0.0039 in April and went through a consolidation as part of the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It then went parabolic on Friday, reaching a high of $0.010, its highest point on February 2. This surge happened after the token was added to Burrito Wallet, a leading wallet provider. MAP Protocol price remains above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Average. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards and moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the MAP Protocol token retreats in the next few days as investors take profits. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $0.0060. A move above $0.01 will invalidate the bearish MAPO forecast. Sky Protocol price forecast SKY price chart | Source: TradingView Sky Protocol, formerly known as Maker , bottomed at $0.032 in February this year. It has formed an ascending channel, comprising of a series of higher highs and higher lows since March 9. The current Sky price is slightly below the upper side of the channel. It has also moved slightly above the 50-day and 25-day EMA, while the MACD indicator has pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $0.10. The alternative scenario is where the Sky price retreats and retests the lower side of of the channel at $0.070.

The president filed his public financial disclosure to the US Office of Government Ethics, declaring that he holds 15.75B $WLFI tokens, the native cryptocurrency of WLF. Interestingly, though, no details were provided as to how this income was generated. Was it through sale or staking, or any other mechanism? We don’t know. Read to know more about WLF and Trump’s pro-crypto approach. We’ll also suggest the best altcoins you can buy now to rake in a handsome income yourself. Price jumps, staking, we’ve covered it all. Trump’s Crypto Empire: From Stablecoins to Meme Tokens World Liberty Financial is a decentralized project focusing on open and on-chain infrastructure with special attention to dollar-pegged stablecoins. It has also issued $USD1, a new stablecoin similar to $USDT and $USDC. The project has raised around $550M in token sales so far. It’s worth noting that the Trump family has a 75% share in the net revenues of this project, with 60% ownership in WLF Holdco LLC through DT Marks DEFI LLC. Overall, the Trump family owns 22.5B out of the total 100B $WLFI token supply. Besides WLFI, Trump had also launched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, just before his appointment as the president. It was under him that the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in the US . He also announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve . In addition to being a boon for the crypto industry, Trump has made a decent return from crypto himself. If you want to become an ace crypto player just like him, here are some cryptos worth investing in right now . 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Altcoin to Buy If You’re Looking for Explode-Worthy Tokens Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best cryptos to buy now , seeing as it’s leading the DeFi revolution by being the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana. Solana’s troubles with scalability began soon after the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, two hyper-successful meme coins that flooded the blockchain with new investors. This resulted in periods of sudden spikes in transaction requests, which Solana couldn’t handle, serving up one failed transaction after another. Solaxy’s brand-new L2 for Solana will address this by offloading a chunk of the network’s transactions onto a sidechain. This will reduce the burden on Solana, allowing it to function like the good old days. Additionally, Solaxy has also designed its L2 to process multiple transactions simultaneously. This will reduce the per-transaction cost, further driving up Solana’s cost-efficiency. Now, here’s the real kicker: Solaxy is predicted to explode over 11,300% and reach $0.20 by 2030. If you wish to ride Solana’s newfound vigor and Solaxy’s promise, buy $SOLX now for just $0.001758. Oh, and the project has in total raised nearly $50M, so you’ll be buying into the best crypto presale of 2025. But hurry up because the presale ends in less than 2 days. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Revolutionizing Bitcoin with a Layer 2 Solution, Highest Staking Rewards If you’re looking for a new crypto that can earn you a significant amount of passive income via staking, look no further than Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Currently in presale, $HYPER is offering early investors 613% p.a. as staking rewards. It’s worth mentioning, though, that this rate is dynamic and will keep decreasing as the presale progresses. So, buy Bitcoin Hyper as early as possible. One token is currently selling for just $0.011875, and besides staking rewards, you’ll also stand a chance to make around 2,100% in gains. That’s because $HYPER is predicted to shoot up to $0.253 by 2030 . Powered by a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, $HYPER connects with Bitcoin Layer 1 through a Canonical Bridge. It works by converting L1 $BTC into L2 ‘wrapped’ $BTC, which can be used to access decentralized applications, Web3, and gaming dApps, as well as speed up transactions on them. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper wants to breathe new life into the aging Bitcoin blockchain by speeding up transactions, lowering fees, and offering improved DeFi access. 3. Jelly-My-Jelly ($JELLYJELLY) – Viral Meme Coin Starting Fresh Rally Jelly-My-Jelly is the brainchild of Venmo’s co-founder, Iqram Magdon-Ismail, and a crypto investor, Sam Lessin. It’s worth noting that the ‘utility’ behind $JELLYJELLY is that it offers token holders early-bird access to an upcoming video-sharing app that will supposedly be the fastest way to post clips from a video chat. However, it has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos , mainly due to hype and backing from the degen community. $JELLYJELLY is up more than 17% over the past seven days – and a chunky 57% over the past year – with each token currently available for a low price of $0.02902. Wrapping Up Donald Trump’s massive $57.3M income from World Liberty Financial tokens is undoubtedly a strong signal of crypto’s bold embrace at the highest level. If you wish to replicate Trump’s crypto success, look at high-potential tokens like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . However, bear in mind that investments in crypto are subject to market risks.

2025-06-14T14:37:04,"Bitcoin Holder GameStop Upsizes Convertible Debt Offering To $2.25 Billion Amid BTC Acquisition Plans","GameStop announced an increase in its previously disclosed offering of convertible senior notes. The company upsized its latest convertible debt offering to $2.25 billion from $1.75 billion , signaling a deeper commitment to establishing its corporate BTC treasury. GameStop Increases Note Sales To $2.25B For Potential Bitcoin Buys GameStop said in a press release published late on Thursday that it would be offering investors more convertible bonds, following a similar multi-billion-dollar raise in March. The $2.25 billion offering targets “qualified institutional buyers” and is expected to close on June 15, 2032, unless converted or repurchased earlier. The embattled video game retailer’s latest batch of convertible bonds, which will carry no interest, will have a conversion price of roughly $28.91 per share, which may change “in some events.” The conversion price of the notes represents a 32.5% premium compared to the company’s average stock price on June 12. GameStop will also allow initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $450 million in notes within 13 days of the initial issuance. Companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) have been able to boost the amount of Bitcoin they own per share by raising funds at a premium relative to their BTC stash and putting that cash into the benchmark crypto. The company, which owns over 582,000 BTC — nearly 3% of the token’s total possible supply — has seen its stock rocket by over 900% in the past year, in the wake of Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs. Whether GameStop will make another Bitcoin purchase is less clear. Though the company indicated that it intends to use the net proceeds of the latest convertible debt offering for “general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy,” which may signal more Bitcoin purchases from the video game behemoth. Following the March announcement of the Bitcoin treasury strategy, GameStop raised $1.5 billion through another convertible note offering. The company subsequently purchased 4,710 Bitcoins for roughly $500 million in May.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holder-gamestop-upsizes-convertible-debt-offering-to-2-25-billion-amid-btc-acquisition-plans/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T14:30:37,"JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and TD Bank Issue Data Breach Alerts, Say Critical Information on Several Customers Compromised","JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and TD Bank are disclosing data breaches that are placing some customers’ accounts and personal information at risk. In new filings with the Massachusetts state government, Chase says at least four customers in the state are affected by multiple breaches. In two incidents, Chase says employees improperly accessed customers’ credit and debit card information and triggered fraudulent transactions, prompting the bank to close the affected cards, issue replacements, and reimburse the customers. In the other two incidents, the bank says it mistakenly posted transaction details, including names, addresses, account numbers, and transaction amounts, to other customers’ accounts. At this point, no misuse due to those errors has been detected. Meanwhile, Bank of America says documentation relating to at least one customer’s savings bonds was lost in transit on February 14th. Attempts to recover the documentation, according to the North Carolina-based lender, have proved unsuccessful. “According to our records, the information involved in this incident was related to your Savings Bonds and included your first and last name, address, Social Security number, and account number.” The lender says it is monitoring the customer’s banking account for any suspicious activity and is committed to resolving any unauthorized transactions. Lastly, TD Bank says a former employee improperly accessed a customer’s personal information between December of 2024 and January of 2025. The information may have included the customer’s name, address, phone number, social security number, account number, and transactional data. TD Bank says it’s monitoring the account for fraud and is offering the customer a complimentary two year membership to an identity theft protection and recovery service.

2025-06-14T14:30:00,"Rumble: Crypto Pivot Doesn't Move The Needle","Summary Rumble's user growth has stalled since late 2022, despite content deals and the 2024 election boost proving fleeting. Revenue totals remain far below expectations, and content partnerships like Barstool Sports failed to deliver meaningful user growth. The company's crypto pivot, including a Tether investment and upcoming wallet, is limited in scope and hasn't translated into business momentum. The stock trades at an expensive 22x 2026 sales estimates without profitability or real growth. Rumble Inc. ( RUM ) once offered the promise of developing into a major online video streaming player, but lately the company is focused on a crypto shift. The business has failed to garner any momentum due to other sites relaxing free speech concerns, originally driving the business model. My investment thesis remains ultra-Bearish on the stock due to the lack of growth and the very expensive valuation. Source: Finviz Online Video Stalling The stock popped on the company announcing pivots towards crypto, since Rumble hasn't actually accomplished anything in the non-video realm. The big question is whether the crypto business will actually amount to something. For Q1'25, Rumble only reported 59 million global monthly average users (MAUs), up from the last March quarter. In reality though, the online video platform hasn't seen any growth in users since the Q4'22 U.S. mid-terms. Source: Rumble Q1'25 10-Q Elon Musk bought Twitter back in October 2022 and the whole free speech benefits of the online video platform disappeared. Rumble has signed substantial content deals in the ensuing years without any meaningful change in the user base. Even in the 2024 Presidential elections with a Rumble user like Donald Trump winning the election, the platform only produced 68 million MAUs, versus 67 million in the prior Q4. Rumble reported Q1'25 revenues of $23 million, up a solid 34% from last Q1, but still far below all original forecasts for the business when completing the SPAC deal. Data by YCharts Rumble still spent $30 million in Q1 on cost of services, even with content costs down $3 million. The company spent substantial amounts on trying to build up the platform via minimum guarantees for new content, but most content creators have much higher followers on other media platforms. Barstool Sports is a prime example of a media outlet doing a deal with Rumble for content, yet the user base remained meager on the platform. The sports media company only has 60K followers on Rumble versus 6.5 million on Twitter/X and another 1.9 million on YouTube, causing a failure to re-up the agreement after a year. Rumble probably wisely signed some content deals to make the platform more legitimate, but organic content creators are what is ultimately needed. Barstool Sports was promised as a partner promoting Rumble as their video home, but the partnership didn't last. Crypto Pivot Going back to December, Rumble obtained a $775 million investment from Tether. Also, the company bought bitcoin during the March quarter and ended Q1 with a balance of 211 bitcoins with a current value of $22 million based on a price of $105K each. The crypto pivot is far from over with the intent to launch a crypto wallet in Q3. The Rumble Wallet is intended to compete with options from Coinbase ( COIN ), but the prime use is to pay content creators, especially in international locations. At the end of the day, Rumble has a very limited crypto pivot with a future Rumble Wallet more for payment transfers, though additional crypto features can be built out in the future. The company used the $775 million investment from Tether to immediately turnaround and acquire $525 million worth of shares at a price of $7.50, providing just $250 million in cash for the business. Source: Rumble Q1'25 10-Q Rumble has a diluted share count of around 400 million shares now, for a market cap of ~$3.5 billion. The consensus analyst forecasts for 2026 revenues of just $154 million, so the stock trades at nearly 22x sales estimates for a company still not profitable, nor growing at a very fast clip. The stock might have some support here around $8.50 with strong recent support down to $7. The key is that Rumble likely doesn't have much upside, at lease sustainable upside, without any actual business with growth. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Rumble is still priced like a booming business in either online video streaming and crypto, yet the company has generally stalled for a couple of years now.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794856-rumble-crypto-pivot-doesnt-move-the-needle?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|USDT","RUM",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T14:29:42,"Top Secret Investment Playbook— Using Ethereum’s Institutional Insights to Find the Best Ethereum Meme Coins & Top Crypto Presales (June 2025)","Ethereum's institutional inflows signal significant opportunities for meme coins. Neo Pepe Protocol emerges as a standout with unique tokenomics and governance. Distinctive Auto-Liquidity Mechanism and Community Ownership drive its popularity. Comparative advantage over existing meme coins through structured presale. Ideal moment to secure early access to promising emerging tokens. Institutional Cash Fuels Meme Coin Frenzy Ethereum is witnessing unprecedented institutional inflows, exceeding $290 million through spot ETFs recently. Major funds like BlackRock lead this influx, totaling over $1.7 billion since May. Ethereum upgrades, including account abstraction and validator enhancements, promise increased Layer-2 activity, significantly boosting potential for meme coins and emerging tokens built on Ethereum. Institutions increasingly view Ethereum as digital infrastructure analogous to oil in the industrial age, essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. This endorsement is also driven by Ethereum's ability to facilitate stablecoin issuance and cross-border transactions efficiently. As major financial institutions continue integrating Ethereum-based solutions, confidence grows among retail investors, further fueling speculative interest in meme coins built on Ethereum's robust blockchain. The spike in institutional adoption is translating into higher overall liquidity and lower volatility across Ethereum's ecosystem, significantly benefiting meme coins. These conditions create an ideal breeding ground for innovative tokens to flourish rapidly, setting the stage for potentially explosive growth in emerging meme coins like Neo Pepe. Best Meme Coins & Top Crypto Presales for June 2025 As meme coins continue to captivate the cryptocurrency landscape, investors must pinpoint the most promising tokens and presales poised for growth and lasting impact. Below are standout meme coins and crypto presales that are leading the charge in June 2025: Best Ethereum Meme Coins: Shiba Inu (SHIB): Persistent popularity driven by strong community and aggressive marketing. Pepe (PEPE): Viral sensation and extensive social media presence. Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge): Charitable initiatives and community-driven promotions. FLOKI: Robust branding and partnerships in gaming and NFTs. ApeCoin (APE): Strong integration within the NFT ecosystem. Top Crypto Presales: Solaxy: Layer-2 solution on Solana, targeting efficiency and usability. BTC Bull: Offers Bitcoin rewards, strong marketing presence. Remittix (RTX): Cross-border payment solutions with a global focus. BitcoinHyper (HYPER): Leveraging Bitcoin's popularity with innovative staking options. Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP): Multi-chain accessible presale, robust governance, auto-liquidity. How This Token Crushes all Meme Competition Compared to tokens like BTC Bull, Solaxy, and Punisher, Neo Pepe distinguishes itself significantly by integrating meme culture with robust tokenomics and decentralized governance : BTC Bull: While offering appealing Bitcoin reward mechanisms and staking opportunities, BTC Bull lacks the foundational structure of decentralized governance and community-driven decision-making. Its growth is heavily reliant on continuous new user adoption rather than sustained community participation. Solaxy: Positioned strongly within the Solana ecosystem, Solaxy provides promising Layer-2 solutions focused primarily on technical utility. However, its meme culture engagement is limited, missing out on capturing the expansive virality and grassroots community support that meme coins typically leverage. Punisher Coin: With appealing branding and mission-driven narratives, Punisher Coin appeals primarily through thematic engagement. Nonetheless, its cross-chain capabilities and transaction transparency fall significantly short compared to Neo Pepe, limiting its appeal to a narrower audience. Ethereum-based meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge) have surged, but often rely heavily on viral marketing with limited intrinsic token utility. Neo Pepe sets itself apart by not only harnessing meme potential but embedding strategic and technical strengths that deliver sustained value to its holders. Shiba Inu (SHIB) relies heavily on speculative trading driven by viral social media marketing, without extensive structural governance or utility mechanisms. Pepe (PEPE) achieves viral status effectively but struggles with long-term value retention, facing frequent volatility and limited practical utility. Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge) engages users with charitable initiatives, yet it lacks robust governance frameworks, limiting holders’ influence over project direction. FLOKI benefits from strong branding partnerships in gaming and NFTs but misses substantial token utility outside speculative and entertainment value. ApeCoin (APE) excels in NFT integration and has strong backing from prominent communities but remains focused within specific niche markets rather than broader, mass-market appeal. Secret Sauce Behind Neo Pepe’s Explosive Rise In stark contrast, Neo Pepe combines the best features of these competitors into one powerful ecosystem: Comprehensive Governance: Neo Pepe's DAO ensures token holders have substantial decision-making power, driving long-term community engagement and stability. Robust Tokenomics: With an innovative Auto-Liquidity Mechanism and clearly structured presale stages, Neo Pepe provides a sustainable financial foundation to attract informed investors. Multi-Chain Accessibility: Neo Pepe's cross-chain compatibility (Ethereum, BSC, Base) broadens its market appeal and ensures liquidity across multiple blockchain environments. Meme Culture with Purpose: Neo Pepe leverages meme virality while reinforcing meaningful interactions through eco-conscious initiatives and charitable endeavors. Presale Advantage: Clearly defined early-entry discounts and controlled vesting periods. Liquidity Stability: Transaction fee contributions to liquidity pools, minimizing volatility. True Decentralization: DAO-led governance ensures community-driven project evolution. Act Now or Miss Out— Why Neo Pepe Could Be Your Best Crypto Bet of 2025 Neo Pepe Protocol captures Ethereum's surging institutional adoption wave, uniquely fusing meme-driven excitement with meticulously crafted tokenomics, a transparent community-led governance model, and its signature Auto-Liquidity system. Positioned at the forefront of crypto innovation this June 2025, Neo Pepe offers a compelling advantage for savvy early investors seeking standout opportunities. Ready to join the movement?

2025-06-14T14:20:24,"France eyes Bitcoin mining as means to manage energy","A group of lawmakers has set out to make France consider Bitcoin mining, particularly as a means to manage its massive electricity system and strengthen its energy sovereignty. A legislative proposal to that end has been put forward in Paris, and its authors hope the government will accept to assess the potential of crypto-related activity in other areas as well. While countries around the world have either tried to suppress cryptocurrency mining, as was the case with China a few years ago, or let it grow, like the United States , for example, France is yet to make up its mind about the industry and what it wants from it. France trying to find its place in the crypto mining space Several members of the French parliament have decided to speed up the decision-making process in Paris. They are now suggesting the country should estimate the potential of Bitcoin mining, at least as a tool to improve the management of power generation. France may well be taking a step toward the pro-mining camp, the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin noted in an article on Saturday. The piece is devoted to the lawmakers’ attempt to trigger a debate on the matter in the National Assembly. On Friday, the group of parliamentarians presented a draft amendment to the law on “National programming and regulatory simplification in the energy sector” that requires the government to assess if France needs to develop domestic Bitcoin mining and report back to the legislature. The key goal of the motion is to study whether the minting of digital currencies could be employed as a means to better manage the EU nation’s electricity system, the largest in Europe. The sponsors of the bill elaborated: “This amendment aims to objectify, through an evaluation report submitted to the Parliament, the conditions under which Bitcoin mining could be used as a tool to serve the French electricity system.” France is the leading producer and exporter of electrical energy in the region, largely due to its massive nuclear power sector. The latter accounts for over 70% of its generated electricity, with renewables and fossil fuels providing the rest. Bitcoin mining can help utilize surplus electricity in France Another debate that has been going on in the French society is how to make the largely state-owned nuclear power industry more efficient. A big part of it is the need to optimize the management of the surplus electricity production. The authors of the new legislation believe that Bitcoin mining can provide a unique solution as “it is highly flexible” and “has no impact on the continuity of supply.” In that regard, they are highlighting some of its “technical advantages.” Crypto mining machines can be started and stopped quickly and activated on demand, depending on production and consumption peaks. Bitcoin farms can be installed near production facilities, even in the most isolated areas. Furthermore, the lawmakers are convinced that building a low-carbon crypto mining sector in France, under the supervision of public authorities, could bring abandoned industrial sites back to life and strengthen the country’s energy sovereignty while supporting innovation. The report sums up the positives of cryptocurrency mining in France: “In short: an activity that can adapt to the constraints of the electricity system, absorb energy surpluses, reduce negative prices on wholesale markets, and relieve the burden on nuclear power plants by avoiding overly frequent modulation cycles, which accelerate wear and tear on the installations.” While the upcoming parliamentary debate on the amendment is just a first step that needs to translate into concrete actions by the French government, “the evaluation process will help inform future policy choices based on energy sovereignty, industrial innovation, and network resilience,” the MPs remarked. The amendment has been developed in partnership with ADAN , France’s Association for the Development of Digital Assets. The industry organization has been a driving force behind proposals concerning the regulation, taxation, and mining of cryptocurrencies in the country. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Altcoin Season Index at 26 confirms Bitcoin dominance as altcoins lag in exchange activity. Over 30 U.S. altcoin ETF filings in 2025 fuel optimism for a potential “altcoin summer.” According to recent data, although the prices of cryptocurrencies have been fluctuating dramatically, altcoin holders have not panicked and have not rushed to withdraw their tokens from exchanges. Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, points out that they have seen “growing price volatility but not correspondingly growing inflows into exchanges.” This stagnation suggests that selling pressure is not particularly strong, despite Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs. The 7-day cumulative transaction count of altcoin exchange inflows shows no significant surges in transfers to large exchanges, such as Binance, OKX, Coinbase, and Bybit.
