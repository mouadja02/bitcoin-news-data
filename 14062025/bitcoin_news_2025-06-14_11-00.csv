2025-06-14T08:40:44,"Trump reports $57M earnings from World Liberty Financial","US President Donald Trump has revealed earning $57 million from World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture he is involved in alongside his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. According to a more than 200-page financial disclosure filed with the US Office of Government Ethics, Trump also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in WLF—granting him significant voting power within the company. The disclosure shows that WLF was Trump’s single largest income source among hundreds of assets, surpassing revenue from his books and real estate holdings. The filing is expected to intensify scrutiny over Trump’s growing ties to the crypto sector, with critics raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Trump earns significant income amid his pro-crypto stance World Liberty Financial announced in January that it has sold 21 billion tokens in a public sale, hitting its target of raising $ 1 billion. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2024 described the special envoy for Trump, Steve Witkoff, as a promoter for WLF. Public support from Trump has helped fuel a rally in crypto markets, sending the price of Bitcoin to over $100,000 a coin. In addition, under chair Paul Atkins, the SEC has dismissed several high-profile cases against crypto groups. Interestingly, Trump has often promoted his $TRUMP meme coin on social media. He also hosted a gala dinner for its largest holders last month. Last week, the Trump family media company said it was planning to launch its own exchange-traded fund to hold Bitcoin directly, and in May, it said it would raise $2.5 billion to establish a “Bitcoin treasury.” During a Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas in May, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr revealed that cryptocurrencies were cheaper, faster, more secure, and more transparent than traditional fiat currencies. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. World Liberty reveals Trump’s family as its major shareholder World Liberty, launched last fall, aims to make financial services reachable to people in cryptocurrencies without intermediaries like banks—a concept known as decentralized finance (DeFi). However, it has yet to release a public platform, and according to a review of the project, it has only a small staff. Nonetheless, World Liberty said in mid-March that it had raised $550 million by selling “governance tokens.” According to reliable sources, most sales occurred following Trump’s victory in November. The tokens, denoted by the symbol $WLFI, entitle holders to vote on proposed changes to a project’s underlying code and signal their perspective on its vision and future road maps. Still, they cannot be traded. It is worth noting that while World Liberty Financial took in more than half a billion dollars, President Donald Trump’s family seized control of the crypto venture and much of that money with it. This is supported by governance rules that industry experts believe disproportionately favor insiders. This was revealed after World Liberty announced in January that the Trump family had acquired the business as its fundraising gained momentum. Two of the co-founders of World Liberty, crypto entrepreneurs Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, have been replaced as the main leaders by a group with a 60% ownership stake from the Trump family. The Trump family claims 75% of the profits from token sales and 60% from World Liberty’s operations once they begin. This setup means the Trump family is set to receive around $400 million in fees. Following the mid-March sales, after the co-founders took their share, World Liberty only retained 5% of the $550 million raised to develop the platform. Trump’s family faces criticism over their shareholder capacity in WLF The way this project is organized, especially with the Trump family’s large share of revenue and the fact that governance tokens cannot be traded, makes World Liberty quite centralized compared to others in the industry. This conclusion comes from a review of practices at the five biggest DeFi lending platforms and interviews with four US professors who study crypto. Jim Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University who focuses on DeFi regulation , said he finds it hard to see any financial advantage for those holding these tokens. Additionally, David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee who recently studied World Liberty, noted that the project’s structure effectively keeps public investors or token holders from having any real financial involvement.

BSV has traded under the 200-day EMA band since early 2025, indicating a bearish trend. Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chartMany ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030. Table of Contents Overview Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 BSV Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2026-2030 BSV Coin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2027 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2028 BSV Crypto Price Prediction 2029 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV Token BSV Price $ 31.12264386 3.60% Market cap $ 618,677,311.4785 Circulating Supply 19,878,687.50 Trading Volume $ 50,607,770.4235 All-time high $491.64 on 16th April 2021 All-time low $23.30 on 10th June 2024 Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 Based on the historical data, price analysis, and broader market sentiments, the BSV price is expected to surge by the end of 2025. With an average of $86 , the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 BSV Price Prediction 2025 In 2024’s second half, an ascending broadening wedge pattern was developed by BSV’s price action. This was followed by a strong buying movement witnessed in Q4 2024, which began from the wedge’s lower border to its upper border. Many experts viewed that continuation of bullish momentum could lead to new levels higher, but the upper border closely aligned with a strong resistance zone, and that repelled its price trajectory downwards to 2025’s first half, eroding over 60% of its gains. Despite BSV price’s effort to rise higher in Q2 of 2025, the bullish strength fell short to push prices higher, as a result, BSV ended up in another declining wedge. Many had anticipated that BSV would reach the round number of $50, but it failed to meet that target by the end of April, dampening investor morale. The last seen good momentum was in Q4 2024 and which is now sorely missed by BSV investors. In April, BSV reached as high as $47 but faced rejection at the resistance block and proceeded to form lower lows. The recent bearish crossover between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA signals increasing bearish pressure in the short term. Despite several optimistic factors in Q2 2025, price action stayed muted. If BSV continues to decline within a downward wedge, then BSV’s price could drop further toward the $24 level. However, there’s a key turning point—if BSV manages to break out of this falling wedge pattern and flip the 200-day EMA band or break above the $40 price level, the trend could shift bullish. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA band might give BSV the momentum it needs to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. Furthermore, if this breakout is supported by increased adoption and BSV successfully clears the $50 resistance, the crypto could gain the momentum required to target $65 by the end of 2025.

2025-06-14T08:30:19,"No ‘Easy Street’: CFTC Acting Chair Shares New Crypto Approach Under Trump Admin","In a recent interview at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chair shared the future of the agency’s crypto regulation under the pro-industry administration. CFTC Won’t Criminalize Crypto On Thursday, CFTC’s acting chair, Caroline Pham, told Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi that regulations won’t be easy on anybody, including the crypto industry, despite the end of the “regulation by enforcement” approach under the new administration. Pham explained that “There is no easy street for anybody, and regulators aren’t easy,” adding that the agency’s shift toward a pro-innovation, pro-growth strategy doesn’t mean companies can bend the law and get away with it. She clarified that the CFTC’s new approach won’t “twist the law to criminalize an asset class or a technology,” like the past administration. Instead, it will focus on catching fraudsters and scammers in the market. “That’s always been our core mission is to prevent fraud, manipulation, and abuse in our markets and to help victims,” Pham affirmed. In the interview, the regulatory agency’s chair explained her previous comments about “uberizing crypto,” sharing that it means effectively integrating digital assets into daily life so that banning or criminalizing it becomes nearly impossible, like Uber did with the transportation industry. “When something becomes so big, so accepted, so part of our lives, you can’t really take it away then. The public, the people, voters, they won’t let you,” she affirmed, noting that the ride-sharing app revolutionized the industry, which resulted in a lot of people unsuccessfully trying to fight it. Pham considers that the “uberization” of the industry must be the goal to prevent crypto from being unfairly criminalized as a concept or a technology. “The way that you do that is by bringing it to the people, and the people will speak, and voters will speak,” she stated. Restoring Regulatory Clarity Speaking about the previous administration, Pham noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC “really went beyond what the law says and what the statute says,” which has been a common criticism of the US watchdogs. She condemned how the agency reinterpreted existing laws that applied to traditional markets to go after what they perceived as “bad or evil,” like crypto and blockchain technology, without considering the unintended consequences it could have on the global economy and global markets. When we start to change the rules for (…) the 700 trillion notional global derivatives markets because we’re trying to be creative and flex it to go after what we perceive to be a bad or evil, you know, crypto or blockchain, that is really breaking the fabric of our global markets.

2025-06-14T08:30:16,"This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash – Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast","The Dogecoin price has crashed alongside the rest of the crypto market, and this has led to the break of a very important support level. This crash below $0.18 has signaled a turn in the tide, and this could trigger the next wave of declines. A crypto analyst had previously predicted this market decline, calling it before it began. However, it is not all bad news for the meme coin as longer timeframes offer more bullish options as time goes by. Dogecoin Price Still Bullish On The Long-Term Crypto analyst Master Ananda forecasted in a TradingView post where the Dogecoin price could be headed next. At the time of the post, the Dogecoin price was still trading close to the $0.2 level, and the market was still on an upward trajectory. While positive sentiment seemed to be returning to the market at that time, the analyst was calling out the possibility of a pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Master Ananda explained that the Dogecoin price was still quite bearish, but this was only on the short-term timeframe. This leaves out only the long-term timeframe for the bullishness, and so far, the meme coin’s market trend seems to be playing out the way the crypto analyst predicted. He called for a correction, using the April 2025 low as a basis and the lower highs that had formed as a result. This had begun back in December 2024 when the Dogecoin price had begun putting in lower highs, suggesting that there was bearishness building up in the market. Presently, as the Dogecoin price has dropped back below the $0.18 support, the analyst simply pointed out that it was a continuation of the decline that had begun on May 11 after the market recovery. While this is bearish for the short-term, suggesting there could be a bit more correction to go, the analyst doesn’t expect it to last long. Where Could The DOGE Price Go From Here As for the bottom of the current Dogecoin price correction, Master Ananda expects the price to bottom above the April 7 lows, which were above $0.13. This would put the meme coin at around $0.15 before the bottom is in, and then the recovery is expected to begin. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Just Flashed A Golden Cross Amid Crypto Market Recovery The crypto analyst urged investors, especially those holding spot bags, to wait for the dust to settle. After this, he expects the altcoin to turn bullish again. For traders going short, he advises caution and not to hold the trade for too long, as the range is short. “We are very likely to get a higher low compared to 7-April,” Master Ananda predicted. “If too many leveraged positions are open though and the market wants to remove those, there can be a long wick that pierces support for the action to recover the next day.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/analyst-dogecoin-price-crash/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Dogecoin|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T08:06:31,"BTC Price Unfazed by Iran’s Retaliation Attack Against Israel, HYPE Rockets 8% (Weekend Watch)","Bitcoin’s price experienced substantial volatility yesterday when Israel struck Iran, but the asset has remained a lot calmer today when the roles reversed. Many altcoins have started to recover from the Friday crash, including HYPE, which has risen back above $42. BTC Calm Despite Attacks The business week started on the right foot for BTC as the asset broke out of last weekend’s consolidation range and shot above $110,000 on Monday. Although it was stopped there, it managed to remain close to that level for the next couple of days. More positive news emerged on Wednesday, including a trade deal between the US and China as well as better-than-expected CPI data, but BTC failed to maintain its run. Just the opposite, it lost some ground and went back down to under $107,000. The bulls took it north to $108,500 on Thursday, but the geopolitical tension in the Middle East skyrocketed that night as Israel fired countless missiles against Iran, killing over 70 people in the process. Bitcoin’s prices reacted immediately with a price plunge that drove it south by over five grand since Thursday’s peak to under $103,000. Nevertheless, it recovered some ground on Friday and even challenged $106,000 at one point. It couldn’t breach that level but still trades above $105,000 now, which is somewhat surprising as Iran retaliated against Israel last night. Still, there are some warning signs about its future price trajectory if it fails to remain above $100,000. For now, though, its market cap has jumped to almost $2.1 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Rebound Most altcoins suffered yesterday but are with minor gains on a daily scale. Ethereum has returned above $2,500 after a small increase, while Ripple’s cross-border token has defended the $2.15 support. SOL, DOGE, ADA, and AVAX are also slightly in the green, while BCH and SHIB have posted more impressive gains. However, HYPE has stolen the show once again from the larger-cap alts, having surged by almost 8%. As a result, the asset now trades close to its all-time high of roughly $43. Other notable gainers from the past day include WBT, Fartcoin, PI, and ICP. The total crypto market cap has recovered over $60 billion and is back to $3.4 trillion on CG.

2025-06-14T08:04:03,"SharpLink Gaming Makes $463M Ethereum Bet Amid Stock Plunge, Sparking “MicroStrategy Moment” for ETH","In a surprising turn of events, SharpLink Gaming has revealed the acquisition of an astounding 176,271 Ethereum (ETH) , worth around $463 million. The announcement, which came just hours after the company’s stock crashed 66% during pre-market trading, has sent ripples through the financial and crypto communities. SharpLink stands now as one of the most significant corporate holders of ETH. Comparisons have been immediately drawn between SharpLink and MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021. Even though the earlier collapse of SharpLink’s share price was eyebrow-raising, their ETH acquisition should be taken seriously. For one thing, it adds an intriguing twist to SharpLink’s long-term strategy to transform itself into a player in the digital assets space. Observers have noted that the timing of the acquisition—in the same week that SharpLink’s stock was getting docked for perceived shortcomings—might just be an instance of management trying to shore up an under-heralded story. Or it might just be an instance, as we often see in crypto, of centralization (hi, holding 38 million ETH!) breeding a not very good idea (hi, trying to be a player in a decentralized space). A Billion-Dollar War Chest and More ETH Likely on the Way SharpLink’s move is growing even more significant when viewed in the broader context of what the company is doing. SharpLink is currently in the process of raising a $1 billion funding round. It has already deployed into Ethereum nearly half of that total. Still, with over $500 million to play with, it could shift even more capital into expanding its Ethereum holdings. The Microstrategy moment for Ethereum has finally happened. Just now, SharpLink Gaming has announced an acquisition of 176,271 ETH worth $463 million. Interestingly, SharpLink Gaming crashed today 66% in pre-market and now they have come up with an announcement. Don't forget… pic.twitter.com/DR6Hlv2EdT — Cipher X (@Cipher2X) June 13, 2025 Speculation has now begun among analysts as to whether this is just the first step in a multi-phase acquisition strategy. If Ethereum’s price rises to the $2,800-$3,000 range over the next few weeks, as many bullish traders anticipate, it could well validate SharpLink’s gamble and maybe even kick off a broader trend among mid-cap tech companies to look for alternative reserve assets. SharpLink’s somewhat less publicized ETH play still has the potential to set off a second wave of institutional crypto accumulation. SharpLink might be too small a player in the Ethereum space for its investment to truly impact the trajectory of institutions accumulating ETH, but if it were to somehow wind up with either an obscene amount of ETH or some Ethereum-based technology, it could potentially affect the accumulation curve. This development also raises questions about SharpLink’s long-term intentions. Is the company pivoting toward a become Ethereum-centric financial entity, or is this simply a high-risk, high-reward treasury strategy to recover from market realities? As of now, the firm hasn’t put any bigger plans on the table, but its ETH buying spree suggests a strong conviction in Ethereum’s viability as a future fine tech. A Turning Point for Corporate Crypto Strategy? SharpLink’s shift might signal a fresh new look at an overarching crypto strategy among corporates—one that stretches beyond Bitcoin. Up until now, Bitcoin has largely dominated institutional treasuries, thanks to its perceived “digital gold” status and its first-mover advantage. But now, Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and emerging “Web3” technologies have more and more institutions looking its way. Following SharpLink’s buy-in, if Ethereum’s price were to appreciate considerably, other companies might start seeing ETH as more than just an asset for speculation, but rather as a serious component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. This could have some pretty earth-shattering effects on Ethereum—more corporate procurement, for one thing, makes ETH less available and more desirable, and that can take price appreciation not just to new highs but also into the next bull cycle. The speculation has already started in the market over which companies might follow the lead of SharpLink. Prospective candidates range from tech startups with loaded balance sheets to gaming firms, to fintechs. The door has now been opened for Ethereum to play a much larger and more impactful role in corporate finance strategies. Similarly to MicroStrategy’s experience with Bitcoin, SharpLink’s Ethereum investment will ultimately play out based on three factors: execution, timing, and market conditions. But one thing is certain: the game has changed, and Ethereum just had its “MicroStrategy moment.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $106,203.76 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 105,157.38084917 0.36% Market cap $ 2,090,318,416,519.80 Circulating Supply 19,878,000.00 Trading Volume $ 49,165,788,805.4232 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2, especially in April and May 2025. Bitcoin saw a strong and steady rally, driven by easing trade war tensions, pushing the price to a new all-time high of $ 112 K. Now, the question remains, Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June?. In early June, BTC is trying to hold support near the previous swing low of May after pulling back from its peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks sparked a short-term bounce from the 50-day EMA’s dynamic support. But on June 10th, momentum was halted, linked directly to rising geopolitical tensions, especially between Israel and Iran . However, Bitcoin is still facing resistance from a multi-month supply block, and is once again inching towards support near the previous swing low of May. if bearish pressure increases, the swing support zone becomes critical. A breakdown below this level could drag the price down to the $100K–$95K range in the near term. On the flip side, if it reverses from the swing support zone and manages to break June’s swing high, then the odds of clearing $112K are possible, and above this level, a certain strong momentum could take BTC price to a new high towards $120K by the end of June. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

2025-06-14T07:52:33,"Ethereum ETFs See Surging Demand as Inflows Hit Five Times the Weekly Average","Demand for Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is on the rise, and this may be a watershed moment for the largest altcoin to gain institutional adoption. Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of 154,000 ETH over the past week, which is five times their previous weekly average. If investors—including institutions—were not paying attention to Ethereum before now, they certainly are now. $ETH spot ETFs are heating up. This week alone, they’ve seen 154K #ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average. For context: the biggest single-day $ETH inflow this month was 77K #ETH on June 11th. pic.twitter.com/8Xlerbc6GX — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 The standout moment was June 11, the day on which ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of ETH for the month, with 77,000 ETH poured in. Not only was the scale of the figure quite notable, but it also suggested something interesting: A rebalancing in the ETF world between Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the longest time, Bitcoin has been the ETF darling, with inflows flowing to the tune of tens of thousands of BTC. But suddenly, it looks like Ethereum has caught up quite nicely. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have not seen nearly the same level of reception. This week’s total of 7,800 BTC inflows—while somewhat above average—pales in comparison to the peak we saw in May, when daily inflows reached as high as 7,900 BTC on May 23. Though Bitcoin reigns as the dominant asset in the world of crypto investments, Ethereum’s recent performance hints at rising interest in its broader ecosystem and long-term utility. Ethereum Futures Open Interest Tops $20 Billion In a further show of strength for Ethereum, cash-margined ETH futures open interest hit a record high this week, sailing past 20 billion dollars. This development indicates an upsurge in not-so-subtle trading activity, and an uptick in trading that Ethereum is a Thriving market for futures and options trading that the platform Ethereum is a park for possibilities that is often seen as a precursor to the implementation of the shift to Ethereum 2.0. Open interest is rising, and that signals the traders are gearing up for future moves. More and more, those moves don’t seem to involve direct ownership of ether, and in fact, traders appear to be perfectly content gaining exposure via stablecoins and other collateralized forms of banking. This aligns with another trend: the rise of derivatives in crypto trading. These are becoming a key short-term market driver. The increase in leverage does not seem to be an isolated or speculative occurrence. The concurrent upsurge in ETF inflows indicates that both institutional investors in the Ethereum spot market and traders in the futures market who are using leverage have a high level of confidence in Ethereum’s performance in the near term. Bitcoin Maintains Stability But Loses the Spotlight Despite Ethereum’s explosion of activity, Bitcoin ETFs continue to perform, if not steadily, then without much drama. This week, the ETFs reported inflows of 7,800 BTC, which is just an eyebrow-raising number without the context of what it means. The context is that these inflows are pretty much the same as what we saw last week and the week before that, at least in terms of not having any kind of noticeable increases or decreases. $ETH futures open interest (cash-margined) just hit a new all-time high – topping $20B. Despite a slight pullback from the $2.8K levels, leverage continues to build as traders load up using stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/XP3KmhkdJ1 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 12, 2025 Certainly, Ethereum ETF potential chatter is way more exciting than anything directly linked to Bitcoin, but that doesn’t mean Bitcoin ETFs aren’t doing their own exciting things, at least in a sense that it’s almost as if they’re functioning like a stablecoin at this point. Bitcoin still commands the lion’s share of attention among traditional financial players, not surprisingly because it is the original and, by far, the most recognized cryptocurrency. That said, Ethereum’s wider and more dynamic range of use cases—something that spans decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and infrastructure for layer-2 solutions—seems to be grabbing the notice of institutions that are looking for an even broader base of exposure to blockchain applications. Inflow data may also show a difference between ETH and BTC because of the larger market cycles and portfolio strategies—part of the natural evolution of an investable asset. Bitcoin, having already undergone a significant rotation of capital earlier this year post-ETF approval, was already benefitting from a more apparent positioning by institutional investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum is apparently only starting to see this same effect and benefit. Conclusion: A New Phase for Ethereum on Wall Street The sharp increase in inflows into ETH ETFs, together with inflows into futures that are setting all-time records, indicates that Ethereum is generating interest among a diverse array of investors. Whether these investors want longer-term exposure via a spot ETF or to express a directional view using high-leverage futures contracts, Ethereum is emerging as a go-to asset for many. Although Bitcoin is still the foundation for getting exposure to the world of cryptocurrencies, it is becoming increasingly clear that Ethereum is the true value proposition. Institutional investors now understand that Ethereum is not simply a representative alternative to Bitcoin. This is partly because the regulatory situation for cryptocurrencies has improved, and products like Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have matured. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-14T07:38:57,"Charles Hoskinson Proposes $100M ADA Treasury Shift to Boost Cardano DeFi","The post Charles Hoskinson Proposes $100M ADA Treasury Shift to Boost Cardano DeFi appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent YouTube video, Charles Hoskinson shared a major update on Cardano’s financial direction. He proposed using $100 million worth of ADA to strengthen stablecoin liquidity and bring Bitcoin into the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Low Stablecoin Liquidity Holds Cardano Back He started off by pointing out that Cardano does not have enough stablecoin liquidity. There is only about $33 million in stablecoins supporting over $330 million in total value locked (TVL). In comparison, Ethereum and Solana have way more stablecoin support, and Cardano is falling behind. “We have a treasury with about $1.5 billion of ADA, and yet there’s only about $30 million of stablecoins in the entire Cardano ecosystem,” he said. “That’s a problem.” Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 Hoskinson Proposes Bold Move- To fix this, Hoskinson is proposing a bold move: take 5–10% of the $1.2 billion Cardano treasury and convert it into a mix of native stablecoins like USDA, USDM, iUSD, and even some Bitcoin to help start Bitcoin-based DeFi on Cardano. The goal here is to generate yield from these assets like a sovereign wealth fund (like Norway or Abu Dhabi) and reinvest the profits back into ADA. This move could boost yields, improve liquidity, and speed up stablecoin adoption on Cardano. It may also help native stablecoins get listed on more exchanges and position Cardano as a strong player in the DeFi space. Will This Hurt ADA? Hoskinson believes that the $100 million move will not hurt ADA’s price. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands daily without visibly affecting the cryptocurrency’s price,” he said. He says that the market is strong and liquid enough to handle it, especially if done gradually using time-weighted average price algorithms and OTC trades. Governance in Progress Cardano is still figuring out how to handle governance. Charles wants the treasury fund plan ready for discussion at the Rare Evo Conference in August. He has already written a 40-page document outlining the idea and shared it with internal teams. Further, the team will gather feedback from Cardano’s DeFi projects and prepare a full proposal, possibly by the conference. Cardano Aims for Cross-Chain Growth and $1B Treasury Hoskinson says Cardano’s treasury will eventually become multi-asset. As more chains connect to Cardano, their fees could also flow into the treasury, building a large, diverse portfolio to support cross-chain growth. If the strategy works out, it could be a game-changer for Cardano. Stablecoin liquidity could rise to 33–40% of TVL, making the ecosystem much healthier. The treasury could grow to over $1 billion in stablecoins and Bitcoin. Cardano’s DeFi could become much more competitive on the global stage.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/charles-hoskinson-proposes-100m-ada-treasury-shift-to-boost-cardano-defi/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","News|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-14T07:25:16,"AERODROME FINANCE PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (June 14) – Aero Sustains Recovery, Will it Last Amid Latest Drops?","Posting over 30% gains in the last 24 hours despite the ongoing crypto meltdown, Aero remains strong on the intraday trading and looks ready for a massive rally following a new bullish formation. Following last week’s market recovery from a correctional phase, which was majorly triggered by Bitcoin’s bounce, several altcoins with Aero regained strength and posted notable gains after 7 days of buying. Unfortunately, the buying cooled off due to a new sell order days back. That caused a serious reduction in the past days, and the market is now bleeding out again, following a negative sentiment. The bleeding came as a result of Bitcoin’s drops, and as we can see, it has shown no signs of stopping yet. However, altcoin like Aero defies the odds and is now posting gains on the day. It currently appears strong and shows signs of bullishness on the daily chart with a higher high and higher low pattern in the past months. The latest bullish signal is supported by the $0.47 level. If it continues to play out, we can expect a major increase in the coming days. Surpassing the previous high should validate a big price movement in the future. Inversely, if Aero fails to advance higher, a dip below last week’s low could trigger a fresh breakdown to the yearly low before deciding where to head next. For now, the market is still in favour of the bulls. AERO’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The immediate resistance level for buying right now is $0.8. If Aero breaks above it, the next line of resistance would be $1, along with the $1.5 resistance level. There’s room for a pullback at $0.56. If the price drops below the $0.47 support level, the next support to keep in mind would be $0.375. Key Resistance Levels: $0.8, $1, $1.5 Key Support Levels: $0.56, $0.47, $0.375 Spot Price: $0.68 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-14T07:23:13,"Bitcoin’s Price Could Plunge Below $80K Amid Rising Tension and Large Holder Sell-Offs: Analyst Warns","It has been over two months since BTC’s price struggles that pushed it south hard, and the asset plummeted to under $75,000. This enhanced selling pressure transpired during the darkest hours of the global trade war started by US President Donald Trump. Although that political tension has improved a lot since then, with the US striking deals with many countries, including its main rival, China , there’s more uncertainty that has blown off in the past few days. This time, it’s a lot more harmful and has already taken many lives. Operation Rising Lion, launched by Israel on June 13, targeted more than 100 strategic military and nuclear sites in Iran, including facilities in Natanz and Fordow. The most recent reports suggest that the number of killed is nearing 100, which includes senior commanders and scientists, while the injured list is well above 300. Iran responded with Operation Vow of Truth 3, firing countless waves of missiles last night at central Israel, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and some targets north. The reported casualties are at least three, while dozens have been injured. While Israel and US President Trump categorized the initial strike as “ preemptive ,” aiming to disrupt Iran’s nuclear progress as the country refuses to sign such a deal, Tehran described its retaliation as defending its sovereignty against direct aggression. Impact on Bitcoin As it happened during the trade war, BTC’s price reacted immediately yesterday to Israel’s attack. In a matter of hours, it plunged from a daily peak of $108,500 to under $103,000. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $105,000, and it hasn’t been significantly influenced by Iran’s response. However, uncertainty persists, and the situation could escalate, potentially leading to further trouble. As such, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that bitcoin needs to stay within a six-digit price territory; otherwise, it risks plummeting back to under $80,000. #Bitcoin $BTC needs to hold above $100,000 to stay on track for a breakout from this channel. Losing $100,000 increases the odds of a downswing to the channel’s lower boundary at $78,500. pic.twitter.com/cDjURKGlHP — Ali (@ali_charts) June 13, 2025 Large Holders Start to Sell One of the initial warning signs that have appeared is the attitude change by whales. As reported earlier this week, some of the long-term BTC investors had started to dispose of small portions of their holdings, but that was even before the attacks occurred. Martinez noted after the first strike that some of the largest BTC whales—those with more than 1,000 bitcoins—have begun “trimming” their positions. If these sell-offs continue or intensify, they will not only increase the selling pressure on BTC but can also be mimicked by smaller investors.

2025-06-14T07:04:33,"Billionaire Warren Buffett Bets $196,700,000,000 on Several Assets As Oracle of Omaha Prepares To Step Down","Billionaire Warren Buffett has allocated $196.7 billion to a small group of assets ahead of his departure from Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett, who plans on ending his legendary 60 year tenure at the end of 2025, has placed more than 70% of the firm’s assets into just seven stocks. The stocks reflect Buffett’s time-tested method of handpicking assets for their resilience and consumer appeal – while Berkshire continues to hoard a staggering $347.7 billion in cash. Here’s a look at where the Oracle of Omaha is placing his bets before the curtains on his legendary career close. • Apple ($58.9 billion allocated): Apple remains Berkshire’s top holding, although Buffett has sold more than half of the firm’s stake in the tech giant since 2023. • American Express ($43.6 billion allocated): A bet on the financial giant’s premium customer base and payment network. • Coca-Cola ($28.4 billion allocated): A longtime Buffett favorite with global brand recognition and consistent dividends. • Bank of America ($27.8 billion allocated): A top holding despite Buffett significantly trimming his stake and reducing bank investments overall. • Chevron ($17.3 billion allocated): An energy giant offering strong dividends, aligning with Buffett’s love for reliable cash flows. • Occidental Petroleum ($12.3 billion allocated): Buffett’s longstanding bet on energy continues with this oil and gas leader. • Kraft Heinz ($8.4 billion allocated): Another consumer goods giant and longtime Buffett favorite. Buffett has selected Greg Abel to be his successor next year, entrusting him to continue Berkshire’s legacy of prudent investing and long-term value creation.

2025-06-14T07:00:48,"Bitcoin To See ‘Choppy’ Next Few Weeks, Will BTC Retest The Range Lows?","After hitting a one-week low on Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim the key $104,000-$105,000 area as support, but some analysts have warned that a visit to its range’s lows could be in BTC’s short-term future if volatility continues. Related Reading: ONDO To Repeat 2024’s ‘Parabolic’ Run? Analyst Anticipates 130% Rally Soon Bitcoin to Continue Choppy Performance On Thursday afternoon, Bitcoin dropped 5.5% to the $102,000 support fueled by the news of the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid the market pullback, the flagship crypto failed to hold its $108,000-$110,000 three-day range, falling to the mid-zone of its post-November breakout range. Notably, BTC had just recovered from last week’s retest of the $100,000 level, reclaiming the key $106,800 area as support earlier this week. Daan Crypto Trades noted that the cryptocurrency “saw a clear trigger on that retest of the range high,” driven by the headlines of the Middle East turmoil, as it is “still quite a volatile and headline-driven market currently.” Bitcoin took the liquidity above and below its local price range, the analyst explained, adding that it is “already starting to trade more like the choppy (pre) summer environment” he had forecasted. Despite the drop, the analyst highlighted that the range high remains the key level for a larger move up: I think the range high is a key area for the Bulls to hold on to. If not, I think there’s a case to be made for a local high to be put in and for the market to move back further within this range. At this point, I’m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possibly beyond). However, he suggested investors be cautious until BTC price breaks back above the range high convincingly and holds it as support on the higher timeframes. “Don’t chop yourself up in the next few weeks/months,” he warned. Volatility Could Send BTC To Range Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted a potential double top pattern forming on BTC’s 4H chart, noting that if the price didn’t bounce from the previous descending resistance, reclaimed a week ago, it could further drop into the mid-zone of its range. According to the analysis, if it loses the mid-range, BTC could risk a retest of the range lows, around the $90,000-$92,000 area. Similarly, market watcher Merlijn The Trader suggested that Bitcoin could fill the lower CME gaps if the war narrative intensifies. BTC opened two CME gaps between the end of April and the start of May, situated at the $92,500 and $97,300 levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the trader considers that this could serve as a discount entry for investors, as BTC “already left higher CME gaps open,” signaling that a rebound to the levels is likely. Moreover, he noted that Bitcoin is displaying the same structure as last year, which could hint at a massive rally brewing. In 2024, the cryptocurrency faced rejection from a multi-month descending resistance following its all-time high (ATH) rally, which set the Range high level. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead? According to the post, after the liquidity grab, BTC broke out of the key downtrend line, was rejected from the range high, and retested the descending resistance as support before a new rally. In 2025, Bitcoin appears to be following this path, currently retesting the descending resistance after the breakout. “If you know the pattern, you know what comes next,” he concluded.

2025-06-14T06:59:15,"Are Cardano Whales Dumping ADA Due to Charles Hoskinson’s Latest Proposal?","TL;DR Cardano whales have changed their behavior toward the asset by starting to dispose of massive ADA quantities. The asset’s price experienced some notable volatility as of late, not just because of the ongoing geopolitical tension but also due to Hoskinson’s latest proposal. Whales Sell CryptoPotato reported at the start of the business week that large ADA holders, those with investments of somewhere between 100 million and a billion tokens, have continued to accumulate. In the span of just 48 hours, they expanded their holdings by 120 million ADA. However, they seem to have changed their attitude once again since then. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez informed that these large entities have disposed of more than 270 million ADA in just a week. In terms of USD value, this stash is worth over $170 million. Whales have sold over 270 million #Cardano $ADA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/SKd94mj99J — Ali (@ali_charts) June 13, 2025 Such big sell-offs increase the selling pressure of the underlying asset and are typically followed by smaller investors doing the same. ADA’s price felt the consequences in the past few days as it plunged from $0.71 to under $0.62 before it recovered some ground to the current $0.636. Some analysts warned that ADA could drop further to around $0.5 if it doesn’t invalidate a head and shoulders pattern that it’s currently breaking down. While the most evident reason behind this price crash could be related to the escalating geopolitical tension between Iran, Israel, and the US, there’s another possibility that involves more internal changes. ADA for BTC? Charles Hoskinson, the brain behind the Cardano ecosystem, proposed earlier this week that the treasury should exchange $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the network’s DeFi capabilities. The responses were mixed, with some praising the move, while others warned that it could increase the selling pressure on ADA even more. However, Hoskinson was quick to refute these rumors, indicating that there’s enough OTC demand from institutions for ADA to cover any potential pressure. “The belief that Cardano DeFi is improving will offset the sale volume of ADA from a modest divestment (and yes, this is modest.)” This is the madness of trying to do anything with the treasury. People who have never traded large amounts of Ada presume that any trade will result in catastrophic harm to the price, using ChatGPT as the source for their claims.

According to an SEC filing dated June 13, the agency “declared effective” TMTG’s Form S-3 registration statement, which the company filed on June 6. This form allows U.S. corporations to register a variety of securities, including stocks, options and different debt instruments. On the same day, TMTG also filed its final prospectus with the SEC. As outlined in the filing, TMTG registered the resale of roughly 56 million shares, along with another 29 million shares tied to convertible notes. These debt and equity agreements involved about 50 investors and generated the full $2.3 billion that the company plans to hold in Bitcoin. The registration statement also establishes a universal shelf, giving TMTG added flexibility to raise funds or issue securities in the future. Despite this, the firm has stated it has “no immediate plans” to sell any securities under the shelf. Chief Executive and President Devin Nunes commented on the filing, saying, “We’re aggressively implementing our plans to expand the Company, our offerings, and our capabilities.” He further added, “By simultaneously enhancing and growing our social media platform, TV streaming platform, and our fintech brand while establishing a Bitcoin treasury, we aim to continue rapidly transforming Trump Media into an indispensable company for the expanding customer base of the Patriot Economy.” TMTG’s stock dipped on the same trading day On the same trading day, TMTG’s shares dipped 2.06 percent, closing at $19.52, according to Google Finance data . Stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. Source: Google Finance This move follows TMTG’s May 27 announcement that it had raised $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, a deal the company had initially denied in earlier reports. Nunes described Bitcoin a financial freedom instrument at that time, adding that Trump Media would keep the cryptocurrency as a key asset. He said, “Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Beyond its treasury holdings, TMTG is also pursuing a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain analytics firm Arkham noted in a May 28 post on X that “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?” Later on June 5, TMTG filed the launch of a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC, stating, “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of Bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of Bitcoin.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-media-receives-sec-approval/,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","News|BTC|TMTG",cryptocompare
2025-06-14T05:30:39,"Ethereum ETF Frenzy: Inflows Jump 5x While Bitcoin Stalls","Data shows the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen weekly inflows five times the recent average, while Bitcoin has seen a slowdown in momentum. Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Seen 154,000 ETH In Inflows This Week In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the netflow related to the US-based Ethereum spot ETFs. The “spot ETFs” refer to investment vehicles that allow an alternate means of exposure to a given asset. This means that with a spot ETF, a trader can ‘invest’ into an asset without having to directly own it. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this is especially relevant, as the ETFs trade on traditional platforms. Some investors may not want to fiddle with digital asset exchanges and wallets, so the ETFs offer them a familiar path into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals The option of the spot ETFs is a relatively recent one in the sector, with Bitcoin’s version gaining approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the start of 2024 and Ethereum’s in mid-2024. Below is a chart that shows how the netflows related to the latter’s spot ETFs have looked during the past month. From the graph, it’s visible that the Ethereum US spot ETFs have been witnessing net inflows for the last few weeks, a sign that there has been demand for the coin from the traditional investors. “This week alone, they’ve seen 154K ETH in inflows – 5x higher than their recent weekly average,” notes Glassnode. “For context: the biggest single-day ETH inflow this month was 77K ETH on June 11th.” While the trend has been that of growth for Ethereum, it has looked a bit more mixed when it comes to the number one digital asset, Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin US spot ETFs have also seen positive netflows this week. The scale of the inflows, however, hasn’t been anything impressive, as only around 7,800 BTC has entered into the ETFs. This is above average, but far lower than the highs witnessed in May, when at one point the daily inflow had reached a peak of 7,900 BTC, more than the inflows for the entire current week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos Last week, the Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed an outright negative netflow, so it seems the momentum has recently just been slower for the asset. In contrast, things have looked much more green for Ethereum indeed. ETH Price While Ethereum has been seeing consistent ETF inflows, its price has still underperformed against Bitcoin over the past day as it has dropped to $2,540, a decline of 7% compared to BTC’s 2% loss.

2025-06-14T05:15:21,"EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses","The post EU Crypto Rules Spark Backlash Over Fast-Track Licenses appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Europe rolls out its new MiCA rules , major crypto companies are lining up to get licensed and operate across the EU. But some regulators are worried that things are moving too fast. According to Reuters , Gemini, the crypto platform founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is about to receive a license in Malta, the EU’s smallest country. This would give them the green light to operate across all 27 member states. This comes shortly after Malta approved licenses for OKX and Crypto.com, just weeks after MiCA came into effect. Malta’s Fast-Track Approvals Face Scrutiny Malta’s fast approvals are raising eyebrows among EU regulators, especially under the watch of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). France’s AMF has warned that weak oversight could lead to a “race to the bottom.” One official even raised concerns over whether countries with smaller regulatory teams, like Malta, can provide adequate oversight. ESMA is now reviewing Malta’s process and is expected to release a report soon. In response, Malta’s regulator said that it has issued four licenses so far, and credited its speed to its past experience and the “in-depth understanding acquired over the years.” Malta’s regulator said it follows strict anti-money laundering rules. OKX also called the process rigorous and said that compliance is a top priority. Coinbase Eyes Luxembourg License Elsewhere, Luxembourg is soon expected to approve a license for Coinbase, the first U.S. crypto firm in the S&P 500. While its team there may be small, Coinbase has 200 staff in Europe, and it plans to hire 20 more in Luxembourg by the end of the year. Luxembourg pushed back on claims that it is being too lenient on crypto. It suggested that other countries might just be trying to win over crypto firms. Notably, Coinbase’s move is seen as a setback for Ireland, whose central bank once compared crypto to a Ponzi scheme. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Czech Opposition Pushes No-Confidence Vote Over $45M Bitcoin Deal Scandal , EU Split on MiCA Enforcement At the centre of the issue is keeping the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market in check. MiCA is designed to bring crypto under the same regulatory standards as traditional finance, but if countries apply the rules differently, it could weaken MiCA’s overall impact. Countries are still divided in the EU over how to enforce crypto rules. There are ongoing talks about giving more power to ESMA. ESMA’s chief Verena Ross wants stronger oversight, but some countries are hesitant to increase their authority. How these early licenses are handled will likely set the tone for how the EU balances crypto growth and investor protection going forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T05:08:44,"Trump Quietly Earned $57M from Family-Backed Crypto, New Filing Shows","The post Trump Quietly Earned $57M from Family-Backed Crypto, New Filing Shows appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Office of Government Ethics has released Donald Trump’s 2025 financial disclosure, a massive 234-page report. It reveals that Trump earned over $57 million from World Liberty Financial , a crypto firm linked to his family, and holds a huge amount of WLFI tokens. The report also lists several other sources of income, showing just how much Trump is profiting across various ventures. Here’s a breakdown of the key earnings. Trump’s Stronghold In Crypto The disclosure , made public by the Office of Government Ethics, revealed that Trump earned $57.35 million from selling tokens linked to his family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. He also holds 15.75 billion governance tokens, making this one of his biggest income sources so far. Apart from this, last week Forbes reported that Donald Trump’s net worth has climbed to $5.6 billion. Interestingly, nearly half of his liquid assets are now tied to crypto. In less than a year, Trump has made over $1.2 billion from crypto-related ventures alone. Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise. All of it makes the president money, but how much? (Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 — Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 Interestingly, Trump’s involvement here shows a change in attitude. He was once critical of digital currencies, but now seems to be embracing them, especially when the profits are this high. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Media Gets SEC Nod for Bitcoin Treasury Filing: What Next? , Big Profits Beyond Crypto Apart from crypto, Trump continues to make millions from his well-known real estate empire. His Florida properties—including Mar-a-Lago, Doral, and Jupiter—brought in over $217 million. He also cashed in on his brand name. The disclosure shows: $3 million from a coffee table book. $2.8 million from Trump watches. $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances. $1.15 million from NFT licensing and royalties. $1 million from collectible guitars. Add to that another $700,000+ from speaking gigs—and it’s clear Trump’s income streams remain diverse and many more. Debts and Legal Troubles Still Loom The filing also lists over $100 million in unpaid real estate loans. Trump is still battling several legal cases, including the $454 million civil fraud judgment and $88 million defamation payout, though both are currently paused due to appeals. Despite these liabilities, Trump’s crypto earnings stand out. They show that even traditional political figures are now diving into digital assets, and walking away with millions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-14T04:13:00,"Bitcoin DeFi Comes To Cardano, Experts Believe ADA Price Could Surge Past $5 And More In 2025","Bitcoin DeFi is now possible on Cardano, which could potentially drive the ADA price significantly higher in 2025. The innovative way Cardano works and its rapid expansion present intriguing potential in the cryptocurrency market. Will ADA surge above $5 as expected? Or could you gain more by investing in a different altcoin? Read on to find out how these changes could change the future of Cardano and the crypto sector. Cardano integrates Bitcoin DeFi Cardano has made news by integrating Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem. With the Cardinal Protocol, those who own Bitcoin (BTC) can now use Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem directly. This means that Bitcoin’s safety and ability to be traded are the same as Cardano’s ability to be programmed and its smart contract features. Source: CoinBureau on X The integration uses MuSig2 technology, which lets Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) be wrapped and used in Cardano’s ecosystem without the need for middlemen. This method keeps Bitcoin safe and in the hands of its owner and it also lets people utilize it in Cardano’s powerful DeFi apps. The new feature has made Bitcoin more like Cardano’s decentralized apps, which are a key part of DeFi. Experts say that this will get more people to utilise Cardano because it mixes Bitcoin and Cardano in a way that hasn’t been done before. This connection lets those who own Bitcoin join Cardano’s developing ecosystem without giving up their Bitcoin. Experts tip ADA price to eclipse $5 in 2025 Many experts believe that ADA, Cardano’s native token, might achieve new highs in 2025 now that Bitcoin is part of Cardano’s DeFi. Some predictions suggest that the price could increase significantly, potentially reaching $5 by the end of 2025. ADA is more appealing to investors since it links Bitcoin’s liquidity to Cardano’s ecosystem. ADA is a popular choice for people who want long-term growth because of its unique consensus method and its platform that can grow and use less energy. ADA’s price could surge due to the momentum from Bitcoin’s integration into Cardano. Source: Coinglass via CoinCentral Analysts are sure that Cardano will have a great year in 2025. ADA’s value could increase significantly with the Bitcoin DeFi integration, potentially surpassing $5, which has never been achieved before. Experts believe Remittix has a higher growth rate than ADA While Cardano’s future looks promising with Bitcoin DeFi, some experts believe that Remittix, a new altcoin, could experience higher growth rates than ADA in the coming years. Remittix aims to revolutionize cross-border payments by offering a platform where users can send crypto directly to bank accounts in fiat currency. Remittix has already raised over $15.6 million in its presale, showing strong investor interest. Many view Remittix as a solution to the pain points that traditional financial systems and even Bitcoin face in everyday transactions. As Remittix continues to develop, it could offer more immediate utility than ADA. While ADA focuses on long-term development with its smart contract system, Remittix has already begun making waves in the real-world market. This practical utility could drive demand for the token, making it a strong contender for growth. Experts are particularly excited about Remittix’s potential to disrupt the payments market. Suppose the project can execute its goals and capture the attention of businesses and consumers. Conclusion Cardano’s integration of Bitcoin into its DeFi ecosystem is an exciting new step that could potentially push the price of ADA above $5 by 2025. The Cardinal Protocol’s technology has made Bitcoin and Cardano more important in decentralised finance. Cardano is now a major participant in this field. However, Remittix has considerable room to expand, and it may become a more effective version of ADA by providing investors and customers with real-world use cases that they can relate to.

2025-06-14T04:00:10,"Bitcoin Drops Below $105K as Binance Net Taker Volume Turns Deep Red","Bitcoin’s recent rally appears to have paused as the asset declined to just above $104,000 following a 2.1% drop over the past 24 hours. This latest movement signals a potential shift in short-term market momentum, with traders increasingly opting to exit positions. While the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced similar pullbacks, Bitcoin’s trajectory is attracting closer scrutiny due to its influence on overall sentiment and market structure. Analysts are looking into how external factors, particularly geopolitical developments, are impacting trading behavior. One such development is the reported military engagement between Israel and Iran on June 13, which triggered sell pressure across high-risk assets, including digital currencies. Amid these events, key metrics on Binance, particularly Net Taker Volume, are showing increased sell-side dominance, suggesting short-term volatility may continue. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside Binance Net Taker Volume Hits Multi-Week Low Amid Bitcoin Panic Selling According to on-chain analyst Amr Taha on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume on Binance fell to -$197 million, the most negative reading since June 6. This metric, which compares aggressive selling to aggressive buying, indicates heightened urgency among traders to sell at market prices, bypassing limit orders. The seven-hour moving average (7HMA) has remained in negative territory since June 12, reinforcing the current downward pressure. Historically, such extremes in net taker volume have been linked to local price bottoms, as they often signal panic-induced capitulation by retail and overleveraged traders. Taha highlighted that a similar event occurred on June 6, followed by a 4% rebound in Bitcoin’s price within 24 hours. The implication is that, while aggressive selling may signal weakness, it also presents conditions that have previously preceded price reversals. Geopolitical Shock Triggers Liquidation Cascade, May Signal Local Bottom Taha also pointed to the geopolitical backdrop, specifically the sudden escalation between Israel and Iran, as a major catalyst for recent market behavior. News of the strike led to a surge in liquidation activity, especially among long-leveraged positions. The correlation between the timing of the conflict and the spike in Binance sell volume suggests that traders are reacting to broader market uncertainty, contributing to downward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rate Flips Again And History Says A Rally Is Around The Corner Despite this, Taha still views these conditions as potentially bullish in the medium term. Heavy selling often flushes out weaker hands, creating opportunities for long-term holders or institutional participants to accumulate positions at lower prices.

2025-06-14T02:50:00,"Geopolitical Risk: Iran Skips Talks, Sparks Critical Uncertainty","BitcoinWorld Geopolitical Risk: Iran Skips Talks, Sparks Critical Uncertainty In the fast-paced world of global affairs, unexpected turns can ripple across markets, sometimes even touching the realm of digital assets. A recent announcement from Iran serves as a stark reminder that Geopolitical Risk remains a significant factor on the world stage. This development, while centered on diplomatic negotiations, highlights the interconnectedness of global events and their potential, albeit indirect, influence on various sectors, including the broader financial landscape that encompasses the Crypto Market Impact . Understanding the Latest Development: Why Did Iran Skip the Talks? According to reports from Iranian state television, Iran will not be participating in nuclear talks with the United States that were scheduled for Sunday. This decision introduces a fresh layer of Global Uncertainty into already complex diplomatic efforts aimed at reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal , formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The planned talks were seen by some as a potential pathway to de-escalation and a step towards bringing both the U.S. and Iran back into full compliance with the 2015 agreement. The deal, which curbed Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, prompting Iran to gradually reduce its own commitments. The exact reasons cited by Iran for skipping this specific round of talks were not immediately detailed in initial reports, but such decisions often stem from a complex interplay of factors: Leverage: Iran may be seeking to gain leverage in future negotiations by signaling dissatisfaction or demanding concessions before returning to the table. Internal Politics: Domestic political considerations within Iran can heavily influence its negotiating stance and willingness to engage. Response to External Events: The decision could be a reaction to recent actions or statements from the U.S., other parties to the deal (like the UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China), or regional adversaries. Procedural Disagreements: There might be disagreements over the format, agenda, or participants of the planned talks. Regardless of the specific immediate cause, the outcome is clear: a delay, and potentially a setback, in diplomatic efforts, increasing Geopolitical Risk . How Does Geopolitical Risk Connect to the Crypto Market Impact? At first glance, nuclear negotiations in the Middle East might seem worlds away from the decentralized ledgers and digital currencies of the crypto market. However, global markets are highly sensitive to shifts in Geopolitical Risk and Global Uncertainty . When major geopolitical events occur, they can trigger broader market reactions: Increased Volatility: Uncertainty often leads to increased volatility across asset classes as investors react to potential instability. Flight to Safety: In times of heightened risk, some investors may move capital out of perceived riskier assets (like stocks, or sometimes, cryptocurrencies) into traditional safe havens (like gold or certain government bonds). Impact on Traditional Finance: Geopolitical events can affect oil prices, currency exchange rates, and stock markets. These shifts in traditional finance can indirectly influence sentiment and liquidity in the crypto market. Regulatory Concerns: Geopolitical tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly regarding their potential use in circumventing sanctions. While the Bitcoin Price and the broader crypto market are driven by their own unique fundamentals (adoption rates, technological developments, halving cycles, etc.), they do not exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly integrated into the global financial ecosystem and can react to macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds. Exploring the Iran Nuclear Deal: What’s at Stake? The potential revival of the Iran Nuclear Deal is significant for several reasons, all of which contribute to the level of Global Uncertainty : Table: Key Aspects of the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) Aspect Description Significance Nuclear Restrictions Limits on uranium enrichment levels and stockpiles, restrictions on advanced centrifuges, intrusive inspections by the IAEA. Aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Breakdown increases proliferation risk. Sanctions Relief Lifting of international sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program (U.S. sanctions largely reimposed after 2018 withdrawal). Intended to provide economic benefits to Iran. Reimposition severely impacts Iran’s economy. Monitoring & Verification Robust inspection regime by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Ensures transparency and verification of Iran’s compliance. Reduced cooperation increases opacity. Parties Involved Iran, P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, UK, U.S.) and the European Union. Requires consensus and cooperation among multiple global powers, adding complexity. A failure to revive the deal could lead to Iran further expanding its nuclear activities, potentially bringing it closer to weapons-grade material. This scenario would dramatically heighten Geopolitical Risk in the Middle East and globally, potentially leading to regional conflict or further international isolation of Iran. Such outcomes are precisely the kind of events that can send jitters through financial markets, contributing to Global Uncertainty and potentially influencing the Crypto Market Impact . Historical Perspective: Geopolitical Events and Market Reactions History provides numerous examples of how geopolitical events have impacted markets. While the crypto market is relatively new compared to traditional finance, it has shown sensitivity to major global shocks: The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 caused a significant, albeit temporary, crash across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as initial Global Uncertainty peaked. Regional conflicts or significant political crises in the past have often correlated with increased volatility in oil prices and stock markets, effects that can spill over into other asset classes. Even events like major elections or policy shifts in key global economies can introduce uncertainty that affects investor sentiment worldwide, influencing decisions related to assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. The current situation with the Iran Nuclear Deal , while not an immediate crisis, is a persistent source of Geopolitical Risk that market participants monitor. A sudden negative turn could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially affecting the Bitcoin Price and the broader market. What Are the Challenges and Risks Ahead? Reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal faces significant challenges: Trust Deficit: Deep mistrust exists between Iran and the U.S., making direct negotiation difficult. Sanctions vs. Nuclear Steps: Disagreements persist on the sequencing and extent of U.S. sanctions relief and Iran’s return to nuclear compliance. External Pressure: Regional adversaries of Iran lobby against the deal’s revival. Escalation Risk: Continued failure to find a diplomatic path increases the risk of escalation, either through further Iranian nuclear advancements or regional tensions. These challenges perpetuate Global Uncertainty and underscore the ongoing nature of Geopolitical Risk associated with this issue. For market participants, this means this is not a ‘one-off’ event but a situation that requires ongoing monitoring due to its potential for sudden shifts that could have a Crypto Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating Uncertainty While it’s impossible to predict market movements based solely on geopolitical news, understanding the potential impact of events like the stalled Iran Nuclear Deal is crucial for informed decision-making. For those interested in the crypto market, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major geopolitical developments, even those seemingly unrelated to crypto. Understand how events causing Global Uncertainty have historically affected markets. Recognize Interconnectedness: Appreciate that the Crypto Market Impact can be influenced by macro factors, including Geopolitical Risk , not just internal crypto news. Monitor Sentiment: Observe how traditional markets (stocks, oil, gold) react to such news, as this can sometimes provide clues about broader risk appetite that may affect the Bitcoin Price and altcoins. Risk Management: Ensure your investment strategy accounts for potential volatility driven by external factors. This might involve diversification or setting clear entry/exit points. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be triggered by news events, the long-term trajectory of the crypto market is driven by fundamental adoption and technological progress. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on single news items. Understanding the landscape of Geopolitical Risk helps investors contextualize market movements and make more resilient decisions in the face of Global Uncertainty . The situation with the Iran Nuclear Deal is a prime example of an external factor that contributes to this complex global backdrop. Conclusion: Monitoring the Horizon Iran’s decision to skip scheduled nuclear talks with the U.S. is a significant diplomatic setback that elevates Geopolitical Risk . While the direct, immediate Crypto Market Impact might not be apparent, this development contributes to the overarching climate of Global Uncertainty that influences all financial markets. The future of the Iran Nuclear Deal remains precarious, and potential escalations or resolutions will continue to be watched closely by global observers and market participants alike. For those navigating the crypto space, recognizing that events far beyond the blockchain can create ripples is key to developing a robust and informed approach to investment in assets like Bitcoin Price and beyond. Staying informed about such critical global developments is an essential part of understanding the broader forces that can shape the market landscape.

2025-06-14T02:40:03,"Urgent: Israel Missile Sirens Ring, Raising Fears of Market Volatility and Crypto Impact","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Israel Missile Sirens Ring, Raising Fears of Market Volatility and Crypto Impact News of missile sirens activated across Israel following confirmation of a launch from Yemen has immediately captured global attention. While the immediate focus is on the humanitarian and security implications, for participants in the financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, such events are closely watched for their potential to trigger significant shifts. Understanding the Geopolitical Tension Behind the Israel Missile Event The report confirms an Israel missile alert triggered by a launch originating from Yemen. This incident is not isolated but occurs within a broader context of escalating regional tensions. Yemen has been a flashpoint for conflict, and actions originating from there impacting Israel represent a significant development. This particular event underscores the complex and volatile geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Several factors contribute to the heightened geopolitical tension in the region: Ongoing conflicts and proxy wars involving regional and international powers. Disputes over territory, political influence, and religious differences. The involvement of non-state actors capable of launching cross-border attacks. The intricate web of alliances and rivalries that can quickly escalate localized incidents into broader confrontations. An confirmed Yemen launch targeting Israel is a direct manifestation of these underlying tensions, raising concerns about potential retaliation and further escalation across the region. How Does Geopolitical Tension Influence Market Volatility? Financial markets, including traditional assets like stocks, bonds, oil, and gold, are highly sensitive to geopolitical events. Increased geopolitical tension typically introduces uncertainty and fear, leading investors to reassess risk exposure. This often results in: Flight to Safety: Capital tends to flow into assets perceived as safe havens, such as gold, certain government bonds (like US Treasuries), and sometimes the US dollar. Increased Volatility: Prices of riskier assets (like stocks and many commodities) can experience sharp swings as traders react to news, rumors, and speculation about the potential impact of the conflict. Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts in key regions can disrupt global supply chains, affecting commodity prices (especially oil and gas) and potentially impacting inflation. Changes in Investor Sentiment: Overall market confidence can be shaken, leading to broader sell-offs or a reluctance to invest until the situation stabilizes. The news of an Israel missile alert following a Yemen launch fits squarely into the category of events that can fuel this kind of market volatility . Exploring the Potential Crypto Impact Given that cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and are increasingly integrated into the global financial landscape, they are not immune to the effects of major geopolitical events. The potential crypto impact from events like the recent Israel missile incident can be multifaceted: Historically, the reaction of the crypto market to geopolitical tension has been debated. Some argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ could act as a safe haven asset, independent of traditional financial systems and government control. Under this narrative, increased global instability might lead investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin, driving its price up. However, the reality is often more complex. Crypto markets are still relatively young and can be highly correlated with traditional risk assets, particularly technology stocks. In times of broad market panic or deleveraging, investors may sell off all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, to raise cash or cover margin calls. Therefore, increased market volatility stemming from geopolitical events could also lead to downward pressure on crypto prices. What Factors Determine the Crypto Market’s Reaction? The specific crypto impact of the Yemen launch and resulting Israel missile alerts will depend on several factors: Scale of Escalation: A contained incident might have minimal lasting impact, while a significant escalation into a broader regional conflict could trigger a more severe market reaction. Global Economic Context: The state of the global economy (inflation, interest rates, recession fears) at the time of the event can amplify or dampen its effects on markets. Market Sentiment: The prevailing sentiment in the crypto market (bullish, bearish, or neutral) before the event can influence how it reacts. A market already under pressure might be more susceptible to negative news. Correlation with Traditional Markets: The degree to which crypto is currently correlated with stocks and other risk assets will play a significant role. Narrative Strength: The strength of the ‘digital gold’ or safe haven narrative for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the specific event. Potential Scenarios for Crypto Impact: Based on past reactions and current market dynamics, here are a few potential scenarios for the crypto impact following the news of the Yemen launch and Israel missile alerts: Scenario Description Potential Crypto Reaction Reasoning Limited Impact / Quick Recovery Incident remains isolated, no major escalation. Minor dip followed by quick recovery or sideways movement. Market assesses the event as not significantly changing the broader economic/geopolitical outlook. Increased Volatility / Short-Term Dip News creates initial panic; broader market sell-off. Prices dip alongside stocks; increased trading volume and price swings. Crypto acts as a risk asset, sold off during general market fear and deleveraging. Flight to Safety Narrative Emerges Significant escalation; traditional systems perceived as vulnerable. Bitcoin (and potentially other select crypto) sees inflows; outperforms traditional risk assets. Investors seek non-sovereign, decentralized assets as a hedge against geopolitical instability. (Less common scenario currently) Sustained Downtrend (if part of larger crisis) Incident is part of a prolonged, escalating regional or global crisis impacting the global economy. Crypto market experiences a sustained downturn, possibly steeper than traditional markets due to higher beta. Broader economic fallout, loss of confidence, and continued risk-off sentiment dominate. As of the immediate aftermath of the report, the market reaction is being closely monitored. Initial news often leads to knee-jerk reactions, and it takes time to assess the true potential for escalation and its lasting effect on global stability and financial markets. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Events like the Yemen launch causing Israel missile alerts serve as a stark reminder of how quickly the global landscape can change and impact financial markets. For those holding or trading cryptocurrencies, navigating this potential market volatility requires a thoughtful approach. Stay Informed, But Be Critical Keep track of reliable news sources regarding the geopolitical situation. However, be wary of sensationalism and rumors that can exacerbate panic. Focus on verified information from reputable outlets and official statements. Assess Your Risk Tolerance and Portfolio Geopolitical shocks are part of the investing landscape. Review your portfolio allocation. Are you comfortable with the potential downside if markets react negatively? Consider whether your current holdings align with your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance in light of increased uncertainty. Avoid Emotional Decisions Sudden news and market drops can trigger fear and panic selling. Conversely, a quick rebound might lead to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Try to stick to your pre-defined investment strategy. Emotional trading during periods of high market volatility often leads to poor outcomes. Consider Diversification While diversification within crypto (holding various coins) is important, also consider your overall asset allocation across different asset classes. However, during systemic shocks driven by geopolitical events, correlations between asset classes can sometimes increase. Think Long-Term For long-term crypto investors, short-term geopolitical shocks might be viewed as temporary noise. Historically, markets tend to recover from such events over time, provided they don’t trigger a sustained global crisis. Consider whether short-term price movements should alter your long-term conviction in the underlying technology and adoption trends. Manage Your Leverage If you are trading with leverage, periods of high market volatility significantly increase the risk of liquidation. Geopolitical events can cause rapid and large price swings, making leveraged positions particularly vulnerable. Conclusion: Monitoring the Crypto Impact Amidst Rising Tensions The news of missile sirens across Israel following a launch from Yemen is a serious geopolitical development with potential ramifications far beyond the immediate vicinity. For global financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space, it introduces a new layer of uncertainty and the potential for increased market volatility . While the immediate crypto impact remains to be fully seen and will depend on how the situation evolves, investors should be prepared for potential price swings. The incident highlights the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets. Staying informed, managing risk prudently, and avoiding impulsive decisions are crucial strategies for navigating these turbulent times. The situation remains fluid, and market participants will be closely watching for further developments from both the region and the subsequent reactions in traditional and crypto markets.

2025-06-14T02:30:15,"Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000","Brewing tensions between Israel and Iran have triggered global de-risking across risk-on assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency by market cap is down 1.7% over the past 24 hours. That said, technical indicators still point toward a potential new all-time high (ATH) for BTC in the coming months. Bitcoin Tracing The ABCD Pattern According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, BTC appears to be following the ABCD pattern. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is currently trading within a wedge formation and could target as high as $137,000 if it breaks out. For the uninitiated, the ABCD pattern is a classic chart setup with four points and three legs – AB, BC, and CD – where AB and CD are typically equal in length, and BC serves as the retracement. It helps identify potential reversal zones and signals when a price move may be losing momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Negative Funding On Binance – A Classic Setup For A Short Squeeze? Several other technical indicators also point to a potential new ATH for BTC. For instance, crypto analyst Crypto Caesar shared the following 4-hour Bitcoin chart highlighting a bullish double bottom pattern that suggests BTC is primed for recovery. Fellow crypto commentator Jelle identified a cup and handle pattern on the daily BTC chart. Jelle shared the following chart showing that BTC has already formed the “cup” and is now beginning to shape the “handle,” which typically precedes a sharp upward move. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn the Trader pointed to the Hash Ribbons – an on-chain indicator historically associated with major rallies. Merlijn shared the following BTC daily chart, noting that the last four appearances of this signal preceded strong Bitcoin uptrends. To explain, Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that uses Bitcoin’s 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages (MA) to spot miner capitulation and recovery. A bullish signal appears when the short-term average crosses above the long-term one. Are BTC Bears Regaining Ground? Although BTC remains above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, some concerning signs are beginning to emerge. The cryptocurrency was recently rejected from the $110,000 resistance level again, giving bears temporary control. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 Similarly, on-chain data shows that long-term holders are beginning to exit the Bitcoin market which retail investors are starting to join in. Such dynamics are typically observed during the late phase of a bull cycle. In parallel, short-term holders are showing signs of declining confidence in BTC, as reflected in recent on-chain activity. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $105,568, down 1.7% over the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T02:10:11,"Massive Bitcoin Transfer: 7,999 BTC Leaves Coinbase for Unknown Wallet","BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Transfer: 7,999 BTC Leaves Coinbase for Unknown Wallet The cryptocurrency world is abuzz following a significant Bitcoin transfer that has caught the attention of market observers and data trackers alike. In a move that underscores the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto movements, a substantial amount of BTC has shifted addresses, sparking widespread discussion about potential market implications. What Did the Whale Alert Reveal About This Bitcoin Transfer? According to data provided by Whale Alert, a service that monitors large transactions on various blockchains, a colossal amount of 7,999 BTC was recently transferred. This particular transaction originated from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, and was directed towards a wallet address currently classified as ‘unknown’. The sheer scale of this Bitcoin transfer is noteworthy, valued at approximately $847 million at the time of the transaction. Whale Alert’s notifications are crucial for traders and analysts trying to gauge the activities of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Such large movements can sometimes signal potential shifts in market sentiment or liquidity. Key Details of the Bitcoin Transfer Metric Detail Amount Transferred 7,999 BTC Originating Exchange Coinbase Destination Wallet Unknown New Wallet Approximate USD Value $847 Million Reported By Whale Alert Why Does a Large Coinbase Outflow Matter? A significant Coinbase outflow , like the one observed with this 7,999 BTC transfer, is often interpreted as a potentially bullish signal by market participants. Exchanges are typically used for trading activities. When a large amount of Bitcoin leaves an exchange and moves to an unknown wallet, it can suggest that the owner intends to hold onto the assets for the long term rather than selling them in the immediate future. This is because moving assets off an exchange, especially in such large volumes, often involves setting up cold storage solutions, which are less accessible for quick trading. Conversely, large inflows to exchanges can sometimes precede selling pressure, as traders move assets onto platforms to potentially execute trades or take profits. Therefore, tracking Coinbase outflow and inflow data is a key metric for analysts assessing market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. Who is This BTC Whale and What Are They Doing? The term BTC whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. These players can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer size of their holdings and transactions. The identity of the wallet receiving the 7,999 BTC remains unknown, which adds an element of mystery and fuels speculation. Several possibilities exist regarding the nature of this BTC whale and the purpose of the transfer: Institutional Investment: It could represent a large institution moving recently acquired Bitcoin into cold storage for safekeeping. This would align with the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. Private Investor/Fund: A wealthy individual or a private investment fund could be consolidating assets or securing a large position off-exchange. Exchange Internal Transfer: Less likely for a move to a completely ‘unknown new wallet’, but sometimes exchanges perform internal rebalancing, though these are usually identifiable. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The BTC might have been purchased via an OTC desk, and this transfer represents the delivery of the assets to the buyer’s secure wallet. Without concrete information on the wallet’s owner, these remain educated guesses based on typical large-scale crypto movements. However, the fact that it left a major exchange like Coinbase and went to a new, unknown address is a strong indicator of a potential long-term holding strategy by the recipient. How Does This Fit Into the Broader Crypto News Landscape? This significant transfer is just one piece of the larger puzzle in the dynamic world of crypto news . Large transactions are constantly occurring across various blockchains, and monitoring them helps provide insights into market activity, investor behavior, and potential trends. In a market often driven by sentiment and large capital flows, keeping an eye on whale movements is considered a crucial aspect of analysis. Recent crypto news has highlighted increasing interest from institutional players and corporations in Bitcoin. Transfers like this one can sometimes be indicative of such trends, especially if followed by similar patterns from other exchanges or into identifiable institutional wallets. However, it’s important not to overstate the impact of a single transaction. While significant, the market’s direction is influenced by a multitude of factors including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. What Can We Learn From Tracking Whale Activity? Tracking large transactions, as reported by services like Whale Alert, offers several potential benefits for market participants: Gauging Sentiment: Large outflows from exchanges can suggest accumulation and a bullish bias among whales, while large inflows might indicate potential selling. Identifying Trends: Observing patterns in whale behavior over time can help identify broader trends in institutional or large investor interest. Understanding Liquidity: Movements of large volumes can impact the available supply on exchanges, potentially affecting price volatility. Spotting Potential Opportunities: While risky, some traders attempt to anticipate market moves based on observed whale activity, although this requires sophisticated tools and analysis. It’s essential to remember that whale tracking is not an exact science and should be used as one of many tools for market analysis. Large transfers can have various legitimate reasons that do not directly predict immediate price movements. Actionable Insights for the Reader Given this large Bitcoin transfer and the ongoing interest in whale activity, what steps can interested individuals take? Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and data providers like Whale Alert to stay updated on significant on-chain movements. Analyze Context: Don’t view a single transaction in isolation. Consider it within the broader market context, including price action, news headlines, and other on-chain metrics. Use Whale Data as an Indicator, Not a Guarantee: Understand that large transfers are just one piece of the puzzle. They can signal potential intent but do not guarantee specific market outcomes. Focus on Long-Term Trends: For most investors, focusing on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader market is often more productive than trying to trade based on individual whale movements. Summary: A Closer Look at the $847 Million Bitcoin Transfer The recent movement of 7,999 BTC, valued at approximately $847 million, from Coinbase to an unknown wallet, as highlighted by Whale Alert , is a significant event in the world of cryptocurrency. This large Coinbase outflow suggests that a major holder, a likely BTC whale , is potentially moving assets off-exchange for long-term storage, which is often interpreted positively by the market. While the identity and exact intentions of the recipient remain a mystery, such transactions are vital pieces of crypto news that analysts use to gauge market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. Tracking these large transfers provides valuable insights but should always be done in conjunction with other forms of market analysis.
