2025-06-14T20:30:43,"Bitcoin May Hit $78,500 If This Critical Support Fails – Details","Bitcoin (BTC) prices crashed by almost 5% in the past 48 hours, with growing global tensions following an Israeli airstrike on Iran on June 12. As financial markets reacted to this news, Bitcoin prices dipped to below $103,000 before experiencing a modest rebound to climb into the $105,000 price band. Notably, top market analyst Ali Martinez has observed that the premier cryptocurrency must maintain a particular support line to avoid a major correction based on the active trading channel. $100,000 Support Key To Bitcoin Bull Challenge In an X post on June 13, Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price movement. The expert reveals that BTC has stylishly maintained a range-bound movement since 2024 amidst major price surges and extended market corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $105K as Binance Net Taker Volume Turns Deep Red Over the last six months, Martinez’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has largely traded between $78,500 and $110,000, establishing multiple vital support and resistance levels within this corridor. During this period, the maiden cryptocurrency has famously retested the upper boundary five times while bouncing off the lower boundary four times. Following Bitcoin’s most recent crash and the propensity for higher market volatility, especially with the potential of a full-scale war in the Middle East, Martinez warns it is critical for Bitcoin bulls to maintain a price point above the $100,000 level, which represents the next major support level in the market. The analyst explains that in line with price behavior within a set trading channel, a decisive close below the $100,000 price point strongly increases the chances for a price return to the lower boundary at $78,500. This situation presents a potential 25% price devaluation for current BTC holdings. On the other hand, maintaining price action above $100,000 keeps bullish momentum intact and raises the probability of a retest of the $110,000 resistance zone, perhaps with the hope of a decisive price breakout beyond the trading channel. However, a breakdown below $100,000 would not necessarily trigger an immediate correction to $78,500. Notably, Martinez’s analysis reveals that support levels at $92,000 and $86,000 could provide Bitcoin bulls with ample opportunity to reassert market control. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,194 following a 1.79% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 37.04%, indicating a boost in market transactions and general trading activity. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin remains the crypto market leader with an impressive 62.75% dominance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern?

2025-06-14T20:20:31,"Philippe Laffont said Bitcoin is becoming a core portfolio asset as its volatility drops","Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, told attendees at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York City on Thursday that Bitcoin is becoming a serious part of traditional portfolios as its once-wild volatility continues to drop. The hedge fund boss said he believes the asset is moving from speculative territory into something more foundational, with price behavior starting to look closer to legacy markets. Laffont explained that Coatue had initially avoided bitcoin because of how unstable it used to be. But now, the math is changing. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking,” he said. “If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting.” The term beta is used to compare an asset’s volatility to the broader market. Institutions buy in as behavior of holders changes Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin has climbed almost 13% so far in 2025. That’s not what stood out to him, though. What mattered more was how price movements now feel more controlled than in previous years. In 2022, bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33%. It was one of those years that kept Coatue on the sidelines. Fast forward to April 2025, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, and the picture looked very different. From April 2 to April 10, bitcoin dropped about 5%, while the Nasdaq fell over 6%. That’s the kind of performance that signals a maturing asset. He said this improvement in behavior wasn’t just about price. It’s about the people holding it. Laffont noted that there’s been a sharp decline in the number of bitcoin wallets that sell their entire holdings after just one month. “That’s come down a lot,” he said . Instead of trading in and out, more holders are staying in for the long run. That’s a critical change in market dynamics, especially when it comes to institutional comfort. Another sign of that change? Big names are getting involved. Laffont mentioned BlackRock, saying the firm played a leading role in bringing bitcoin ETFs to the market. That kind of participation wasn’t possible until recently. Now that the biggest asset managers are getting behind it, more institutions are following. Laffont believes this is pushing bitcoin toward becoming a necessary part of portfolios. He said the asset only represents about $2 trillion out of the world’s $500 trillion in total wealth. That’s still a tiny share. But if people keep valuing it, he argued, it “has to become more central.” The growth potential, by his measure, is still huge. Laffont admits missing the early wave and tells others not to overdo it Coatue hasn’t stayed completely out of crypto. Laffont said the firm has investments in both private and public companies in the space, including Dune Analytics, Hut 8, and CoreWeave. CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure firm, works with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Still, Laffont made it clear he regrets not going deeper into bitcoin itself. “Every night, I wake up at about three in the morning and I go, ‘What an idiot. Why didn’t I invest more in bitcoin?’” he said. He blamed his delay on overthinking. Laffont said he used to focus too much on complex theories and debates about use cases. But the core truth was simple: value grows when people believe in it. “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time – and that’s what we missed,” he said. Now, he said he tells investors to consider putting “one or two or 3% or 4%” of their assets into bitcoin as a way to protect themselves from inflation. He also described how his clients fall into three groups. There are the ones who trust him and don’t ask questions. Then there are the ones who confront him with “Why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world?” And finally, there are the cautious ones who are still uncomfortable with anything crypto-related. “That,” Laffont said, “is the dying population.” He said those people are getting fewer every year. Even as Laffont has warmed up to bitcoin , he still warned people not to make it the center of their portfolios. “For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio,” he said. His advice is to keep it small and steady. “You’re going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/laffont-bitcoin-turning-into-a-core-asset/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|BTC",cryptocompare

According to Swissblock, Bitcoin is “stalling below $110,000” and the upward trend is now under pressure as a broad trading range appears to form between the resistance level and a price of $100,000. “Consolidation may last, but one thing’s clear: No breakout without strong fundamentals.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,447 at time of writing, around 7% below the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached last month. Earlier in the week, Swissblock had warned that a failure by Bitcoin to break out amid a lack of fresh investor flows could lead to a double-top. A double-top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern formed when the price of an asset forms two consecutive peaks, an indication that there’s a strong resistance level that the price is unable to pierce through. Source: Swissblock/X According to Bitcoin Vector, a joint report by Swissblock and on-chain analyst Willy Woo, BTC liquidity has been trending lower for the past couple of days, an indication of falling volume levels, a declining number of transactions and reduced activity. But Bitcoin Vector says a further correction is unlikely. “Here’s the interesting part: network growth remains stable, participants are not leaving the market.

2025-06-14T19:47:21,"ADA Hovers Around $0.62 as New Enterprise Product Launch Offsets Whale-Driven Pressure","Cardano's ADA ADA was down 1.71% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.6229 as of June 14. The asset briefly slipped to $0.6176 before stabilizing, holding its footing despite a sharp wave of selling from large holders. According to recent market data, whales have offloaded over 270 million ADA —worth roughly $170 million — in a move that has added significant pressure to the token’s price action during a week marked by geopolitical volatility. Yet, amid the sell-off, the Cardano Foundation unveiled a new product aimed at enterprise adoption. On Thursday, the organization launched Originate , a blockchain-based solution for verifying product origin and authenticity. Designed to help businesses streamline compliance and protect against counterfeits, Originate allows companies to digitize and track critical product data on-chain, enabling instant verification by consumers and regulators. On its website, the Foundation emphasized that Originate is built to strengthen brand trust in industries where supply chain transparency is critical. By positioning itself as a tool for regulatory compliance and consumer assurance, the product may help bolster Cardano’s reputation in enterprise circles —especially at a time when investors are searching for real-world use cases beyond DeFi and staking. The announcement comes just days after ADA was added to the Nasdaq Crypto Index , joining Bitcoin and Ethereum. While short-term sentiment remains fragile due to whale behavior and broader risk-off macro trends, Cardano’s expanding institutional profile could provide longer-term support. Technical Analysis Highlights ADA ranged between $0.6176 and $0.6428, closing near $0.6229, a 1.71% daily loss. Resistance remains strong near $0.642–$0.645, while price broke below support at $0.636. Heaviest volume spikes occurred after 18:00 GMT as price dipped below $0.62, triggering brief sell-off followed by consolidation. Trend remains bearish with lower highs forming throughout the day, and rejection at $0.635.

However, this dream hit a major stumbling block after geopolitical tensions quickly escalated in the late hours of Thursday, June 13. It didn’t take much time for Israel’s airstrike against Iran to impact the global financial markets, with crypto prices succumbing to a fresh wave of downward pressure. Specifically, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost about 6% of its value in the past 24 hours. Is Capital Flowing Out Of ETH Into BTC? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha shared fresh insights into the wave of volatility that recently hit the cryptocurrency market. The crypto pundit noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin were particularly impacted by the recent global happenings. Related Reading: A Rare Bitcoin Signal Is Flashing: Could the Bull Run Just Be Getting Started? Firstly, Taha noted the decline in the Ethereum Open Interest (OI) on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the ETH OI metric experienced a significant 19% dip in the past 24 hours, coinciding with a decrease in price. The Open Interest indicator estimates the total amount of money flowing into derivatives of a specific cryptocurrency at any given time. A falling OI value is often considered a bearish signal, as it suggests a decline in investor confidence and positive sentiment. According to Taha, this latest abrupt decline in the Ethereum Open Interest points to a wave of panic-induced selling, with investors instinctively exiting their long positions. “Traders likely rushed to close their long positions, either manually in fear of deeper losses or automatically via forced liquidations as stop-loss triggers were hit,” the analyst said. Taha drew a parallel relationship between the falling Ethereum Open Interest and the flow of Bitcoin out of Coinbase, the largest centralized exchange in the United States. CryptoQuant data shows a significant withdrawal of 7,000 BTC from the trading platform in the past day. According to Taha, this substantial exchange outflow of Bitcoin, coinciding precisely with the Ethereum OI decline, suggests fresh buying and that large investors may be strategically repositioning for accumulation. This trend might not be particularly positive for ETH, as it shows that capital might be rotating back into the premier cryptocurrency. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,546, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

Storm faces three charges in the upcoming trial related to operating a crypto mixer in the United States. ‘Privacy Is Normal, And Writing Code Is Not A Crime’ – EF In a June 13 post on the X platform, the Ethereum Foundation disclosed that it would donate $500,000 to Storm’s defense in the upcoming court trial. In addition to the significant contribution, the foundation intends to match up to an extra $750,000 in donations from the crypto community. This Ethereum Foundation’s announcement comes about a month before the beginning of the trial, which would see Storm battle charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to violate US sanctions, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. If found guilty of all these charges, the crypto mixer co-founder faces a prison sentence of up to 45 years . While Storm’s legal defense team has tried to get these charges dismissed in court, his trial is set to begin in New York on Monday, July 14. For his defense, the Tornado Cash developer is looking to raise about $2 million. The Ethereum Foundation wrote in the post on X: Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. This statement touches on what has been a major talking point — privacy concerns — in the crypto community since Storm’s arrest in 2023 and other similar cases (the arrest of Telegram’s co-founder , Pavel Durov, in 2024). While the US prosecutors have declared intentions to drop the charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, Storm has maintained his innocence throughout this legal battle. Tornado Cash Co-Founder Speaks Out On Social Media Earlier on Friday, Storm took to the social media platform X to appeal for the support of the crypto community, saying that the US judicial system is “trying to crush” him. The crypto co-founder said: If I lose, DeFi dies with me. The dream of financial freedom, the code I believed in—it all fades into darkness. I’m fighting, but the weight is unbearable. This isn’t just my end; it’s ours. Storm also posted an appreciation message on X to the Ethereum Foundation for its $500,000 donation to his legal defense. “Your support means the world to me, especially standing up for privacy and the right to code. I’m so grateful to everyone chipping in—your generosity is truly inspiring!

2025-06-14T19:00:04,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Jumps as Over 537M SHIB Set Ablaze","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most well-known memecoins, has significantly increased its burn rate over the past 24 hours. More than 537 million worth of SHIB coins have been taken out of circulation. This caused the burn rate to jump by 3,484%, a massive increase from the day before. This turn of events has made the SHIB community more hopeful for the token’s future. This came after the SHIB ecosystem improved its decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. Massive Token Burn Fuels Shiba Inu Price Jump Burning coins usually helps reduce the total supply, making the remaining coins more valuable. Following this large burn, SHIB’s price increased by 4.12%, trading at $0.000012, and its total market value crossed $7.2 billion. This price bounce came shortly after SHIB dropped by 10% earlier in the week. This drop was caused mainly by a bigger dip in the crypto market, which reacted to rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Furthermore, Shibburn tracking platform shows that the recent increase in SHIB’s burn rate continues a trend seen earlier this week. In a notable move, one wallet alone burned over 500 million SHIB in the past 12 hours. The Shiba Inu community has used token burning to help support long-term value. As SHIB’s price went up, its future open interest rose by over 4%, reaching $141.85 million. According to Coinglass data, traders are showing more confidence in SHIB’s short-term performance. A rise in open interest usually means more trading activity and a stronger belief in the token’s direction. This geopolitical tension also shook the entire crypto market. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) dropped 2.8% after the incident , falling from $106,042 to $103,053. However, the flagship crypto seems to be back on a bullish path. According to CoinMarketCap data, it is trading at $105,092 at the time of writing, up 0.27% in the past 24 hours. SHIB Whale Activity Drops Despite Price Uptick Even though the token burn and price rise are good signs, data shows that large-scale SHIB holders are pulling back . In the past 24 hours, large transaction volume has dropped 65%. Wallets with at least $100,000 worth of SHIB have seen a significant slowdown in activity. This points to weakening interest among big investors, possibly due to recent market uncertainty. On June 6, the enormous transaction volume hit 17.63 trillion SHIB. However, this has dropped to just 948.59 billion SHIB, showing that many big investors are pulling away. Experts say if larger investors continue to reduce their holdings, it may put downward pressure on the SHIB price.

2025-06-14T19:00:02,"Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio Outlines Meme Stock Trading Strategy, Says Investors Are Not Paying Enough Attention to the ‘Most Important Thing’","Billionaire hedge fund legend Ray Dalio thinks investors aren’t paying attention to obvious factors in meme stock trading. Dalio says in a new post on X that there’s always a “current most popular meme” that everyone believes in but is bound to lose its status. “These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don’t take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don’t pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing.” Dalio says this behavior sets the stage for potential market missteps, especially in the current economic climate. At this time, it is typical for almost everyone to be looking to make money by buying assets that they believe will go up (rather than betting on them going down), and they quite often use leverage.” Dalio’s meme trading advice follows dire warnings he’s recently issued about the US economy. Earlier this month, Dalio argued in an interview on PBS that the government needs to lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-14T18:45:30,"NBA Legend Shaquille O’Neal To Settle FTX Endorsement Lawsuit for $1,800,000","New court filings show that NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal will settle a lawsuit related to the endorsement of defunct crypto exchange FTX for $1.8 million. According to recent court documents, the retired superstar is settling a lawsuit where he’s accused of promoting FTX, which went bankrupt in 2022 after its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found to be mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds as well as defrauding investors. “This proposed settlement… results from the tremendous efforts of the parties, with negotiations informed by previous mediations and settlement agreements which were reached in this action. Defendant O’Neal has agreed to provide $1,800,000 in monetary relief in exchange for reaching this early settlement, which amount will be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the settlement.” However, the agreement between the parties is still pending approval from the court. O’Neal and other marquee celebrities – such as fellow NBA superstar Stephen Curry, NFL quarterbacks Tom Brady and Trevor Lawrence, MLB pitcher Shohei Ohtani, Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, and supermodel Gisele Bündchen – were all accused of failing to perform due diligence before promoting FTX in a class action lawsuit filed in 2022. O’Neal, who received $750,000 to endorse the crypto exchange, first agreed to a settlement in April, though the amount at the time was undisclosed. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of his crimes in 2023 and was sentenced to 25 years behind bars in 2024.

2025-06-14T18:41:17,"Bitcoin’s Stability Tested Following Trump’s ‘Very Alarming’ Remarks on Middle East Tension","Reports have emerged about a hours-long phone conversation between the heads of state of the US and Russia, where topics ranged from the growing tension in the Middle East to Donald Trump’s birthday. According to some publications, the POTUS described the Israel-Iran situation as “very alarming,” as there’s no closure in sight. BREAKING: President Trump tells Putin that the situation in the Middle East is “very alarming.” — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 14, 2025 Recall the events that transpired between the two nations located in the Middle East as Israel hit Iran first on Friday morning, killing over 70 people in the process, including high-end generals and nuclear scientists. Iran responded last night, but the damage was significantly less. Although Trump previously expressed hope that Iran could be closer to signing a nuclear deal now, he and Putin were reportedly concerned about the recent escalation, as the conflict is nowhere near a resolution. Nevertheless, both still “did not rule out a return to negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program,” reported the Moscow Times, citing a statement from the Kremlin. Israel’s attack against Iran earlier this week had an immediate and profound impact on the cryptocurrency market, with BTC slumping from a Thursday peak of $108,500 to under $103,000 on Friday morning. Iran’s response failed to influence the market in a similar manner, but BTC is back in the red after Trump’s most recent remarks. Some analysts warned that the largest cryptocurrency could plunge below $80,000 if the sell-off intensifies and it fails to maintain the $100,000 support. BTCUSD.

Responding to a user’s question regarding token plans for MetaMask, Lubin announced that the company is developing short- and medium-term strategic plans and that the first token distribution will take place on the LINEA network. He noted that future protocols are designed to work in synergy with each other. A few days ago, ConsenSys shared the news of a significant acquisition with the public.

2025-06-14T18:17:03,"Analyst sets Bitcoin’s next buying opportunity after BTC ‘started to cascade south’","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has entered a volatile phase, and according to cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe, this could soon present a new buying opportunity. His outlook follows recent losses that dragged the broader market lower, triggered by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. After failing to hold above $106,000, Bitcoin began what Poppe described as a “cascade south,” slicing through liquidity zones and prompting a wave of sell-offs, he noted in a June 14 X post. A brief bounce followed, but the recovery was quickly rejected at the same $106,000 level, now acting as firm resistance. The leading digital currency had regained bullish momentum earlier, only to lose it after a liquidity sweep and sharp rejection at a local high. Now, the $101,500 to $102,500 range could serve as either a launchpad for recovery or a setup for further downside. To this end, Poppe noted that a fresh rally could take shape if Bitcoin holds above $102,500 and consolidates. But if selling pressure intensifies, he sees the $98,000 to $99,000 zone as a strong candidate for a high-probability long entry. $BTC has a very similar picture. We couldn't hold above $106K and then we started to cascade south taking all the liquidity. Bounce upwards, instant rejection at that crucial level. Two options; – Sub $100K buy opportunity if this continues to fall. – Price holds around… pic.twitter.com/dOCjnBBtOP — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 14, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s volume profile supports this view, highlighting heavy selling after the failed breakout. A lower support zone could also be a trap for late short positions, offering an ideal re-entry point for bullish traders. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch In a separate June 14 analysis, RLinda noted that Bitcoin is consolidating within a broad range between $100,600 and $110,400. The Middle East geopolitical tension spike briefly disrupted its bullish structure, pushing the price down to $102,500 before a sharp recovery. That rebound reinforced support at $102,500, with $106,200 now a key resistance level. Despite market uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to hold above critical support. According to the analyst, short-term trading strategies remain viable if the cryptocurrency stays within the $100,600 to $102,500 range. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

The revelation came through a detailed financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which was viewed by the Financial Times. The 200-page report identifies World Liberty Financial as one of Trump’s most significant sources of income, with the president holding 15.75 billion governance tokens. Rather than purchasing the tokens, Trump received them as part of promotional activities related to the platform. Token Holdings Raise Conflict-of-Interest Concerns The report also details Trump’s transactions with other crypto-related companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, although these companies reported minimal income. While swearing that the filing’s contents are “true, complete, and correct,” ethical concerns have been raised by critics. Trump removed David Huitema, head of the Office of Government Ethics, from office earlier this year, which raised further controversy over his crypto dealings. The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, has eased enforcement actions against crypto firms — a move some say directly benefits Trump’s online venture. World Liberty Financial: $1B Raised, A-List Backers World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform, conducted a token offering last year that raised $1 billion through the sale of 21 billion tokens. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “promoter” for the project, 2024 SEC filings show. Criticisms from both sides of the aisle have been raised over whether Trump’s ongoing profit from crypto investments presents a conflict of interest, especially when creating policy impacting the industry. DRW Investments Shores Up Trump’s Digital Dreams Major financial backing has come from DRW Investments, led by Chicago trader Don Wilson. DRW invested $100 million in Trump Media just weeks after its affiliate Cumberland received SEC enforcement relief from the new administration. This support enables Trump Media’s plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury strategy and the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investigations Underway Representative Jamie Raskin has launched a congressional probe into a private dinner Trump hosted for anchor investors in his meme coin, adding pressure on an already controversial crypto portfolio.

Solana has only seen +1% growth over the same period. $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 This divergence means capital is rotating into XRP faster than Solana, implying short-term accumulation by traders who are positioning for a breakout. Realized cap is especially useful during times of uncertainty, as it shows wealth that has actually moved on-chain rather than speculative market value. A higher realized cap growth often correlates with more network activity and investor confidence. For context: XRP 30D Realized Cap: +4.2% SOL 30D Realized Cap: +1% The big jump in XRP’s realized capital could be seen as a sign of shifting sentiment among retail and institutional traders alike, possibly ahead of regulatory clarity or broader crypto market momentum.

It’s trading at $2.13, down 0.70% in the last 24 hours and stuck below a descending trendline that has rejected every bullish attempt since early June.

Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $2.18, $2.22 Support: $2.09, $2.0474, $2.0042 EMA Barrier: 50-EMA at $2.19 XRP price prediction remains bearish unless XRP breaks above the descending trendline and confirms strength above $2.22; traders may continue to see downside pressure. XRP Trade Setups to Watch As XRP consolidates under resistance, traders have clearly defined levels to monitor for both bullish and bearish strategies. Short Trade Idea: Entry: Rejection near $2.18 Stop: Above $2.22 Targets: $2.0936, $2.0474 Long Trade Setup: Entry: Breakout and close above $2.22 Stop: Below $2.18 Targets: $2.27, $2.3365 For now, the fundamentals suggest investor interest is heating up, but price must follow through with a clean breakout to confirm the next leg higher. Until then, XRP remains at a technical crossroads.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to $105,300, up by 2.4% from its lowest point on Friday, and 5% above this month’s lowest point. SoSoValue data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $301 million on Friday, even as Bitcoin’s price dropped to nearly $100,000. This pushed total weekly ETF inflows to $1.3 billion—a sharp reversal from the previous week’s $128 million in outflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF, whose ticker symbol is IBIT, had daily inflows of $238 million on Friday, bringing its cumulative figure to $49.7 billion. It now has $70 billion in assets, making it the fastest-growing ETF in finance. You might also like: AVAX price down 9.75% on geopolitical tensions, but technicals saw it coming The SPDR Gold Trust, which was launched in 2004, has accumulated $103 billion in assets. This means that IBIT may flip the biggest gold ETF in the next few months or in 2026 if the trend continues. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF has had over $11 billion in inflows, while Bitwise’s BITB has had $2 billion since inception. A possible reason why Wall Street investors bought Bitcoin’s dip is that it maintains strong fundamentals. BlackRock’s data shows that Bitcoin beats the stock market after a major geopolitical event such as the Iran and Israel attacks . Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has plunged from 1.5 million in January to 1.1 million today. Falling Bitcoin supplies at a time of falling supplies will likely boost the price in the long term. Bitcoin price long-term chart point to a multi-year breakout BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The monthly chart indicates a strong Bitcoin price breakout in the near term. This chart shows that Bitcoin formed a rounded bottom between Dec. 17 and March 2021. Since November 2021, Bitcoin has been forming another rounded bottom. The price remains slightly below the ascending trendline connecting the upper side of these rounded bottoms. Therefore, the coin may be about to exit an eight-year trendline, which could push it much higher in the long term.

The Brazilian government, which currently presides over the alliance, announced on Friday that Vietnam would join BRICS as a “partner country.” Partner countries, a category the bloc established last year, aren’t full-fledged members but are invited to participate in the BRICS summit and can endorse the alliance’s declarations. Vietnam is the 10th partner country, joining Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan. BRICS held its initial summit in 2009 was originally just called BRIC, which stood for its four founding members: Brazil, Russia, India and China. The acronym changed to BRICS after South Africa joined the following year. In 2024, it expanded membership to other nations, including Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia joined in early 2025. Brazil also claims that Saudi Arabia is part of the bloc, but the Middle Eastern country has reportedly eschewed formal membership in the intercontinental economic alliance to avoid antagonizing the US. Brazil says current BRICS priorities include “facilitating economic transactions between bloc countries, such as the use of local currencies; the development of international payment platforms; cooperation in government procurement; and the promotion of trade facilitation measures, among others.” In 2023, the alliance reportedly began working on creating a common currency backed by gold and potentially additional precious metals and assets to circumvent reliance on the US dollar, though officials from several of the bloc’s member countries claimed in early 2025 that they weren’t pushing for de-dollarization.

2025-06-14T16:48:33,"U.S. Treasury Quietly Pours $20,000,000,000 Into Record-Breaking Bond Buyback Operation – Is Stealth QE Underway?","The U.S. Treasury Department has now poured $20 billion into a major Treasury buyback operation in the span of two weeks. The Treasury’s June 3rd and June 10th buybacks , which are historic in size, allow the agency to repurchase securities maturing between May and July of this year. The move has triggered social media speculation that a stealth quantitative easing operation is now underway, with the Treasury mimicking the Federal Reserve’s money-printing tactics to stimulate the economy. Skeptics argue that by repurchasing illiquid bonds with borrowed funds, the Treasury is subtly propping up the bond market to maintain confidence in an overextended system. But Bianco Research’s Jim Bianco says claims that the Treasury’s moves are a form of quiet QE are way off the mark. “Everyone is calling Treasury buybacks “stealth QE.” They misunderstand. This is the Treasury, not the Fed… The Treasury cannot “print.” The Treasury borrows new more liquid “on-the-run” bonds and uses the proceeds to buyback old illiquid “off-the-run” bonds. Buybacks do not “create money,” rather they improve the overall quality of the bond market. Buybacks support the bond market in that they make it more liquid so it reduces the (lack of) liquidity premium. But that’s only a few basis points.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently touted the agency’s “big toolkit” to support the bond market if needed, citing buybacks as a strategic option to enhance liquidity and stabilize conditions.

Our Manta price forecast expects Manta price to surge to a maximum level of $3.6 in 2025. In 2030, Manta price prediction expects Manta price to record a maximum level of $22.28.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume dropped to $1.8 million, showing a decline in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.214, surging by over 5.8% in the last 24 hours. Manta price chart The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but hovers around 39, showing that bears are still controlling the momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. However, buyers aim for a surge by sending the price above the EMA20 trend line. MANTA price chart The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening bearish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.261, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.321. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.194, resulting in a correction to $0.159. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.2. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction June 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In June, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.37. The average price is expected to be around $0.25.

2025-06-14T16:05:29,"VanEck Exec Calls Out Small-Cap Firms Over Crypto Investment Claims","Matthew Sigel, a digital asset expert at VanEck, has recently voiced concerns about a rising trend among small-cap companies. These firms are announcing plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP. However, many have weak financial positions and extremely low market values. According to Sigel, these announcements are not genuine business strategies but appear to be efforts to boost stock prices through misleading information. VanEck Exec Spotlight Crypto Treasury Anomaly Several companies with market capitalizations under $100 million have made bold claims about buying large amounts of digital currencies. Some of these companies have promised to invest between $300 million and $800 million in crypto, even though their total value is much lower. These claims have sparked doubts among analysts and investors. Sigel highlighted Trident Digital Tech as an example. Recently, the company, valued at just $16 million, announced plans to raise $500 million to acquire XRP . The gap between its value and stated goal has caused many to question whether the announcement is possible. Sigel Likened Crypto Treasuries Plans To a Pump and Dump Scheme The VanEck Executive points out several warning signs. Most companies making these bold claims have no known track record in the crypto industry. They usually lack the funding needed to carry out such large investments. In many cases, these announcements come when the crypto market is rising. Segel suggests they are timed to take advantage of investor excitement. He warned that these patterns match the behavior seen in pump-and-dump schemes. President Trump was accused of this tactic in January. In this scheme, insiders push up stock prices with exaggerated news and then sell their shares for a profit. This leaves regular investors with overvalued stock and heavy losses. A Broader Industry Trend The problem is not limited to one or two companies. Addentax Group, a Chinese clothing company worth only a few million dollars, said it plans to buy $800 million worth of Bitcoin and TRUMP tokens. Likewise, DeFi Development Corp announced it would sell $5 billion in shares to purchase Solana . After the announcement, its market cap jumped from $7 million to $379 million, demonstrating how such statements can instantly influence investor behavior. Other companies, including Classover Holdings and Webus International, have made similar promises. Each claimed it would raise hundreds of millions to buy digital assets despite their total value of less than $100 million. Industry analysts are warning investors not to take such announcements at face value. Investors are advised to examine the company’s financial reports and ability to raise funds before making any investment decisions.

2025-06-14T16:00:12,"Why Bitcoin Price Continues To Rise Despite Soaring Treasury Yields  — Analyst","Over the past few weeks, the Bitcoin price has maintained a somewhat healthy momentum, forging minor swing highs and lows in its bull run revival. Interestingly, this early-week upward movement has been corrected following the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. All in all, the overall positive outlook for the premier cryptocurrency has remained, even though it has been observed to be against historical perspective. An on-chain analyst on social media platform X has delved into this strange phenomenon in the BTC market and the possible reasons behind it. Bitcoin’s Historical Correlations With Macro Instruments In a recent post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost broke down what, until recently, used to be conventional expectations in the Bitcoin market relative to broader macroeconomics. The crypto pundit mentioned that investors consider key indicators when trying to decipher what institutional sentiments and the broader state of global liquidity may be like. Related Reading: Solana Approaches Critical Support Amid Middle East Conflicts – Can Demand Hold? The key indicators investors highlighted in this analysis include the US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the US dollar against a basket of major foreign currencies, and the US Treasury Yields, which basically represent the return investors earn on United States government bonds. According to Darkfost, the above chart illustrates a well-known macro principle: when both the DXY and bond yields are on the rise, capital tends to flee risk assets (one of which is Bitcoin). As a result, the premier cryptocurrency becomes susceptible to corrective movements. According to the on-chain analyst, this principle is backed by historical trends, as bear markets in crypto have coincided with strong uptrends in both yields and the DXY. On the other hand, when there is a loss of momentum in DXY and yields, investor appetite tends to shift towards risk. The reason for this, Darkfost explained, could be expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which fuel bullish sentiment across crypto markets. BTC Breaks Conventional Macro Logic In the post on X, Darkfost then went on to point out that the current BTC cycle has been unusual. The online pundit reported that there has been a decoupling between the Bitcoin price and bond yields, which manifests as a seeming annulment of the usual macro principles. The analyst noted that the Bitcoin price continues to maintain its upward movement, despite yields reaching some of their highest levels in Bitcoin’s history. But this holds, he was sure to note, when the DXY declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Most Reliable Signal Just Flashed—Next Stop: $170,000 What this anomaly suggests, Darkfost inferred, is that Bitcoin has taken on a new role within the macro landscape, one that increases its perception as a store of value. To take it further, this means that BTC, as of now, may react a little less conventionally to the macro forces believed to influence the crypto market. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price sits just beneath $106,000, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T15:51:24,"Derivatives Bloodbath: $1.16B Liquidated Amid Global Turmoil","The crypto universe was rocked by a brutal tidal wave of liquidations worth $1.16 billion, as short-squeeze vulnerable leveraged longs were caught off guard by a one-two punch: increased Middle East tensions and hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data. Bitcoin led the way lower, dropping to $103,556 — its worst one-day performance in June—while Ethereum, Solana, and the rest of the majors lagged behind in a bout of compelled selling. Where the Pain Was Worst: Exchange Breakdown Binance was hit hardest in the carnage, with $458 million in liquidations — over 91% of longs. Bybit wasn't too far behind, at $375 million worth of liquidations, close to 94% of longs. OKX and Gate each lost over $125 million, with HTX, Coinex, BitMEX, and Bitfinex finishing off the list with dozens of millions more. These were mostly losses from speculators who were betting on a continued rally — only to be surprised by the sudden geopolitical and macroeconomic storm. Bitcoin lost $446 million in long liquidations alone, with Ethereum losing $303 million. Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP all experienced tens of millions of forced sells, demonstrating just how widespread and severe the pain was across the market. Why Leveraged Longs Are Still High — and Vulnerable Despite repeated warnings, the leverage hunger has not abated. BTC and ETH funding rates have remained positive, which means the traders continue to be strongly speculating on the higher side — even as volatilities have risen. This ongoing optimism provided the context for a traditional liquidation cascade: when prices fell, stop-losses and margin calls triggered a domino effect, which fueled the sell-off and closed out more positions at each major support. How Liquidation Cascades Shape the Market With so many traders on one side of the ship, a little shake will send the market into chaos. The numbers indicate that the first $20 million in liquidations arrived within an hour after the breaking news, but as selling snowballed out of control, nearly $1 billion was lost in just 12 hours. This feedback mechanism — where all liquidation induces further selling — is why crypto corrections are so brutal and why heatmap tools are now an indispensable tool for risk management. “If BTC drops to $92K, bulls could lose $8B more. Watch the heatmap.” — @CoinGlass, June 13, 2025 Heatmaps not only show where the pain was — they show where it is likely to be next. According to recent data, if BTC dips to $92,500, over $8.4 billion of long positions would be liquidated, which would be a critical ”pain point” for bulls. A breakout higher towards $121,900 would short-squeeze, which could unleash a short squeeze of nearly $14 billion. Hedging Ahead of the FOMC: What Traders Can Do Now Since the Federal Reserve's FOMC sits on June 18, volatility has hardly ceased. Historically, FOMC announcement days are marked by sharp spikes in crypto market volatility since rate decisions and forward guidance are reacted to by traders. Many individuals are now reducing exposure, contracting stops, or buying put options to hedge against further downside. Institutional desks are seeing increasing demand for downside protection, with traders targeting deep out-of-the-money puts as insurance against another liquidation cascade. The broader macro environment — rising inflation, geopolitical tension, and uncertainty regarding the Fed's policy — makes risk management more critical than ever before. Traders need to watch the funding rates, heatmaps, and the all-important support levels, and stay alert for the sentiment shifts as the Fed announcement approaches. The Bottom Line The $1.16 billion liquidation event is a testament to the dangers of a highly levered, sentiment-driven market. As war news and inflation reads collide with packed derivatives bets, only the ones that manage risk and watch the heatmaps will make it through the next leg. With the FOMC lined up, expect more fireworks—and remember: in crypto, the only thing certain is volatility.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9570/derivatives-bloodbath-1-16-b-liquidated-amid-global-turmoil,"BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Previously, individuals selling up to R$35,000 (around $6,300) worth of crypto per month were exempt from taxation. Before the change, gains above that were taxed progressively, reaching as high as 22.5% for volumes over $5.4 million. The new rule replaces this system with a flat tax, meaning smaller investors will face higher tax burdens while large holders may see their bills shrink, local news outlet Portal do Bitcoin reports. The tax will apply regardless of where the assets are held, including in overseas exchanges or self-custodial wallets. Losses can be offset, but only within a rolling five-quarter window, a rule that will become stricter starting in 2026. The government says the overhaul is aimed at boosting tax revenue after walking back a proposed hike to the IOF financial transaction tax, which had drawn industry and congressional criticism. Alongside crypto, the new measure affects fixed-income investments and online betting, with the former now incurring a fixed 5% tax on earnings and the latter seeing taxes on operator revenues rise from 12% to 18%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/14/brazil-sets-flat-175-tax-on-crypto-profits-ending-exemption-for-smaller-investors,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","Markets|Brazil|taxation|News",cryptocompare
