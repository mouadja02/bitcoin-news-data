Initially, the company said that $25 million of the $100 million allocation would be tokenized on Chintai. According to PREH, the tokenization structure helps alleviate many transparency and liquidity constraints investors typically face in private market placements.Founded in 2010, PREH is a national real estate asset manager that oversees a portfolio of Class A multifamily properties. The company owns and operates real estate investments, overseeing the acquisition, financing and management of properties. Since its inception, PREH has completed more than $500 million in real estate transactions.Chintai is a tokenization-focused layer-1 blockchain that also powers the R3 Sustainability Fund for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. Its native token, CHEX, is currently valued at $0.24, with a total market capitalization of $244 million, according to CoinMarketCap.Chintai (CHEX) token price. Source: CoinMarketCap\""We chose Chintai because they offer a fully regulated, institutional-grade platform purpose-built for tokenizing real-world assets,” PREH’s president, Tejas Patel, told Cointelegraph in a written statement, adding:“Their technology allows us to maintain the highest standards of compliance and investor protections while introducing the efficiencies and access advantages of blockchain.”Related: RWA tokenization trends and market outlook for 2025: ReportTokenizing real estateTokenizing real estate has long been seen as a way to modernize property investment, but until recently, real-world examples were rare. By early 2025, real estate tokenization had gained traction across North America and the United Arab Emirates, while efforts are underway in Europe to establish regulatory frameworks that support its growth.One of the biggest catalysts for tokenization is the “ability to eliminate the illiquidity discount on real estate,” Polygon CEO Mark Boiron told Cointelegraph in March.The growth of liquid secondary markets for fractional real estate could significantly strengthen that advantage.This motivation also drove RWA platform DigiShares to launch the REX marketplace on Polygon earlier this year, featuring two luxury property listings in Miami, Florida.Efforts are also underway to tokenize commercial real estate, with Blocksquare and Vera Capital recently partnering to offer fractional ownership of more than $1 billion worth of properties.Deloitte expects global tokenized real estate value to more than quadruple between 2030 and 2035.

2025-05-12T15:00:00.000Z,"Will Bitcoin hodlers be the reason more countries adopt wealth taxes?","Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of KoinlyIs there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into their tax systems for ages, yet some of the world’s biggest economies — like the US, Australia and France — have largely steered clear. That might be changing. More governments are eyeing wealth taxes for crypto. In December 2024, French Senator Sylvie Vermeillet took it a step further, suggesting Bitcoin (BTC) be labeled “unproductive,” which would mean taxing its gains every year — whether or not it’s ever sold. Yep, every asset holder’s favorite word is unrealized capital gains tax. It would be naive to assume other countries are not thinking about the same idea. With Bitcoin’s significant gains and industry executives such as ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood eyeing a $1.5-million price tag by 2030, I’d bet a magic 8-ball would say, “Signs point to yes.”The growing global interest in wealth taxIt might seem far-fetched, but it is hard to ignore the gains. The average long-term Bitcoin holder is already sitting on significant profits.The incentive is obvious. Switzerland’s wealth tax goes up to 1% of a portfolio’s value, and governments know there is plenty to collect.Countries catch on — sooner or later. Consider how capital gains tax became the norm.The US introduced capital gains tax in 1913, the UK jumped on board 52 years later in 1965, and Australia followed in 1985. Governments likely considering the wealth taxGovernments are likely entertaining the idea — whether they admit it or not. If any country seriously considers it, Germany could be a prime candidate, even though it scrapped its wealth tax back in 1997.Recent: Ukraine floats 23% tax on some crypto income, exemptions for stablecoinsIn July 2024, offloading 50,000 seized BTC at $58,000 might have seemed like a smart move for the German government, but when Bitcoin hit $100,000 just months later in December, it became clear they left a fortune on the table. In retrospect, a costly mistake…Will this be remembered as a blunder on par with Gordon Brown selling half of the UK’s gold reserves at $275 an ounce? Imposing such a rule on the wealthy comes with obvious risks.To understand the real effect of taxation on a country, just follow the money — specifically, where millionaires are moving. Recent data shows that high-net-worth individuals are leaving countries like the United Kingdom in droves, heading for tax-friendly havens like Dubai.The potential repercussions of a wealth taxWill nations risk losing these individuals to tap into unrealized gains on Bitcoin and other assets?Bitcoin is volatile and full of unknowns. While some events could lead to massive losses, governments may still push forward with policies that ultimately drive away millionaires, only to realize the trade-off wasn’t worth it. Conversely, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a clear nod to the hodl mentality. No doubt, this has other nations considering a similar move.If nations are embracing the hodl mindset, could that mean wealth taxes are off the table in those countries? Only time will tell.One thing is sure: Bitcoin hodlers have amassed enough wealth to put themselves on the radar of tax authorities. Whether this sparks fundamental policy changes or just political grandstanding, the crypto community won’t sit back quietly.Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  “The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that.

The researchers pointed out that geographical barriers have less influence on cryptocurrency transactions compared with traditional financial systems.Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin paymentsSpeculative crypto activity remains tied to “global conditions for funding in major crypto markets,” signaling a growing “interconnectedness” between cryptocurrencies and the legacy financial system, the researchers said, adding:“Concurrently, we observe that tighter global funding conditions, known to curtail risk-taking in traditional asset classes, are associated with reduced flows. This indicates increasing interconnectedness between cryptoassets as speculative assets and mainstream finance.”Additionally, crypto-specific risks and heightened public awareness significantly influence crypto investment flows, reinforcing their role as speculative assets, according to the BIS.The findings were published nearly a month after the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) had “reached a critical mass,” posing a threat to financial stability and global wealth inequality, Cointelegraph reported on April 19.Related: $400M Web3 investment fund ABCDE halts new investments, fundraisingStablecoin, low-value Bitcoin payments fueled by fiat inflation, high transfer costsBeyond speculative investment tools, stablecoins and Bitcoin are also used as a “transactional medium.”“Higher opportunity costs of fiat currency usage, such as high inflation, spur bilateral cross-border transactions in both unbacked cryptoassets and stablecoins,” the BIS stated, adding:“Likewise, greater economic activity within both sender and receiver countries is often linked to increased crypto flows in most cases.”High remittance fees charged by traditional financial institutions further bolster crypto adoption for international money transfers, especially from developed economies to emerging markets, the report stated.Global USDT flow map.

2025-05-12T11:18:00.000Z,"What is RISC-V, and why does Vitalik Buterin want it for Ethereum smart contracts?","What is RISC-V?              RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.On April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a “radical” new scaling proposal to replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the RISC-V instruction set architecture, aiming to boost the speed and efficiency of the network’s execution layer. The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain’s scalability constraints. “It aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer’s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,” said Buterin.Ethereum continues to face high transaction fees and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum’s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin’s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.Did you know? Ethereum’s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.                  How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?              Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (ETH) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another. An alternative approach, described as “more radical,” would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum can’t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter — essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.Did you know? In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed “The Merge,” the chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This involved merging the Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called Beacon Chain.                  Key benefits of RISC-V vs. EVM              If RISC-V causes a major shift in the Ethereum architecture, what will be the benefits of making this change? In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts’ performance and processing.According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V’s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.It’s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry. Additionally, RISC-V’s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management. Rather than rebuilding the EVM for ZK-proofs, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers. This could accelerate Ethereum’s roadmap for privacy and scalability via ZK rollups, making RISC-V a compelling complement to the EVM.Below is a comparison table summarizing the key differences and benefits of RISC-V vs. the EVM.Did you know? Ethereum has gone through several major development milestones over its first decade. Notably, in 2016, it conducted a hard fork to roll back the chain after The DAO hack. The result is still noticeable today with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains both in existence.                  Will RISC-V be implemented in the future?              Buterin’s proposal has sparked a lively debate among Ethereum users and developers. It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain. Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower. “The risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,” commented Ben Adams.A sentiment that was echoed by another anonymous commenter, “I agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.”Others appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost. “Agree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?” added Adam Cochran. It’s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the layer-1 blockchain works.Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn’t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin’s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-risc-v-and-why-does-vitalik-buterin-want-it-for-ethereum-smart-contracts?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

On March 5, Pectra was rolled out to the Sepolia testnet, but the developers encountered errors made worse by an attacker who caused the mining of empty blocks. To further prepare for the deployment, Ethereum core developers created a new testnet called “Hoodi” before deploying the upgrade to the mainnet on May 7. With the upgrade, externally owned accounts (EOAs) can act as smart contracts to cover gas fees and payments using tokens that are not ETH. In addition, validator staking limits were increased from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, simplifying operations for large stakers.

One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation and trust-building tactics to deceive their victims. By exploiting psychological weaknesses, attackers can trick individuals into giving up their private information, credentials or funds. In the world of crypto, this kind of manipulation is especially dangerous because transactions are irreversible, and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can make it even harder to recover lost funds. Once funds are transferred or access is granted, it’s almost impossible to reverse the action. This makes crypto users a prime target for social engineering attacks.Did you know? In 2024, phishing and spoofing topped the US Federal Bureau of Investigation’s list of reported cybercrimes, with victims also losing over $6.5 billion to crypto-related investment fraud, according to the Internet Crime Complaint Center.                  Anatomy of a social engineering attack: Step by step              Social engineering attacks trick crypto users by gaining trust, creating urgency, and then stealing sensitive info to drain their wallets.Step 1: The setup — Scouting for targetsScammers start by lurking on social media platforms such as X, Discord, Telegram and Reddit.They look for:Newbies asking for helpPeople showing off their gains or NFTsUsers who accidentally leak wallet addresses or emails.The more info they gather, the easier it is to craft a personalized attack.Step 2: The approach — Gaining trustNext, they reach out, pretending to be:A helpful support agent (e.g., from MetaMask, Binance)A famous crypto influencerA friend or community manager.They copy profile pictures, usernames (sometimes with slight changes), and even fake verification badges to seem real. This is all about lowering your guard.Step 3: The hook — Creating urgency or fearNow they trigger your emotions with urgent, scary or tempting messages:“Your wallet is at risk — act now!”“Exclusive airdrop ending in 5 minutes!”“We detected suspicious activity — please verify your account!”They use fear, excitement and time pressure to force you into quick action without thinking.Step 4: The ask — Extracting sensitive infoThis is where the real trap springs. They ask you to:Share your private key or seed phrase (a big red flag)Click a link to a phishing site that looks like MetaMask, Phantom or OpenSeaApprove a suspicious smart contract that drains your walletSend a small amount of crypto to “verify your account” or “unlock” funds.If you fall for this step — game over.Step 5: The heist — Draining your cryptoOnce they get your sensitive info or get you to sign a malicious transaction, they:Instantly drain your wallet of coins and tokensSwap your assets into privacy coins (e.g., Monero) to hide the trailLaunder the funds through mixers or exchanges.Victims usually realize the theft too late; sadly, funds are gone forever in most cases.Did you know?

This can take several forms but typically involves fake websites, apps or emails designed to look legitimate.Fake wallet apps: Scammers create fake versions of popular wallet apps like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. They trick users into downloading these apps, which then steal the private keys and funds stored within them.Fake exchanges: Similarly, attackers might impersonate well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. Victims are sent a link to a phishing site that looks identical to a legitimate platform, such as Binance or Coinbase. Once users log in and input their details, the attacker gains access to their funds.Fake MetaMask pop-ups: One common trick involves fake pop-ups that prompt MetaMask users to enter their seed phrase or private keys, thereby giving scammers control over their wallets.ImpersonationImpersonation scams occur when attackers pose as legitimate figures — whether that’s support staff, crypto influencers or even friends — to convince victims to hand over their information or funds.Fake support staff: In many cases, scammers will impersonate customer support agents for popular crypto wallets or exchanges. They might reach out to users claiming there’s an issue with their account and ask for sensitive information, such as a password or seed phrase.Influencers and friends: Attackers might pretend to be well-known crypto influencers or friends, asking for funds or convincing victims to participate in a scam. In some cases, attackers even go as far as to hijack a social media account of a crypto personality, offering fake giveaways or investment opportunities.Giveaway scams“Send 1 ETH, get 2 ETH back” — this is the classic giveaway scam that has made its rounds throughout the crypto community. Scammers pose as trusted entities, often mimicking celebrities like Elon Musk or official crypto exchanges, claiming they’re running a giveaway.The catch? The scammer asks you to send cryptocurrency to a specified wallet address in exchange for a larger amount of crypto that you’ll receive “later.” Once the funds are sent, they disappear.Romance and friendship scamsRomance and friendship scams, often known as pig butchering, occur when an attacker builds an emotional connection with the victim through messaging platforms like Telegram or even dating apps. Over time, the scammer gains the victim’s trust and then lures them into a fake investment opportunity, often involving cryptocurrency.Victims are manipulated into sending funds to what they believe is a secure investment, only to lose all their money when the scammer disappears.Fake investment platformsFake investment platforms promise extremely high returns with minimal risk — too good to be true. These scams might mimic legitimate crypto investment platforms, promising high returns on crypto investments or passive income streams. Once users deposit their funds, the platform either disappears or the scammer stops responding to communication.                  Why social engineering works so well in crypto              Social engineering attacks thrive in the cryptocurrency world because they take advantage of certain vulnerabilities that are unique to the space. The combination of psychological manipulation, technical complexity and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions makes crypto users particularly susceptible to these types of scams. Below are the key factors that explain why social engineering is so effective in the crypto environment:Fear and urgency: Crypto scams often create a sense of urgency to pressure victims into acting quickly. Common examples include emails or messages stating, “Your account is locked!” or “You need to verify your identity to avoid losing access to your funds!” These messages push users to make impulsive decisions that they later regret.Greed: Social engineering tactics often prey on a person’s desire to make quick, easy money. Scammers might promise users huge returns on investment or offer “exclusive” crypto deals that seem too good to pass up. This appeals to the greed of crypto investors, making them more likely to act impulsively.Lack of crypto security knowledge: Many crypto users, especially beginners, may not fully understand how crypto security works. This makes them more susceptible to attacks like phishing, where they might unknowingly give up their private keys or passwords. Scammers take advantage of this lack of knowledge to manipulate and deceive.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks              While social engineering is hard to prevent entirely, staying vigilant, using 2FA, verifying links and practicing strong security habits can significantly reduce your risk.Several steps you can take to minimize your risk include:Be skeptical of unsolicited messages: Always be cautious when you receive unsolicited messages, whether by email, SMS or social media. If someone contacts you out of the blue asking for sensitive information or money, verify the authenticity of the message before acting.Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts, making it harder for attackers to gain access — even if they manage to obtain your password.Verify links and URLs: Before clicking on any link, hover your cursor over it to see where it leads. If the URL looks suspicious or doesn’t match the official site, don’t click it. Always double-check URLs for legitimacy, especially when dealing with crypto transactions.Educate yourself and others: The best defense against social engineering is knowledge. Stay informed about common scams and share this knowledge with others. The more you know, the less likely you are to fall for a scam.Use strong security practices: Consider using hardware wallets for storing your crypto assets, as these are considered much safer than keeping them on exchange platforms or software wallets. Always keep your private keys and seed phrases secure and never share them with anyone.In a crypto world full of scammers, your best defense is vigilance, education and strong security practices — because even the smartest tech can’t protect you from a well-crafted con.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-social-engineering-in-crypto-and-how-to-protect-yourself?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-12T08:04:15.000Z,"Can you stake Bitcoin (BTC)? Here’s what you need to know","Key takeawaysThough Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.Unlike proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano, Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work (PoW) mining for network security. However, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 innovations, Bitcoin (BTC) holders can now generate passive income through various yield-generating methods. These include centralized lending, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks.This article explores how to earn yield on BTC, the risks involved and the technological advancements enabling these opportunities, all without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol.Staking vs. miningStaking and mining are two distinct consensus mechanisms used to secure blockchain networks and validate transactions. Staking is central to PoS blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Participants lock up cryptocurrency to become validators, who are randomly selected to create new blocks and confirm transactions, earning rewards. The more coins staked, the higher the chance of selection.Mining, used by PoW blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical puzzles with powerful computers. The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.Bitcoin’s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.Did you know? Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.Ways to earn yield on BitcoinWhile you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or bridging BTC to other blockchains.Centralized lending platformsCentralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The collapse of firms like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability. WBTC on EthereumWBTC is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, providing liquidity on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi’s potential but introduces risks from BitGo’s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.Bitcoin layer-2 platformsEmerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin’s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.Did you know? Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after “the Merge,” replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain’s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platformEarning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:Simple Earn: Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.Dual Investment: Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.On-chain Yield: Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.After subscribing:Simple Earn: BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term’s end.Dual Investment: Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.On-chain Yield: Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.How to earn yield with WBTC on EthereumWBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum’s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into liquidity pools and earning interest or fees.Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:Convert BTC to WBTC: Use a centralized exchange (CEX) (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.Transfer WBTC to a wallet: Move WBTC to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and make sure you have enough Ether (ETH) for gas fees.Connect to a DeFi protocol: Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform’s interface.Earn yield: By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2sLayer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon’s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.Steps to earn yield with Babylon:Set up a compatible wallet: Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses. Avoid wallets with Bitcoin Inscriptions (Ordinals).Access the Babylon stake app: Visit the Babylon Stake app, which is active post-Genesis launch.Connect your wallet: Link your BTC wallet and approve digital signature requests for platform interaction.Choose a finality provider: Select from over 250 finality providers (e.g., Galaxy, Figment) that secure Babylon’s network.Set transaction fees: Choose default or custom fees (higher fees ensure faster confirmation) and enter the BTC amount to lock.Confirm and monitor: Lock BTC via the app and track status in the Babylon Staking Terminal. Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.Did you know? In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocolsLayer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin’s security.Native time-locked scripts in Babylon ProtocolBabylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.Stacking in the Stacks ProtocolStacking is Stacks’ yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (STX) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) ExplainedCoinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns for institutional investors outside the US. The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between spot and futures markets, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling. Targeting annual net returns of 4–8% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin — an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.Risks involved in earning yield with BTCGenerating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:Custodial risk: Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC’s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.Smart contract risk: WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.Liquidity risk: Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.Network maturity: Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.Market risk: Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.Regulatory risk: Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction. How earning yield with BTC may evolveBitcoin’s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin’s censorship resistance. However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin’s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

They have both pleaded not guilty.In their letter, prosecutors argued they “acted in good faith” in disclosing the “contents of this informal conversation” between them and Kevin O’Connor, the chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente.A highlighted excerpt of the prosecutors’ letter arguing that they disclosed a discussion with FinCEN on time and the discussion was an “informal conversation.” Source: PACERThey claimed O’Connor and Valente’s comments were “their individual, informal, and caveated opinion” on whether Samourai would need to register as a money transmitter under FinCEN regulations.FinCEN “did not have a sense” of broaching SamouraiThe prosecutor’s letter noted that an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the August 2023 call with FinCEN said that because Samourai doesn’t take custody of the crypto, it “would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].”However, it noted FinCEN staff “did not have a sense of what FinCEN would decide if this question were presented to their FinCEN policy committee.”An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListenerSamourai’s lawyers had claimed that the call showed Rodriguez and Hill “were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance” and that they “could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.”The Samourai co-founders had bid to dismiss the case in April, pointing to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s memo released that month saying the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In their letter, prosecutors addressed the memo, arguing the court “should not consider” it, as the memo states it “may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit” against the US or its departments.Legal Panel: XRP win leaves Ripple a ‘bad actor’ with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/feds-say-fincen-talk-samourai-wallet-disclosed-on-time?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-12T06:12:06.000Z,"DeFi lending TVL is outpacing DEXs due to more sustainable yield — VC","Crypto users could be looking for a more sustainable yield this cycle, as total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending continues to hit new highs while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have lagged in comparison.DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.Change in crypto lending protocol TVL since 2019. Source: DeFiLlamaIn stark contrast, DEXs, which once held nearly double the TVL of their closest competitor, have dropped from $85.3 billion in November 2021 to $21.5 billion today.Explaining the rise in DeFi lending and fall in DEX TVL, the founder of crypto fund Apollo Capital, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph that lending is arguably the “only sustainable way to produce yield” in DeFi, as DEX liquidity pooling has largely become unprofitable due to impermanent loss.He also argued that the industry-leading DEX Uniswap v3’s more “capital efficient” design, relative to Uniswap v2, may have contributed to the DEX TVL fall, as liquidity providers can now earn more rewards with less upfront capital.Andersson also pointed out that the rise of intent-based swaps — a relatively new crosschain trading mechanism — may have further reduced the DEX TVL, as market makers typically source liquidity from centralized exchanges to facilitate these swaps.DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound Finance enable crypto users to lend assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral. Smart contracts manage deposits, loans and interest rates to ensure trustless transactions.DeFi users who supply Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) on Aave, for example, currently earn an annual percentage yield of 1.86% and 3.17%, respectively.Providing stablecoins and Ether to DEX pools such as Uniswap’s can offer higher rewards; however, as Andersson pointed out, they’re far less sustainable, fluctuating by the day.DeFi now dominates CeFi in crypto lending market DeFi-based crypto lending accounted for around 65% of the total market by the end of 2024 and has increased or maintained its market share against centralized lenders every quarter since Q4 2022, an April report from crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital showed.The fall started occurring around the time several centralized crypto lenders such as Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager fell bankrupt, causing TVL to fall massively.Related: Bitcoin hits $103K but DeFi is a mixed bag: Finance RedefinedTheir collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the crypto lending market from the 2022 peak to the bear market trough, Galaxy noted.Change in market share between centralized and decentralized crypto lending protocols between Q3 2018 and Q4 2024.

The victim had finished hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas, and when he returned home, the suspects forced him into a vehicle and drove him to a remote desert area an hour away from the city. There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now. The man was allegedly told to comply with the teens’ demands if he wanted to “live to see another day,” and because they also “had his dad and would kill him,” according to the report. It’s also alleged that a fourth person may have been communicating with the three young men through a phone call during the incident, which the victim could hear through a speakerphone.After having his accounts drained of $4 million in crypto and NFTs, the victim reportedly walked five miles back through the desert to reach a gas station where he could call a friend for help. Two 16-year-olds from Florida are facing charges including robbery, kidnapping, and extortion in connection with the incident. A third teen allegedly involved in the plot has left the country, prosecutors say.One of the young men is behind bars with bail set at $4 million, while the other has been released under house arrest with electronic monitoring. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June, with both teens set to be tried as adults. Digital asset lawyer Sasha Hodder said in a May 10 X post that this case illustrates how “Crypto theft is evolving. It’s not just social engineering or SIM swaps anymore.”Source: Sasha HodderUptick in thieves targeting crypto industry offlineCrypto industry participants are increasingly becoming targets for kidnappings and extortion.

Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11.Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April. At the time, people wondered if Bitcoin’s relative strength came from the narrative that countries were using Bitcoin to bypass tariffs. The analyst said the opposite should theoretically occur if the trade deal is confirmed. “Theoretically speaking, if the trade uncertainty was what was making BTC outperform, it should stop outperforming after we hit the most important deal, which includes China.”Bitcoin performance since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.

2025-05-12T03:20:12.000Z,"Stablecoin bill gets second chance with Northern Mariana lawmakers","Tinian, a small island in the US territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, could get a second chance at launching a stablecoin after the territory’s Senate voted to override the governor’s earlier veto of its stablecoin bill.On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios' April 11 veto of the bill, which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.If the House is quick to pass the bill, the Tinian government could be in the lead for the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin. It’s in a race against the state of Wyoming, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by July.Tinian is governed by the local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, and is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a small US territory in the Pacific north of Guam. Tinian has just over 2,000 residents, and its economy heavily relies on tourism.Senators push “much-needed” bill despite “deep concerns” Governor Palacios said in his letter last month that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional” and would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian.Democrat Senator Celina Babauta, the only one to vote against overriding the veto, said before the vote that she had “deep concerns with respect to the lack of resources, the lack of manpower” to enforce the gambling law and police use of the stablecoin.“We are restricted by federal statutes and must comply with that,” she added.Senator Celina Babauta (right) delivers remarks at a Senate hearing alongside Senator Karl King-Nabors (middle). Source: YouTube“We struggle with trying to find creative and innovative ways to diversify our economy and our industries,” Babauta said. “I don't believe that gambling is the only thing that we can be looking forward to every single time there's an investor that comes in.”However, Republican Senator Karl King-Nabors, who represents Tinian and co-authored the bill, said it was “a far more stringent and efficient way to oversee the online gaming aspect.”“This stablecoin is tracked through software, and if anything, it allows for more transparency when it comes to the Tinian Casino Gaming Control Commission,” he added.King-Nabors said the bill aligned with “much-needed” economic diversification measures, as the local economy was yet to bounce back from a COVID-19 pandemic-induced slump.“This legislation stands at a time where we're going through so much economic hardships,” King-Nabors added. “I find it difficult that we're constantly having to step over obstacles when we're trying to incentivize and look for ways to bring in revenue that don't affect our environment, that don't require a brick and mortar, that don't impact our land.”Tinian bids for fully-backed stablecoinRepublican Senator for Tinian, Jude Hofschneider, led the introduction of the bill in February, which aims to amend a local Tinian law to allow internet-only casino licenses, along with allowing the island to launch a fully backed US dollar-pegged stablecoin.A four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature, which includes Hofschneider and King-Nabors, had passed the bill to Governor Palacios in a unanimous vote on March 12.Statements shared with Cointelegraph in March said the stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury.The Tinian government chose tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation, based in the Northern Mariana Islands’ capital of Saipan, as the exclusive infrastructure provider to issue and redeem MUSD.MUSD is built on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain that split off from Bitcoin in 2017.Related: Senator Tim Scott slams partisan politics for failed stablecoin bill Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani told Cointelegraph in April that it was “in active discussions with potential partners” about launching the token after Governor Palacios’ veto and was “poised to act quickly” as US Congress is looking to pass stablecoin laws.In the US, one stablecoin bill, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, has since stalled in Congress after Senate Democrats pulled support for the bill due to concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto ventures.Another stablecoin-regulating bill in the House, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, has also lost Democrat support due to Trump’s crypto tie-ups.Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tinian-stablecoin-bill-comeback-mariana-senate-override-veto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-12T02:55:08.000Z,"‘Dark stablecoins’ could emerge as regulations tighten","Censorship-resistant “dark stablecoins” could come in increasing demand as governments tighten their oversight of the industry. Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”On the heels of US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration assuming power earlier this year, lawmakers are weighing stablecoin legislation, which seeks to regulate US stablecoins, ensuring their legal use for payments. The European Union has already brought in its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which, among other measures, mandates that stablecoins be regulated and transparent.Source: Ki Young JuJu speculates that a dark or private stablecoin could be created as an algorithmic stablecoin, with the value maintained through algorithmic mechanisms rather than being pegged to an external asset like gold, which makes it susceptible to interference from authorities. “One possible example could be a decentralized stablecoin that follows the price of regulated coins like USDC using data oracles like Chainlink,” he said.Another way would be stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions, or, for example, if Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations in the future.“USDT itself used to be considered a censorship-resistant stablecoin. If Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations under a future Trump administration, it could become a dark stablecoin in an increasingly censored internet economy,” Ju said.Privacy technology in crypto is already being usedZcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR) — while they aren’t stablecoins —already shield transactions and allow users to send and receive funds without revealing their transaction data on the blockchain.Related: Russia finance ministry official floats country making own stablecoins: ReportSeveral projects are also working on using similar technology for stablecoins, such as Zephyr Protocol, a Monero fork that hides transactions from being revealed on the blockchain.

2025-05-11T15:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are coming for DeFi — Wallets are the weakest link","Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic LabsCrypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.As AI agents increasingly operate in DeFi, this infrastructure limitation becomes critical. We need standardized infrastructure that allows for secure, cost-effective automation with verifiable guardrails across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Automation needs guardrails, not guessworkThe rise of autonomous agents opens new possibilities: hands-free DeFi strategies, real-time portfolio optimization and crosschain arbitrage. Without programmable permissions and onchain visibility, however, delegating control to AI can expose users to catastrophic risk. Malicious bots, hallucinating agents and poorly designed automation can drain wallets before a human notices.We’ve already seen what happens when agent infrastructure fails. In September 2024, users of the Telegram-based trading bot Banana Gun lost 563 Ether (ETH) (approximately $1.9 million) through an exploited oracle vulnerability that allowed attackers to intercept messages and gain unauthorized access to user wallets. More recently, attackers breached Aixbt’s dashboard and issued commands to transfer funds directly, resulting in the loss of 55.5 ETH worth over $100,000. These aren’t isolated incidents — they are warning signs of systemic vulnerability in our automation infrastructure. Legacy wallets can’t support autonomous agentsDespite years of wallet innovation, the architecture remains static mainly: sign a transaction, broadcast it, repeat. Most wallets aren’t built to understand “intent,” verify that automation matches user-defined rules, or restrict activity by time, asset type or strategy. This rigidity creates an all-or-nothing dynamic: either you maintain manual control and miss out on fast-moving opportunities or you hand over access entirely to opaque third-party systems. For AI-powered DeFi to scale securely as it builds more utility, we need programmable, composable and verifiable infrastructure. Programmable permissions are the new trust layerAs smart contracts encode logic into DeFi protocols, wallet infrastructure must encode logic into user control. That means enabling session-based permissions, cryptographic verification of agent actions and the ability to revoke access in real-time.Recent: AI and blockchain — A match made in heavenWith these features in place, users can delegate trading, rebalancing or strategy execution without giving up complete control. This approach doesn’t just mitigate risk — it expands access. Advanced DeFi strategies could become accessible to users without technical knowledge and managed securely by agents operating within verifiable constraints. Programmable infrastructure makes DeFi scalableProgrammable wallet infrastructure doesn’t just make DeFi safer — it makes it scalable. Fragmentation across chains and protocols has long been a barrier to automated strategies. A universal keystore protocol that syncs permissions across networks can streamline crosschain delegation and open the door for interoperable agent ecosystems. As institutional interest in DeFi grows, secure automation will be non-negotiable. Most firms won’t allow AI agents to interact with capital without verifiable guardrails. Just as zero-knowledge proofs are becoming essential to privacy and compliance, programmable wallet permissions may become standard for agent-based security. The future of DeFiSome may argue that AI can’t be trusted with financial autonomy, but traditional markets have already adopted algorithmic trading and black box automation. DeFi isn’t immune — it’s simply unprepared. If crypto is to maintain its transparency and user sovereignty principles, it must build infrastructure that keeps AI agents in check. That starts with rebuilding wallets as interfaces and operating systems for the autonomous, multichain economy. DeFi is on the edge of an automation revolution. The question isn’t whether agents will participate. Whether we give them the rails, they need to act in service of users, not in spite of them.Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-11T13:10:42.000Z,"Pectra lets hackers drain wallets with just an offchain signature","Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message.If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet’s code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.“Once the code is set,” Usman explained, “the attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account’s ETH or tokens—all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.”Source: Vladimir S. | Officer's NotesRelated: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new featuresWallets can be altered with offchain signatureYehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user’s account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract.“This tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user’s behalf,” Rudytsia said.Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker’s contract.“Pre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved… Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,” Rudytsia explained.The threat is real and immediate. “Pectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,” Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable.Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that “wallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum’s transaction types,” especially transaction type 0x04.He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses.This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.“We believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,” Rudytsia said. “From now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.”Source: NoirRelated: Pectra features already in use: Ethereum EIP-7702 wallets roll outHardware wallets are not safer anymoreHardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said. He added that hardware wallets from now on are at the same risk as hot wallets from the perspective of signing malicious messages. “If done—all the funds are gone in a moment.”There are ways to stay safe, but they require awareness. “Users should not sign the messages they do not understand,” Rudytsia advised. He also urged wallet developers to provide clear warnings when users are asked to sign a delegation message.Special caution should be taken with new delegation signature formats introduced by EIP-7702, which are not compatible with existing EIP-191 or EIP-712 standards. These messages often appear as simple 32-byte hashes and may bypass normal wallet warnings.“If a message includes your account nonce, it’s probably affecting your account directly,” Usman warned. “Normal sign-in messages or offchain commitments don’t usually involve your nonce.”Adding to the risk, EIP-7702 allows for signatures with chain_id = 0, meaning the signed message can be replayed on any Ethereum-compatible chain. “Understand it can be used anywhere,” Usman said.While multisignature wallets remain more secure under this upgrade, thanks to their requirement for multiple signers, single-key wallets — hardware or otherwise — must adopt new signature parsing and red-flagging tools to prevent potential exploitation.Alongside EIP-7702, Pectra also included EIP-7251, which raised Ethereum’s validator staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which increases the number of data blobs per block for better layer-2 scalability.Magazine: Bitcoin eyes ‘crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest, May 4 – 10",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/pectra-wallet-exploit-offchain-signature-risk?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-11T13:00:00.000Z,"8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year","Crypto services platform Nexo shared its plans to reenter the United States market on Monday, marking the eighth major crypto firm to announce such plans since US President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year.Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”Amid concerns of conflicts of interest and blatant token shilling by the Trump family, it remains to be seen whether these upcoming regulations will adequately protect everyday investors. Regardless, these are the eight firms that have banked on big bucks in the US this year.Binance.US resumes USD services; CZ seeks clemency Binance.US officially reinstated USD deposit and withdrawal services less than a month into Trump’s presidency. They were halted on June 13, 2023, on the back of a civil enforcement action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), claiming willful evasion of US laws and operating illegally in the country. Binance later settled for $2.7 billion; then-CEO Changpeng Zhao paid $150 million.Soon after halting USD on- and off-ramps, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a lawsuit. The agency claimed Zhao and Binance “engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.”In November 2023, Binance and CZ agreed on a settlement with the Department of Justice that included pleading guilty to federal charges, including violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, a $4.3-billion fine, CZ’s dismissal as CEO and a prison sentence.Zhao has sought clemency from President Trump, who has pardoned a number of crypto executives. Zhao (right) discusses his clemency request. Source: Farokh RadioeToro files for US IPO after 2024 enforcement actionOnline trading platform eToro publicly filed its registration statement for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The IPO is anticipated to occur as early as Q2 2025, pending market conditions, with eToro seeking a $4-billion valuation with plans to raise $500 million by offering 10 million Class A shares. The trading platform ran into some trouble with the SEC in 2024, when the agency claimed eToro “operated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities.”As a result, eToro paid a fine and agreed to reduce its crypto offerings for US customers to Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH).The move signals growing investor confidence in the future of retail cryptocurrency trading platforms in the US as the jurisdiction reorients its rules defining cryptocurrencies and loosens restrictions that made it more difficult for such platforms to receive banking services. OKX relaunches in the US months after $500-million settlementOKX, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, announced its reentry into the US market in April 2025. The company is implementing a phased rollout plan throughout the year and has established a new regional headquarters in San Jose, California. The firm also named Roshan Robert, recently of Barclays, as head of its US operations. Edit the caption here or remove the textThe relaunch comes just months after the firm announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). US attorneys alleged that the platform “knowingly violated anti-money laundering laws and avoided implementing required policies to prevent criminals from abusing our financial system” for over seven years. OKX paid a hefty $500-million fine, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and agreed to pay for an external compliance consultant. In a statement, OKX said, “There were no allegations of customer harm, no charges against any Company employee and no government appointed monitor as part of the settlement.Related: OKX to restart DEX with anti-abuse upgrades after Lazarus ‘misuse’Robert told Fortune that the firm was ramping up its compliance and risk management infrastructures ahead of the relaunch. He also cited the improving regulatory landscape as a contributor to the relaunch. “The rulemaking will take some time, but there is a path that we can see,” he said.Nexo returns to US markets after deadlock with regulatorsNexo, a global digital assets wealth platform, announced its return to the US market on April 28, 2025, at an event in Sofia, Bulgaria. According to industry media, US customers will have access to Nexo’s asset-backed credit lines, crypto savings accounts and advanced trading options.Nexo left the US in 2022 after 18 months of negotiations with federal regulators reached an impasse. Eight different state regulators had charged Nexo with allegedly failing to register its Earn Interest Product.Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev credited the crypto-friendly approach of President Trump with his firm’s relaunch: “America is back — and so is Nexo.”“Nexo is returning to America — stronger, smarter, and determined to win,” he added.Circle relocates to NYC ahead of IPOCircle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, is relocating its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in early 2025. The move to One World Trade Center aligns with Circle’s plans for an initial public offering and reflects its commitment to integrating with traditional financial markets. Circle filed for its IPO on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters. The firm is seeking a $5-billion valuation. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, “Our new headquarters near the top of One World Trade Center is a symbol of the trust, security and stability we’re building as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of finance.”Circle initially sought to go public via a blank-check firm in 2022, but the deal fell through.

2025-05-10T14:00:00.000Z,"In volatile markets, RWAs like gold are a lifeline","Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAACIt’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we have recently seen. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the price of gold soared 148% but stagnated for nearly a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered another rally, and it's likely we will see gold hold, if not fall from it's new record high once markets revive. While it remains an excellent hedge, gold’s long-term track record is not a growth story.Investors prefer US Treasurys or high-yield savings accounts as part of a balanced portfolio. While gold may outperform these assets in uncertain times, it offers a better balance of security and predictable income over the long term. The DeFi solution This is where DeFi brings innovation to the world’s oldest asset. DeFi can significantly modernize gold investing, offering the speed and transparency of blockchain-based transactions and the ability to earn returns.Currently, though, most tokenized gold is much the same as holding it in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Stablecoin giants like Tether and Paxos have launched gold-backed tokens, which they say are fully backed by physical, audited gold reserves, yet offer no yield.Recent: Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal grows during trade war uncertaintyMost DeFi investors prefer liquid, tradable assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which can generate attractive returns. Many would rather, for example, buy Tether’s USDt (USDT) stablecoin and stake it, earning rewards while still maintaining ownership.Perhaps this is why the market capitalization of gold-backed tokens remains modest. Tether Gold, the world’s most significant gold token, has a market capitalization of just under $835 million, for example, while Paxos Gold sits at around $799 million. Combined, this is equivalent to just 1% of the market cap of USDT. Unlocking income from the world’s oldest asset To unlock gold’s full potential, we need to take tokenization a step further by creating a DeFi ecosystem where tokenized gold is actively put to work — borrowed, lent and integrated into yield-bearing strategies.One possibility is for companies such as gold miners is to issue tokenized versions of their reserves that can be turned into stablecoins that can then be staked to earn a yield. Leveraging protocols whose liquidity mechanisms enable the trading of stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, holders could take advantage of further yield opportunities throughout the DeFi ecosystem.Beyond the benefits of yield opportunities, blockchain technology means investors in tokenized gold can benefit from the flexibility of 24-hour trading, near real-time price discovery and near-instant settlement without compromising the stability of the asset. The future of gold investingIt is, perhaps, ironic that — just as governments worldwide are starting to put their stamp of approval on digital finance — gold is becoming a highly desirable commodity again. The public’s interest in it will grow as governments essentially ratify digital finance. At the same time, the appetite for gold in these uncertain times will also increase. DeFi could bring these trends together and kickstart a natural evolution in gold ownership that provides a solid bridge between traditional and digital finance. While gold inside traditional markets attracts investors looking for stability, DeFi brings opportunities that don’t compromise that stability, as it presents new and unique yield opportunities. Gold has captivated humanity for thousands of years. It’s the foundation of myths, the standard of wealth and the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. But in today’s financial world, it needs an upgrade.Through integrating gold into the DeFi ecosystem, we could unlock its true potential — not just as a store of value but as an income-generating asset. The world’s oldest safe haven asset is finally on the brink of a digital evolution.Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts. Crypto is no exception, with 4chan also a historically influential gathering place to share altcoin alpha, coordinate campaigns to pump tokens, share price prophesies and more.With the imageboard back from the dead, here are just a few of the ways it has influenced the crypto space during its storied history.Finding alpha on 4chan’s /Biz/ imageboardThe primary hub of crypto activity on 4chan is its /Biz/, or “Business & Finance,” imageboard, where traders, gamblers, investors and commentators gather to share info, shill tokens, and discuss the state of the crypto industry at large. The imageboard has gathered a reputation for being a place where intrepid investors can go to learn about moonshot tokens the broader community has yet to discover, though X and Telegram have since given 4chan a run for its money. It has also been ground zero for countless shilling campaigns that have helped pump prices for various tokens.A Reddit user shares some tokens they discovered early on, thanks to /Biz/. Source: Deleted Reddit account/Biz/ has also become known for the various prophecies, lore and legends that emerge from its anonymous users. People who claim to have inside knowledge on major market movements often leak alleged secret info on the imageboard or issue prophecies, and every once in a while, they actually turn out to be accurate.In January 2019, a user correctly predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) would hit $5,300 by April and $9,200 by July, sparking huge interest online. Unfortunately, their remaining price predictions quickly fell short of reality, including that Bitcoin would hit $87,000 by October 2020.Another user claimed in May 2021 to work at a Chinese firm that collaborated closely with the government and said they had insider information that Bitcoin would sell off due to major news out of China.

The fake news led to Ether’s (ETH) market cap crashing by $4 billion before Buterin stepped in to share that he had, in fact, not died.The fake news that Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash started on /Biz/. Source: WarosuChainlink and the LINK MarinesPerhaps the most successful shilling campaign to come out of 4chan is that of Chainlink (LINK), which saw a massive rally that started in 2020 and continued into 2021. Many of the oracle project’s most diehard community members, known as the LINK Marines, first discovered Chainlink on /Biz/.Much of the excitement among the early Chainlink community was galvanized by a mysterious figure known as “AssBlaster,” who claimed to have insider knowledge about the project and would share alpha on /Biz/. Source: WarosuThe LINK Marines relentlessly promoted Chainlink on 4chan and social media platforms, and by 2020, LINK had experienced its first major rally — from $1.80 at the start of the year to a high of $16.64 on Aug. 12.Following the rally, Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang declared that “4chan has become the largest market driver” in crypto, “more powerful than even China or institutional crypto fund capital.”Related: Mechanism Capital founder doubles Bitcoin position with a $200M longLINK went on in 2021 to hit an all-time high of $49.54, becoming one of the year’s most talked-about crypto success stories.LINK’s price exploded to nearly $50 in 2021. Source: CoinMarketCapLINK Marine Albert Nazarov told Cointelegraph Magazine in March 2021 that “4chan is basically a crucible of raw thoughts; the best and balanced make it to the top. It’s almost anything goes there, and it trains the brain to decipher good info from bad stuff.”Chainlink remains the third most mentioned stock or cryptocurrency on /Biz/ over the last 24 hours as of the time of writing, behind only Bitcoin and Ether.Pepe the Frog and memes galoreOne of the most well-recognized memes associated with 4chan is Pepe the Frog, though its origins have nothing to do with the imageboard. Pepe was created by artist Matt Furie back in 2005 for a comic titled Boy’s Club.Over the next several years, Pepe was popularized by 4chan and eventually became a mainstream meme. But in 2015, posters from 4chan’s /R9k/ board decided to “reclaim” Pepe and began a campaign to intentionally associate it with the far right. Nevertheless, the frog remains a popular meme on 4chan and in crypto circles.In the cryptosphere, Pepe became closely associated with Chainlink. Sanctum CEO Tyler Ward, who sparked a Pepe non-fungible token (NFT) craze in 2021, told Magazine, “When Chainlink started doing well, it just became this cultish prophecy of 4chan, and 4chan really likes Pepe the frog, so it was kind of this merger.”“A lot of people that posted about Chainlink would post with Pepe the Frog, and they kind of became intertwined.”Crypto’s obsession with Pepe the Frog has since grown significantly beyond its early association with Chainlink. In 2023, the memecoin Pepe (PEPE), named after the frog, was launched and quickly became popular among traders. The token truly took off in 2024 amid the memecoin mania, going from a $591-million market cap at the start of the year to $11 billion by December, flipping Uniswap’s UNI (UNI) token.But Pepe is not the only 4chan meme to be tokenized and explode in price. Mog Coin (MOG), a memecoin based on the phrase “mogging” — dominating, outclassing or outshining others — gained 1,800% in early 2024. According to CoinGecko, 4chan-themed memecoins command a $37-billion market cap as of May 8.The popular phrase “we’re all gonna make it,” or WAGMI, was also popularized on 4chan. It was borrowed from Australian bodybuilder Aziz “Zyzz” Shavershian, who would frequently post on the Bodybuilding.com forum as well as 4chan’s fitness board and who passed away in 2011. It later made its way into crypto around 2017, seemingly as users who had been active in online fitness communities got into digital assets.Source: Snoop DoggDespite the growing attention platforms like Telegram and X command among the crypto community, 4chan remains a cultural powerhouse, and these are just a handful of the ways it has influenced crypto culture and markets. And with 4chan back online and seemingly fully committed to continuing its operations, they won’t be its final influences — at least as long as 4chan can avoid being taken down for good.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/4chan-rises-from-the-dead-how-the-imageboard-moves-crypto-markets?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-10T11:52:56.000Z,"UK to become ‘safe harbor’ for crypto with new draft rules — experts","On April 29, 2025, UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves unveiled plans for a “comprehensive regulatory regime” aimed at making the country a global leader in digital assets.Under the proposed rules, crypto exchanges, dealers, and agents will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms, with requirements for transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience, the UK Treasury said in a statement released following Reeves’ remarks.Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking.Rather than opting for a light-touch regime similar to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), the UK is applying the full weight of securities regulation to crypto, according to UK-based law firm Wiggin. That includes capital requirements, governance standards, market abuse rules, and disclosure obligations.“The UK’s draft crypto regulations represent a meaningful step toward embracing a rules-based digital asset economy,” Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, told Cointelegraph.“By signaling a willingness to provide regulatory clarity, the UK is positioning itself as a safe harbor for responsible innovation.”Disparte added that the proposed framework can provide the predictability needed to “scale responsible digital financial infrastructure in the UK.”Source: Mica Crypto AllianceRelated: Revolut doubles profits to $1.3B on user growth, crypto trading boomUK’s new crypto rules are “net positive”Vugar Usi Zade, the chief operating officer (COO) at Bitget exchange, also expressed optimism regarding the new regulations, claiming that it “is a net positive” for the industry.“I think a lot of companies recently exited or hesitated to enter the UK because they were not clear about what activities, products, and operations need FCA authorization. Firms finally get clear definitions of “qualifying crypto assets” and know exactly which activities—trading, custody, staking or lending—need FCA authorization.”For exchanges, including Bitget, the UK’s draft rules mean they need full approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer crypto trading, custody, staking, or lending services to UK users.The rules also give companies two years to adjust their systems, like capital and reporting. “Mapping each service line to the new perimeter adds compliance overhead, but that clarity lets us plan product roll‑outs and invest in local infrastructure,” Zade said.The new draft regulations reclassify stablecoins as securities, not as e-money. This means UK-issued fiat-backed tokens must meet prospectus-style disclosures and redemption protocols. Non-UK stablecoins can still circulate, but only via authorized venues.Zade claimed that excluding stablecoins from the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (EMRs), which keeps them out of the e‑money sandbox, could slow their use for payment.However, Disparte, whose firm is the issuer of USDC (USDC), the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, said predictability is key to fostering responsible growth in the UK.“What matters most is predictability: a framework that enables firms to build, test, and grow responsibly—without fear of arbitrary enforcement or shifting goalposts. If realized, this could mark a pivotal moment in the UK’s digital asset journey.”Ripple’s Cassie Craddock praising new UK draft rules. Source: Cassie CraddockRelated: UK regulator moves to restrict borrowing for crypto investmentsUK to require FCA approval for foreign crypto firmsAmong the biggest changes as part of the new draft rules is the territorial reach. Non-UK platforms serving UK retail clients will need the FCA authorization. The “overseas persons” exemption is limited to certain B2B relationships, effectively ring-fencing the UK retail market.Crypto staking enters the perimeter as well. Liquid and delegated staking services must now register, while solo stakers and purely interface-based providers are exempt. New custody rules extend to any setup that gives a party unilateral transfer rights, including certain lending and MPC (multiparty computation) arrangements.“Some DeFi nuances still need fleshing out, but the direction is toward efficient, tailored compliance rather than blanket restriction,” Bitget’s Zade said.He added that the broad “staking” definition might sweep in non‑custodial DeFi models lacking a central provider. “Proposed credit‑card purchase restrictions—though aimed at high‑risk use—could dampen retail participation in token launches,” he said.Furthermore, Zade said bank‑grade segregation rules for client assets could burden lean DeFi projects. “Final rule tweaks will need to mitigate these side effects.”The FCA plans to publish final rules on crypto sometime in 2026, setting the groundwork for the UK regulatory regime to go live. The roadmap to greater regulatory clarity in the UK could follow the European Union, which started to implement its MiCA framework in December.Magazine: Finally blast into space with Justin Sun, Vietnam’s new national blockchain: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-safe-harbor-crypto-draft-regulation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.In South Korea, users can receive a virtual card for $10 or a physical card for $100, with minimal verification requirements, including name, address, and ID.Reports on social media indicate that the card is currently available to Korean users. “You can use it right away with your smartphone without a physical card by simply verifying your identity upon issuance,” one user wrote on X.Source: BlippiRelated: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interviewRedotPay cards support major cryptocurrenciesThe RedotPay cards support major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) and stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT). Users can load their cards with crypto assets from several blockchains, including Solana, Polygon, BSC, Tron, and Arbitrum.One standout feature is RedotPay’s real-time stablecoin payment and refund system. When a purchase is made, stablecoins are deducted instantly from the user’s wallet.If a transaction is canceled, refunds in USDC or USDT are processed within minutes.RedotPay is also compatible with Apple Pay in Seoul, giving it an edge in a market where Apple Pay is currently limited to Hyundai Card customers. The compatibility could prove crucial as RedotPay challenges Korea’s established payment infrastructure.Crypto adoption has been accelerating in South Korea, where over 16 million people reportedly hold crypto. This has also made crypto a key topic in the 2025 South Korean presidential race.On May 6, South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung became the latest presidential candidate to promise the approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other crypto-friendly measures, should he be elected.South Korea’s ruling party, the People Power Party, also reportedly made crypto policy promises in late April, which included allowing spot crypto ETFs, dismantling Korea’s controversial one-exchange-one-bank rule, and establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, and now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/redotpay-crypto-payment-cards-south-korea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

He has repeatedly criticized the US dollar, labeling it a “dying” currency inflated by government spending and central bank manipulation.His financial philosophy, rooted in Austrian economics and personal sovereignty, champions assets that cannot be debased or politically controlled.Kiyosaki has long argued that bearer assets like gold, silver, and more recently Bitcoin, are critical hedges against inflation and key to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles.“Don’t work or save fake money,” he advised. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.”In an April 18 post, Kiyosaki forecasted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2035 as the US dollar continues to lose value to inflationary monetary policies.“I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” he said.Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future.In February 2025, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 if demand for the digital asset continues to grow.More recently, on Dec. 10, Eric Trump delivered the keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million due to its scarcity.Magazine: TradFi fans ignored Lyn Alden’s BTC tip — Now she says it’ll hit 7 figures: X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/robert-kiyosaki-bitcoin-gold-silver-fake-money?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. ETH's continued underperformance—trailing the altcoin market capitalization by 17% in 2025—helps explain the prevailing lack of investor confidence.Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully.Ethereum maintains leadership in decentralization and TVLIrrespective of Ether’s price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability. More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum’s position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether’s strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million.Ether US-listed spot ETFs' daily net flows, USD million. Source: Farside InvestorsThe muted enthusiasm following Ether’s recent bullish momentum can be partly attributed to the sharp 85% drop in Ethereum network fees from January to April. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol’s burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing.ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. Deribit 30-day ETH options delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.chCurrently, put (sell) options are trading at similar levels to equivalent call (buy) options, indicating a neutral sentiment. This outcome is somewhat discouraging for Ether bulls. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins.Related: Ether clocks ‘insane’ 20% candle post Pectra — A turning point?According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve.

The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry.According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking.Other crypto ETF issuers share that view. On Feb. 15, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a rule change to introduce staking services for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs. In April, the SEC delayed a decision on whether to approve or disapprove the rule change. BlackRock and Grayscale are behind the largest Ether ETFs by market capitalization, according to Sosovalue.Ethereum ETFs as of May 8.

A potential SEC approval of staking for Ether ETFs could lead to future requests among altcoins, including Solana (SOL) ETFs.Tokenization on the agendaBlackRock also discussed “tokenization of securities under federal securities regulatory framework.” Securities are traditional financial instruments where the investor expects monetary gain, such as bonds and stocks. Tokenizing securities has many benefits, including faster settlement times, lower costs than with traditional finance infrastructure, and 24-hour markets.BlackRock already offers a US federal debt tokenized fund called BUIDL, the largest fund with a $2.9 billion market cap. Competing products include Franklin Templeton's BENJI fund.Brokerage firm Robinhood is also exploring securities tokenization.

During a May 9 Cointelegraph X Space, Pai said a validator’s chances of proposing a block or earning rewards remain tied to how much ETH they hold, adding that larger validators don’t gain any new advantages under the upgrade: “Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it's not the case that if you're a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”Pectra is Ethereum’s most extensive network upgrade since the Merge took place in September 2022. Pectra allows validators to stake as much as 2,048 ETH, up from the previous limit of 32 ETH. The new standard has raised community concerns about the risks of centralization on the network.According to Pai, the Pectra upgrade has taken “a bunch of busy work that the network was doing behind the scenes and removed it.”Pai noted that while there are about a million technical validators on Ethereum, many aren’t truly distinct — large validators often operate numerous virtual keys from a single physical machine. With the Pectra upgrade, those keys can now be consolidated — something he says they are already seeing.“In the best case, we’ll get to about 30,000 validators,” he said, adding that this consolidation reduces auxiliary work and enables network stakeholders to focus on what matters, such as lowering gas limits.Related: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new features — How long before ETH price reacts?New Pectra staking limit paves the way for institutionsThe new limit could pave the way for institutions to stake ETH, according to Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org. “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.”Ether staking within exchange-traded funds has been a hot topic in 2025. BlackRock has said that the successful Ether ETFs are less perfect without staking, and multiple financial institutions have filed for amendments to their Ether ETFs to allow for staking.If approved, investors might be more inclined to buy into the ETFs, as they could receive yield.

2025-05-09T19:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price rallies as global liquidity growth accelerates — Analysts","Key takeaways:Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?Liquidity is Bitcoin's silent price driverRaoul Pal, the founder of Global Macro Investor, recently gave a speech on the strong correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 liquidity. In a recap posted by Paul Guerra, Pal’s message refers to: despite looming concerns—recession risks, geopolitical tensions, and other global stressors—rising liquidity as the dominant force behind asset price action. According to Pal, expanding liquidity backs up to 90% of Bitcoin’s price action and as much as 97% of the Nasdaq’s performance. Indeed, a chart comparing global M2 (with a 12-week lead) and Bitcoin’s price shows an almost uncanny alignment.Global M2 and BTC/USD. Source: Real VisionPal also frames the issue in personal finance terms. He says there's an 11% \""hidden tax\"" on all of us, composed of 8% currency debasement and 3% global inflation. He notes,“If you’re not earning more than 11%/yr, you’re getting poorer by definition.”Bitcoin has returned an average of 130% annually since 2012, despite dramatic drawdowns. That makes it one of the most asymmetric bets of the past decade—and it’s outperformed the Nasdaq by over 99%.What drives global liquidity?At its core, global liquidity is fueled by expanding the money supply. As independent investor Lyn Alden puts it,“Fiat currency systems are primarily based on ever-growing debt levels. The money supply continuously grows in every country for this reason.”This offers a high-level view of global liquidity and suggests its long-term expansion is structural. However, this growth isn't linear. Over shorter time frames, it fluctuates based on specific drivers. Michael Howell, author of “Capital Wars,” identifies three main drivers currently impacting global liquidity: the US Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and banks lending through collateral markets.Global liquidity drivers. Source: Michael HowellHowell also points to indirect influences that act with a lag of 6 to 15 months. These include the world business cycle, oil prices, dollar strength, and bond market volatility. A weak global economy and a softening dollar typically boost liquidity. But rising bond volatility tightens collateral supply and chokes lending, undermining liquidity.Related: New bull cycle? Bitcoin's return to $100K hints at ‘significant price move’How long will global liquidity rise?Michael Howell believes that global liquidity moves in roughly five-year cycles, and is now on the way to its local peak. He projects the current cycle to mature by mid-2026, reaching an index level of around 70 (below the post-COVID index of 90). That would mark a turning point, with a subsequent downturn being a likely outcome.Global liquidity cycle. Source: Michael HowellThe recent growth in global liquidity stems from the rapidly weakening world economy, which is likely to prompt further easing by central banks. The People’s Bank of China has already begun injecting liquidity into the system. The Fed now faces a tough choice: continue fighting inflation or pivot to support an increasingly fragile financial system. At its May 7 meeting, rates were held steady, but the pressure on Chair Jerome Powell is mounting, especially from US President Donald Trump.At the same time, economic uncertainty is driving up US Treasury yields and fueling bond market volatility, both indicators of collateral scarcity and tightening credit conditions. Over time, these pressures are likely to become headwinds for liquidity expansion. Meanwhile, a looming recession is expected to weaken investor risk appetite, further draining liquidity from the system.Even if a downturn lies ahead in 2026, global liquidity still has room to run, at least through 2025. And that matters for Bitcoin.Howell notes,“The likely inevitable policy response of ‘more liquidity’ is a great future omen. It establishes the upward path of persistent monetary inflation that ultimately underpins hedges such as gold, quality equities, prime residential real estate, and Bitcoin.”Interestingly, Howell’s liquidity cycle roughly aligns with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle. The former points to a potential peak in late 2025, and the latter in early 2026. If history rhymes again, that convergence could set the stage for a major price move.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Budorin said that the space implements limited measures instead of deploying comprehensive strategies. “Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough,” Budorin told Cointelegraph. Continue readingAI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarWhile gaming and DeFi held on to the top spot in the decentralized applications (DApps) ecosystem, artificial intelligence is slowly catching up. Blockchain analytics platform DappRadar showed that Gaming and DeFi saw 21% DApp dominance in April.

In a Token2049 interview, Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca told Cointelegraph that investors' moods have shifted from short-term speculation to a more long-term outlook on Bitcoin. Rocca said that the confidence comes from broader institutional adoption and Bitcoin's price levels that are \""nowhere near\"" liquidation. Rocca said Bitcoin-backed loans allow holders to stay exposed to the asset when facing unexpected expenses.
