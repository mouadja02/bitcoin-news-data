DeFillama meanwhile shows Uniswap is the leading DEX with a 23% market share in daily volumes, which it reports as slightly lower at $3 billion over the past 24 hours. The second-largest DEX in volume is PancakeSwap, with $2.7 billion and a 21% DEX market share. Uniswap has a current total value locked of just under $5 billion. However, this figure is around half of its 2021 all-time high, as overall DeFi total value locked (TVL) is about half of what it was in late 2021.DeFillama reports a DeFi TVL of $124 billion, while DappRadar reports $132 billion, with more than half of this total on Ethereum. Uniswap reaches total trade volume milestone.

2025-05-12T06:12:06.000Z,"DeFi lending TVL is outpacing DEXs due to more sustainable yield — VC","Crypto users could be looking for a more sustainable yield this cycle, as total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending continues to hit new highs while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have lagged in comparison.DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.Change in crypto lending protocol TVL since 2019. Source: DeFiLlamaIn stark contrast, DEXs, which once held nearly double the TVL of their closest competitor, have dropped from $85.3 billion in November 2021 to $21.5 billion today.Explaining the rise in DeFi lending and fall in DEX TVL, the founder of crypto fund Apollo Capital, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph that lending is arguably the “only sustainable way to produce yield” in DeFi, as DEX liquidity pooling has largely become unprofitable due to impermanent loss.He also argued that the industry-leading DEX Uniswap v3’s more “capital efficient” design, relative to Uniswap v2, may have contributed to the DEX TVL fall, as liquidity providers can now earn more rewards with less upfront capital.Andersson also pointed out that the rise of intent-based swaps — a relatively new crosschain trading mechanism — may have further reduced the DEX TVL, as market makers typically source liquidity from centralized exchanges to facilitate these swaps.DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Compound Finance enable crypto users to lend assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral. Smart contracts manage deposits, loans and interest rates to ensure trustless transactions.DeFi users who supply Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) on Aave, for example, currently earn an annual percentage yield of 1.86% and 3.17%, respectively.Providing stablecoins and Ether to DEX pools such as Uniswap’s can offer higher rewards; however, as Andersson pointed out, they’re far less sustainable, fluctuating by the day.DeFi now dominates CeFi in crypto lending market DeFi-based crypto lending accounted for around 65% of the total market by the end of 2024 and has increased or maintained its market share against centralized lenders every quarter since Q4 2022, an April report from crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital showed.The fall started occurring around the time several centralized crypto lenders such as Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager fell bankrupt, causing TVL to fall massively.Related: Bitcoin hits $103K but DeFi is a mixed bag: Finance RedefinedTheir collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the crypto lending market from the 2022 peak to the bear market trough, Galaxy noted.Change in market share between centralized and decentralized crypto lending protocols between Q3 2018 and Q4 2024.

The victim had finished hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas, and when he returned home, the suspects forced him into a vehicle and drove him to a remote desert area an hour away from the city. There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now. The man was allegedly told to comply with the teens’ demands if he wanted to “live to see another day,” and because they also “had his dad and would kill him,” according to the report. It’s also alleged that a fourth person may have been communicating with the three young men through a phone call during the incident, which the victim could hear through a speakerphone.After having his accounts drained of $4 million in crypto and NFTs, the victim reportedly walked five miles back through the desert to reach a gas station where he could call a friend for help. Two 16-year-olds from Florida are facing charges including robbery, kidnapping, and extortion in connection with the incident. A third teen allegedly involved in the plot has left the country, prosecutors say.One of the young men is behind bars with bail set at $4 million, while the other has been released under house arrest with electronic monitoring. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June, with both teens set to be tried as adults. Digital asset lawyer Sasha Hodder said in a May 10 X post that this case illustrates how “Crypto theft is evolving.

Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11.Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April. At the time, people wondered if Bitcoin’s relative strength came from the narrative that countries were using Bitcoin to bypass tariffs.

2025-05-12T03:20:12.000Z,"Stablecoin bill gets second chance with Northern Mariana lawmakers","Tinian, a small island in the US territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, could get a second chance at launching a stablecoin after the territory’s Senate voted to override the governor’s earlier veto of its stablecoin bill.On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios' April 11 veto of the bill, which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.If the House is quick to pass the bill, the Tinian government could be in the lead for the first US public entity to issue a stablecoin. It’s in a race against the state of Wyoming, which is aiming to issue a stablecoin by July.Tinian is governed by the local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, and is one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a small US territory in the Pacific north of Guam. Tinian has just over 2,000 residents, and its economy heavily relies on tourism.Senators push “much-needed” bill despite “deep concerns” Governor Palacios said in his letter last month that he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional” and would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian.Democrat Senator Celina Babauta, the only one to vote against overriding the veto, said before the vote that she had “deep concerns with respect to the lack of resources, the lack of manpower” to enforce the gambling law and police use of the stablecoin.“We are restricted by federal statutes and must comply with that,” she added.Senator Celina Babauta (right) delivers remarks at a Senate hearing alongside Senator Karl King-Nabors (middle). Source: YouTube“We struggle with trying to find creative and innovative ways to diversify our economy and our industries,” Babauta said. “I don't believe that gambling is the only thing that we can be looking forward to every single time there's an investor that comes in.”However, Republican Senator Karl King-Nabors, who represents Tinian and co-authored the bill, said it was “a far more stringent and efficient way to oversee the online gaming aspect.”“This stablecoin is tracked through software, and if anything, it allows for more transparency when it comes to the Tinian Casino Gaming Control Commission,” he added.King-Nabors said the bill aligned with “much-needed” economic diversification measures, as the local economy was yet to bounce back from a COVID-19 pandemic-induced slump.“This legislation stands at a time where we're going through so much economic hardships,” King-Nabors added. “I find it difficult that we're constantly having to step over obstacles when we're trying to incentivize and look for ways to bring in revenue that don't affect our environment, that don't require a brick and mortar, that don't impact our land.”Tinian bids for fully-backed stablecoinRepublican Senator for Tinian, Jude Hofschneider, led the introduction of the bill in February, which aims to amend a local Tinian law to allow internet-only casino licenses, along with allowing the island to launch a fully backed US dollar-pegged stablecoin.A four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature, which includes Hofschneider and King-Nabors, had passed the bill to Governor Palacios in a unanimous vote on March 12.Statements shared with Cointelegraph in March said the stablecoin is called the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD) and will be backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury.The Tinian government chose tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation, based in the Northern Mariana Islands’ capital of Saipan, as the exclusive infrastructure provider to issue and redeem MUSD.MUSD is built on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a blockchain that split off from Bitcoin in 2017.Related: Senator Tim Scott slams partisan politics for failed stablecoin bill Marianas Rai Corp. co-founder and technology chief Vin Armani told Cointelegraph in April that it was “in active discussions with potential partners” about launching the token after Governor Palacios’ veto and was “poised to act quickly” as US Congress is looking to pass stablecoin laws.In the US, one stablecoin bill, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, has since stalled in Congress after Senate Democrats pulled support for the bill due to concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto ventures.Another stablecoin-regulating bill in the House, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, has also lost Democrat support due to Trump’s crypto tie-ups.Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tinian-stablecoin-bill-comeback-mariana-senate-override-veto?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-12T02:55:08.000Z,"‘Dark stablecoins’ could emerge as regulations tighten","Censorship-resistant “dark stablecoins” could come in increasing demand as governments tighten their oversight of the industry. Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”On the heels of US President Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration assuming power earlier this year, lawmakers are weighing stablecoin legislation, which seeks to regulate US stablecoins, ensuring their legal use for payments. The European Union has already brought in its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which, among other measures, mandates that stablecoins be regulated and transparent.Source: Ki Young JuJu speculates that a dark or private stablecoin could be created as an algorithmic stablecoin, with the value maintained through algorithmic mechanisms rather than being pegged to an external asset like gold, which makes it susceptible to interference from authorities. “One possible example could be a decentralized stablecoin that follows the price of regulated coins like USDC using data oracles like Chainlink,” he said.Another way would be stablecoins issued by countries that don’t censor financial transactions, or, for example, if Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations in the future.“USDT itself used to be considered a censorship-resistant stablecoin. If Tether chooses not to comply with US government regulations under a future Trump administration, it could become a dark stablecoin in an increasingly censored internet economy,” Ju said.Privacy technology in crypto is already being usedZcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR) — while they aren’t stablecoins —already shield transactions and allow users to send and receive funds without revealing their transaction data on the blockchain.Related: Russia finance ministry official floats country making own stablecoins: ReportSeveral projects are also working on using similar technology for stablecoins, such as Zephyr Protocol, a Monero fork that hides transactions from being revealed on the blockchain.

If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31. If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19).

2025-05-11T15:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are coming for DeFi — Wallets are the weakest link","Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic LabsCrypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.As AI agents increasingly operate in DeFi, this infrastructure limitation becomes critical. We need standardized infrastructure that allows for secure, cost-effective automation with verifiable guardrails across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Automation needs guardrails, not guessworkThe rise of autonomous agents opens new possibilities: hands-free DeFi strategies, real-time portfolio optimization and crosschain arbitrage. Without programmable permissions and onchain visibility, however, delegating control to AI can expose users to catastrophic risk. Malicious bots, hallucinating agents and poorly designed automation can drain wallets before a human notices.We’ve already seen what happens when agent infrastructure fails. In September 2024, users of the Telegram-based trading bot Banana Gun lost 563 Ether (ETH) (approximately $1.9 million) through an exploited oracle vulnerability that allowed attackers to intercept messages and gain unauthorized access to user wallets. More recently, attackers breached Aixbt’s dashboard and issued commands to transfer funds directly, resulting in the loss of 55.5 ETH worth over $100,000. These aren’t isolated incidents — they are warning signs of systemic vulnerability in our automation infrastructure. Legacy wallets can’t support autonomous agentsDespite years of wallet innovation, the architecture remains static mainly: sign a transaction, broadcast it, repeat. Most wallets aren’t built to understand “intent,” verify that automation matches user-defined rules, or restrict activity by time, asset type or strategy. This rigidity creates an all-or-nothing dynamic: either you maintain manual control and miss out on fast-moving opportunities or you hand over access entirely to opaque third-party systems. For AI-powered DeFi to scale securely as it builds more utility, we need programmable, composable and verifiable infrastructure. Programmable permissions are the new trust layerAs smart contracts encode logic into DeFi protocols, wallet infrastructure must encode logic into user control. That means enabling session-based permissions, cryptographic verification of agent actions and the ability to revoke access in real-time.Recent: AI and blockchain — A match made in heavenWith these features in place, users can delegate trading, rebalancing or strategy execution without giving up complete control. This approach doesn’t just mitigate risk — it expands access. Advanced DeFi strategies could become accessible to users without technical knowledge and managed securely by agents operating within verifiable constraints. Programmable infrastructure makes DeFi scalableProgrammable wallet infrastructure doesn’t just make DeFi safer — it makes it scalable. Fragmentation across chains and protocols has long been a barrier to automated strategies. A universal keystore protocol that syncs permissions across networks can streamline crosschain delegation and open the door for interoperable agent ecosystems. As institutional interest in DeFi grows, secure automation will be non-negotiable. Most firms won’t allow AI agents to interact with capital without verifiable guardrails. Just as zero-knowledge proofs are becoming essential to privacy and compliance, programmable wallet permissions may become standard for agent-based security. The future of DeFiSome may argue that AI can’t be trusted with financial autonomy, but traditional markets have already adopted algorithmic trading and black box automation. DeFi isn’t immune — it’s simply unprepared. If crypto is to maintain its transparency and user sovereignty principles, it must build infrastructure that keeps AI agents in check. That starts with rebuilding wallets as interfaces and operating systems for the autonomous, multichain economy. DeFi is on the edge of an automation revolution. The question isn’t whether agents will participate. Whether we give them the rails, they need to act in service of users, not in spite of them.Opinion by: Sean Li, co-founder of Magic Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-11T13:10:42.000Z,"Pectra lets hackers drain wallets with just an offchain signature","Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”At the center of the risk is EIP-7702, a core component of the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message.If an attacker obtains this signature — say, via a phishing site — they can overwrite the wallet’s code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.“Once the code is set,” Usman explained, “the attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account’s ETH or tokens—all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.”Source: Vladimir S. | Officer's NotesRelated: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new featuresWallets can be altered with offchain signatureYehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user’s account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract.“This tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user’s behalf,” Rudytsia said.Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker’s contract.“Pre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved… Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,” Rudytsia explained.The threat is real and immediate. “Pectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,” Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable.Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that “wallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum’s transaction types,” especially transaction type 0x04.He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses.This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.“We believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,” Rudytsia said. “From now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.”Source: NoirRelated: Pectra features already in use: Ethereum EIP-7702 wallets roll outHardware wallets are not safer anymoreHardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said. He added that hardware wallets from now on are at the same risk as hot wallets from the perspective of signing malicious messages. “If done—all the funds are gone in a moment.”There are ways to stay safe, but they require awareness. “Users should not sign the messages they do not understand,” Rudytsia advised. He also urged wallet developers to provide clear warnings when users are asked to sign a delegation message.Special caution should be taken with new delegation signature formats introduced by EIP-7702, which are not compatible with existing EIP-191 or EIP-712 standards. These messages often appear as simple 32-byte hashes and may bypass normal wallet warnings.“If a message includes your account nonce, it’s probably affecting your account directly,” Usman warned. “Normal sign-in messages or offchain commitments don’t usually involve your nonce.”Adding to the risk, EIP-7702 allows for signatures with chain_id = 0, meaning the signed message can be replayed on any Ethereum-compatible chain. “Understand it can be used anywhere,” Usman said.While multisignature wallets remain more secure under this upgrade, thanks to their requirement for multiple signers, single-key wallets — hardware or otherwise — must adopt new signature parsing and red-flagging tools to prevent potential exploitation.Alongside EIP-7702, Pectra also included EIP-7251, which raised Ethereum’s validator staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691, which increases the number of data blobs per block for better layer-2 scalability.Magazine: Bitcoin eyes ‘crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest, May 4 – 10",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/pectra-wallet-exploit-offchain-signature-risk?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-11T13:00:00.000Z,"8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year","Crypto services platform Nexo shared its plans to reenter the United States market on Monday, marking the eighth major crypto firm to announce such plans since US President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year.Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”Amid concerns of conflicts of interest and blatant token shilling by the Trump family, it remains to be seen whether these upcoming regulations will adequately protect everyday investors. Regardless, these are the eight firms that have banked on big bucks in the US this year.Binance.US resumes USD services; CZ seeks clemency Binance.US officially reinstated USD deposit and withdrawal services less than a month into Trump’s presidency. They were halted on June 13, 2023, on the back of a civil enforcement action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), claiming willful evasion of US laws and operating illegally in the country. Binance later settled for $2.7 billion; then-CEO Changpeng Zhao paid $150 million.Soon after halting USD on- and off-ramps, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a lawsuit. The agency claimed Zhao and Binance “engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.”In November 2023, Binance and CZ agreed on a settlement with the Department of Justice that included pleading guilty to federal charges, including violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, a $4.3-billion fine, CZ’s dismissal as CEO and a prison sentence.Zhao has sought clemency from President Trump, who has pardoned a number of crypto executives. Zhao (right) discusses his clemency request. Source: Farokh RadioeToro files for US IPO after 2024 enforcement actionOnline trading platform eToro publicly filed its registration statement for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The IPO is anticipated to occur as early as Q2 2025, pending market conditions, with eToro seeking a $4-billion valuation with plans to raise $500 million by offering 10 million Class A shares. The trading platform ran into some trouble with the SEC in 2024, when the agency claimed eToro “operated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities.”As a result, eToro paid a fine and agreed to reduce its crypto offerings for US customers to Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH).The move signals growing investor confidence in the future of retail cryptocurrency trading platforms in the US as the jurisdiction reorients its rules defining cryptocurrencies and loosens restrictions that made it more difficult for such platforms to receive banking services. OKX relaunches in the US months after $500-million settlementOKX, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, announced its reentry into the US market in April 2025. The company is implementing a phased rollout plan throughout the year and has established a new regional headquarters in San Jose, California. The firm also named Roshan Robert, recently of Barclays, as head of its US operations. Edit the caption here or remove the textThe relaunch comes just months after the firm announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). US attorneys alleged that the platform “knowingly violated anti-money laundering laws and avoided implementing required policies to prevent criminals from abusing our financial system” for over seven years. OKX paid a hefty $500-million fine, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and agreed to pay for an external compliance consultant. In a statement, OKX said, “There were no allegations of customer harm, no charges against any Company employee and no government appointed monitor as part of the settlement.Related: OKX to restart DEX with anti-abuse upgrades after Lazarus ‘misuse’Robert told Fortune that the firm was ramping up its compliance and risk management infrastructures ahead of the relaunch. He also cited the improving regulatory landscape as a contributor to the relaunch. “The rulemaking will take some time, but there is a path that we can see,” he said.Nexo returns to US markets after deadlock with regulatorsNexo, a global digital assets wealth platform, announced its return to the US market on April 28, 2025, at an event in Sofia, Bulgaria. According to industry media, US customers will have access to Nexo’s asset-backed credit lines, crypto savings accounts and advanced trading options.Nexo left the US in 2022 after 18 months of negotiations with federal regulators reached an impasse. Eight different state regulators had charged Nexo with allegedly failing to register its Earn Interest Product.Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev credited the crypto-friendly approach of President Trump with his firm’s relaunch: “America is back — and so is Nexo.”“Nexo is returning to America — stronger, smarter, and determined to win,” he added.Circle relocates to NYC ahead of IPOCircle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, is relocating its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in early 2025. The move to One World Trade Center aligns with Circle’s plans for an initial public offering and reflects its commitment to integrating with traditional financial markets. Circle filed for its IPO on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters. The firm is seeking a $5-billion valuation. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, “Our new headquarters near the top of One World Trade Center is a symbol of the trust, security and stability we’re building as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of finance.”Circle initially sought to go public via a blank-check firm in 2022, but the deal fell through. The deal would have valued Circle at $9 billion at the time. Crypto.com introduces stock and ETF tradingCrypto.com is expanding its services in the US throughout 2025, including introducing trading for stocks and ETFs. The company is rolling out these offerings in phases as part of its 2025 roadmap, including significant expansions of its banking, crypto, stock and credit card services for US customers. The plan shows the company’s broader strategy of integrating crypto with traditional finance, a theme recurring with many crypto and finance firms operating in the US. Travis McGhee, Crypto.com managing director and head of global capital markets, said that the firm is letting clients “marry up that capability [trading stocks and ETFs] with your crypto trading, as well as your crypto derivative trading.” McGhee added that “there’s a lot of tailwinds” pushing the industry ahead, including an “administration that is [...] looking to put a regulatory framework into place.” “That just bodes well for a strong market and a strong future for crypto.”a16z returns to US after initial UK moveAndreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced that it is closing shop in the UK and focusing its efforts on the US. In a Jan. 24 X post, Anthony Albanese, chief operating officer of Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, said the firm will be closing its UK branch despite the “enthusiasm for crypto building and adoption” in the country.According to Sifted, the UK government had spent five years wooing a16z to move to London, just for the firm to leave 18 months after it opened its offices there. Related: A16z leads $25M funding for Miden blockchain projectA16z launched offices in London in 2023, citing the regulatory environment under former President Joe Biden as too unfriendly to the blockchain industry. Albanese said there was “strong momentum” behind the crypto industry with the inauguration of President Trump.Per TechCrunch, other factors driving a16z’s relocation were the slow progress on crypto in the UK and the Labour government shifting its priorities away from digital assets.Coinbase acquires Deribit in bid to capture derivatives marketUS-based crypto exchange Coinbase bought crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion on May 8. The merger makes Coinbase the largest crypto derivatives platform by open interest, per an exchange blog post. The deal comes as major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood jockey to dominate the growing global crypto derivative market. On the day of the announcement, Coinbase’s international derivatives exchange saw $10 billion in trading.Source: CoinbaseMagazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nexo-8-crypto-firms-us-expansion-this-year?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-10T14:00:00.000Z,"In volatile markets, RWAs like gold are a lifeline","Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAACIt’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we have recently seen. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the price of gold soared 148% but stagnated for nearly a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered another rally, and it's likely we will see gold hold, if not fall from it's new record high once markets revive. While it remains an excellent hedge, gold’s long-term track record is not a growth story.Investors prefer US Treasurys or high-yield savings accounts as part of a balanced portfolio. While gold may outperform these assets in uncertain times, it offers a better balance of security and predictable income over the long term. The DeFi solution This is where DeFi brings innovation to the world’s oldest asset. DeFi can significantly modernize gold investing, offering the speed and transparency of blockchain-based transactions and the ability to earn returns.Currently, though, most tokenized gold is much the same as holding it in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Stablecoin giants like Tether and Paxos have launched gold-backed tokens, which they say are fully backed by physical, audited gold reserves, yet offer no yield.Recent: Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal grows during trade war uncertaintyMost DeFi investors prefer liquid, tradable assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which can generate attractive returns. Many would rather, for example, buy Tether’s USDt (USDT) stablecoin and stake it, earning rewards while still maintaining ownership.Perhaps this is why the market capitalization of gold-backed tokens remains modest. Tether Gold, the world’s most significant gold token, has a market capitalization of just under $835 million, for example, while Paxos Gold sits at around $799 million. Combined, this is equivalent to just 1% of the market cap of USDT. Unlocking income from the world’s oldest asset To unlock gold’s full potential, we need to take tokenization a step further by creating a DeFi ecosystem where tokenized gold is actively put to work — borrowed, lent and integrated into yield-bearing strategies.One possibility is for companies such as gold miners is to issue tokenized versions of their reserves that can be turned into stablecoins that can then be staked to earn a yield. Leveraging protocols whose liquidity mechanisms enable the trading of stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, holders could take advantage of further yield opportunities throughout the DeFi ecosystem.Beyond the benefits of yield opportunities, blockchain technology means investors in tokenized gold can benefit from the flexibility of 24-hour trading, near real-time price discovery and near-instant settlement without compromising the stability of the asset. The future of gold investingIt is, perhaps, ironic that — just as governments worldwide are starting to put their stamp of approval on digital finance — gold is becoming a highly desirable commodity again. The public’s interest in it will grow as governments essentially ratify digital finance. At the same time, the appetite for gold in these uncertain times will also increase. DeFi could bring these trends together and kickstart a natural evolution in gold ownership that provides a solid bridge between traditional and digital finance. While gold inside traditional markets attracts investors looking for stability, DeFi brings opportunities that don’t compromise that stability, as it presents new and unique yield opportunities. Gold has captivated humanity for thousands of years. It’s the foundation of myths, the standard of wealth and the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. But in today’s financial world, it needs an upgrade.Through integrating gold into the DeFi ecosystem, we could unlock its true potential — not just as a store of value but as an income-generating asset. The world’s oldest safe haven asset is finally on the brink of a digital evolution.Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-10T13:00:00.000Z,"4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto markets","After 4chan was hacked on April 14 and vast troves of user and moderator data were leaked online, the controversial website quickly went down, and many believed it would never recover. However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts. Crypto is no exception, with 4chan also a historically influential gathering place to share altcoin alpha, coordinate campaigns to pump tokens, share price prophesies and more.With the imageboard back from the dead, here are just a few of the ways it has influenced the crypto space during its storied history.Finding alpha on 4chan’s /Biz/ imageboardThe primary hub of crypto activity on 4chan is its /Biz/, or “Business & Finance,” imageboard, where traders, gamblers, investors and commentators gather to share info, shill tokens, and discuss the state of the crypto industry at large. The imageboard has gathered a reputation for being a place where intrepid investors can go to learn about moonshot tokens the broader community has yet to discover, though X and Telegram have since given 4chan a run for its money. It has also been ground zero for countless shilling campaigns that have helped pump prices for various tokens.A Reddit user shares some tokens they discovered early on, thanks to /Biz/. Source: Deleted Reddit account/Biz/ has also become known for the various prophecies, lore and legends that emerge from its anonymous users. People who claim to have inside knowledge on major market movements often leak alleged secret info on the imageboard or issue prophecies, and every once in a while, they actually turn out to be accurate.In January 2019, a user correctly predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) would hit $5,300 by April and $9,200 by July, sparking huge interest online. Unfortunately, their remaining price predictions quickly fell short of reality, including that Bitcoin would hit $87,000 by October 2020.Another user claimed in May 2021 to work at a Chinese firm that collaborated closely with the government and said they had insider information that Bitcoin would sell off due to major news out of China. A few hours later, reports emerged that China would ban payment companies and financial institutions from offering services related to crypto transactions, and Bitcoin sold off./Biz/ was also the source of a June 2017 rumor that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash. The fake news led to Ether’s (ETH) market cap crashing by $4 billion before Buterin stepped in to share that he had, in fact, not died.The fake news that Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash started on /Biz/. Source: WarosuChainlink and the LINK MarinesPerhaps the most successful shilling campaign to come out of 4chan is that of Chainlink (LINK), which saw a massive rally that started in 2020 and continued into 2021. Many of the oracle project’s most diehard community members, known as the LINK Marines, first discovered Chainlink on /Biz/.Much of the excitement among the early Chainlink community was galvanized by a mysterious figure known as “AssBlaster,” who claimed to have insider knowledge about the project and would share alpha on /Biz/. Source: WarosuThe LINK Marines relentlessly promoted Chainlink on 4chan and social media platforms, and by 2020, LINK had experienced its first major rally — from $1.80 at the start of the year to a high of $16.64 on Aug. 12.Following the rally, Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang declared that “4chan has become the largest market driver” in crypto, “more powerful than even China or institutional crypto fund capital.”Related: Mechanism Capital founder doubles Bitcoin position with a $200M longLINK went on in 2021 to hit an all-time high of $49.54, becoming one of the year’s most talked-about crypto success stories.LINK’s price exploded to nearly $50 in 2021. Source: CoinMarketCapLINK Marine Albert Nazarov told Cointelegraph Magazine in March 2021 that “4chan is basically a crucible of raw thoughts; the best and balanced make it to the top. It’s almost anything goes there, and it trains the brain to decipher good info from bad stuff.”Chainlink remains the third most mentioned stock or cryptocurrency on /Biz/ over the last 24 hours as of the time of writing, behind only Bitcoin and Ether.Pepe the Frog and memes galoreOne of the most well-recognized memes associated with 4chan is Pepe the Frog, though its origins have nothing to do with the imageboard. Pepe was created by artist Matt Furie back in 2005 for a comic titled Boy’s Club.Over the next several years, Pepe was popularized by 4chan and eventually became a mainstream meme. But in 2015, posters from 4chan’s /R9k/ board decided to “reclaim” Pepe and began a campaign to intentionally associate it with the far right. Nevertheless, the frog remains a popular meme on 4chan and in crypto circles.In the cryptosphere, Pepe became closely associated with Chainlink. Sanctum CEO Tyler Ward, who sparked a Pepe non-fungible token (NFT) craze in 2021, told Magazine, “When Chainlink started doing well, it just became this cultish prophecy of 4chan, and 4chan really likes Pepe the frog, so it was kind of this merger.”“A lot of people that posted about Chainlink would post with Pepe the Frog, and they kind of became intertwined.”Crypto’s obsession with Pepe the Frog has since grown significantly beyond its early association with Chainlink. In 2023, the memecoin Pepe (PEPE), named after the frog, was launched and quickly became popular among traders. The token truly took off in 2024 amid the memecoin mania, going from a $591-million market cap at the start of the year to $11 billion by December, flipping Uniswap’s UNI (UNI) token.But Pepe is not the only 4chan meme to be tokenized and explode in price. Mog Coin (MOG), a memecoin based on the phrase “mogging” — dominating, outclassing or outshining others — gained 1,800% in early 2024. According to CoinGecko, 4chan-themed memecoins command a $37-billion market cap as of May 8.The popular phrase “we’re all gonna make it,” or WAGMI, was also popularized on 4chan. It was borrowed from Australian bodybuilder Aziz “Zyzz” Shavershian, who would frequently post on the Bodybuilding.com forum as well as 4chan’s fitness board and who passed away in 2011. It later made its way into crypto around 2017, seemingly as users who had been active in online fitness communities got into digital assets.Source: Snoop DoggDespite the growing attention platforms like Telegram and X command among the crypto community, 4chan remains a cultural powerhouse, and these are just a handful of the ways it has influenced crypto culture and markets. And with 4chan back online and seemingly fully committed to continuing its operations, they won’t be its final influences — at least as long as 4chan can avoid being taken down for good.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/4chan-rises-from-the-dead-how-the-imageboard-moves-crypto-markets?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-10T11:52:56.000Z,"UK to become ‘safe harbor’ for crypto with new draft rules — experts","On April 29, 2025, UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves unveiled plans for a “comprehensive regulatory regime” aimed at making the country a global leader in digital assets.Under the proposed rules, crypto exchanges, dealers, and agents will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms, with requirements for transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience, the UK Treasury said in a statement released following Reeves’ remarks.Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking.Rather than opting for a light-touch regime similar to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), the UK is applying the full weight of securities regulation to crypto, according to UK-based law firm Wiggin. That includes capital requirements, governance standards, market abuse rules, and disclosure obligations.“The UK’s draft crypto regulations represent a meaningful step toward embracing a rules-based digital asset economy,” Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, told Cointelegraph.“By signaling a willingness to provide regulatory clarity, the UK is positioning itself as a safe harbor for responsible innovation.”Disparte added that the proposed framework can provide the predictability needed to “scale responsible digital financial infrastructure in the UK.”Source: Mica Crypto AllianceRelated: Revolut doubles profits to $1.3B on user growth, crypto trading boomUK’s new crypto rules are “net positive”Vugar Usi Zade, the chief operating officer (COO) at Bitget exchange, also expressed optimism regarding the new regulations, claiming that it “is a net positive” for the industry.“I think a lot of companies recently exited or hesitated to enter the UK because they were not clear about what activities, products, and operations need FCA authorization. Firms finally get clear definitions of “qualifying crypto assets” and know exactly which activities—trading, custody, staking or lending—need FCA authorization.”For exchanges, including Bitget, the UK’s draft rules mean they need full approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer crypto trading, custody, staking, or lending services to UK users.The rules also give companies two years to adjust their systems, like capital and reporting. “Mapping each service line to the new perimeter adds compliance overhead, but that clarity lets us plan product roll‑outs and invest in local infrastructure,” Zade said.The new draft regulations reclassify stablecoins as securities, not as e-money. This means UK-issued fiat-backed tokens must meet prospectus-style disclosures and redemption protocols. Non-UK stablecoins can still circulate, but only via authorized venues.Zade claimed that excluding stablecoins from the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (EMRs), which keeps them out of the e‑money sandbox, could slow their use for payment.However, Disparte, whose firm is the issuer of USDC (USDC), the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, said predictability is key to fostering responsible growth in the UK.“What matters most is predictability: a framework that enables firms to build, test, and grow responsibly—without fear of arbitrary enforcement or shifting goalposts. If realized, this could mark a pivotal moment in the UK’s digital asset journey.”Ripple’s Cassie Craddock praising new UK draft rules. Source: Cassie CraddockRelated: UK regulator moves to restrict borrowing for crypto investmentsUK to require FCA approval for foreign crypto firmsAmong the biggest changes as part of the new draft rules is the territorial reach. Non-UK platforms serving UK retail clients will need the FCA authorization. The “overseas persons” exemption is limited to certain B2B relationships, effectively ring-fencing the UK retail market.Crypto staking enters the perimeter as well. Liquid and delegated staking services must now register, while solo stakers and purely interface-based providers are exempt. New custody rules extend to any setup that gives a party unilateral transfer rights, including certain lending and MPC (multiparty computation) arrangements.“Some DeFi nuances still need fleshing out, but the direction is toward efficient, tailored compliance rather than blanket restriction,” Bitget’s Zade said.He added that the broad “staking” definition might sweep in non‑custodial DeFi models lacking a central provider. “Proposed credit‑card purchase restrictions—though aimed at high‑risk use—could dampen retail participation in token launches,” he said.Furthermore, Zade said bank‑grade segregation rules for client assets could burden lean DeFi projects. “Final rule tweaks will need to mitigate these side effects.”The FCA plans to publish final rules on crypto sometime in 2026, setting the groundwork for the UK regulatory regime to go live. The roadmap to greater regulatory clarity in the UK could follow the European Union, which started to implement its MiCA framework in December.Magazine: Finally blast into space with Justin Sun, Vietnam’s new national blockchain: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-safe-harbor-crypto-draft-regulation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

When a purchase is made, stablecoins are deducted instantly from the user’s wallet.If a transaction is canceled, refunds in USDC or USDT are processed within minutes.RedotPay is also compatible with Apple Pay in Seoul, giving it an edge in a market where Apple Pay is currently limited to Hyundai Card customers. The compatibility could prove crucial as RedotPay challenges Korea’s established payment infrastructure.Crypto adoption has been accelerating in South Korea, where over 16 million people reportedly hold crypto.

He has repeatedly criticized the US dollar, labeling it a “dying” currency inflated by government spending and central bank manipulation.His financial philosophy, rooted in Austrian economics and personal sovereignty, champions assets that cannot be debased or politically controlled.Kiyosaki has long argued that bearer assets like gold, silver, and more recently Bitcoin, are critical hedges against inflation and key to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles.“Don’t work or save fake money,” he advised. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.”In an April 18 post, Kiyosaki forecasted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2035 as the US dollar continues to lose value to inflationary monetary policies.“I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” he said.Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future.In February 2025, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 if demand for the digital asset continues to grow.More recently, on Dec. 10, Eric Trump delivered the keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million due to its scarcity.Magazine: TradFi fans ignored Lyn Alden’s BTC tip — Now she says it’ll hit 7 figures: X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/robert-kiyosaki-bitcoin-gold-silver-fake-money?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: Natalie BrunellSaylor said that many of these trustees do not have a “10-year investors mindset,” and as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price began to rally, they took advantage and “thought this is a good exit point to get liquidity.”“So I think people less committed to the long term have taken the opportunity to exit the market and a whole new class of investors are entering by way of ETFs and by way of Bitcoin treasury companies.”After Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 just hours before US President Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, it experienced a downtrend, falling as low as $76,273 on April 9, before starting to show signs of recovery.On May 8, Bitcoin reclaimed $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 1 after US President Donald Trump proposed tariffs.

2025-05-10T01:40:56.000Z,"Ethereum price greenlit for further upside after surprise 29% ETH rally","Key takeaways:ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: laevitas.chThe ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. ETH's continued underperformance—trailing the altcoin market capitalization by 17% in 2025—helps explain the prevailing lack of investor confidence.Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully.Ethereum maintains leadership in decentralization and TVLIrrespective of Ether’s price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability. More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum’s position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether’s strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million.Ether US-listed spot ETFs' daily net flows, USD million. Source: Farside InvestorsThe muted enthusiasm following Ether’s recent bullish momentum can be partly attributed to the sharp 85% drop in Ethereum network fees from January to April. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol’s burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing.ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. Deribit 30-day ETH options delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.chCurrently, put (sell) options are trading at similar levels to equivalent call (buy) options, indicating a neutral sentiment. This outcome is somewhat discouraging for Ether bulls. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins.Related: Ether clocks ‘insane’ 20% candle post Pectra — A turning point?According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. While Trump’s social media post on March 2 specifically mentioned Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, the subsequent March 6 “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order struck a much more reserved tone.Despite the evident apathy in both the Ether derivatives market and spot ETF flows, a rally toward the $2,700 level remains plausible—especially if investor sentiment shifts in response to the failed lobbying efforts undertaken by some of Ethereum’s competitors.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

During a May 9 Cointelegraph X Space, Pai said a validator’s chances of proposing a block or earning rewards remain tied to how much ETH they hold, adding that larger validators don’t gain any new advantages under the upgrade: “Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it's not the case that if you're a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”Pectra is Ethereum’s most extensive network upgrade since the Merge took place in September 2022. Pectra allows validators to stake as much as 2,048 ETH, up from the previous limit of 32 ETH. The new standard has raised community concerns about the risks of centralization on the network.According to Pai, the Pectra upgrade has taken “a bunch of busy work that the network was doing behind the scenes and removed it.”Pai noted that while there are about a million technical validators on Ethereum, many aren’t truly distinct — large validators often operate numerous virtual keys from a single physical machine. With the Pectra upgrade, those keys can now be consolidated — something he says they are already seeing.“In the best case, we’ll get to about 30,000 validators,” he said, adding that this consolidation reduces auxiliary work and enables network stakeholders to focus on what matters, such as lowering gas limits.Related: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new features — How long before ETH price reacts?New Pectra staking limit paves the way for institutionsThe new limit could pave the way for institutions to stake ETH, according to Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org. “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.”Ether staking within exchange-traded funds has been a hot topic in 2025. BlackRock has said that the successful Ether ETFs are less perfect without staking, and multiple financial institutions have filed for amendments to their Ether ETFs to allow for staking.If approved, investors might be more inclined to buy into the ETFs, as they could receive yield. The SEC has yet to rule on staking amendments. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently forecast in a podcast interview that if staking were to be approved for Ether ETFs, it would have “a little impact” on inflows. “The bigger problem with Ethereum is performance; it just doesn’t ever go on a nice long rally.”Magazine: Pectra hard fork explained — Will it get Ethereum back on track?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-new-staking-limit-not-risk-decentralization-consensys?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-09T19:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price rallies as global liquidity growth accelerates — Analysts","Key takeaways:Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?Liquidity is Bitcoin's silent price driverRaoul Pal, the founder of Global Macro Investor, recently gave a speech on the strong correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 liquidity. In a recap posted by Paul Guerra, Pal’s message refers to: despite looming concerns—recession risks, geopolitical tensions, and other global stressors—rising liquidity as the dominant force behind asset price action. According to Pal, expanding liquidity backs up to 90% of Bitcoin’s price action and as much as 97% of the Nasdaq’s performance. Indeed, a chart comparing global M2 (with a 12-week lead) and Bitcoin’s price shows an almost uncanny alignment.Global M2 and BTC/USD. Source: Real VisionPal also frames the issue in personal finance terms. He says there's an 11% \""hidden tax\"" on all of us, composed of 8% currency debasement and 3% global inflation. He notes,“If you’re not earning more than 11%/yr, you’re getting poorer by definition.”Bitcoin has returned an average of 130% annually since 2012, despite dramatic drawdowns. That makes it one of the most asymmetric bets of the past decade—and it’s outperformed the Nasdaq by over 99%.What drives global liquidity?At its core, global liquidity is fueled by expanding the money supply. As independent investor Lyn Alden puts it,“Fiat currency systems are primarily based on ever-growing debt levels. The money supply continuously grows in every country for this reason.”This offers a high-level view of global liquidity and suggests its long-term expansion is structural. However, this growth isn't linear. Over shorter time frames, it fluctuates based on specific drivers. Michael Howell, author of “Capital Wars,” identifies three main drivers currently impacting global liquidity: the US Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and banks lending through collateral markets.Global liquidity drivers. Source: Michael HowellHowell also points to indirect influences that act with a lag of 6 to 15 months. These include the world business cycle, oil prices, dollar strength, and bond market volatility. A weak global economy and a softening dollar typically boost liquidity. But rising bond volatility tightens collateral supply and chokes lending, undermining liquidity.Related: New bull cycle? Bitcoin's return to $100K hints at ‘significant price move’How long will global liquidity rise?Michael Howell believes that global liquidity moves in roughly five-year cycles, and is now on the way to its local peak. He projects the current cycle to mature by mid-2026, reaching an index level of around 70 (below the post-COVID index of 90). That would mark a turning point, with a subsequent downturn being a likely outcome.Global liquidity cycle. Source: Michael HowellThe recent growth in global liquidity stems from the rapidly weakening world economy, which is likely to prompt further easing by central banks. The People’s Bank of China has already begun injecting liquidity into the system. The Fed now faces a tough choice: continue fighting inflation or pivot to support an increasingly fragile financial system. At its May 7 meeting, rates were held steady, but the pressure on Chair Jerome Powell is mounting, especially from US President Donald Trump.At the same time, economic uncertainty is driving up US Treasury yields and fueling bond market volatility, both indicators of collateral scarcity and tightening credit conditions. Over time, these pressures are likely to become headwinds for liquidity expansion. Meanwhile, a looming recession is expected to weaken investor risk appetite, further draining liquidity from the system.Even if a downturn lies ahead in 2026, global liquidity still has room to run, at least through 2025. And that matters for Bitcoin.Howell notes,“The likely inevitable policy response of ‘more liquidity’ is a great future omen. It establishes the upward path of persistent monetary inflation that ultimately underpins hedges such as gold, quality equities, prime residential real estate, and Bitcoin.”Interestingly, Howell’s liquidity cycle roughly aligns with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle. The former points to a potential peak in late 2025, and the latter in early 2026. If history rhymes again, that convergence could set the stage for a major price move.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential elections. Data from its “Industry Rollup” report highlights Bitcoin’s high Sharpe ratio of 1.72, a key financial metric that measures risk-adjusted returns by dividing an asset’s average return (minus the risk-free rate). A higher Sharpe ratio reflects superior risk-adjusted returns, and in 2025, Bitcoin’s robust score, surpassed only by gold, highlights its growing maturity as an asset.Bitcoin price performance in different environments.

2025-05-09T15:15:00.000Z,"Is Ripple’s Hidden Road deal part of a SoftBank-like playbook?","Ripple has made a slew of acquisitions to control key transaction rails and route them through XRP and its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), drawing comparisons to Japanese investment firm SoftBank. The $1.25-billion acquisition of Hidden Road on April 8 allows Ripple to use RLUSD as collateral in the firm’s prime brokerage products. Hidden Road will also migrate its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) and several of Ripple’s institutional services.Omni Network founder and CEO Austin King knows Ripple’s strategy firsthand. He sold his startup, Strata Labs, to Ripple in 2019 and describes the approach as a “SoftBank-type” acquisition strategy.Instead of in-house development like Google or Meta (formerly Facebook), SoftBank built its empire through aggressive investments, joint ventures and acquisitions. Ripple seems to be following a similar playbook, but not everyone’s convinced the comparison holds.XRP reaches over 300 institutional clients through Ripple’s Hidden Road acquisition. Source: Brad GarlinghouseThe SoftBank model in RippleTwo deals put SoftBank on the global map: an early investor in Yahoo and the legendary $20-million bet on Alibaba, which exploded to $60 billion when Alibaba went public in 2014. SoftBank recycled its returns into fresh capital, exits and a sprawling ecosystem. That included the $20-billion move into US telecom via Sprint and semiconductors through its $31-billion acquisition of UK-based ARM.“This wide breadth of coverage allowed SoftBank to create synergies across their entire portfolio of companies,” King told Cointelegraph. “Ripple is performing a similar strategy focused on financial services, but instead of venture bets on Yahoo and Alibaba enabling this, it is XRP.”Related: Does XRP, SOL or ADA belong in a US crypto reserve?Considering Ripple’s recent acquisitions, both firms buy infrastructure instead of building it from scratch and treat their portfolios as ecosystems rather than one-off investments.Both companies rely on capital as leverage. SoftBank used its $100-billion Vision Fund to outbid competitors. Ripple also has a war chest of XRP and cash. As of March 31, Ripple had 4.56 billion XRP (around $11 billion at current prices) and another 37.13 billion XRP ($89.8 billion) in escrow.Acquisitions expand the footprint for XRP and RLUSD in traditional finance, turning them into embedded components of custody, brokerage and payment flows. This creates what King describes as a token-fueled flywheel. Ripple uses its assets to acquire infrastructure, which in turn drives usage back into those assets.XRP ranks third among non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Source: CoinGecko“With a full-stack infrastructure, Ripple can embed XRP as the native bridge asset between networks, custodians and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, RLUSD can provide a regulated, USD-pegged unit of account that institutions want,” said Sid Powell, co-founder and CEO of institutional blockchain lender Maple.King’s analogy has its skeptics.“SoftBank operates more as a conglomerate or holding company, taking broader investment positions across industries. On the other hand, Ripple is taking a more focused and product-related approach with its recent acquisitions tied to payment missions and core blockchain,” Powell said.Casper Johansen, co-founder of Spartan Group, told Cointelegraph the comparison seems “a bit stretched,” noting that SoftBank’s success came from acquiring and turning around operating businesses, joint ventures, minority stakes and eventually exiting some for large gains.Ripple joins the crypto M&A arms raceInstead of spanning telecom, media and chips, Ripple is assembling a financial infrastructure stack. It acquired custody firms Metaco in 2023 and Standard Custody in 2024. The latest addition, prime broker Hidden Road, brings 300 institutional clients clearing $3 trillion annually.“Where Metaco lays the foundation — the vault for storing assets — Hidden Road allows Ripple to leverage its massive balance sheet to turbocharge Hidden Road’s business, in which access to capital — a lot of capital — is critical in order to keep growing and competing,” Johansen said.The move echoes a broader M&A wave among US crypto firms. Kraken recently acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, while Coinbase has acquired Deribit for $2.9 billion.These acquisitions follow a shift in the US regulatory climate that’s clearing the runway for crypto firms to scale. For years, companies like Ripple were stuck in limbo, facing lawsuits, enforcement actions and denied access to basic banking services under Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission. Related: Ripple celebrates SEC’s dropped appeal, but crypto rules still not setWhile “debanking” remains a concern, industry leaders say momentum is changing. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a recent media interview that the SEC is expected to take a “very constructive and positive” stance toward the industry.Ripple itself spent years in a legal battle with the SEC, which sued the company in December 2020. On May 8, Ripple and the SEC reached a settlement to formally end the case, pending court approval.Ripple’s next moves include stablecoinsGarlinghouse said Ripple intends to continue exploring acquisitions.“I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next year or two we saw the acquisition of a large-scale point-of-sale company to expand their territory from backend financial services to more direct consumer payments,” King said.On April 30, Bloomberg reported that Ripple made a $4 billion-to-$5 billion bid to acquire Circle, which was rejected for being too low.Ripple’s recent moves show it’s willing to pursue high-stakes acquisitions, including plays to absorb stablecoin rivals.All banks will jump on stablecoins soon, and that will reshape US finance, according to King.

2025-05-09T15:00:00.000Z,"AI&#039;s GPU obsession blinds us to a cheaper, smarter solution","Opinion by: Naman Kabra, co-founder and CEO of NodeOps NetworkGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.CPUs aren't outdated. More people need to realize they can be used for AI tasks. They're sitting idle in millions of machines worldwide, capable of running a wide range of AI tasks efficiently and affordably, if only we'd give them a chance.Where CPUs shine in AIIt's easy to see how we got here. GPUs are built for parallelism. They can handle massive amounts of data simultaneously, which is excellent for tasks like image recognition or training a chatbot with billions of parameters. CPUs can't compete in those jobs.AI isn't just model training. It's not just high-speed matrix math. Today, AI includes tasks like running smaller models, interpreting data, managing logic chains, making decisions, fetching documents, and responding to questions. These aren't just \""dumb math\"" problems. They require flexible thinking. They require logic. They require CPUs.While GPUs get all the headlines, CPUs are quietly handling the backbone of many AI workflows, especially when you zoom in on how AI systems actually run in the real world.Recent: ‘Our GPUs are melting’ — OpenAI puts limiter in after Ghibli-tsunamiCPUs are impressive at what they were designed for: flexible, logic-based operations. They're built to handle one or a few tasks at a time, really well. That might not sound impressive next to the massive parallelism of GPUs, but many AI tasks don't need that kind of firepower.Consider autonomous agents, those fancy tools that can use AI to complete tasks like searching the web, writing code, or planning a project. Sure, the agent might call a large language model that runs on a GPU, but everything around that, the logic, the planning, the decision-making, runs just fine on a CPU.Even inference (AI-speak for actually using the model after its training) can be done on CPUs, especially if the models are smaller, optimized, or running in situations where ultra-low latency isn't necessary.CPUs can handle a huge range of AI tasks just fine. We're so focused on GPU performance, however, that we're not using what we already have right in front of us.We don't need to keep building expensive new data centers packed with GPUs to meet the growing demand for AI. We just need to use what's already out there efficiently.That's where things get interesting. Because now we have a way to actually do that.How decentralized compute networks change the gameDePINs, or decentralized physical infrastructure networks, are a viable solution. It's a mouthful, but the idea is simple: People contribute their unused computing power (like idle CPUs), which gets pooled into a global network that others can tap into.Instead of renting time on some centralized cloud provider's GPU cluster, you could run AI workloads across a decentralized network of CPUs anywhere in the world. These platforms create a type of peer-to-peer computing layer where jobs can be distributed, executed, and verified securely.This model has a few clear benefits. First, it's much cheaper. You don't need to pay premium prices to rent out a scarce GPU when a CPU will do the job just fine. Second, it scales naturally.The available compute grows as more people plug their machines into the network. Third, it brings computing closer to the edge. Tasks can be run on machines near where the data lives, reducing latency and increasing privacy.Think of it like Airbnb for compute. Instead of building more hotels (data centers), we're making better use of all the empty rooms (idle CPUs) people already have.Through shifting our thinking and using decentralized networks to route AI workloads to the correct processor type, GPU when needed and CPU when possible, we unlock scale, efficiency, and resilience.The bottom lineIt's time to stop treating CPUs like second-class citizens in the AI world. Yes, GPUs are critical. No one's denying that. CPUs are everywhere. They're underused but still perfectly capable of powering many of the AI tasks we care about.Instead of throwing more money at the GPU shortage, let's ask a more intelligent question: Are we even using the computing we already have?With decentralized compute platforms stepping up to connect idle CPUs to the AI economy, we have a massive opportunity to rethink how we scale AI infrastructure. The real constraint isn't just GPU availability. It's a mindset shift. We're so conditioned to chase high-end hardware that we overlook the untapped potential sitting idle across the network.Opinion by: Naman Kabra, co-founder and CEO of NodeOps Network.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Siu believes this type of infrastructure investment goes further than symbolic funding.“What our industry needs a lot more is these kinds of positive-sum use cases that everyone else understands,” Siu said in the interview. “If students can receive better, cheaper and more effective opportunities and interest rates through crypto student loans, what happens? They’re going to be more pro-crypto.”Related: The Giving Block starts disaster fund for California wildfire victimsUnlike a one-time donation, the Pencil Finance model integrates crypto directly into the financing mechanism—leveraging blockchain rails to make lending more transparent, efficient, and accessible.“While money has influence, it doesn’t necessarily change the system for the better per se. The technology… actually provides a way we can onboard people into that.”Crypto in the classroomSiu said the crypto industry still suffers from a perception problem, especially among those unfamiliar with financial tools or blockchain-native culture. That’s why educational use cases need to move beyond highbrow NFT art or meme coins and offer something universally relatable.“When you’re sitting at the table and someone’s saying, ‘What is crypto really good for?’—what do we say?” he asked. “Memecoins? Or do we say student loans? That’s something everyone understands.”Siu also emphasized the long-term impact of onboarding students early—both for growing crypto literacy and building a foundation for adoption. “You want to onboard them at the earliest levels and let them understand what’s going on,” he said. “That’s what Apple did with education discounts. It wasn’t about profit at first—it was about future influence.”Ripple’s donation may be a step forward for awareness and much-needed funding support in the education sector, but Animoca’s approach aims to make crypto indispensable, not just visible, in education systems around the world.“We have to show what [crypto] is good for.

2025-05-09T12:45:00.000Z,"TapSwap on Telegram: Is it legit or a scam?","What is TapSwap on Telegram?              TapSwap is a tap-to-earn Web3 application that lives inside Telegram — no separate download required.Are your crypto friends obsessed with tapping their phones all the time? Welcome to the world of TapSwap. TapSwap is a tap-to-earn game released in mid-2024 in the Telegram Mini Apps ecosystem. The game quickly catches your attention: one minute you’re just curious… the next, you’re tapping away at 2 am trying to squeeze out one more energy boost. At its core, TapSwap is simple:You tap your screen.You earn TAPS tokens.Repeat.It’s built as a Mini App inside Telegram, which means no downloading or setting up complicated wallets just to play. Just hit “Start” and you’re in. Launched in early 2024, it quickly amassed over 72 million users, with 3 million daily active participants as of February 2025, as per the official website. As of late April 2025, the platform has a strong presence on social media, with 6 million followers on X and 5 million on Telegram. Built on The Open Network (TON), TapSwap rose to popularity due to its simple tapping mechanics, which, combined with word-of-mouth and social media sharing, allowed it to grow fast among Telegram’s massive user base.While TapSwap currently operates primarily through its tap-to-earn mechanics on Telegram, the platform has ambitious plans to expand into a full-fledged gaming ecosystem. Per TapSwap, new games like Treasure Hunt and Warrior’s Legacy are expected to launch soon.In addition to expanding its gaming catalog, TapSwap is also focusing on attracting third-party developers. It has introduced an SDK and various tools to help game creators easily integrate their games into TapSwap’s ecosystem. This will allow developers to reach TapSwap’s massive Telegram user base and unlock new monetization opportunities.TapSwap’s shift toward becoming a developer-friendly, multi-game platform hints at a larger ambition: transforming from a simple tap-to-earn project into a Web3 gaming hub.In this article, you’ll find out exactly how TapSwap works, how to play smarter and tap faster, whether it’s legit, and what’s next for this viral sensation.Did you know? By June 2024, TapSwap had surpassed 59.7 million users, establishing itself as the second-largest player in the tap-to-earn industry, just behind Hamster Kombat.                  How to play TapSwap on Telegram              Playing TapSwap is simple, and it’s designed for mass adoption, especially among users new to crypto.Here’s how it works:Open Telegram: You must have a Telegram account. TapSwap operates as a Mini App within Telegram.Find the TapSwap bot: Search for “TapSwap bot” in Telegram or access it through an invite link from another user.Start the game: Tap “Start” to launch the TapSwap Mini App. Grant basic permissions to connect.Tap to earn energy: The core gameplay involves tapping your screen repeatedly to generate “Energy” or points. The more you tap, the more points you accumulate.Upgrade and boost: Use earned Energy to upgrade your in-game equipment (like tap strength or auto-tapper speed). Upgrades allow you to generate Energy faster without manual tapping.Complete tasks: Daily missions, social media tasks and inviting friends can earn additional bonuses and multipliers.Climb the leaderboard: Players can compete for higher rankings, which could influence future token rewards and airdrop eligibility. Did you know? By mid-2024, TapSwap players had collectively executed over 2.7 trillion taps within the game, showcasing the platform’s immense engagement.                  How to maximize your TapSwap rewards              If you want to make the most out of your TapSwap journey, here are some key strategies to boost your Energy production, leaderboard ranking and eventual TAPS token rewards. Daily codes: TapSwap releases daily codes that give free Energy or multipliers. Find them in the TapSwap app and redeem daily to stay ahead.Watch videos: Take advantage of the “Watch Video” feature to earn bonus Energy. Most of the videos are educational or promotional in nature. Upgrades: Use your earned Energy wisely to upgrade key attributes like Tap Strength and Auto-Tapper speed. Higher upgrades mean you earn more Energy even while idle, making your gameplay more efficient.Complete daily tasks and missions: Daily missions offer bonus rewards, XP boosts and sometimes even special upgrade opportunities.Invite friends: TapSwap has a referral system where you can earn extra bonuses.Participate in events: TapSwap occasionally hosts time-limited events, challenges or contests with exclusive prizes. Keep an eye on announcements to join early and maximize benefits.                  Common mistakes new TapSwap players make              While TapSwap is easy to start, many new users make avoidable mistakes that could cost them.Using fake bots: TapSwap’s popularity has led to the rise of fake Telegram bots pretending to be official. Always double-check the bot’s username and verify through TapSwap’s official channels.Expecting immediate payouts: Energy points earned in-game are not instantly withdrawable. These are convertible to tokens, and TAPS can be staked to earn in the ecosystem. Falling for withdrawal scams on Telegram: If a bot or user asks for upfront payment or private keys for “faster withdrawal,” it’s a scam. TapSwap has stated that no fees are required to claim tokens.Ignoring game updates: TapSwap frequently announces changes (such as tokenomics or blockchain updates). Players who ignore updates may miss important steps like Know Your Customer (KYC) verification or instructions for claiming their airdrop or rewards.                  Is TapSwap legit or just a hype train?              When evaluating whether TapSwap is legit or not, it’s important to weigh the positives and the concerns carefully. Let’s get to the big question: Is TapSwap legit?Favorable factors include:Massive user base: TapSwap has attracted over 72 million users worldwide, including 3 million daily active players, a sign of strong organic growth.Official token audit: TapSwap partnered with security firm Hashlock to conduct an audit of its smart contract in 2024. Minor issues (low-severity issues, minor inconsistencies in event parameter ordering, the use of default return values, etc.) were identified. Importantly, no critical vulnerabilities were found, and the minor concerns were corrected following the audit.KYC compliance: TapSwap requires users to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for airdrop claims and larger transactions, aligning with global regulatory practices.Active communication: TapSwap maintains verified channels on Telegram and X, regularly posting updates, fixes and clarifications to user concerns.Roadmap and white paper: TapSwap has published a detailed roadmap and white paper outlining the project’s goals, tokenomics and future plans, indicating a serious long-term vision.Some reasons for concern:Anonymous founding team: TapSwap’s core team remains undisclosed to the public, which raises questions about accountability and transparency.Telegram bot issues: Users have frequently reported bugs, downtime and access issues with the TapSwap bot, especially during high-traffic periods.Scam impersonators: The popularity of TapSwap has led to a surge of fake Telegram bots and phishing scams pretending to be official TapSwap channels.Withdrawal delays: Token withdrawals and airdrop claims have faced multiple delays, with users sometimes waiting months for updates and timelines to be clarified.                  What’s next for TapSwap?              As the platform matures and cements its place, the team behind it has hinted at a much bigger vision. Here’s what’s reportedly on the roadmap:Transition to skill-based gaming: TapSwap is evolving into a skill-based gaming platform, moving beyond simple tapping mechanics. This shift aims to introduce competitive gameplay where players can participate in tournaments and earn rewards based on their performance, fostering a more engaging and merit-based environment. TON, the official blockchain of TapSwap, has hinted at fight-to-earn models in upcoming skills. TAPS token listing and trading: The TAPS token was officially launched on Feb. 14, 2025, with trading commencing on exchanges like Bitget under the trading pair TAPS/USDT. There is a growing push for more listings across social media, and these will enhance liquidity, enabling users to trade their earned tokens. Introduction of staking mechanisms: TapSwap plans to implement staking features, allowing users to lock their TAPS tokens in exchange for rewards. This initiative aims to incentivize long-term holding and contribute to the platform’s stability, while users earn passive income. Enhanced user interface and features: To improve the user experience, TapSwap is working on integrating new features such as comprehensive leaderboards, integrated wallets for seamless transactions and social features that allow players to showcase their achievements and progress.Community engagement and governance: TapSwap is focusing on strengthening its community by encouraging user feedback and participation in decision-making processes. Holders of TAPS tokens may gain governance rights, allowing them to vote on future developments and upgrades within the platform. ​Developer engagement: For developers who want to build their games inside TapSwap, there will be a full developer kit to create games that plug directly into TapSwap’s Mini App structure. Builders may benefit from the instant access to TapSwap’s massive Telegram audience, solving for adoption hurdles that Web3 game developers often face.

Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  “Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation,“ Scott said.The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: ReportScott criticizes last-minute oppositionScott, a South Carolina Republican, said that “the GENIUS Act was a bipartisan achievement at the Banking Committee.” By working on it, he claimed those involved “made the decision to make America's economy safer and cheaper for the American people.” Still, in his view, Democrats changed their minds when the “light and cameras were watching.”Scott alleged that the shift was driven not by changes in the bill, but by efforts to deny President Donald Trump a legislative win:“It was a vote against President Trump and President Trump’s legislative agenda. It was a vote to stop President Trump from having a victory in the digital asset space.“Related: Democrat lawmakers object to hearing, citing ‘Trump’s crypto corruption’Democrats cite corruption concernsMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading voice on crypto regulation, raised concerns that the Trump family-linked stablecoin, USD1, surged in market value due to a “shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates.”“The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption,“ she said.On May 1, Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX used the Trump-linked stablecoin USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.

Four of the five pro-crypto Democrats who passed the GENIUS Act in the Senate Banking Committee signed their names to a statement on May 3, saying that they do not feel comfortable with the direction stablecoin legislation is taking. While the letter did not mention Trump directly, Representative Maxine Waters was more explicit in her opposition.“If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” Waters said.Democrats propose stricter crypto lawsDemocrats also recently sponsored the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, to prevent federal officials from profiting from memecoins. US Senator Jeff Merkley and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also introduced the End Crypto Corruption Act earlier this week.The End Crypto Corruption Act would ban the president, vice president, senior executive branch officials, members of Congress, and their immediate families from financially benefiting from issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets, such as memecoins and stablecoins.In a statement published on Merkley’s website, he said that “people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls.”“This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let’s end this corruption immediately,” Merkley added.In a statement to CBS News, Warren echoed that sentiment, saying that both Democrats in favor and opposed to the GENIUS Act “agree that green-lighting Donald Trump’s corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong.”“The GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump’s crypto corruption,” Warren claimed.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senator-tim-scott-blames-politics-for-failed-stablecoin-bill?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Ko Ju-Chun, a legislator at-large in Taiwan’s legislative body, the Legislative Yuan, took to X on Friday to report that he advocated for Bitcoin (BTC) investment by the Taiwanese government at the National Conference on May 9.In his remarks, Ko cited Bitcoin’s potential to become a hedge amid global economic risks, urging Taiwan to recognize the cryptocurrency alongside gold and foreign exchange reserves to boost financial resilience.Source: Ko Ju-ChunKo’s announcement came shortly after the legislator held talks with Samson Mow, who advocates for Bitcoin adoption by states like El Salvador at his BTC tech firm Jan3.Taiwan is an export-oriented economyKo highlighted that Taiwan is an export-driven economy that has experienced significant fluctuations in its national currency, the New Taiwan dollar, amid global inflation and intensifying geopolitical risks.“We currently have a gold reserve of 423 metric tons, and our foreign exchange reserves amount to $577 billion, including investments in US Treasury bonds,” the lawmaker stated.In a scenario of more intense currency volatility or potential regional conflicts, Taiwan may “very likely be unable to ensure the security and liquidity,” Ko continued, adding that Bitcoin could be a great new addition to Taiwan’s reserves due to a number of reasons.Ko Ju-Chun advocated for the adoption of Bitcoin by the Taiwanese government before the Legislative Yuan. Source: Ko Ju-Chun“Bitcoin has been operating for over 15 years. It has a fixed total supply, is decentralized, and is resistant to censorship. Many countries are focusing on its hedging attributes. At the same time, in intense situations, it may not face the risk of embargo,” he stated.Bitcoin is not the only solutionReferring to many global initiatives considering Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset, Ko stressed that he’s not advocating for Bitcoin as the “only solution” to rising economic challenges.Instead, the legislator suggested adding a “small proportion of Bitcoin” into the diversified assets as tools for sovereign asset allocation and risk hedging, and backup capacity of Taiwan’s financial system.Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: ReportHe previously suggested that Taiwan could allocate a maximum of 5% of its $50 billion reserve to Bitcoin in an X post on May 6.Source: Ko Ju-Chun“When exchange rate risk and regional uncertainty increase, it is time to introduce new tools to construct a more flexible financial strategy framework,” Ko said, adding:“As former Dean Chen Chong said, Bitcoin is the gun of the digital era.

The move marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA’s history.The authorities also seized eXch’s German server infrastructure with over eight terabytes of data and shut down the platform, the announcement added.eXch exchanged crypto without AMLIn the statement, the BKA described eXch as a “swapping” service that allowed users to exchange various crypto assets without implementing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures.The platform had operated since 2014 and reportedly facilitated about $1.9 billion in crypto transfers, some of which were believed to be of “criminal origin,” including assets laundered during the Bybit hack.Example of flow of Bybit exploit funds moving through eXch and bridging back and forth between Ether and Bitcoin.

2025-05-09T08:10:00.000Z,"Is Pi Network dead? What really went wrong behind the hype","What Pi Network promised              When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.Did you know? Pi Network utilizes the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which aims for energy efficiency and decentralization, differing from Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work.                  What the Pi Network delivered              The roadmap was supposed to be gradual: start with mobile mining, then move toward a testnet, KYC rollout and, finally, full mainnet launch with real trading and utility. But that last step took a lot longer than anyone expected.After years in limbo, the Pi Network finally opened its mainnet to external trading in February 2025. That should’ve been a big win. But it didn’t go smoothly. For one, not all users were able to migrate their balances. Know Your Customer (KYC) verification became a bottleneck, and many were left wondering when — or if — they’d ever be able to access the tokens they’d mined for years.Then there was the price. When Pi first started trading on external platforms, the price spiked, hitting as high as $2.98 in late February. But the hype didn’t last. As early adopters started selling off their tokens and real-world use cases remained thin, the price slid hard. By early May 2025, it had dropped to around $0.58, wiping out more than 70% of its value.There’s also still no real utility. You can’t spend Pi on much (only in small, community-run markets and pilot programs). And while the team talks about building a full ecosystem of apps and services, it’s unclear how fast — or how seriously — that’s progressing.                  Why the crypto community grew skeptical              As the months turned into years, more and more red flags started popping up, and the community started asking hard questions.1. Still waiting on the mainnetPi launched in 2019, and for years, users kept hearing that the open mainnet was “just around the corner.” First there was the testnet. Then the “enclosed mainnet.” Then a roadmap update. The actual open network didn’t arrive until early 2025 — six years later. And by that time, a lot of early believers had started losing faith.2. All roads lead back to the core teamDespite the talk of decentralization, the reality is that the Pi Core Team has retained almost total control over the project. Every active mainnet node? Controlled by them. Most of the token supply? Still in their hands. That doesn’t sit well with crypto users who believe in distributed power and community-driven networks. Right now, Pi feels more like a private company than a decentralized protocol.3. Where’s the transparency?Another sticking point has been the lack of detail on how Pi actually works under the hood. The white paper is vague. There’s no clear breakdown of tokenomics, no timelines on when tokens unlock, no burn mechanics and no insight into supply control. Without that info, it’s hard for anyone to judge the health or future value of the project.4. Exchange listingsDespite years of hype, Pi still isn’t listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. It is tradable on some platforms like OKX and Bitget, but even there, things are shaky. Some users have reported trouble withdrawing their tokens, with exchanges blaming “traffic spikes” and other vague technical reasons. It all feels a bit fragile.For instance, one user on Bitget reported depositing 1,500 Pi tokens but found them inaccessible, with no clear timeline for resolution. On OKX, withdrawals were suspended for over 24 hours, with users asked to provide ID and email verification but given vague responses like “Your request will be completed within 24-48 hours.”By April 2025, users reported that MEXC, another exchange listing Pi, suspended Pi withdrawals, sparking concerns about liquidity and platform reliability. This was compounded by reports of large Pi transfers from MEXC, Gate.io and Bitget to OKX wallets, raising suspicions of coordinated price manipulation or exchange-level issues.5. Fake volume and fading hypeAt its peak in February 2025, Pi was trading at nearly $3 and generating billions in volume. Fast forward a few months, and that volume has dropped off a cliff — down to around $40 million. That kind of collapse raises serious questions: Was the demand real, or was it inflated by speculation, bots or internal market-making?6. Users trapped in a closed loopEven now, many users can’t actually use or withdraw their Pi tokens. Without access to real exchanges or spending options, they’re stuck in a kind of token limbo, watching a number go up in an app but with no way to convert that into anything useful.Did you know? While Pi Network claims over 70 million users, blockchain data indicates that only about 9.11 million wallets exist, with approximately 20,000 showing daily activity.                  Is Pi Network a scam or just a failed vision?              Not every crypto project that stumbles is a scam. Some are just ambitious ideas that don’t quite pan out. So, where does Pi Network fall?On the surface, Pi doesn’t fit the classic scam mold. There was no initial coin offering (ICO), no upfront investment required — just an app that lets you “mine” Pi by tapping your phone daily. That’s a low bar for entry, and it attracted millions.But dig a little deeper, and things get murkier. The whole system leans heavily on referrals, encouraging users to bring in more people to boost their mining rate. That kind of structure starts to resemble a multi-level marketing scheme more than a decentralized crypto project.Then there’s the monetization angle. The app is filled with ads, and users are required to complete KYC verification, handing over personal data. So, while you’re not paying money, you’re paying with your attention and information.Given these developments, critics such as Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, and Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, have publicly expressed skepticism regarding Pi Network’s legitimacy.Pi Network might not be a blatant fraud, but the combination of opaque operations, aggressive referral tactics and questionable monetization strategies certainly raises eyebrows.Did you know? Pi Network was officially launched on March 14, 2019 — Pi Day — symbolizing the mathematical constant π (3.14).                  Can Pi recover, or is it over?              Is there a path forward for Pi Network? Possibly, but it’s a steep climb.First, transparency is key. Open-sourcing the code would allow the community to verify what’s under the hood and build trust.Second, Pi needs real utility. Right now, holding Pi doesn’t offer much beyond the hope of future value. Integrating Pi into actual use cases — like payments or decentralized applications — would give the token purpose.Third, broader exchange listings are crucial. Currently, Pi is available on a limited number of exchanges, which hampers liquidity and price discovery. Major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have yet to list Pi, citing concerns over transparency and regulatory compliance.Fourth, decentralization must be more than a buzzword. Currently, the Pi Core Team maintains significant control over the network, which contradicts the principles of decentralization. Implementing decentralized governance would distribute decision-making power and align with the ethos of blockchain technology.But even if all these boxes are checked, time is a factor. Since its mainnet launch in early 2025, Pi’s price has dropped significantly, and user engagement has waned. Rebuilding momentum is challenging.Without significant changes, the Pi Network risks fading into obscurity, remembered more for its unfulfilled promises than its achievements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-pi-network-dead-what-really-went-wrong-behind-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: Dune AnalyticsAnother factor is Solana’s tokenomics, which Sygnum said was “a comparable issue” to the criticism levelled at Ethereum over its mainnet’s stagnant transaction volumes due to it lowering the cost for its layer 2 networks.The company said Solana is leading Ethereum in market share for layer-1 fee generation, but “most of the fees are paid to validators and do not grow the value of the Solana token.”“In fact, when it comes to revenues, Ethereum still exceeds Solana 2- 2.5x,” Sygnum said.It argued that Solana’s tokenomics are “easier to modify” than Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Still, it said that Solana “does not appear inclined to drive more value to the token,” as its community shot down a proposal to cut the SOL’s inflation rate in March.Solana could gain with stable revenue focusSygnum noted that Solana, which some have hailed as an “Ethereum killer” that could challenge the network’s market share, could make some gains on the No. 2 blockchain.The company said Ethereum has the dominant market share in “use cases that are showing traction” with support from governments, regulators, and traditional finance — such as tokenization, stablecoins, and decentralized finance.However, it added that Solana had made progress in the amount of value locked on its decentralized finance protocols, and if it gains in “more stable revenue sources” such as tokenization and stablecoins, it could gain on Ethereum.Sygnum added that Solana still has a strong backing, even with the Ethereum Foundation reshuffling its priorities to the layer 1 and recognising “the need to adjust its go-to-market strategy.”However, that could give a sentiment tailwind to Ethereum as the blockchain’s “2-year-long underperformance vs Solana has been temporarily arrested” since the foundation’s pivot.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-no-convincing-signs-besting-ethereum-memecoin-bias?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-09T06:01:07.000Z,"Ether clocks ‘insane’ 20% candle post Pectra — a turning point?","Ether surged 20% in the past 24 hours following the launch of the Pectra upgrade, with some crypto traders suggesting the growing number of ETH long positions could mark a “turning point” for the asset that has faced uncertain sentiment throughout most of 2025.At the time of publication, Ether (ETH) is trading at $2,230, up 19.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%. Ether price pump caught traders offsideThe surge followed the long-awaited Pectra Upgrade, which went live on May 7, introducing new wallet features, increased staking limits and scalability improvements to Ethereum. Popular crypto trader Alex Kruger said on May 8 that Ether’s price spike was primarily due to “new longs.”If Ether were to fall back to $2,000, approximately $2.06 billion in long positions would be at risk of liquidation, according to CoinGlass data. The price surge caught many traders offside, with approximately $328 million in Ether short positions liquidated over the same period.Crypto trader Bob Loukas said, “ETH holders thinking this might finally be the turning point.” 2025 has not been a strong year for Ether’s price, which fell 56% from its Jan. 1 price to $1,472 by April 9 — its lowest point this year — as sentiment weakened throughout the year.Ether is up 52% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCapEther’s recent rally coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) gaining 3.59% over the same period and nearly 6% over the past seven days, reclaiming the $100,000 mark on May 8 for the first time in over three months. In comments to Cointelegraph, onchain options protocol Derive founder Nick Forster said Ether’s recent price surge was due to a combination of factors, beyond just the Pectra hard fork. Forster pointed out the US trade deal with the UK, where US President Donald Trump “slashed tariffs on British cars and steel.” He also pointed to the crypto exchange Coinbase, which announced the acquisition of Deribit for $2.9 billion.Related: Ethereum price finally ‘breaking out,’ data suggests — Is $3K ETH next?Since 2013, Ether has averaged a 62.2% return in the second quarter.

2025-05-09T05:27:46.000Z,"AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadar","AI decentralized apps (DApps) have seen a spike in user activity and could soon challenge gaming and DeFi for the top spot in the DApp ecosystem, according to blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Gaming and DeFi are both sitting on 21% dominance in April, judged by percentage of unique active wallets, while AI has climbed to 16%, up from the 11% recorded in the February report, data in DappRadar’s April industry report shows.“As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. “If this trend continues, AI could soon challenge the traditional dominance of DeFi and Gaming, signaling a new era in the DApp landscape.”AI DApps have seen a jump in market dominance this month, while market leaders have declined slightly. Source: DappRadarAt the same time, AI DApp activity surged over 26% to reach 3.8 million daily unique active wallets (dUAW), up from the 2.6 million dUAW recorded in February.In contrast, DeFi activity dropped by 16%, settling at 4.8 million dUAW, which is equal to the gaming sector, which saw a 10% decline as well.Source: DappRadarGherghelas said most of the top AI DApps being tracked by DappRadar have remained the same, with many tied to AI agent infrastructure and those building utility.LOL, a project that styles itself as an AI-powered mining system, is the top AI DApp on DappRadar’s list in dUAW. LOL encourages users to send a voice recording of laughter to Telegram groups that use the LOL AI bot, which then uses factors like pitch and frequency to calculate the number of LOL tokens paid out in rewards.  Coming in second is AI-powered decentralized messaging service Dmail Network. Rounding out the top three is World.‎‎‎Fun, a launchpad that allows users to deploy AI agents into massive multi-agent simulations.“This month, the top AI DApps on our platform remain largely unchanged, reinforcing the staying power of early leaders in this space. These projects are not just riding the hype: they’re building utility,” she added.Last December, crypto industry execs told Cointelegraph they expected AI agents to transform Web3 in 2025, flagging crypto staking and onchain trading as emerging early use cases. However, there was also speculation that AI would face headwinds, including technical challenges, regulatory hurdles, and centralization. Social DApps rise as Web3 holds groundSocial DApps also saw a spike in activity for April, with an 18% increase to 3.6 million dUAW. Social DApp market dominance also grew to over 15% for the month.Related: Crypto users cool with AI dabbling with their portfolios: SurveyGherghelas said overall that “Web3 is holding its ground,” despite wider market turbulence in the wake of sweeping US tariffs, with 23 million daily active wallets recorded in April, compared to the 24 million recorded in February.“April’s top performers underscore a key narrative: utility and narrative-driven hype, especially around memecoins and AI, are major drivers of user engagement,” Gherghelas said. Magazine: UK’s Orwellian AI murder prediction system, will AI take your job?

2025-05-09T05:13:46.000Z,"Apple makes progress toward its first pair of smart glasses: Report","Apple is reportedly working on its own microchips across multiple product categories, including smart glasses and artificial intelligence — a hint at what’s next for the massive Silicon Valley-based tech giant. A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers.The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said. Apple’s smart glasses will initially be non-augmented reality versions that will include cameras, microphones and integrated AI, much like rival offerings from Meta. They would presumably have similar functions like snapping photos, recording video and offering translation options, the report added. The product may also integrate a visual intelligence feature for scanning the environment and describing objects, looking up information about products and providing directions.Mass production targeted for late 2026 or 2027, suggesting a product launch within approximately two years, they added.  Apple is targeting rival Meta’s smart Ray-Bans.

Apple has targeted completion by 2027 to make its AI services faster and more competitive. In late April, it was reported that Chinese tech giant Huawei has developed a powerful AI chip that could rival high-end processors from US chip maker Nvidia.Magazine: Bitcoin to $1M ‘by 2029,’ CIA tips its hat to Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/apple-makes-progress-first-smart-glasses-bloomberg?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-09T04:56:52.000Z,"Zerebro dev is reportedly alive and at parents’ house: SF Standard","The 22-year-old developer of Zerebro, who apparently committed suicide during a livestream on May 4, is actually alive, according to a San Francisco news outlet that claims they spoke to Yu outside his family home. The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.Jeffy Yu speaking about the future of crypto AI agents in a January 2025 podcast on Bankless. Source: BanklessThe SFS didn’t share an image of Yu outside his family’s house. Many initially believed that Yu’s suicide was legitimate after reports of the incident emerged on May 4. But several pieces of information that began circulating on X two days later led some to conclude his suicide attempt was faked. One piece of evidence was an unverified letter purportedly sent by Yu to an investor confirming that he hadn’t died; another included transfers from several crypto wallets owned by Yu after the alleged incident and the removal of his obituary from the memorial site Legacy.com.Wallets tied to Yu have moved $1.5M since the suicide incidentAccording to blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps, wallets tied to Yu have offloaded around $1.5 million worth of the Zerebro (ZEREBRO) tokens since the suicide incident, strengthening the SFS’ report that Yu is still alive.Some of those funds have been transferred to the same wallet address Yu used to create the so-called “Legacy Memecoin” — Legacoin (LLJEFFY) — Bubblemaps noted.Related: Doodles NFT sales surge 97% ahead of DOOD token airdropYu’s AI-powered, content-focused Zerebro platform burst onto the scene in late 2024, with the ZEREBRO token soaring to a near $660 million market cap on Jan. 3 before tanking below $20 million around three months later, CoinGecko data shows.ZEREBRO currently boasts a $47.2 million valuation, while several LLJEFFY tokens have notched multimillion-dollar valuations across different blockchain networks.Yu’s PTSD claims reflect a concerning industry trend of harassment, violenceThe PTSD comment that Yu made to the SFS reporter appears to be related to the constant harassment, blackmail and threats that he talked about in his apparent letter sent to the Zerebro investor.He claimed that with his house address publicly known, he’s been in constant fear of robbery and physical harm — an unfortunate trend that has escalated in the crypto space in recent months.There have been more than 150 crypto-related physical attacks since 2014, according to a GitHub list tracked by Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp. Forty-six of those reported incidents have occurred over the last 12 months alone. Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths:",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/zerebro-dev-jeffy-yu-reported-alive-after-being-spotted-parents-house?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
