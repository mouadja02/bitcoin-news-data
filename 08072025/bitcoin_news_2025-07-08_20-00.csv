2025-07-08T17:57:28,"Will Elon Musk‚Äôs America Party facilitate green Bitcoin?","On July 7, 2025, on X, Elon Musk claimed that his recently announced political party will embrace Bitcoin, stating that ‚Äúfiat is hopeless.‚Äù In the past, Musk had conflicting relations with Bitcoin. In 2021, his company, Tesla, halted support of Bitcoin payments, citing Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental impact. What is Musk‚Äôs current political platform, and what‚Äôs his stance on Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental impact? The America Party After a very public disagreement with U.S. President Donald Trump over government spending, Elon Musk took to X on July 4 to state that Independence Day is the perfect time to ask people if they want independence from a two-party system and attached the poll: ‚ÄúShould we create the America Party?‚Äù There were only two options, yes and no. In 24 hours, over 1.2 million votes were cast, with ‚Äúyes‚Äù beating ‚Äúno‚Äù at a 2:1 ratio. Then, Musk claimed that the focus on several seats in the Senate and several House districts would be enough to have political influence. Several hours later, he declared that the party was formed ‚Äúto give you back your freedom.‚Äù By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom. https://t.co/9K8AD04QQN ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025 Many Republicans expressed displeasure, noting that ‚Äúthe third party‚Äù would only split the Republican vote and let Democrats win instead of fixing the country. Some suggested that the third party already exists, and it‚Äôs called MAGA. Others offered Musk to join the Libertarian Party instead, as it already has some achievements and it‚Äôs better not to begin from scratch. I am staying as a Republican. We are 74,606 *active* voters away from flipping Pennsylvania üü¶üîúüü•. If you do NOT like Governor Shapiro or that democrats shut down Pennsylvania during COVID, a third party will only help re-elect Shapiro in 2026. ‚Äî ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) July 5, 2025 On July 5, 2025, Musk launched another poll, asking if we need a party that represents the 80% in the middle. 80% of voters chose the ‚Äúyes‚Äù answer. Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle? ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 While Musk is yet to release the party‚Äôs platform, he replied ‚Äúyeah‚Äù to several points offered by tech investor Tyler Palmer. In his view, the America Party should reduce debt and fight for responsible spending, modernize the military with AI robotics, boost technologies and AI, reduce regulation (especially in the energy sector), and be pronatalist and pro-free speech. As Musk greeted this post, it was copied many times by other accounts, publishing it as the America Party platform. Is this the America Party platform? -reduce debt, responsible spending only -modernize military with ai/robotics -pro tech, accelerate to win in ai -less regulation across board but especially in energy -free speech -pro natalist -centrist policies everywhere else If so‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Tyler Palmer (@tyler__palmer) July 5, 2025 On July 7, 2025, an X user, Renato Lima, asked Musk if the America Party is going to embrace Bitcoin. Musk replied , ‚ÄúFiat is hopeless, so yes.‚Äù Someone has already created a ‚Äúnot affiliated‚Äù account of the America Party on X. In several days, it got over 300,000 subscribers, including notable Bitcoin influencers. The account posts Musk‚Äôs statements and silently promotes a memecoin via a link in the bio. Musk‚Äôs environmental concerns and Bitcoin A huge part of Musk‚Äôs success is intertwined with his push for eco-friendly technology. It has been impacting his businesses, his political activity, and his relationships with cryptocurrencies. Musk‚Äôs dedication and leadership in producing electric vehicles are based on his concern about climate change and CO2 emissions. Prioritizing solar power over fossil fuels is another element of Musk‚Äôs strive to rebuild the industries so that emissions will be reduced. Notably, after Trump‚Äôs victory in the 2024 election, Musk backed Trump‚Äôs crackdown on electric vehicles. He supported Trump‚Äôs aim to take away subsidies for those buying electric cars. According to Musk, it would hurt General Motors and Ford before Tesla. Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla. Also, remove subsidies from all industries! ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 16, 2024 As Tesla‚Äôs sales tanked this year, Musk criticized taking away subsidies on eco-friendly vehicles. While some claim that Musk was advocating for the subsidies‚Äô removal in the past, he rather wanted to lift them from other oil/fossil-based industries too, so generally Musk never stepped away from his ecology focus. However, Musk‚Äôs recent ‚Äúyeah‚Äù reply to the platform containing the ‚Äúless regulation in energy‚Äù clause may look like a step back in terms of striving for the war on CO2 emissions. There is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar https://t.co/kJFMfLOGV0 ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 29, 2025 In 2021, Musk made waves in the crypto market by publishing tweets about Dogecoin and Bitcoin. At some point, Tesla Motors started to accept Bitcoin as a payment for its vehicles. However, soon the company reconsidered its decision, citing Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental impact. As the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy as entire countries, Musk decided to look for greener options. Read more: Bitcoin harmful to the environment, or not? Opinions vary, truth is singular Despite Musk‚Äôs change of heart on Bitcoin, Tesla remained one of the top corporate holders of Bitcoin with 11,509 coins on its balance sheet, according to Bitbo. Bitcoin enthusiasts have found many ways to mine Bitcoin with excessive energy, effectively reducing harmful emissions rather than impacting the environment. So, it is not impossible for Elon Musk to be involved in Bitcoin without compromising his ‚Äúgreen‚Äù reputation. Musk‚Äôs political ambitions After several months of service as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk had to step down in May as his work was limited to a 130-day appointment. The department was set to cut government spending. He was usually seen with Trump and was present at high-profile meetings. This fact allegedly was annoying many people outside and inside Trump‚Äôs circle. In June, Musk began to criticize the project of the ‚ÄúOne big, beautiful bill.‚Äù He cited the potential of increasing the U.S. national debt by a whopping $5 trillion in ten years, scrapping the achievements of Musk‚Äôs activity in the government in cutting spending. He said that he would start a new political party if the bill were adopted, which he did. However, in July, his main obsession on X is the Epstein list. Musk is posting memes about it, asking why the case is not investigated properly, and replying to Epstein-themed posts of other users. On June 5, 2025, he mentioned that Trump is on the Epstein list. Ever since, Musk has been trying to use it as a tool in the conflict with the POTUS. ü§¨ pic.twitter.com/Oe9jPGoQRR ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Yet, it‚Äôs not clear how serious Musk is when it comes to creating the America Party and what impact it can have. However, despite Musk‚Äôs advocacy for EV subsidies removal in the past, it doesn‚Äôt seem that the America Party can ignore ecological concerns. Speaking of Bitcoin, it is possible that Musk would popularize the eco-friendly ways of mining BTC the way he popularized electric vehicles.

2025-07-08T17:43:03,"Cronos (CRO) Price Explodes After Truth Social Files Crypto Blue-Chip ETF‚ÄîCan it Secure $0.1 Today?","The post Cronos (CRO) Price Explodes After Truth Social Files Crypto Blue-Chip ETF‚ÄîCan it Secure $0.1 Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The recent filing of the Truth Social Crypto Blue-Chip ETF has sparked renewed interest in Cronos (CRO), driving a noticeable surge in price. The move comes amid a broader wave of institutional activity in the digital asset space. Technically, the CRO price has shown renewed strength, posting a solid rebound from a multi-week low. On the fundamental side, inclusion in a high-profile ETF marks a potential turning point for Cronos, elevating its visibility and long-term investment appeal. Truth Social‚Äôs Crypto ETF: What it Means On July 8, 2025, Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, filed for a new ‚ÄúCrypto Blue-Chip ETF.‚Äù The proposed ETF includes five cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and notably, Cronos (CRO)‚Äîmarking the first time CRO has been considered in a mainstream investment vehicle of this kind. The fund, managed by Yorkville America Digital, is structured as a Nevada business trust and will be listed on NYSE Arca, pending SEC approval. Crypto.com‚Äôs affiliate, Foris DAX Trust, will serve as custodian, further deepening institutional support for CRO. Why CRO‚Äôs Inclusion is a Big Deal Cronos is no stranger to crypto-native ecosystems, but its inclusion in a potential Wall Street-listed ETF represents a significant leap toward legitimacy. This marks a key milestone for CRO, potentially bringing it into the portfolios of traditional investors who were previously limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure. Moreover, this strategic move by Truth Social and its partners underscores growing confidence in mid-cap Layer-1 networks, with Cronos positioned as a gateway to the broader Crypto.com ecosystem. This could lead to enhanced capital inflows, staking interest, and utility growth across the Cronos chain. CRP Price Surges Over 22% After the Announcement The price of CRO spiked more than 20% intraday after the ETF filing was made public, jumping from $0.08 to as high as $0.0994. This marks one of the strongest single-day performances in recent times. The sharp rally reflects investors optimism around institutional adoption and future liquidity support, especially as the ETF progresses through the SEC review process. The CRO price has remained stuck within the 0 FIB & 0.236 FIB after facing the breakdownin the first few days of the year. The current rise has elevated the levels close to the upper range after piercing above the 50-day MA. With this, the 50-day MA is acting as a local support and a rise above the 200-day MA at $0.1017 may offer a strong base to reach the 0.236 FIB at $0.1092. Once the price rises above these levels, the Cronos price is expected to rise above the bearish influence and eventually begin a fresh bullish wave. Although some profit-taking is pretty much likely in the short term, the broader narrative seems to have shifted as CRO is considered alongside the major cryptos. This change in the sentiment could help sustain the Cronos (CRO) price and the momentum in the medium term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cronos-cro-price-explodes-after-truth-social-files-crypto-blue-chip-etf-can-it-secure-0-1-today/,"CRO|TRADING|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T17:42:09,"$100 Million Institutional Doping for Ethereum (ETH)! ‚Äì Why Institutions Are Switching From Bitcoin to Ethereum? Here's What You Need to Know‚Ä¶","Ethereum (ETH) has been receiving institutional attention for a while now, as much as Bitcoin (BTC). While many companies have announced their ETH purchases one after another, Sharplink Gaming, which is on its way to becoming Ethreum‚Äôs MicroStrategy, continues to maintain its position as the largest public ETH holder in the world and the second largest holder after the Ethereum Foundation. While companies other than Sharplink Gaming continue to purchase ETH, the latest news came from Nasdaq-listed Blockchain company BTCS. Accordingly, BTCS announced a plan to raise $100 million to purchase additional Ethereum. BTCS said in its X post: ‚ÄúTo accumulate more Ethereum, we plan to raise $100 million this year through convertible bonds, at-the-market (ATM) stock offering, and staking rewards. With this plan, we aim to increase the amount of Ethereum held per share, thereby increasing shareholder value. We will take the lead in building a company focused on Ethereum infrastructure.‚Äù BTCS currently has 14,600 ETH in its possession. Institutional Migration from Bitcoin to Ethereum! As is known, Bit Digital recently made a bold move by shifting all of its institutional investment from Bitcoin to Ethereum. This raised the question in the market: ‚ÄúWhy are institutional investors suddenly accumulating Ethereum instead of Bitcoin?‚Äù While there is more than one answer to this question, Bit Digital CEO stated that they switched from BTC to ETH because they think the future is Ethereum. ‚ÄúEthereum is the next wave. With real economic activity, a massive developer base, and growing stablecoin and tokenization volume, ETH is becoming a new type of strategic asset that captures value.‚Äù Market experts also predict that corporate companies will turn to Ethereum more for reasons such as Ethereum's programmable blockchain structure, increasing adoption rate, staking model, tokenization and stablecoin leadership. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin also stated in a statement that institutions find ETH valuable and choose it not for speed, but for reliability, privacy and long-term trust. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-08T17:30:17,"Truth Social‚Äôs Groundbreaking Crypto ETF: A New Era for Digital Asset Investment","BitcoinWorld Truth Social‚Äôs Groundbreaking Crypto ETF: A New Era for Digital Asset Investment The financial world is abuzz with a surprising development: Truth Social , the social media platform founded by former U.S. President Donald Trump, has reportedly filed for a groundbreaking Crypto ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This isn‚Äôt just any ETF; it‚Äôs a ‚Äúblue-chip‚Äù offering poised to include heavyweights like Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana, XRP, and Cronos. This bold move could signal a significant shift in how mainstream investors access digital assets, blending the realms of social media, politics, and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. What is a Crypto Blue-Chip ETF and Why Does it Matter? An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, and trades on stock exchanges. A Crypto ETF , specifically, holds cryptocurrencies or derivatives tied to their prices. The term ‚Äúblue-chip‚Äù in this context refers to established, highly reputable, and financially sound cryptocurrencies that are generally considered safer and more stable investments within the volatile crypto market. Think of them as the equivalent of Coca-Cola or Apple in the stock market. The significance of a blue-chip Crypto ETF , especially one proposed by a high-profile entity like Truth Social , cannot be overstated. It offers several compelling advantages for investors: Accessibility: Investors can gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without the complexities of direct ownership, such as setting up digital wallets, managing private keys, or dealing with various exchanges. Diversification: A single ETF can provide diversified exposure to multiple top cryptocurrencies, reducing the risk associated with investing in just one digital asset. Regulation: Trading through a regulated ETF offers a layer of investor protection that direct crypto investments often lack. Liquidity: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling throughout the trading day. For many traditional investors, this type of ETF could be the bridge they need to enter the digital asset space with greater confidence and less friction. Truth Social‚Äôs Ambitious Foray into Digital Assets Truth Social , primarily known as a social media platform, venturing into the financial services sector with a Crypto ETF is an intriguing development. While the exact motivations are multifaceted, they likely include: Diversification of Revenue Streams: Expanding beyond advertising and subscription models into the lucrative asset management space. Catering to a Tech-Savvy User Base: Many users of alternative social media platforms are often early adopters of new technologies, including cryptocurrencies. Leveraging Brand Recognition: The association with a prominent political figure can draw significant attention and potential investment, even from those who might otherwise be hesitant about crypto. Strategic Positioning: Positioning itself at the forefront of the convergence between digital finance and mainstream investment. This move highlights a growing trend where companies from diverse sectors are exploring opportunities within the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, recognizing the immense potential of digital assets to reshape finance. The Blue-Chip Lineup: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Beyond The proposed ETF‚Äôs inclusion of specific cryptocurrencies ‚Äî Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cronos (CRO) ‚Äî provides a snapshot of what‚Äôs considered the cream of the crop in the crypto world. Let‚Äôs briefly explore why each of these assets holds a ‚Äúblue-chip‚Äù status: Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Gold Standard Bitcoin , the world‚Äôs first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is often referred to as ‚Äúdigital gold.‚Äù It serves primarily as a store of value and a medium of exchange, decentralized and resistant to censorship. Its limited supply and established network effect make it a foundational asset in any diversified crypto portfolio. For many, Bitcoin represents the entry point into the world of digital finance. Ethereum (ETH): The Backbone of Decentralized Applications Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency and is much more than just a digital currency. It‚Äôs a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. It powers the vast ecosystems of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and countless other blockchain innovations. Its upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 (now called the Consensus Layer) and its move to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism further enhance its scalability and energy efficiency, cementing its status as a vital blue-chip asset. Solana (SOL): The High-Performance Challenger Solana has rapidly risen to prominence due to its high throughput and low transaction costs, making it a formidable competitor to Ethereum for dApp development. Its innovative proof-of-history consensus mechanism allows it to process thousands of transactions per second, attracting developers and users looking for speed and efficiency. XRP: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger, an open-source, permissionless, and decentralized blockchain technology. Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP is designed for fast, low-cost international payments and remittances, aiming to facilitate cross-border transactions for financial institutions. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges, its utility in real-world payment solutions gives it a unique position. Cronos (CRO): Powering a Crypto Ecosystem Cronos is the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos Chain, an EVM-compatible blockchain developed by Crypto.com. CRO is integral to the Crypto.com ecosystem, enabling users to pay fees, earn rewards, and participate in governance across various Crypto.com products, including its exchange, DeFi wallet, and NFT marketplace. Its utility within a rapidly expanding crypto services platform gives it blue-chip potential. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison of these blue-chip assets: Cryptocurrency Primary Use Case Key Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Store of Value, Digital Gold First & Largest Crypto, Decentralized Ethereum (ETH) Smart Contracts, dApps, DeFi Programmable Blockchain, Large Ecosystem Solana (SOL) High-Performance dApps Fast Transactions, Low Fees XRP Cross-Border Payments Institutional Focus, Efficient Transfers Cronos (CRO) Ecosystem Utility (Crypto.com) EVM-Compatible Chain, Rewards The Critical Role of the SEC Filing and Regulatory Hurdles The most crucial step for this Crypto ETF to become a reality is the approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC filing process is rigorous and designed to protect investors by ensuring transparency and compliance with securities laws. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation, custody, and investor protection in an unregulated market. However, the landscape has been shifting. The approval of several Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year marked a significant turning point, demonstrating a growing regulatory comfort with certain digital asset products. While a Bitcoin ETF was a major hurdle, an ETF encompassing multiple cryptocurrencies, including altcoins like Solana and Cronos, presents new challenges for the SEC. Each asset needs to be thoroughly vetted for market integrity, liquidity, and potential risks. The SEC filing for a multi-asset crypto ETF by Truth Social will undoubtedly attract intense scrutiny, both from regulators and the broader financial community. The outcome of this filing will set a precedent for future multi-asset crypto investment products and could influence the regulatory trajectory for digital assets in the United States. Potential Impact and Benefits for the Crypto Market Should Truth Social ‚Äôs Crypto ETF receive approval, its impact on the digital asset market could be profound: Increased Institutional Adoption: An approved ETF provides a familiar and regulated pathway for institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to cryptocurrencies, potentially bringing in billions of dollars. Enhanced Market Legitimacy: SEC approval would lend significant credibility to the included cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset space, signaling that these assets are maturing and gaining acceptance within traditional finance. Broader Retail Investor Access: Millions of everyday investors who are comfortable with traditional brokerage accounts but hesitant about direct crypto purchases could easily gain exposure. Price Stability and Liquidity: Increased inflows from institutional and retail investors could lead to greater market depth, potentially reducing volatility and improving liquidity for the underlying assets. Innovation and Competition: The success of such an ETF could spur other financial institutions to launch similar products, fostering innovation and competition in the crypto investment landscape. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the prospects are exciting, several challenges and considerations remain: Regulatory Hurdles: As mentioned, the SEC filing process is arduous. The SEC will scrutinize market surveillance, custody solutions, and potential conflicts of interest, especially given the political ties of Truth Social . Market Volatility: Despite their ‚Äúblue-chip‚Äù status, cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. An ETF would still be subject to significant price swings, which might not be suitable for all investors. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of the underlying digital assets for an ETF of this scale is a complex logistical and security challenge. Political Scrutiny: Given Truth Social ‚Äòs founder, the ETF proposal could face additional political and public scrutiny, potentially influencing the regulatory timeline and outcome. Fees and Performance: The success of the ETF will also depend on its fee structure and its ability to accurately track the performance of its underlying assets. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this space, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the SEC filing progress and any announcements from Truth Social or the SEC regarding this ETF. Regulatory updates will be key. Understand the Underlying Assets: Even if you plan to invest via an ETF, take the time to understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the other included cryptocurrencies. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Remember that even a blue-chip crypto ETF carries inherent risks due to the volatility of the underlying assets. Ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk profile. Diversify Wisely: While the ETF offers internal diversification, consider how it fits into your broader investment portfolio. A New Horizon for Digital Asset Investment? The Truth Social Crypto ETF filing represents a significant moment in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset economy. It signifies not just a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies but also an innovative approach by a social media company to diversify and expand its footprint. While the path to approval through the SEC filing process is fraught with challenges, the potential for this blue-chip ETF to open new avenues for investment in Bitcoin , Ethereum , and other leading digital assets is undeniable. It could truly usher in a new era of mainstream accessibility and institutional engagement, redefining how we perceive and interact with the future of finance.

2025-07-08T17:28:07,"Aptos max buy opportunity? Why $3.65 support could launch a 250% run","Aptos is trading at the bottom of a multi-month range. With a potential rounded bottom forming and confluence at $14, the current support zone offers a high-reward setup with 250% upside. Aptos ( APT ) is currently positioned in what can only be described as a ‚ÄúMax Opportunity‚Äù zone‚Äîthe lower boundary of a high time frame trading range that has held firm for months. Historically, this zone has served as a launchpad for rallies toward the range high and now presents a compelling long setup for both swing traders and long-term investors. The price structure hints at accumulation, and attention is now focused on whether bullish expansion can emerge from this technically significant area. Key technical points Major Support at $3.65: Long-term range low aligning with the value area low. Rounded Bottom Structure Forming: Accumulation pattern supports a reversal narrative. Upside Target at $14: 0.618 Fibonacci and high time frame resistance aligned, representing a potential 250% rally. APTUSDT (1D) Chart: Source: TradingView Aptos is trading near $3.65, the macro range low of a prolonged consolidation phase. Historical interactions with this level have triggered sharp bullish reversals, including a prior rally that extended to the value area high. This reinforces the zone‚Äôs significance as both a trade location and structural support. Current price action suggests a rounded bottom is developing‚Äîa classic accumulation pattern that often forms at market lows. Rounded bottoms signal a shift in control from sellers to buyers, as selling pressure fades and demand gradually builds. The longer Aptos consolidates at this level without breaking down, the greater the likelihood of a bullish breakout. You might also like: BlackRock hits 700K BTC milestone with latest purchase The support zone also aligns with the value area low on the volume profile, indicating high historical trading activity and strong demand. This confluence strengthens the case for this area as a durable floor unless meaningful selling emerges, which has not materialized. If Aptos confirms this rounded bottom formation and begins to rotate higher, the next key target lies around $14. This level represents the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous move, a prior swing high, and a major high time frame resistance zone. A move from $3.65 to $14 would mark an approximate 250% rally, offering a compelling risk-to-reward scenario. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Aptos holds above the $3.65 value area low, the probability of a bullish breakout remains elevated. Traders should watch for confirmation of the rounded bottom pattern and monitor volume activity as APT attempts a rotation toward the $14 level in the coming weeks.

2025-07-08T17:21:09,"Metaplanet Sets Bold Plan to Buy Digital Bank With Bitcoin","Metaplanet, a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is taking a new and bold approach to business growth using Bitcoin (BTC). The company, which holds a significant amount of the top cryptocurrency, aims to utilize its substantial crypto holdings to finance the acquisition of profitable businesses. Metaplanet‚Äôs CEO, Simon Gerovich, recently shared that the company plans to buy a digital bank in Japan. This represents a significant shift from its original business direction as a hotel operator. Metaplanet Started Buying Bitcoin to Grow in the Future In 2024, Metaplanet began buying Bitcoin to hedge against inflation . Since then, it has continued to add to its reserve. By early July 2025, the company owned 15,555‚ÄØBTC after spending $239 million to buy 2,205 more coins. With this, the Japanese-based firm is now the fifth-largest public company in the world, holding the flagship crypto. On average, it has paid about $99,985 for each coin. The company‚Äôs long-term goal is to own over 210,000‚ÄØBTC by 2027. This would be around 1% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist. Metaplanet‚Äôs leadership sees this aggressive accumulation as a critical first phase. The goal is to achieve a level of Bitcoin ownership that places the company significantly ahead of any potential competitors. Bitcoin as a Tool for Business Expansion In the next phase of its plan, Metaplanet intends to use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This would enable the company to access loans and raise funds, much like businesses use stocks or government bonds. These funds would then be used to acquire companies that generate steady income. One of the main targets under consideration is a digital bank. The company believes it can offer better services than regular banks by entering the digital finance space. This plan is part of Metaplanet‚Äôs goal to mix digital assets with modern financial services. To help grow the business, Metaplanet may issue preferred shares instead of taking on regular debt. This choice helps the company avoid repaying loans under strict rules or adjusting share prices. With this method, Metaplanet aims to attract long-term investors without the stress of short-term repayments. Metaplanet Sees Strong Growth Even with Small Revenue Metaplanet is not generating significant revenue yet, but its stock has increased by over 345% this year, pushing its market value above $7 billion. This considerable jump indicates that many investors are confident in Metaplanet‚Äôs strategy to focus on Bitcoin.

2025-07-08T17:11:47,"Bitcoin Stays Steady, But Momentum Flashes Bullish Signs: Bitfinex Alpha","With bitcoin (BTC) having remained in a consolidation phase for a relatively long time, market participants are wondering about its next direction. Some analysts have predicted a significant correction in the coming weeks, while others believe a positive breakout is imminent. Despite the state of the market and negative sentiment within a part of the crypto community, analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex insist BTC is biased to the upside. This means the cryptocurrency has a higher chance of climbing up than declining. Bulls In Structural Control According to this week‚Äôs Bitfinex Alpha report , the Bitcoin market has been defending the short-term holder realized price (STHRP) of $98,220 despite recent volatility. Although BTC has fallen below range lows in recent weeks, the asset has found support at the STHRP. Analysts termed this a constructive signal, indicating that bulls remain in structural control. Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience also supports the belief that underlying momentum is skewed to the bullish side. The STH cost basis has been rising and is now hovering around $99,474, indicating persistent accumulation by newer market participants. This cohort of investors is led by institutional buyers purchasing BTC through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and balance sheet allocations . Amid this consolidation phase, Bifinex says bitcoin‚Äôs short-term momentum is weakening at range highs. Futures market traders have been closing their positions around levels seen between July 2 and 4. This suggests that while bulls are in structural control, they are unable to trigger and sustain significant price rallies. Hence, the market is still in need of fresh catalysts or clearer macroeconomic signals before prices can surge. BTC Whales Are Redistributing Meanwhile, BTC whales are in a distribution phase. Since July 4, mid-sized wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC have been slashing their holdings. With more than 14,000 BTC offloaded since June 30, the market is witnessing a cautious stance among high-cap investors. As whales continue to redistribute amid macro uncertainty, retail and institutional investors are absorbing the supply. So far this month, STHs have increased their collective holdings by more than 382,000 BTC, nearly the same amount as was offloaded by long-term holders. Their purchases have been driving market momentum this month. ‚ÄúThis divergence points to a redistribution of coins from crypto natives to newer entrants and institutions, many likely motivated by recent price dips and renewed macro interest following the strong performance of the equities markets,‚Äù Bitfinex stated.

2025-07-08T17:00:39,"XRP Proponent Sends Critical Warning to Investors","A powerful warning from XRP advocate Kenny Nguyen is echoing across the crypto community: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt invest in XRP now, you miss the same BTC train back in the day.‚Äù The message is direct and sobering; those who overlook XRP today may be passing up the kind of life-changing opportunity that Bitcoin once offered in its earliest days. Bitcoin‚Äôs Rise: From Obscurity to Global Dominance Bitcoin‚Äôs journey began in 2009 with little fanfare. Back then, it traded for mere fractions of a cent. By 2010, it reached $0.01, and by 2013, $1,000, a milestone that drew both attention and skepticism. In 2017, Bitcoin stunned the world by climbing to $20,000 before entering a deep correction. But it wasn‚Äôt the end, it was only the beginning. Driven by institutional adoption, growing mainstream interest, and increasing demand as a digital store of value, Bitcoin surged to over $60,000 in 2021. As of July 2025, it trades above $108,000, having firmly established itself as the gold standard of digital assets. IF YOU DON'T INVEST IN XRP NOW, YOU MISS THE SAME BTC TRAIN BACK IN THE DAY JUST SAYING ‚Äî Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) July 8, 2025 Nguyen‚Äôs warning draws a clear parallel: just as most people dismissed Bitcoin in its early days, many are currently underestimating XRP. But history, he suggests, may soon repeat. XRP‚Äôs Evolution: Utility Without Recognition XRP entered the crypto space in 2012 with a different mission from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin positioned itself as a decentralized alternative to fiat, XRP was designed to enable fast, low-cost, cross-border transactions. Its payment settlement speed, just 3 to 5 seconds, makes it vastly superior to Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and scalability for financial institutions. Despite this strong foundation, XRP‚Äôs price never mirrored its utility. Regulatory challenges, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple Labs, kept its value suppressed for years. Its all-time high of $3.84 in 2018 was followed by a long period of stagnation. But the tide is turning. Ripple has secured key legal wins, expanded its enterprise adoption globally, and launched new products like RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin to be deployed on the XRP Ledger. These moves are setting the stage for what many believe could be a historic breakout. A Familiar Setup: XRP Poised for Explosive Growth Analysts have identified major bullish patterns on XRP‚Äôs long-term charts , including a breakout from multi-year consolidation and a reclaim of critical resistance zones. The setup is strikingly similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs price structure before each of its parabolic rallies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At a current price of around $2.29, XRP remains significantly undervalued relative to its potential. With the lawsuit nearly behind it, macro sentiment shifting in favor of crypto, and Ripple accelerating its institutional use cases, the market conditions are aligning. Nguyen‚Äôs call to action is grounded in this backdrop. He believes XRP today mirrors Bitcoin during its $100‚Äì$1,000 phase, a time when the conviction was low, but the opportunity was immense. The Verdict: A Second Chance at a First-Mover Advantage Nguyen‚Äôs warning is not just speculative enthusiasm; it‚Äôs a strategic insight. The chance to invest in Bitcoin before its meteoric rise is long gone. But XRP, he argues, may now offer a similar window of opportunity for those with foresight. If history has taught the crypto market anything, it‚Äôs that major breakouts rarely wait for public consensus. For investors still on the sidelines, the message is clear: don‚Äôt let hesitation become regret. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-08T17:00:16,"Bitcoin Options Market Cools Off, Echoing Familiar Summer Slowdowns ‚Äì What This Means","Following a resurgence of bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape, Bitcoin underwent a sharp rally and has since maintained this remarkable upward momentum, with its price holding strongly above the $108,000 mark. Amidst BTC‚Äôs renewed rally is a slowdown in the options market, which is currently mirroring past negative trends. Summer Slowdown Hits Bitcoin Options Since recovery from its pullback, Bitcoin has remained in an upward trajectory and appears to have found stability above the $108,000 level. Despite this notable upside performance of the flagship asset, a worrying trend has been observed in BTC‚Äôs on-chain and market dynamics . Popular on-chain data and financial platform, Glassnode, has reported a negative development in the Bitcoin options market. Presently, the BTC options market is starting to exhibit clear signs of slowing down despite the recent upward price action. While the market is cooling down, the development is echoing familiar trends observed during previous periods of less desire for speculation. Recent on-chain data shows that both implied volatility and trading volumes have significantly decreased lately, which may indicate that traders are reducing their exposure as sentiment is hindered by seasonal or unclear causes. Glassnode, after analyzing the Bitcoin Options ATM Implied Volatility metric, has revealed that the options market is echoing the summer slowdown. According to the on-chain platform, the implied volatility across all expiries, especially the 1-week and 1-month holders, is approaching all-time lows. Such a development signals a cautious pause from BTC investors, suggesting that the market may be building momentum or just taking a collective breather before making its next big move. The on-chain platform further highlighted that the options market is currently pricing some of the lowest volatility levels since the middle of 2023. This trend has continued despite BTC‚Äôs price hovering near all-time highs. Glassnode has also drawn attention to trading volume, which seems to have dived down sharply. According to Glassnode, the summer lull is here, and BTC‚Äôs volumes are drying up in spite of the flagship asset‚Äôs ongoing run toward the $110,000 price mark . Data shows that the spot volume has fallen to $5.01 billion, whereas the futures volume has fallen to approximately $31.2 billion. The platform noted that volumes in these two areas are currently at their lowest in over a year and are still trending downward. BTC Makes Key Breakouts Despite the summer lull, Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to display strength. Melijn The Trader, a crypto analyst, has predicted a major rally as the asset breaks out of both a falling wedge pattern and a bull flag pattern. According to the analyst, this structure reflects momentum and not noise, classifying the development as a breakout phase. Considering the breakout, Melijn is confident that BTC could surge to a new all-time high of $140,000. At the time of writing, BTC‚Äôs price was valued at $108,271, demonstrating a nearly 1% decline in the last 24 hours. While prices may be down, trading volume is gradually picking up pace, as indicated by a more than 15% increase in the past day.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-options-market-slowdown/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Futures Volume|bitcoin news|Bitcoin Options ATM Implied Volatility Metric|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot Volume|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Bull Flag Pattern|Falling Wedge Pattern|Glassnode|Melijn The Trader",cryptocompare

XRP HODL Wave chart shows HODLing. Source: Glassnode. Long-term cohort bands also remain stable despite recent volatility and macro FUD, creating a solid foundation for growth with resilient underlying support. XRP Price Analysis: Can $3 Be Topped This Cycle? The XRP price could be gearing up for its next leg higher as it teeters on a breakout from a symmetrical triangle that has capped its upside since late February. Momentum indicators align with the long-term bullish on-chain metrics. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line at 52, signaling renewed buyer strength and a return to bullish territory. More so, the MACD has formed a golden cross, surpassing the single line for the first time since May. On the 3-day chart, this suggests a potential mid-term uptrend is taking shape. XRP has already surpassed the immediate resistance to a breakout at the 0.618 Fibonnaci level at $2.267. The next hurdle sits at $2.44, which will determine whether this is a true breakout or a false move. Should the bullish case play out, the pattern sets up a likely technical target at the 2.618 Fibonacci extension around $4.365‚Äîrepresenting a 90% gain from current levels. For this breakout to fully materialize, a market-warming catalyst such as the October 17 U.S. spot XRP ETF decision could prove decisive, opening the door to fresh TradFi inflows. Bitcoin Could Soon Steal the Spotlight ‚Äì With Some Help Those who jumped to altcoins like XRP over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks ‚Äì until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin‚Äôs first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

2025-07-08T16:40:55,"Bitcoin Futures: CME Dominance Signals Monumental Institutional Shift","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures: CME Dominance Signals Monumental Institutional Shift Are you ready to witness a monumental shift in the cryptocurrency landscape? The latest data reveals a compelling story about who is truly driving the Bitcoin market now. For years, retail traders dominated the narrative, but a significant change is underway, signaling a maturing market where big players are taking the lead. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has now firmly positioned itself at the forefront of Bitcoin futures open interest, a clear indicator of burgeoning institutional demand. Understanding the Rise of Bitcoin Futures and Open Interest Before we dive into the specifics of CME‚Äôs ascent, let‚Äôs clarify what Bitcoin futures and open interest mean. Bitcoin futures are financial contracts that obligate the buyer or seller to transact Bitcoin at a predetermined future date and price. They allow investors to speculate on Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without actually owning the underlying asset. Open interest, on the other hand, represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. It‚Äôs a crucial metric because it reflects the total amount of money flowing into the futures market, indicating liquidity and market depth. A rising open interest suggests new money entering the market, while a falling open interest indicates money leaving. The significance of open interest, particularly in the context of Bitcoin, lies in its ability to gauge market sentiment and participation. High open interest often correlates with strong market conviction and can precede significant price movements. When institutional players engage, their capital infusion adds substantial depth and stability, fundamentally altering the market‚Äôs dynamics. CME Open Interest Takes the Lead: A Detailed Look According to the CoinGlass H1 2025 report, as of June 1, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has officially surpassed all other platforms in Bitcoin futures open interest. This isn‚Äôt just a marginal lead; it‚Äôs a decisive statement from the traditional finance world. Wu Blockchain on X highlighted that CME recorded a staggering 158,300 BTC in open interest, significantly outpacing Binance, which stood at 118,700 BTC. Key Takeaways from the Data: CME‚Äôs Dominance: The 158,300 BTC figure for CME represents a robust vote of confidence from institutional investors who prefer regulated, traditional venues for their crypto exposure. Binance‚Äôs Market Share Decline: While still a major player, Binance‚Äôs second position indicates a shift in the landscape, with its market share in Bitcoin futures open interest diminishing relative to CME. This could be attributed to increased regulatory scrutiny on offshore exchanges and institutions favoring regulated alternatives. Widening Gap: The report also points to a widening gap between Binance and other prominent exchanges like OKX and Bybit. This suggests a consolidation of institutional activity on platforms like CME, while the broader market for retail and some institutional players remains distributed but with a clear leader emerging. This shift isn‚Äôt merely about numbers; it reflects a deeper trend in the crypto market . Institutions, with their massive capital, are increasingly comfortable entering the digital asset space, but they demand the infrastructure and regulatory clarity that traditional exchanges like CME provide. This preference is reshaping how Bitcoin is traded and perceived globally. What Drives This Surging Institutional Demand ? The rise of institutional demand for Bitcoin futures on CME is not accidental. Several factors contribute to this significant trend: 1. Regulatory Clarity and Compliance: CME is a regulated derivatives exchange based in the United States. For large financial institutions, regulatory compliance is paramount. Trading on a regulated platform minimizes legal and operational risks, providing a sense of security that is often lacking on less regulated crypto-native exchanges. This clarity is a major draw for hedge funds, asset managers, and corporate treasuries. 2. Familiarity and Infrastructure: Traditional finance players are accustomed to the trading mechanisms and infrastructure offered by exchanges like CME. The systems, settlement processes, and risk management tools are familiar, making the transition into Bitcoin futures smoother than navigating the often-complex and varied interfaces of pure crypto exchanges. 3. Liquidity and Depth: As more institutions enter, they bring significant capital, enhancing liquidity on CME. High liquidity ensures that large orders can be executed with minimal price impact, a critical factor for institutional-sized trades. This creates a virtuous cycle: more liquidity attracts more institutions, further deepening the market. 4. Macroeconomic Factors and Diversification: In an environment of economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge or a store of value. Institutions are diversifying their portfolios to include digital assets, and futures contracts offer a convenient, non-custodial way to gain exposure without directly holding Bitcoin, which can have its own set of operational challenges. Implications for the Broader Digital Assets Ecosystem CME‚Äôs dominance in Bitcoin futures open interest has profound implications for the entire digital assets ecosystem: Market Maturation: The increased participation of institutional investors signals a maturing market. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its speculative, retail-driven origins and is becoming a recognized asset class within traditional finance. This legitimacy can attract even more mainstream adoption. Price Discovery and Stability: Institutional capital tends to bring more stability and efficiency to price discovery. Their long-term investment horizons and sophisticated trading strategies can reduce volatility compared to purely retail-driven markets. While volatility will always be a characteristic of crypto, institutional involvement can temper extreme swings. Future Product Development: The success of Bitcoin futures on CME could pave the way for more sophisticated institutional products, such as Bitcoin spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), options, and other structured products. This expansion of investment vehicles will further integrate crypto into traditional financial markets. Competitive Landscape Shift: Crypto-native exchanges will need to adapt. While they may continue to cater to retail and certain institutional segments, the trend towards regulated venues for large-scale derivatives trading is undeniable. This could spur more crypto exchanges to seek regulatory licenses and enhance their compliance frameworks. Challenges and Considerations While the rise of institutional demand is largely positive, it‚Äôs essential to consider potential challenges: Centralization Concerns: As more volume flows through regulated, centralized entities like CME, some in the crypto community might raise concerns about the decentralization ethos of Bitcoin. Increased Correlation with Traditional Markets: Greater institutional involvement could lead to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements becoming more correlated with traditional financial assets, potentially reducing its appeal as an uncorrelated hedge. Regulatory Scrutiny: With increased institutional adoption comes increased regulatory attention. While beneficial for legitimacy, it could also lead to more stringent rules and oversight for the entire crypto industry. Actionable Insights for Investors For both retail and institutional investors, this shift offers several actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on open interest data from CME and other regulated exchanges. Rising open interest can be a bullish signal, indicating strong institutional conviction. Understand Market Structure: Recognize that the market is evolving. While retail still plays a role, institutional capital is increasingly influential in price discovery and overall market sentiment. Consider Regulated Products: If you are an institutional investor or a high-net-worth individual, explore the benefits of regulated Bitcoin futures and other upcoming products for compliant exposure. Diversify Wisely: As the digital assets space matures, continue to diversify your portfolio, understanding the different risk profiles of various cryptocurrencies and investment vehicles. The Future is Institutional: A Compelling Outlook The data from CoinGlass and the analysis from Wu Blockchain paint a clear picture: the institutionalization of Bitcoin is not just a concept; it‚Äôs a rapidly unfolding reality. CME‚Äôs lead in Bitcoin futures open interest is a powerful testament to this trend, underscoring the growing confidence of traditional finance in digital assets. This monumental shift promises a more mature, stable, and integrated crypto market, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future.

2025-07-08T16:30:55,"Falcon Finance Soars: Unveiling 116% Overcollateralization and Brilliant Yield Strategies","BitcoinWorld Falcon Finance Soars: Unveiling 116% Overcollateralization and Brilliant Yield Strategies In the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi), finding protocols that offer both stability and impressive returns can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, recent insights from Andrei Grachev, co-founder of crypto market maker DWF Labs, shed a bright light on Falcon Finance , positioning it as a standout contender. Grachev‚Äôs update on X highlighted Falcon Finance‚Äôs remarkable 116% overcollateralization and its innovative approach to generating yield, making it a compelling subject for anyone interested in the future of digital asset investments. Understanding Falcon Finance‚Äôs Robust Overcollateralization One of the most critical indicators of a DeFi protocol‚Äôs health and reliability is its collateralization ratio. For Falcon Finance , this figure stands at an impressive 116%, signifying a strong buffer against market volatility. What makes this even more compelling is the composition of this collateral: Dominant Stablecoins and Bitcoin: Approximately 89% of Falcon Finance‚Äôs collateral is backed by stablecoins and Bitcoin. This strategic allocation provides a bedrock of stability, as stablecoins are designed to maintain a pegged value (usually to the USD), and Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is widely considered a foundational digital asset. Strategic Altcoin Exposure: The remaining 11% comprises various altcoins. While altcoins can introduce higher volatility, their inclusion, when managed effectively, can offer diversification and potential for higher growth. The relatively small percentage ensures that the protocol‚Äôs overall stability is not unduly compromised. This substantial overcollateralization means that for every dollar of value issued by Falcon Finance, there is 1.16 dollars of underlying assets securing it. This provides a significant safety net for users, mitigating risks associated with market downturns and ensuring the protocol‚Äôs solvency even under adverse conditions. It‚Äôs a testament to a cautious and risk-aware approach in a space often criticized for its speculative nature. Unpacking Falcon Finance‚Äôs Dynamic Yield Strategies Beyond its robust collateral, Falcon Finance distinguishes itself through its sophisticated and diversified yield strategies . Unlike many protocols that rely on single, often high-risk, methods, Falcon employs a multi-pronged approach to generate returns for its users. These strategies are meticulously designed to be market-neutral, a concept we‚Äôll explore further. The primary sources of yield for Falcon Finance are: Basis Trading (44%): This strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling an asset in different markets to profit from small price discrepancies. In crypto, this often means exploiting the difference between the spot price of a cryptocurrency and its futures contract price. It‚Äôs a low-risk, high-volume strategy that thrives on market inefficiencies. Arbitrage (34%): Similar to basis trading, arbitrage involves profiting from price differences of the same asset across different exchanges. For example, buying Bitcoin on Exchange A where it‚Äôs slightly cheaper and immediately selling it on Exchange B where it‚Äôs slightly more expensive. This requires speed and sophisticated algorithms but carries minimal directional risk. Staking (22%): A more traditional DeFi yield method, staking involves locking up cryptocurrencies to support the operations of a blockchain network, in return for rewards. Falcon Finance leverages staking of its underlying assets to contribute to its overall yield generation, adding a layer of passive income. This diversified portfolio of yield strategies ensures that the protocol isn‚Äôt overly reliant on any single market condition or trading opportunity, thereby enhancing its resilience and consistency in generating returns. The Power of Market-Neutral Strategies: A Core Principle One of the most compelling aspects of Falcon Finance , as highlighted by Grachev, is its exclusive reliance on market-neutral strategies. But what exactly does this mean in the context of cryptocurrency, and why is it so significant? A market-neutral strategy is designed to profit regardless of whether the overall market goes up or down. This is achieved by taking offsetting positions that cancel out the directional risk. For example, in basis trading, you might simultaneously long (buy) an asset in the spot market and short (sell) its futures contract. If the market goes down, your spot position loses value, but your short futures position gains, balancing the outcome and allowing you to profit from the ‚Äòbasis‚Äô (the price difference) rather than the asset‚Äôs price movement. The benefits of a market-neutral approach for a fixed-income protocol are immense: Reduced Volatility Exposure: Investors are shielded from the extreme price swings characteristic of the crypto market. Consistent Returns: By not relying on bullish or bearish trends, the protocol aims for more predictable and stable returns, mimicking traditional fixed-income investments. Enhanced Security: Minimizing directional bets reduces the risk of large capital losses due to sudden market crashes. This commitment to market-neutrality, combined with features like instant unstaking for staked USDf and a trader-driven peg mechanism, positions Falcon Finance as a truly innovative and potentially safer alternative for those seeking stable returns in the volatile crypto landscape. The instant unstaking feature, in particular, offers liquidity that is often lacking in traditional staking models, giving users greater control over their funds. Growth and Resilience: Falcon Finance‚Äôs Journey as a Leading Fixed-Income Protocol Andrei Grachev‚Äôs public endorsement on X wasn‚Äôt just about technical specifications; it was also a nod to Falcon Finance ‚Äòs impressive growth and remarkable resilience. Despite the inherent skepticism and occasional criticism that new DeFi protocols face, Falcon Finance has managed to carve out a significant niche for itself. Grachev‚Äôs emphasis on the protocol‚Äôs journey underscores its ability to navigate market challenges and continuously deliver on its promise of stable returns. This resilience is a critical factor for any project aiming to be a leading fixed-income protocol in the long term. The fact that it maintains its overcollateralization and diversified yield streams even amidst broader market fluctuations speaks volumes about its operational efficiency and robust risk management. The ‚Äòtrader-driven peg mechanism‚Äô is another interesting innovation, empowering market participants to help maintain the stability of the USDf token. This decentralized approach to peg maintenance can be more robust than centralized models, leveraging collective intelligence and market forces to ensure stability. Why Falcon Finance Stands Out in the DeFi Landscape In a crowded DeFi space, what truly makes Falcon Finance noteworthy? Transparency and Trust: Backed by insights from prominent figures like Andrei Grachev and DWF Labs, Falcon Finance is gaining recognition for its transparent operational model. Superior Risk Management: The combination of 116% overcollateralization , a diversified asset base (89% stablecoins/BTC), and strictly market-neutral yield strategies significantly lowers investor risk compared to many other high-yield DeFi platforms. Innovation in Yield Generation: By focusing on basis trading and arbitrage alongside staking, Falcon Finance taps into sophisticated financial engineering to generate consistent returns without relying on speculative asset appreciation. Liquidity and Control: The instant unstaking for staked USDf provides users with unparalleled flexibility, a major advantage in the DeFi space where funds can often be locked up for extended periods. These elements collectively position Falcon Finance not just as another DeFi project, but as a serious contender for investors seeking predictable and secure returns in the volatile crypto market. It represents a mature approach to DeFi, blending innovative technology with sound financial principles. The Future Outlook for Fixed-Income Protocols As the crypto market matures, the demand for reliable fixed-income protocol s will only grow. Institutional investors, in particular, are looking for avenues to deploy capital into digital assets without taking on excessive directional risk. Protocols like Falcon Finance , with their emphasis on market-neutral strategies and robust collateralization, are perfectly poised to meet this evolving demand. The ongoing development and refinement of such protocols will be crucial for the broader adoption of DeFi. They bridge the gap between traditional finance‚Äôs need for stability and the crypto world‚Äôs promise of higher returns, paving the way for a more integrated and accessible financial future. Conclusion: Falcon Finance ‚Äì A Beacon of Stability and Growth Falcon Finance , as highlighted by DWF Labs‚Äô Andrei Grachev, stands as a compelling example of innovation in decentralized finance. Its impressive 116% overcollateralization , primarily backed by stablecoins and Bitcoin, alongside its sophisticated and diversified yield strategies rooted in market-neutral principles, sets it apart. By prioritizing stability, transparency, and consistent returns, Falcon Finance is not just weathering the storm of market volatility but thriving, solidifying its position as a truly remarkable and potentially leading fixed-income protocol . For those seeking a blend of security and lucrative opportunities in the digital asset space, Falcon Finance presents a powerful and exciting proposition.

2025-07-08T16:29:36,"UK small-cap firms are adopting MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin treasury model","Several UK-listed small-cap companies are now copying a controversial American playbook that turned a tech firm into a full-on Bitcoin proxy. The plan is simple but aggressive: issue new shares, raise cash, and buy Bitcoin. Executives hope this move will push their stock prices higher by giving investors indirect exposure to crypto, something that‚Äôs still difficult to access in the UK. This development was brought to our attention by Axel Cabrol, Co-Deputy CIO at TOBAM, whose research paper Accounting for the Performance of MicroStrategy shows that British firms are now trying to do what MicroStrategy did in the US between 2020 and 2024, when it massively outperformed Bitcoin itself using a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Axel believes that while this model isn‚Äôt without risk, it could be one of the few tools available to revive UK equities. He also made it clear that just because a company adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll succeed. ‚ÄúBitcoin adoption is no magic wand that turns lead into gold,‚Äù said Axel, warning that companies must know what they‚Äôre doing and whether the strategy fits their business. MicroStrategy outperforms Bitcoin using a three-pronged structure Between 2021 and 2024, MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock jumped 7.5x, while Bitcoin rose just 3.2x. According to TOBAM, the outperformance came from three things: turning the stock‚Äôs premium into book value and buying more Bitcoin with it, increasing exposure to Bitcoin over time through that same mechanism, and taking advantage of spikes in the premium at which its stock traded compared to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. TOBAM‚Äôs study, conducted by Axel along with Yves Choueifaty and Tristan Froidure, says the strategy works best when the company can issue new shares at a premium, then use that money to buy more Bitcoin, generating something they call a ‚ÄúBitcoin Yield.‚Äù When the company sells shares at inflated prices and turns that cash into more Bitcoin, it boosts its exposure and stock performance. In 2021 and 2024, MicroStrategy managed to generate a Bitcoin Yield of around 50%. But of course, the strategy isn‚Äôt perfect. In 2023, even though the company added 43% more Bitcoin to its holdings, it had to increase its number of shares by 48%. That meant the Bitcoin Yield turned negative and dragged on the stock‚Äôs performance. Bitcoin Price Premium gives investors more than coin performance The paper explains that performance also depends on how far the company‚Äôs shares trade above the value of the Bitcoin it holds. This is called the Bitcoin Price Premium, and it fluctuates based on demand. MicroStrategy‚Äôs returns were boosted when this premium grew. If the premium had stayed flat in 2021, shareholders would have nearly doubled Bitcoin returns anyway. But because the premium expanded in 2023 and 2024, investors got more‚Äîup to three times Bitcoin‚Äôs performance in some periods. Exposure also played a role. The company‚Äôs realized exposure to Bitcoin (Œ≤) was sometimes higher than one. In 2022, during a crypto sell-off, the firm‚Äôs stock traded at a discount to its Bitcoin, which pushed its exposure above normal. In 2024, the company started with a relatively low beginning-of-year exposure (Œ≤‚ÇÄ = 0.75), but the massive 61% Bitcoin Yield that year pushed realized exposure to 1.2. Source: Axel Cabrol, Yves Choueifaty, and Tristan Froidure In simple terms, MicroStrategy found ways to give shareholders more upside than Bitcoin itself. This is exactly what UK firms want. But the model only works if the company knows how to manage dilution, time the issuance of shares, and buy Bitcoin strategically. If they screw up the balance, the strategy can collapse fast. Axel said the recent moves by UK small caps to mimic this structure could finally give British retail and wealth investors a practical way into crypto markets. ‚ÄúThis will also allow UK wealth and retail investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency where it has previously been more challenging,‚Äù he said. With the UK far behind the US in regulated crypto investment options, this indirect route might be the only access some investors have for now. But TOBAM‚Äôs research ends on a warning. Axel, Yves, and Tristan made it clear that this model is not a guaranteed fix. Execution is everything. If done wrong, the company ends up with diluted equity and poor returns. If done right, it could be the last card these firms play to stay listed and to finally get some attention from markets that have mostly forgotten them.

KULR, which has added to its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings since announcing plans to establish a BTC treasury strategy, said in a press release on July 8 that the $20 million credit facility is from Coinbase Credit and will be a multi-draw facility. The company intends to use the facility to purchase additional Bitcoin once Coinbase executes the offer. For a firm that previously committed to allocating up to 90% of its cash surplus toward acquiring Bitcoin as a treasury asset, securing this financing marks a renewed commitment to its BTC-first strategy. In a statement, KULR Technology Group CEO Michael Mo said: ‚ÄúThis marks KULR‚Äôs first bitcoin-backed credit facility, giving us access to non-dilutive capital at a competitive financing rate.

Ripple ( XRP ) token was trading at $2.30 on Tuesday, June 8, up by over 20% above its lowest level in June. XRP has several fundamentals that may drive its price higher in July. First, its ecosystem is performing well, with tokens like Coreum and Sologenic posting double-digit gains this week. Additionally, the total value locked on the XRP Ledger has risen to $62 million, while the newly launched XRP Ledger EVM has reached $52,000. Second, there are signs that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may finally break above its all-time high this month. Polymarket odds of a strong Bitcoin breakout have continued to rise, as the token has formed both a cup-and-handle and a bullish flag pattern.

As such, USDT holders in the US will likely be transitioned to other compliant tokens, such as USDC, PYUSD, and RLUSD. The probability that the SEC will approve multiple XRP ETFs later this year remains high at 85%.

Tokenized assets are gradually proving to be a viable alternative to traditional investment instruments. According to a July 8 report by CEX.io, tokenized gold is gaining traction compared to gold ETFs. The asset class has attracted $19 billion in trading volume this year, outpacing several widely held gold ETFs. Trading volume in popular gold ETFs and tokenized gold in the second quarter of 2025 | Source: CEX.io While tokenized gold still trails major ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), it has surpassed many smaller counterparts. The asset class now sees higher trading volume than SGOL, AAAU, IAUM, and OUNZ. Moreover, the growth in tokenized gold trading volume has significantly outpaced all gold ETFs so far this year. In the second quarter of 2025, volume in the asset class rose from $2.4 billion to $19.2 billion‚Äîan eightfold increase. This marks part of a broader trend, as tokenized gold has outperformed gold ETFs in trading volume growth for four consecutive quarters. According to CEX.io, this outperformance suggests that capital is shifting from gold ETFs to tokenized gold assets.

In a move that has stunned analysts and delighted investors, the Bitcoin price has not just risen, but absolutely exploded, soaring past the psychological and technical barrier of $100,000 to firmly establish itself above $109,000. This monumental achievement, confirmed by leading market monitoring platforms including Bitcoin World, marks a new chapter in the digital asset revolution. What does this incredible milestone mean for the future of finance, and how are investors reacting to this seismic shift? The Unprecedented Rise: BTC Breaches $109,000 According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has risen above $109,000 , trading at this astounding level on the Binance USDT market. This isn‚Äôt just a fleeting spike; it represents a significant consolidation of gains, indicating strong buying pressure and robust market confidence. For years, skeptics questioned Bitcoin‚Äôs viability, but this latest surge provides undeniable proof of its enduring power and growing mainstream acceptance. The move above $109,000 is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to the digital gold narrative gaining immense traction globally. The psychological impact of BTC reaching $109,000 cannot be overstated. For many long-term holders, this is a vindication of their belief in a decentralized future. For new entrants, it‚Äôs a compelling invitation to participate in what many believe is the greatest wealth transfer event of our generation. This milestone often triggers a positive feedback loop: rising prices generate more media attention, which attracts more new investors, further fueling demand. The ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù (FOMO) becomes a powerful force, drawing in capital from individuals and even smaller institutions who initially hesitated. This collective surge in optimism creates a self-reinforcing cycle, pushing the Bitcoin price to new, unimaginable heights. The narrative shifts from ‚Äòif‚Äô Bitcoin will succeed to ‚Äòhow high‚Äô it can go, embedding it deeper into the global financial consciousness. What Propelled This Cryptocurrency Market Triumph? Understanding the catalysts behind such a dramatic ascent is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet rewarding cryptocurrency market . Several factors appear to be converging, creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin‚Äôs parabolic rise: Institutional Inflow: Major financial institutions, once hesitant, are now aggressively allocating capital into Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, once theoretical, have become a reality, opening floodgates for traditional investors. Global Macroeconomic Factors: Persistent inflation fears and geopolitical uncertainties are driving investors towards hard assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Halving Hype and Scarcity: The inherent scarcity mechanism of Bitcoin, reinforced by its quadrennial halving events, continues to play a pivotal role. Reduced supply issuance combined with soaring demand creates immense upward pressure. Retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): As prices climb, retail investors, who were perhaps on the sidelines, are now rushing back into the market, fearing they will miss out on further gains. This self-fulfilling prophecy often fuels bull runs. The institutional embrace of Bitcoin has been a game-changer. What began as a trickle of interest from venture capitalists and tech-savvy hedge funds has now evolved into a veritable flood of capital from mainstream financial giants. The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets like the United States have democratized access for institutional investors, allowing them to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership or custodial risks. These ETFs provide a regulated, familiar wrapper that fits seamlessly into traditional investment portfolios, attracting pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries seeking diversification and inflation hedges. This unwavering institutional conviction is a foundational pillar supporting the current rally, indicating a deep-pocketed and sophisticated demand side that wasn‚Äôt present in earlier bull cycles. The confluence of these elements has transformed the landscape of the cryptocurrency market , demonstrating its resilience and burgeoning maturity. The Echo Effect: Crypto Price Surge Across the Board? When Bitcoin makes such a significant move, the entire ecosystem often follows. This massive crypto price surge in BTC has had a profound ripple effect across the altcoin market. While some altcoins might initially lag as capital flows into Bitcoin, a sustained BTC rally typically leads to an ‚Äúaltcoin season‚Äù where profits from Bitcoin are reinvested into other digital assets. We are observing: Altcoin Rally: Many major altcoins, particularly those with strong fundamentals and established ecosystems, are showing significant gains, albeit perhaps not as dramatic as Bitcoin‚Äôs. Increased Market Capitalization: The overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space is soaring, reflecting heightened investor confidence across the board. Renewed Developer Activity: A bullish market often stimulates innovation and development within blockchain projects, leading to new features, partnerships, and use cases. This widespread positive sentiment driven by the crypto price surge of Bitcoin is invigorating the entire digital asset landscape, attracting new participants and fostering further innovation. The increased liquidity and visibility brought by Bitcoin‚Äôs performance often cascade down to smaller cap assets, allowing them to gain traction and find their own footing within the expanding digital economy. Why the Binance USDT Market is Key to This Breakthrough The fact that BTC is trading at $109,000 on the Binance USDT market is particularly noteworthy. Binance, being the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serves as a bellwether for global crypto activity. The USDT (Tether) pairing is crucial because it represents a direct gateway for stablecoin liquidity into Bitcoin. This indicates: High Liquidity: The depth of the Binance USDT market ensures that large orders can be executed without significant price slippage, reflecting robust demand. Global Accessibility: USDT is a widely used stablecoin, making it accessible to traders worldwide, further solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs global reach. Confidence in Stablecoin Peg: The seamless trading against USDT suggests continued confidence in the stablecoin‚Äôs peg to the US dollar, which is vital for maintaining market stability and trust. The strength observed on the Binance USDT market underscores the global nature of this rally and the vast amount of capital flowing into Bitcoin from various sources. Binance‚Äôs robust infrastructure and extensive user base provide the necessary platform for such a significant price discovery, allowing millions of traders to participate in real-time. This high trading volume on a leading exchange like Binance further legitimizes the price point, signaling that it‚Äôs not merely a localized anomaly but a globally recognized valuation. Historical Precedents and Future Projections: Can the Bitcoin Price Sustain $109,000? Bitcoin‚Äôs journey has been marked by extreme volatility, but also by consistent upward trajectories over the long term. Previous bull runs, while impressive, rarely saw such rapid ascension to these heights. The $109,000 mark isn‚Äôt just a number; it‚Äôs a new frontier. What can we expect next? Consolidation or Further Ascent? After such a parabolic move, some degree of consolidation or a minor pullback is often healthy. However, if the underlying demand remains strong, further upside targets could be in play. New All-Time Highs: With $109,000 now a reality, the focus shifts to potential new all-time highs and the psychological resistance levels beyond. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: As Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization swells, so too will the attention from regulators worldwide. This could bring both challenges and opportunities for mainstream adoption. While predicting the exact future of the Bitcoin price is impossible, the current momentum suggests a strong foundation for continued growth, albeit with the inherent volatility that defines the crypto space. To put this milestone into perspective, let‚Äôs look at Bitcoin‚Äôs incredible journey: Milestone Approximate Date Significance $1 February 2011 First parity with USD, marking its initial recognition as a currency. $1,000 November 2013 First major bull run, gaining mainstream media attention and sparking early investor interest. $20,000 December 2017 Peak of the ICO boom, widespread retail frenzy, bringing crypto into household discussions. $69,000 November 2021 Previous all-time high, driven by growing institutional adoption and low interest rates in traditional markets. $109,000 Current Scenario Unprecedented new high, signaling a new era of adoption, maturity, and valuation, moving beyond previous cycles. Navigating the New Frontier: Actionable Insights for Investors For both seasoned investors and newcomers, the current market presents unique opportunities and challenges. Here are some actionable insights to consider in this new era of Bitcoin above $109,000: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrencies you consider. Evaluate whitepapers, use cases, and development teams. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Volatility is inherent, and corrections can be sharp. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk, spreading your investments over time rather than making a single large purchase. Long-Term Vision: Many seasoned Bitcoin investors advocate for a long-term ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù strategy, believing in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value over decades. This approach aims to ride out short-term fluctuations. Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading the charge, explore other promising projects within the cryptocurrency market to diversify your portfolio. This can help spread risk and potentially capture gains from emerging sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or Web3. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources like Bitcoin World, analyze market trends, and understand global economic indicators that might influence crypto prices. Education is your most powerful tool in this dynamic environment. For those considering entering or expanding their position in the Binance USDT market or other exchanges, a strategic approach is vital. Avoid emotional decisions driven by euphoria. Instead, focus on a well-thought-out investment plan. Consider setting clear profit targets and stop-loss levels. Research technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, but always remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. Explore different trading strategies, such as swing trading for short-term gains or long-term accumulation. Engage with reputable crypto communities for insights, but always cross-reference information with credible sources. Potential Challenges and What Could Derail the Rally Despite the euphoria, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the potential headwinds. The journey to and beyond $109,000 won‚Äôt be without its bumps: Regulatory Crackdowns: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Onerous regulations could dampen enthusiasm. The rapid ascent of the cryptocurrency market inevitably draws the attention of regulators worldwide. While some jurisdictions have embraced innovation, others remain cautious, citing concerns over consumer protection, illicit activities, and financial stability. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, security breaches on major exchanges, or major FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) campaigns could trigger significant sell-offs. Cybersecurity remains a critical concern for digital assets. Market Corrections: No asset moves up in a straight line forever. Healthy corrections are a natural part of bull markets, and investors should be prepared for them. A 20-30% pullback after such a significant crypto price surge would not be uncommon. Technological Setbacks: While unlikely for Bitcoin itself due to its robust and battle-tested network, issues within the broader blockchain ecosystem or a major vulnerability discovered in a widely used protocol could impact investor confidence across the board. The resilience of the Binance USDT market and other major exchanges will be tested during periods of high volatility, highlighting the importance of robust infrastructure and reliable trading platforms. Investors should always prioritize security, using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and cold storage solutions for significant holdings. Bitcoin‚Äôs Utility Beyond Price: The Foundation of Its Value While the price action dominates headlines, it‚Äôs essential to remember Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental utility. Beyond being a speculative asset, Bitcoin offers a censorship-resistant, permissionless, and global payment network. It serves as a digital safe haven for individuals in economically unstable regions, a tool for cross-border remittances with lower fees, and a decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems. Its underlying blockchain technology promises transparency and immutability, features that are increasingly valued in a world grappling with trust issues. The rising Bitcoin price simply amplifies the awareness of these intrinsic qualities, encouraging more developers to build on its ecosystem and more users to leverage its capabilities for real-world applications. This underlying utility is what provides long-term value, even amidst market fluctuations. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Gold The ascent of Bitcoin to $109,000 is not merely a statistical anomaly; it‚Äôs a profound statement about the shifting paradigms of global finance. It underscores Bitcoin‚Äôs growing role as a legitimate, powerful asset class, challenging traditional notions of money and value. This explosive surge, fueled by a confluence of institutional adoption, macroeconomic shifts, and unwavering community belief, signals a new era for digital gold. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, this milestone will undoubtedly be etched into its history as a defining moment. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, the message is clear: Bitcoin is here to stay, and its journey is far from over.

2025-07-08T16:10:55,"Strategy‚Äôs Astonishing Bitcoin Holdings: Now 11th Largest US Corporate Treasury","BitcoinWorld Strategy‚Äôs Astonishing Bitcoin Holdings: Now 11th Largest US Corporate Treasury Are you tracking the incredible shifts in corporate finance, especially when it comes to digital assets? If so, you‚Äôve likely heard of Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, and their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin. Their latest move solidifies their position as a true titan in the crypto space, with their Strategy Bitcoin holdings reaching unprecedented levels. Decoding Strategy‚Äôs Monumental Bitcoin Holdings The recent reports confirming Strategy‚Äôs colossal $65 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) holdings have sent ripples through both the cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. This isn‚Äôt just a large sum; it positions the software giant as the eleventh largest corporate treasury holder of BTC in the United States. For a company whose primary business isn‚Äôt finance or investment, this level of commitment to a volatile asset like Bitcoin is nothing short of remarkable. It speaks volumes about their long-term conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and its role as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This aggressive accumulation strategy has become a defining characteristic of Strategy‚Äôs financial approach, making their every move closely watched by investors and analysts alike. MicroStrategy BTC vs. Tech Giants: A Cash Comparison When we talk about corporate treasuries, it‚Äôs common to compare a company‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents. Interestingly, Strategy‚Äôs impressive MicroStrategy BTC holdings, valued at $65 billion, are now on par with the cash reserves of a tech behemoth like chipmaker NVIDIA, which boasts $66 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This direct comparison highlights a fascinating divergence in corporate treasury management. While NVIDIA maintains liquidity in traditional assets, Strategy has made a strategic decision to allocate a significant portion of its balance sheet to a decentralized, digital asset. This isn‚Äôt merely an investment; it‚Äôs a bold statement about their belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs future potential as a primary treasury reserve asset. It challenges the conventional wisdom of what constitutes a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô or ‚Äòprudent‚Äô corporate treasury, pushing the boundaries of financial innovation in the corporate world. The Evolving Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Landscape Strategy‚Äôs journey is a microcosm of a larger, evolving trend: the increasing adoption of a corporate Bitcoin treasury . What started as a niche strategy by a few pioneering companies is gradually gaining traction, albeit with cautious optimism from many traditional firms. The benefits for companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset are often cited as a hedge against fiat currency depreciation, a potential for significant capital appreciation, and an appeal to a new generation of investors. However, this path is not without its challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin, coupled with an uncertain and evolving regulatory landscape, presents significant risks that corporate treasurers must carefully navigate. Despite these hurdles, Strategy‚Äôs continued success and unwavering commitment serve as a powerful case study for other companies considering similar moves, influencing the broader market‚Äôs perception of digital assets. Strategy‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Expansion Adding another layer to their already aggressive stance, Strategy recently announced an astonishing $84 billion expansion of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy . This move effectively doubles their previous capital-raising target, signaling an even deeper commitment to accumulating the digital gold. This expansion isn‚Äôt just about buying more Bitcoin; it‚Äôs about leveraging various financial instruments, often through convertible notes or equity offerings, to fund these massive purchases. This innovative approach allows them to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin acquisitions, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of financial markets and a willingness to utilize every available tool to achieve their ambitious Bitcoin accumulation goals. It‚Äôs a strategy that has not only bolstered their balance sheet but also significantly impacted market sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. What This Means for US Corporate BTC Holders and Beyond Strategy‚Äôs actions are setting a precedent, not just for US corporate BTC holders but for companies globally. Their consistent accumulation and public advocacy for Bitcoin have undoubtedly influenced other corporations to at least consider, if not outright adopt, similar strategies. This institutional embrace of Bitcoin could lead to increased market stability, greater liquidity, and a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. For investors, Strategy‚Äôs moves offer a fascinating insight into a company with a clear, long-term vision for its treasury, distinct from traditional corporate finance. It suggests a future where digital assets play a more central role in corporate balance sheets, potentially accelerating the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Companies watching from the sidelines might find themselves compelled to re-evaluate their own treasury strategies as the digital asset landscape continues to mature. From its initial foray into Bitcoin to becoming one of the largest corporate holders, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has truly redefined what a corporate treasury can look like in the digital age. Their bold moves, substantial holdings, and ambitious acquisition strategy not only highlight their conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs future but also serve as a powerful case study for the evolving financial landscape. As the eleventh largest corporate treasury holder of BTC in the U.S., Strategy continues to be a bellwether for institutional adoption, proving that digital assets are increasingly becoming a cornerstone of modern corporate finance.

The most important data in the report was that CME‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) futures open position surpassed Binance and ranked first overall. CME Surpasses Binance in Bitcoin! The open interest size in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has surpassed that of Binance, which is positioned as the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, according to CoinGlass data. The report also stated that Binance's market share has been diluted, and the gap between OKX, Bybit, and Binance has widened. As of June 1, CMEBTC futures open interest reached 158,300 BTC ($16.5 billion), ranking first among all exchanges. With this figure, CME surpassed Binance's 118,700 BTC ($12.3 billion) level for the first time. ‚ÄúThis milestone comes as open interest in BTC derivatives surges from $60 billion to over $70 billion in the first half of 2025, driven by large ETF inflows and institutional demand. ‚ÄúSpecial attention should be paid to the growth in market share of the CME, a traditional exchange, in the futures market.‚Äù According to CoinGlass, this shift in these futures is seen as a signal that more institutions are entering the market.

Noting that ETH and altcoins have fallen by more than 50%, CoinGlass analysts predicted that in the short term, given the liquidity constraints at the macro level, it is unlikely that the weak momentum in the ETH and altcoin markets will reverse unless there are strong new ecosystem developments or technological breakthroughs.

2025-07-08T16:01:48,"From Bricks to Bitcoin: Murano‚Äôs $500M Treasury Play","Murano Global Investments, a Nasdaq-listed real estate developer and hotel owner, launched a record $500 million Bitcoin treasury program, among the largest non-tech corporate crypto moves to date. The plan: exchange real estate equity for reserves of BTC, taking a cue from MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific in employing digital currencies for balance sheet volatility. How Murano Is Funding Its Bitcoin Treasury Murano purchased a $500 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) with Yorkville Advisors whereby it has the ability to sell stock over time and invest proceeds into Bitcoin. In the first instance, 21 BTC (considerably more than $2.1 million at today's prices) was purchased, with a view to scaling up to the full $500 million depending on market conditions. In order to tap into more capital, Murano is exploring sale-leaseback deals and strategic asset disposals‚Äîbasically converting illiquid real estate value into liquid high-yielding BTC assets. While this move follows in the steps of MicroStrategy (which used debt and equity to buy over 200,000 BTC) and Semler Scientific, it marks a first for the hospitality and real estate sectors. Strategic Reasoning: Why Bitcoin, Why Now? Murano CEO Elias Sacal explained: ‚ÄùWe consider Bitcoin to be an innovative asset that not only provides long-term growth potential but is also a complement to our balance sheet versus inflation and systemic risk.‚Äù By joining the ‚ÄùBitcoin for Corporations‚Äù alliance (led by BTC Inc and Strategy of Michael Saylor), Murano signals its intent to be among the best industry crypto adoption leaders. The corporation also anticipates starting to accept BTC as payment for accommodations and starting Bitcoin reward schemes to attract crypto-beneficial travelers and diversify its revenue streams. Balance Sheet Impact: Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios Scenario BTC Price Path Potential Impact on Murano‚Äôs Treasury Bullish $110,000+ $500M equity could yield 4,500+ BTC Bearish $50,000 $500M equity yields 10,000 BTC, but value drops to $500M Volatile Swings between $50K‚Äì$110K Treasury fluctuates with market Murano‚Äôs move is designed to hedge against inflation and currency risk, but also exposes the company to Bitcoin‚Äôs notorious price swings. The phased approach‚Äîgradually converting equity and real estate value‚Äîlets the company adapt to market conditions and manage risk. MicroStrategy, Semler, and the New Corporate BTC Wave MicroStrategy was the initial corporate Bitcoin trailblazer to utilize bonds and share issues to accumulate the world's largest corporate BTC holding. As a tech-industry participant, MicroStrategy's highly leveraged accumulation process established the template for public companies interested in utilizing digital assets as a treasury reserve. Their procedure relied on elevated leverage and prominent chief executive officer, so Bitcoin featured centrally in their brand message and investor narrative. Semler Scientific was top story as a medical device company that switched to a Bitcoin treasury model in 2024. Semler's move, in contrast with MicroStrategy's tech roots, meant the move into Bitcoin was spreading beyond software and finance. The company's move to buy a significant portion of its balance sheet in BTC demonstrated that even traditionally fiscally conservative sectors could value digital assets as both a hedge and a growth opportunity. Murano is venturing into new territory as the first big real estate developer to use property equity and sale-leasebacks to fund a BTC war-chest. This strategy is new: rather than tapping pure debt or cash reserves, Murano is literally converting illiquid real estate worth into liquid holdings of Bitcoin. In the process, the company is hedging not just against currency risk and inflation but sending a message that the next leg of corporate adoption of Bitcoin is extending into traditional sectors like real estate and hospitality. Murano's action can set the stage for a broader set of industries to consider digital assets as a strategic balance sheet asset, taking the corporate BTC wave much further than its origins in the tech industry.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9849/from-bricks-to-bitcoin-murano-s-500-m-treasury-play,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T16:00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Bullish Flag Points to $120,000 in July, But This DeFi Altcoin Could Be the Real Bull Run Winner","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to tease a breakout from its bullish flag pattern, with some analysts setting sights on the $120,000 mark in July, many crypto investors are wondering what crypto to buy now for the next leg of the bull run. While BTC dominates the headlines, a lesser-known DeFi altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quietly building momentum, and it might just outpace the giants when the real rally begins. The 5th presale round of Mutuum Finance is already over 60% sold out. Over $11.9 million has been raised and 12,800 investors have been onboarding by the project. With growing whispers of a next crypto to explode, especially in the decentralized finance market, Mutuum Finance could turn out to be the most profitable name of 2025‚Äôs crypto comeback. Bitcoin Holds Above $108K as Bull Flag Signals Possible Move to $120K+ Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $108,108, comfortably holding above the $108,000‚Äì$110,000 support zone despite a recent pullback. Technical analysts note a classic bullish flag pattern, confirmed by respected traders, which suggests a breakout could propel BTC toward $120,000 by July if it clears key resistance around $109K‚Äì$110K. Additionally, strong fundamentals‚Äîsuch as shrinking exchange reserves, continued ETF inflows, and historically bullish seasonality, support the case for further upside. While BTC remains the market leader, some investors are diversifying into early-stage, high-upside projects like Mutuum Finance, currently gaining attention during its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Over 60% Sold Out in Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 is underway and gaining amazing momentum. Already over 12,800 investors have joined the presale and raised $11.9 million, a clear indicator of growing hype. Since Phase 5 already reached 60%, price increases are imminent. Buying now guarantees investors the minimum cost for the maximum ROI. Mutuum Finance Launches $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance in its security and transparency emphasis has even introduced its formal Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK with a reward value of 50,000 USDT. The reward is offered in four parts, critical, major, minor and low where there is reward for all types of vulnerability. This is yet another aspect that reflects the proactive approach of Mutuum towards development of trust in terms of strong infrastructure and affirmative security. Moreover, the project is also creating an Ethereum-based full-collateralized stablecoin. The asset will be stable at all times during market downturns compared to algorithmic stablecoins that tend to depeg when there is a volatile market. The Mutuum Finance $100,000 Giveaway The project is already certified by CertiK and is paving the way for massive adoption. To put cherry on top, the platform is running a $100,000 giveaway contest, and 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. While Bitcoin eyes a potential breakout to $120,000 in July, early investors are already positioning themselves in what could be the true bull run winner, Mutuum Finance. With over $11.9 million raised, more than 12,800 investors onboarded, and Phase 5 of the presale already 60% sold out, Mutuum is rapidly gaining momentum.

2025-07-08T15:53:45,"VRTX price slides 40% as Vertex Protocol phases out native token, abandons Arbitrum","The cryptocurrency market remained bullish on Tuesday, with Bitcoin above $108,000 after surging 1.33% in the last 24 hours. While most altcoins targeted rebounds, Vertex Protocol‚Äôs native coin exhibited massive bearishness, driven by the ongoing ecosystem developments. The hybrid decentralized exchange has confirmed that it will shut down its platform on Arbitrum and move to Kraken-backed L2 Ink. Vertex üèî @vertex_protocol ¬∑ Follow A New Chapter ‚Äì Vertex Joins the Ink Foundation!We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that Vertex has entered an agreement to join @inkonchain , bringing our core infrastructure and team to the Ink ecosystem.This marks a major milestone for both Vertex and Ink as we power the next 7:39 pm ¬∑ 8 Jul 2025 47 Reply Copy link Read 18 replies Meanwhile, this is more than a migration to another blockchain. The protocol is hitting the reset button. That includes retiring native VRTX, sunsetting existing products, and relaunching with an advanced infrastructure. While the overhaul could be a strategic move for long-term growth, native token VRTX saw a massive dip following the announcement. VRTX hovers at $0.006573 after a substantial 41% dip minutes after Vertex Protocol‚Äôs announcement. Vertex migrates from Arbitrum to Ink Vertex Protocol launched on Arbitrum in 2023, aiming to be a go-to platform for money markets and perpetual trading. However, the project has failed to gain grounds in the highly competitive DeFi sector. That‚Äôs despite massive support from investors during its initial fundraising. Arbitrum has also struggled to keep pace, with 100% of holders of its native ARB experiencing losses at one time . Now, Vertex Protocol is abandoning Arbitrum. It is turning to the new Ink, a new Kraken-incubated L2 network. The decision follows a strategic acquisition, which will see the Ink Foundation taking over Vertex‚Äôs technology, including lending systems, core trading functionalities, and an order book engine. Ink Foundation commented: As part of the transition, Vertex will sunset its current EVM deployments. A new version of the DEX will launch exclusively on the Ink Layer-2, purpose-built for speed, capital efficiency, and on-chain composability. This brings Vertex‚Äôs synchronous order book engine and perpetual tech directly into Ink‚Äôs DeFi stack. However, Ink Foundation will absorb Vertex‚Äôs engineering team. The decision to move from Arbitrum aims to bolster the protocol‚Äôs growth and survival. Vertex CEO Darius Tabai highlighted that increased competition in the perp sector prompted the migration. He believes Ink‚Äôs goal of its layer-2 encompassing a complete vertical integration of multiple applications aligns with Vertex‚Äôs growth ambitions. Vertex phases out VRTX token The most striking change in this migration is retiring the native VRTX. Meanwhile, the project will compensate holders with INK airdrop. It will determine eligibility today, July 8, after taking a snapshot. The altcoin has struggled, losing around 98% since its November 2023 debut. Its market cap has plummeted from early 2024 levels of $77 million to press time‚Äôs $3.47 million. VRTX trades at 0.006573 after losing 41% on its daily price chart. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its trading volume has increased by nearly 24%, possibly reflecting speculative undertakings as traders capitalize on the prevailing volatility. VRTX exhibits a weak structure, suggesting more price dips in the coming sessions.

2025-07-08T15:49:56,"CRO rallied by over 18% on the news of ETF inclusion","The price of Cronos (CRO) went vertical after the asset was mentioned in the new ETF filing portfolio. Truth Social, Trump‚Äôs media company, filed for a new blue chip ETF, combining BTC, ETH, XRP, and CRO. CRO rallied by over 18% on the news of its inclusion in the upcoming ETF by Truth Social. It turned into the top trending token during the relatively slow summer market. CRO became the hottest token for the day, rallying to a one-week high with over 18% in daily gains. | Source: Coingecko The Trump media company announced a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a new Blue Chip ETF. The filing arrives just days after Truth Social announced it started the process for its first ETF, combining BTC and ETH. The actual launch of the ETF depends on regulatory approval, and we are still awaiting a 19b-4 filing with the SEC. The ETF will eventually start trading on NYSE Arca, sponsored by Yorkville America Digital. CRO rises on news of custody service for the ETF The CRO token, native to the Crypto.com platform, rallied by over 15% within hours to trade at $0.094, a one-week peak. CRO rallied after months of sideways trading based on its inclusion in the ETF. The asset has relatively niche markets, lacking a Binance listing. Instead, CRO relies on Upbit and Bitget for the bulk of its trading volumes. CRO will have a 5% weight in the ETF, where BTC will carry 70% of the value, with 15% for ETH, 8$ for SOL, and only 2% for XRP. Despite this, the Crypto.com ecosystem will be key for the new blue-chip fund. SOL and XRP did not react to the news, as their markets were much more liquid. The CRO market is also an anomaly, as the token relies on the Korean won for over 47% of its trading activity. Over 25% of CRO trading is against the US dollar, with another 22% against USDT. In addition to using CRO as part of the ETF basket, Crypto.com would serve as a custodian for all crypto assets. With this move, Truth Social breaks the usual format of ETF custody, which often relies on the Coinbase infrastructure of cold wallets. The platform, which offers a mix of services, including a wallet, payment cards, Web3 services, trading, and even stock investments, will be part of the ETF strategy. The platform will be the prime execution agent for crypto trades, as well as a staking and liquidity provider. Truth Social partnered with Cronos back in March Trump Media Group announced its partnership with Cronos and the Crypto.com ecosystem back in March. The social media company mentioned plans for launching an ETF, though the role of Crypto.com has only become clearer. The choice of CRO as an ETF asset follows the moves of World Liberty Fi to partner with relatively old crypto projects. Cronos and Crypto.com raised doubts after deciding to re-issue 70% of the supply, despite the previous claims that the tokens would be burned forever. Trump‚Äôs crypto company, World Liberty Fi, does not own any CRO in its portfolio, as it focuses mostly on the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the token‚Äôs rapid market reaction raised skepticism and doubts about potential insider trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-08T15:49:02,"Is $1 Still Possible for Dogecoin (DOGE)? Experts Tip a Newcomer With Real-World Utility to Outperform","The post Is $1 Still Possible for Dogecoin (DOGE)? Experts Tip a Newcomer With Real-World Utility to Outperform appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) blasted from $0.166 to $0.173 on July 6, its best hourly jump in weeks. As fans cheer a possible march back to the one-dollar line, analysts are also whispering about Remittix (RTX) , a little-known payments token now racing toward a key funding goal. Both coins offer upside, but the ways they plan to get there could not be more different. Whale Wave Pushes DOGE Toward Breakout Source: tradingview Fresh on-chain data shows that giant wallets holding one to one-hundred million DOGE scooped up millions of coins during the spike, while smaller traders trimmed positions. This transfer of supply tightens the float and often leads to stronger price swings later. Technically, DOGE is coiling inside a falling-wedge pattern, a setup that can explode when volume returns. A clean daily close above $0.175 would open a sprint to $0.25, the first checkpoint on any trip to a dollar. Drop under $0.16, however, and the bullish script unravels fast. Federal Reserve Hopes Lift Sentiment Dogecoin‚Äôs pop isn‚Äôt happening in a vacuum. U.S. officials just added three extra weeks to tariff talks, cooling global trade worries. Traders also expect next week‚Äôs consumer-price report to show softer inflation. If that happens, the Federal Reserve could hint at rate cuts, giving risk assets like crypto more room to run. Bitcoin already hovers near $110,000; a breakout there usually drags DOGE along for the ride. A hotter inflation print, though, could send all boats lower, trapping meme-coin bulls mid-wedge. Remittix: Turning Crypto Into Cash in Seconds While DOGE leans on macro news and whale wallets, Remittix focuses on something far more practical: moving money. Its coming PayFi wallet, slated for release later this year, will let anyone swap Bitcoin, Ether or XRP into local bank deposits in about ten seconds. There are no weekend delays, no hidden exchange spreads and transfer fees are just fractions of a cent. Every single swap permanently burns a slice of RTX, shrinking supply as the network grows. That built-in scarcity is attracting serious notice: over $16 million has already been raised at $0.0811 per token and the team is sprinting toward an $18 million soft-cap finish. During this final push, new supporters can still claim a 50 percent bonus allocation, making today‚Äôs effective entry roughly five cents. Beyond the numbers, two global payout corridors one aimed at Southeast Asia, another at Latin America are lined up for launch right after the wallet goes live. If even a sliver of the $190-trillion global payments market flows through Remittix, daily burns will tighten circulation quickly, giving long-term holders an automatic boost without hype tweets or mascot memes. Conclusion: Two Very Different Moonshots Dogecoin‚Äôs path to $1 depends on continued whale buying and a string of friendly macro headlines. If those pieces stay in place, the meme king could rediscover its magic. Remittix, on the other hand, offers a real-world service that slashes costs and time for everyday payments and rewards token holders every time someone clicks ‚ÄúSend.‚Äù For investors weighing hype against hard utility, RTX may prove the quieter but smarter play for 2025 and beyond.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake‚Äôs Latest Track‚ÄîDetails According to trading data, its price shot from under $10 to a whopping $80 within hours, pushing its fully diluted valuation to nearly $75 billion. But by July 2025, TRUMP had tumbled back to $8.60, a 90% drop from its peak. Its circulating market cap now sits around $1.70 billion, with a fully diluted value of about $8.60 billion. Cross Chain Push Into Tron Based on reports from the project‚Äôs official X account, TRUMP plans its first expansion beyond Solana by launching on the Tron blockchain. This move is designed to tap Tron‚Äôs large user base and faster transaction speeds. Tron boasts over 100‚ÄØmillion accounts and sub‚Äësecond confirmations, which the TRUMP team believes could fuel a fresh wave of buyers and traders. $TRUMP on #TRON is coming. Stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/S5WfV8APvU ‚Äî TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) July 7, 2025 Volatile Price Swings Define TRUMP TRUMP‚Äôs rollercoaster debut underlines extreme volatility. After the initial frenzy in January, the coin‚Äôs price plummeted by 88% from $80 to $8.60. That slide erased roughly $65 billion in valuation. Today‚Äôs price reflects speculative trading rather than any long‚Äëterm adoption. Investors who rode the peak saw massive gains briefly, then steep losses just as quickly. Justin Sun‚Äôs Big Stake On May 20, 2025, Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he is TRUMP‚Äôs largest holder. He reportedly owns nearly $19 million worth of tokens after a $75 million investment in Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial platform. Sun‚Äôs position comes with perks. He won a ‚Äúprivate dinner‚Äù alongside the top 220 token holders, securing a seat at US President Donald Trump‚Äôs Virginia golf club. Critics say that kind of setup blurs the line between crypto hype and pay‚Äëto‚Äëplay politics. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Central Control Raises Warnings Two Trump‚Äëaffiliated companies, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, control 80% of TRUMP‚Äôs token supply.

That level of centralization runs counter to crypto‚Äôs promise of open and fair systems. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley have called for new rules to curb how politicians and their allies can launch or endorse digital coins. They argue that projects like TRUMP could be used for personal gain or campaign boosts, creating a need for clearer boundaries. Traders And Regulators Brace For Tron Launch As TRUMP eyes a Tron debut, traders and regulators alike will watch closely. The move could spark a fresh surge in trading volume. Yet the same factors that drove its initial spike‚Äîviral hype, insider perks, and a heavy token concentration‚Äîcould just as easily lead to another steep plunge.

According to a report from Dawn , the federal cabinet has approved the creation of PVARA as an independent regulator for licensing, monitoring, and supervising virtual asset service providers, in alignment with the Financial Action Task Force guidelines. Notably, the regulatory framework emerged after Pakistan‚Äôs ambitious digital transformation agenda gained momentum throughout 2025.

IMF Resistance Challenges Power Allocation Plans Recently, the International Monetary Fund rejected Pakistan‚Äôs proposal to offer subsidized electricity tariffs for crypto mining operations , warning the plan could strain the power sector. The Pakistan government is still engaged with international institutions to refine its proposal to offer subsidised electricity tariffs for crypto mining, after IMF rejected its proposal. #IMF #Pakistan #BitcoinMining https://t.co/DOIm2pNGV7 ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan confirmed that the IMF has expressed concerns about market distortions and the effects on resource distribution. The Fund questioned the legality of cryptocurrency mining in Pakistan and the additional strain it would put on the already burdened power grid. The IMF noted Pakistan failed to consult the agency ahead of the 2,000MW allocation announcement, seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. Pakistan faces chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, with the IMF warning about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs. Officials involved in negotiations expressed concerns about ‚Äú further tough talks ‚Äù as the economic team faces tough questions over the initiative. Despite IMF resistance, Pakistan continues to pursue its crypto ambitions through diplomatic channels. U.S. President Trump expressed keen interest in cryptocurrency during a White House lunch with Pakistan Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, discussing economic development and emerging technologies. PVARA will oversee public protection mechanisms, anti-money laundering protocols, and cyber risk mitigation across all virtual asset transactions.
