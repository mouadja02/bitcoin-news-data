2025-07-07T21:56:58,"Russia Wants to Eliminate Tax Dodgers in Bitcoin Mining: Report","According to a local newspaper, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Federal Tax Service have compiled a “registry” that has been sent to regions with increased mining activity. An official of the Finance Ministry, Ivan Chebeskov, stated that despite certain laws being adopted, only 30% of miners had signed the official register of the Federal Tax Service since the end of 2024. A Step Forward In Regulation Local newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the country is actively working on developing more stringent legislation to reduce the improper use of the country’s energy grid. The previously introduced framework requires individuals and businesses interested in mining to register with the Federal Tax Service. Citizens can mine up to 6,000 kWh per month without entrepreneur status, but must register as such if they exceed the limit. In an interview with the paper, Petr Konyushenko, the Deputy Energy Minister, noted that this is a step in the right direction for taxation and legalization (translated in English by Google): “The creation of such a register will allow for the precise identification of consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary for applying special regulation and taxation to them.” Two laws were signed by Putin in late 2024, one of which outlines key terms, such as mining and pools, and imposes requirements for registration and reporting for businesses. It also prohibits foreign nationals from mining in Russia while granting the government the right to restrict mining in specific areas. The second law outlines the rules governing the circulation of digital currency and establishes regulations for mining activities . Despite these legislations being signed into law, no clear regulations have been introduced, according to the chief analyst of local exchange BestChange, Nikita Zuborev: “The full legalization of mining has not happened. Instead, it can be said that some norms have been established by law that simplifies control over industrial mining,” Current Regulatory Landscape In Russia Due to the conflict with Ukraine that began in early 2022, the country has been facing serious sanctions from the European Union. As a consequence, some well-known exchanges, such as Deribit, had to cease providing their services to nationals unless certain specific requirements were met. Some of these requirements include Russian citizens with dual citizenship to other EEA countries, Switzerland, or individuals who permanently reside in either of these regions. Native companies were completely exempt from using the exchange. A ban was also enforced for the winter months, restricting mining in several regions to avoid blackouts. These restrictions vary between areas controlled by Russia and Ukraine and have different timeframes, from as early as March this year to as late as March 3031. Some will remain on an annual basis as well. The Russian power company PAO Rosseti has begun exploring the hosting of mining infrastructure by utilizing the country’s idle power. Although cryptocurrency mining is deemed legal, trading of them remains illegal as of this moment. CryptoPotato has previously reported that, despite these hurdles, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is seeing notable adoption from institutions.

The trend of investment inflows into crypto funds has continued for the twelfth consecutive week since April. The trading volume for the reporting period was $16.3 billion, remaining roughly in line with the average weekly figure since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin-based investment products attracted $790 million in early July, which is less than the previous three weeks when inflows averaged $1.5 billion.

On average, over the past seven days, inflows amounted to 1.6% of AUM, significantly higher than Bitcoin's 0.8%. According to the report's authors, this indicates a noticeable shift in investor sentiment in favor of the second-largest cryptocurrency. From June 28 to July 4, investments in Solana and Sui-related instruments totaled $21.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Analysts noted that Solana saw its highest investment inflows in the past 69 weeks.

This means that they closely follow BTC's movements.” Wedson also said that 1,400 altcoins that were active in the market no longer exist. The analyst, who interpreted this situation as a positive development, said, “This is excellent news. Because only the most durable projects survive. This makes the market stronger. The more secure, fast and solving a real problem a crypto project is, the more valuable it is.” Related News: BREAKING: SEC Issues Update on Fidelity Solana Spot ETF Alphractal, an analytics company led by Joao Wedson, announced that Bitcoin has entered a new phase of discovery in terms of on-chain metrics.

Meccanica di Gioco della Chicken Road Strategie per Vincere Comunità e Interazioni di Gioco Le Competenze Sociali nel Gioco Eventi e Tornei Esperienza Emotiva nel Gioco Crescita Personale attraverso il Gioco Il Gioco e le Relazioni Conclusione Scopri la sfida avvincente della tua strategia sulla Chicken Road senza farti abbagliare! La sfida della Chicken Road è un gioco che ha catturato l’attenzione degli appassionati di sfide e strategie. Questo gioco non riguarda solo l’abilità ma anche la pianificazione e la prudenza. Giocando per sopravvivere nel pericoloso mondo delle cucine ardenti, i giocatori si trovano a saltare da un forno all’altro senza farsi ‘arrostire’. Ciò crea un’atmosfera di suspense che rende ogni partita unica e avvincente. Ogni salto rappresenta una decisione strategica, perché più si avanza, maggiore è il rischio e la ricompensa. Alla base di questo gioco c’è una meccanica semplice: controllare una gallina che cerca di attraversare una serie di forni, evitando di essere colpita da fiamme o di cadere in trappole ardenti. Con ogni forno superato, la posta in gioco aumenta, incoraggiando i giocatori a pressarsi ulteriormente e a spingere i propri limiti. In questo articolo approfondiremo i vari aspetti della Chicken Road, dalla sua meccanica di gioco alle strategie per vincere, fino agli aspetti emotivi che apporta ai giocatori. Comprendere la Chicken Road significa esplorare non solo le regole fondamentali, ma anche le tecniche più avanzate per massimizzare le possibilità di successo. Esamineremo anche gli aspetti sociali del gioco, come la comunità di giocatori e le interazioni che si sviluppano durante le sessioni di gioco. Inoltre, analizzeremo quanto questa esperienza possa influenzare la personalità e il modo in cui affrontiamo le sfide nella vita quotidiana. Iniziamo quindi questo viaggio esplorativo attraverso la Chicken Road, e prepariamoci a scoprire i segreti e le strategie che possono trasformare un semplice gioco in un’avventura memorabile! Meccanica di Gioco della Chicken Road La meccanica di Chicken Road è semplice, ma richiede un alto livello di attenzione e strategia. I giocatori controllano una gallina che cerca di saltare da un forno all’altro. Ogni forno è un potenziale ostacolo, con fiamme che possono ‘arrostire’ la gallina se non si salta al momento giusto. La sfida principale consiste nel calcolare il momento esatto per saltare e decidere se rischiare di andare verso forni più pericolosi per guadagni maggiori. Ogni salto non è solo una questione di riflessi ma implica anche una scelta strategica che può influenzare il risultato finale della partita. I giocatori devono considerare il loro progresso e l’aumento della posta in gioco ogni volta che riescono a superare un forno. Inizialmente, il gioco può sembrare semplice, ma man mano che si avanza, le fiamme diventano più aggressive e le sfide si moltiplicano. FornoRischioRicompensa Forno 1 Basso 10x Forno 2 Medio 20x Forno 3 Alto 30x Il successo nella Chicken Road dipende anche dall’acquisizione di esperienza. Con ogni partita, i giocatori imparano a riconoscere i modelli e a fare previsioni più accurate, migliorando così le loro prestazioni. È comune che i neofiti subiscano numerosi fallimenti prima di padroneggiare la tecnica di salto perfetta. L’importante è mantenere la calma e imparare dai propri errori per sviluppare abilità migliori. Strategie per Vincere Per ottenere successo nella Chicken Road, i giocatori devono sviluppare strategie solide. Una delle chiavi è conoscere i propri limiti e non lasciarsi prendere dal panico. Avere una buona strategia implica fare scelte ponderate su quando rischiare e quando giocare in modo più conservativo. Analizzare il comportamento delle fiamme e adattare il proprio stile di gioco è vitale. Un altro punto cruciale è l’osservazione: i giocatori esperti tendono a studiare attentamente il comportamento degli avversari. Questo non solo aiuta a prevedere le mosse altrui, ma offre anche spunti su nuove strategie. Imparare a gestire la pressione e a non essere sopraffatti dalle emozioni è fondamentale per raggiungere traguardi più elevati. Pianifica ogni salto con attenzione. Non rischiare troppo, specialmente all’inizio. Osserva i movimenti degli avversari. Aggiusta la tua strategia in base al progresso. Usa il tuo istinto per valutare il rischio. Infine, è importante adattare le proprie strategie nel tempo. Con l’evoluzione del gioco, le meccaniche possono cambiare, rendendo necessarie nuove approcci. Partecipare a forum e comunità online può fornire nuove idee e strategie che possono essere applicate per migliorare le performance nel gioco. Comunità e Interazioni di Gioco Un aspetto molto interessante della Chicken Road è la comunità di giocatori che si è formata attorno a questo gioco. Condividere esperienze, strategia e approcci diversi arricchisce notevolmente l’esperienza. Giocare con altri permette anche di osservare nuove tecniche e di imparare da coloro che hanno più esperienza. Inoltre, molte piattaforme offrono spazi di discussione dove i giocatori possono scambiarsi suggerimenti e trucchi. Questi forum diventano un luogo dove si celebra non solo il gioco, ma anche il senso di appartenenza a una comunità unita dalla passione per la Chicken Road. Le interazioni sociali possono migliorare l’esperienza di gioco, portando a legami più forti e a migliori prestazioni individuali.

2025-07-07T20:30:38,"Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know","The liquidity engine that has supported risk assets, including Bitcoin, since the beginning of 2025 is now shifting into reverse. According to macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets), the six-month upswing in Federal Reserve liquidity has ended, and a potentially destabilizing wave of debt issuance by the US Treasury is about to begin. In a post published on X late Sunday, Tomas warned: “ Federal Reserve Liquidity set to fall… The Fed liquidity upswing that began on January 1 2025 is now over.” Bitcoin Enters Danger Zone The catalyst behind this reversal is the recent $5 trillion debt ceiling increase passed by Congress last week. That legislative decision gives the Treasury Department the green light to aggressively rebuild its cash balance at the Federal Reserve—known as the Treasury General Account (TGA)—which had been intentionally drained to inject liquidity into the system during the first half of the year. “The US Government had previously been draining the Treasury General Account (liquidity injection). But a new debt ceiling agreement was reached last week ($5 trillion raise). This means the Government will start to flood the market with new debt to ‘refill’ the TGA (liquidity drain),” Tomas wrote. He emphasized that the refill target is currently set at $850 billion, up from recent levels around $350 billion, implying roughly $500 billion in liquidity will be removed from the system in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means The implications for Bitcoin are stark. Risk assets have historically benefited from rising dollar liquidity—particularly in the context of elevated ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and a weakening US dollar. But that backdrop is now shifting. As Tomas put it, “All else being equal, this TGA rebuild process should be bullish for the US dollar.” A strengthening dollar, when coupled with falling bank reserves, is generally a bearish environment for Bitcoin. The pressure on liquidity won’t necessarily come all at once, but the mechanics are clear. Treasury will issue large volumes of new short-term debt—primarily T-bills—to finance the TGA refill. This issuance will compete with other dollar-denominated assets for funding, draining cash out of banks and money markets. Tomas notes that this dynamic could be softened if money market funds rotate their cash out of the Fed’s Overnight Reverse Repo Facility, which still holds about $214 billion. “It’s possible that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could lower the target level, meaning less of a refill,” he adds. “I’d expect we may see a lot of T-bill issuance, which could tempt some of the remaining $214bn left in the Reverse Repo to leave the facility (liquidity injection) and lessen any negative impact of the TGA refill.” Still, even with some reallocation from RRP, Tomas expects the overall effect to reduce reserve balances—bank reserves as a percentage of GDP are likely to fall below 10%, he estimates. While this is not as dire as the 7% level reached in 2019 (which triggered the repo crisis), it represents a sharp tightening compared to the first half of this year. “There could be some funding stress around the end of September (end-of-quarter),” Tomas cautioned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap—Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Bitcoin’s performance has coincided with the exact window Tomas outlines as a liquidity upswing. As documented, Bitcoin’s price has closely tracked the direction of aggregate G5 central bank balance sheets and the level of US bank reserves. When those reserves shrink—especially in the face of stronger Treasury issuance and a rebounding dollar—Bitcoin has historically struggled to sustain upside momentum. This concern is compounded by Tomas’s warning that speculative short positioning against the dollar has reached extremes. “Back in January, I was shouting about a fall in the dollar. Now everybody and their mothers are bearish on the dollar, and positioning is massively short across the board. It’s time for, at the very least, an upward correction/consolidation for the US dollar, in my opinion.” Such a reversal in the dollar would mark a critical macro headwind for Bitcoin. The 90-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin and the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains firmly negative. In environments where the dollar strengthens—especially when driven by tightening liquidity—Bitcoin has rarely outperformed. The next several weeks will be critical. If Treasury proceeds with aggressive issuance and market participants demand higher yields, liquidity could tighten faster than anticipated. While Tomas does leave open the possibility that Secretary Bessent may adjust the TGA target downward, the baseline scenario remains a $500 billion net liquidity drain—directly reversing the conditions that allowed Bitcoin to surge. At press time, BTC traded at $108,148.

2025-07-07T20:30:08,"What is the Latest Situation for Bitcoin (BTC)? Where Are the Option Data Pointing?","Cryptocurrency analysis company QCP Capital published an important analysis of Bitcoin's performance and the general mood in the market last weekend in its latest evaluation report. Bitcoin held its price over the long holiday weekend before reaching a new all-time weekly close, reaching as high as $109,700 during low-volume trading on Sunday, according to the report. This rise came despite the transfer of around $8.5 billion worth of BTC by eight old Bitcoin wallets that went into action on Saturday. It was reported that $4.3 billion worth of BTC was sold in the middle of the week, and the price was around $108,000 at the time. QCP Capital said that these large-scale “bearish” transactions were largely ignored by the market, while “bullish” scenarios found strong buyers. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market It was stated that TON's “Golden Visa” rumors, which were denied by the United Arab Emirates authorities, and Elon Musk's criticism of fiat money, along with his announcement of a new political formation called “The American Party”, also contributed to the rise in the market. QCP Capital also noted that large investors such as Metaplanet and Strategy continued to make strategic purchases throughout the weekend. However, due to new sell orders from these large wallets, the price could get stuck in the current range and implied volatility could drop to record lows. However, it is stated that a new increase in volatility may occur if the $ 110,000 resistance level is clearly broken. It is observed that institutional investors are showing interest in September term $ 130,000 call options and continue to maintain $ 115,000/140,000 call spread positions. According to QCP Capital, this situation points to a structurally optimistic picture for the third quarter of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T20:10:00,"ApeCoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will APE recover?","Key takeaways: Our ApeCoin price predictions anticipate a high of $1.59 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6053 Market cap $456M Trading volume $21.02 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6177 24-hour low $0.6028 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.08% 50-day SMA $0.6589 200-day SMA $0.6789 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (July 7), APE’s price dropped by 1.08% in one week and dropped by 0.69% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.60. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume fell by 41.26% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. It started recovering last month as it rose above $0.65. The MACD histogram shows that the price is experiencing little momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show little price volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s bear run as it dropped below $0.65. It registered continuous bearish candles in the last 12 hours. At current levels, it registers little volatility and momentum.

APE price analysis shows the market had little momentum in the last few days. It should move sideways in the short term. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction July 2025 The APE July price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.79, with an average of $0.69.

The bank is revamping its private banking arm in preparation to serve its richest customers who are looking to spread their money around the world to protect their wealth, the Wall Street Journal reports . JPMorgan’s service requires a minimum balance of $10 million from clients and caters to investors who no longer want all of their wealth to just sit in their main country of residence. In addition, investors are reportedly becoming more concerned about the war in the Middle East, as well as America’s trade war against other markets, prompting a migration of wealth. Says Mary Erdoes, head of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management unit, “Our clients have always been multi-jurisdictional but now their assets are too, and that’s becoming ever more so with how the world is changing.” JPMorgan recently appointed David Frame to head the private bank, which is a new role within the firm. Frame noted that sports teams are one of the high-flying investments that the super rich are currently looking to park their wealth, and when Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck asked JPMorgan to find buyers for the NBA team, the bank contacted roughly 186 different clients around the world to solicit interest. “The wealthier you get, the more you feel you’re a citizen of the world… If that doesn’t happen with the first generation of a family, it starts to happen with the second and the third. There are borders for sports teams, but it doesn’t feel that way when it comes to the wealthy who are investing in them.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bloomberg reports that the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) uses software, subpoenas and spreadsheets to identify and go after criminals behind fraudulent crypto scams, including pig butchering operations that offer fake investments to victims. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the GIOC has already seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the last 10 years.

2025-07-07T19:53:52,"Calamos unveils ‘Protected Bitcoin’ strategy for institutional investors","Investment firm Calamos has unveiled a new investment strategy aimed at limiting Bitcoin’s downside potential. Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming increasingly attractive to institutions, but many still view it as too risky. In response, on June 7, global investment firm Calamos introduced its “protected Bitcoin” strategy , designed to limit both the downside and the upside of Bitcoin exposure. The firm noted that although Bitcoin has reached a $2 trillion valuation, institutional investors remain concerned about its volatility. As a result, most allocate just 1–2% of their portfolios to BTC to avoid outsized risk exposure. Calamos has structured its strategy to offer some upside participation while managing risk by combining Bitcoin futures with U.S. Treasuries. Specifically, the firm purchases zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds maturing at the end of the year. You might also like: Over a third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is in instituitional hands: report Calamos pairs treasuries with Bitcoin These Treasuries act as a protective floor in predefined worst-case scenarios, limiting losses to 0%, 10%, or 20%, depending on the risk tier. Simultaneously, Calamos buys call options on the Bitcoin Index to capture potential gains. To fund these, the firm also sells out-of-the-money call options, effectively capping the upside between 25% and 60%. Calamos risk-reward tiers | Source: Calamos Each risk-return tier is benchmarked to familiar asset classes. The 100% protected Bitcoin tier mirrors the risk profile of Treasuries, offering capital preservation with virtually no downside risk. The second tier is comparable to gold or alternative assets, while the third tier aligns with equities in terms of expected returns and volatility. Calamos believes this structured approach could enhance Bitcoin’s appeal relative to traditional assets. However, timing remains critical. Traders must hold positions to maturity to benefit from the downside protection; early exits could result in loss of principal. While rare, another risk includes potential sovereign debt default, which the firm notes is highly unlikely.

They can make money with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake method by locking up ETH to support network security. The returns are usually between 4% and 6.5% per year. This is a great option for traditional mining, which needs a lot of money. However, while Bitcoin miners can use different hedging techniques, staking Ethereum is directly exposed to changes in the price of Ethereum on the market. A big drop in the value of Ethereum could be very bad for the company’s finances, even if the staking rates are high. This method increases both the possible gains and the risks. Meanwhile, different markets initially had different reactions to Bit Digital’s news. The company’s stock price went down and hit a low point of $1.86. It then started to rise again after the company announced its strategy shift and sold 150 million shares. Ethereum has turned into a hot commodity for governments too’ According to recent reports, the United States government has deposited $218k ETH to Coinbase. According to analysts, the change in price projects investors’ uncertainty on whether the shift will work and if it will be financially viable in the long run. Ethereum vs Bitcoin mining Bit Digital’s move wasn’t entirely unexpected given the more challenging environment Bitcoin miners have experienced since last year’s halving. The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This reduction has led to significant declines in revenue and gross profits for miners. According to JPMorgan, average mining revenues have dropped by 46% since the halving, and gross profits have fallen by 57%. Also, BTC mining burns through electricity, and the miner must constantly upgrade hardware. On the other hand, Ethereum staking gives you steady returns with way less overhead. BTCS CEO Charles Allen states, “Ethereum staking, by contrast, offers cleaner economics — yield without the expensive energy costs and rapidly depreciating assets.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bit-digital-goes-full-on-eth-dumps-btc-stash/,"ETH|BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|BTC|ETH",cryptocompare

In addition to the approximately $172 million in proceeds from the IPO, the company sold approximately $28 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and purchased a total of $192.9 million worth of Ethereum (ETH). With these purchases, Bit Digital’s ETH holdings reached $254.8 million. According to the company's press release, Bit Digital held 24,434 ETH as of March 31, 2025. After the proceeds from the IPO and the BTC sale, this amount was increased to 100,603 ETH. With this development, Bit Digital has one of the largest Ethereum portfolios among publicly traded companies.

2025-07-07T19:30:53,"Jack Dorsey releases details of his p2p messaging app Bitchat","The co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, announced the launch of a new decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app named Bitchat. The application is currently available on Apple’s beta‐testing service TestFlight. On Sunday evening, Dorsey shared Bitchat’s whitepaper along with a TestFlight link for anyone interested in trying the app. He said his weekend project was to learn about “bluetooth mesh networks, relays and store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things.” Bitchat works without the internet Bitchat’s whitepaper states that the application doesn’t rely on internet infrastructure. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks, which provide ephemeral, encrypted communication. This setup ensures the application stays operational even during internet blackouts or censorship. When somebody sends a message to another user, the message is end-to-end encrypted and it stays in the device memory. No data is saved on a server. Also, using the app doesn’t require a phone number or an email address. This makes Bitchat more private compared to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp that rely on Meta’s data servers. Since Bitchat relies on BLE mesh networks, each device acts as both a client and a server. Nearby devices (within 30 meters) form clusters. When a device from one cluster comes into the range of a device from another cluster, they act as a bridge, linking the two groups. This allows messages to hop from cluster to cluster until they reach their intended recipient. The whitepaper further dives into the messaging app’s architecture, protocols, and safety mechanisms. Source: Jack Dorsey via X. How does Bitchat enhance privacy? Bitchat injects dummy messages at random intervals of 30–120 seconds and it adds 50–500 milliseconds delays to real transmissions. This makes it statistically impossible for anyone to distinguish genuine messages or correlate timing with user activity. Messages do not stay in the device’s memory forever. The decentralized app saves any message for 12 hours for regular peers while the time for favorite peers is indefinite. So even if somebody gains access to a device, they can’t trawl through years of old conversations. Bitchat has no metadata leaks since there’s no centralized servers or a service provider who can see your messages or who you’re talking to. Instead, each node only examines a TTL (time-to-live) counter and a message ID. Nodes do not keep any record of who sent the message, who will get it, or when it was sent—just enough data to know when to stop forwarding. Bitchat provides uninterruptible communication channels in situations like protests or disaster areas where the internet may be down, overloaded, or actively blocked. Besides founding Twitter and building Bitchat today, Jack Dorsey co-founded and led Block (formerly Square). He backed decentralized social protocols such as Bluesky and Nostr. In recent years Dorsey drove the development of Web5 and other decentralized applications while advocating for Bitcoin adoption.

Core Scientific shares were 18% lower, trading around $14.75 at publication time. CoreWeave stock was down 5%. While the deal offers CoreWeave strategic benefits, cutting over $10 billion in lease obligations and unlocking more than $500 million in annual cost savings by 2027, KBW views it as an opportunistic move, capitalizing on CRWV’s 295% post-IPO rally, the bank said in a report on Monday. ""While we view this as an opportunistic attempt by CRWV to capitalize on recent stock appreciation, the reaction signals disappointment and potential disagreement to the deal terms,"" wrote analyst Bill Papanastasiou. Under the terms of the agreement, Core Scientific shareholders will receive 0.1235 CoreWeave shares for each share held, valuing the business at around $9 billion. The deal requires approval from Core Scientific shareholders and is expected to close in Q4 2025. Core Scientific shareholders may push back on the terms of the deal, the analyst noted, given the unchanged asset base since CRWV’s first failed bid and lack of a cash component. The ""shareholder vote may see friction."" Still, with no competing offer expected, the deal is likely to proceed, the report said. KBW has an ""outperform"" rating on Core Scientific shares with a $19 price target. Rival Wall Street firm Bernstein noted the drop in the Core Scientific share price after the deal was announced and said ""shareholders were probably expecting a higher valuation,"" and ""investors were disappointed with an all stock deal.""

2025-07-07T19:00:41,"Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350","Ethereum is approaching a pivotal moment as it pushes to reclaim the $2,600 level, aiming to break free from weeks of sideways action. After trading within a tight range since early May, ETH is now testing the upper boundary of its consolidation zone, a move that could mark the start of a new bullish phase for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Market participants are closely watching this level, as a successful breakout above $2,600 would likely attract momentum buyers and confirm renewed strength across the altcoin sector. However, the breakout is far from guaranteed. If bulls fail to sustain this move, Ethereum could face renewed selling pressure, with price potentially revisiting lower support zones. According to Coinglass data, liquidity clusters are clearly defined at $2,800 and $2,350. These levels will likely act as magnets in the coming days, depending on how Ethereum responds to current resistance. A clean break toward $2,800 would confirm bullish intent and broader altcoin surges, while a rejection could reinforce bearish sentiment. Ethereum’s Next Move Could Ignite Altseason Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but bullish momentum is quietly building. Ethereum, the leader of the altcoin market, has been consolidating in a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. This prolonged sideways action has kept much of the altcoin sector in a state of indecision. Now, traders and analysts agree: Ethereum must break out to lead the next major move. Market analyst Ted Pillows identifies two key liquidity levels for ETH: $2,800 on the upside and $2,350 on the downside. These zones represent the most likely destinations for price in the short term, depending on which side of the range breaks first. If Ethereum pushes above $2,800 with strength, it would likely trigger renewed risk appetite and a broad-based altcoin rally. On the other hand, a breakdown below $2,350 could lead to deeper corrections across the board. So far, bulls have defended the $2,500 level well, and growing open interest suggests that investors are positioning for an expansion. A decisive breakout in either direction will resolve weeks of consolidation and determine the short-term trend. Until then, Ethereum remains the gatekeeper of altcoin momentum—its next move could define the path for the entire market. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Resistance Amid Range-Bound Structure Ethereum is currently trading at $2,563, hovering just below the $2,600 mark, a level that has acted as short-term resistance throughout June and early July. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has been trapped in a horizontal consolidation structure between $2,400 and $2,700, with multiple failed attempts to break either side convincingly. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs), which is a positive signal for bulls. The 100 SMA at $2,532 and the 200 SMA at $2,206 have offered strong dynamic support during recent pullbacks, reinforcing the current uptrend structure. Volume remains moderate, suggesting that market participants are waiting for a clear breakout before entering with conviction. A decisive close above $2,600 would open the door for a move toward $2,800, where large liquidity clusters have been identified by Coinglass. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook However, failure to maintain this short-term momentum could push ETH back toward the $2,400 support zone.

2025-07-07T18:45:43,"Goldman Sachs Flips Bearish on US Treasury Yields, Forecasts Fed Rate Cuts Sooner Than Expected: Report","Market strategists at banking giant Goldman Sachs have reportedly lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. In a report seen by Bloomberg , analysts, including George Cole, say that they’re lowering their end-of-year targets for yields and are revising their expectations for Fed cuts in 2025. The analysts say that they see the two and 10-year yields ending 2025 at 3.45% and 4.20%, respectively, dropping from their initial call of 3.85% and 4.50%. Meanwhile, Goldman’s economists originally believed that the Fed would only achieve one rate cut near the end of the year, but are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. Even though strong labor numbers challenged the analysts’ forecast, the Goldman analysts are standing firm on their call, noting that the strong data was distorted by the outsized figure of government hiring and a decline in the labor participation rate. “A benign path to lower short-term rates can dilute a potential source of additional fiscal risk premia and improve the economic appeal [of owning Treasuries.] We see scope for deeper cuts to support lower yields than previously envisioned.” The Financial Times reports that $11 billion in long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt have been dumped in just three months. The Q2 2025 sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off happening back in the second quarter of 2022. Source: The Financial Times PGIM’s top fixed-income strategist, Robert Tipp, says the shift shows investors are wary of rising inflation and increasing government debt. “It’s a volatile environment, with inflation still above target and heavy government supply as far as the eye can see. This is driving a skittishness about the long end of the yield curve, and a general uneasiness.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 The so-called America Party was formed out of a public rift between Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’, which Musk has called a “disgusting abomination,” claiming it would erode millions of jobs in the US and cause “immense strategic harm” to the nation. This particular bill is estimated to add a whopping $3.3 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade. Musk questioned Trump’s rationale for forming the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an extra-governmental agency that sought to reduce the US national debt, if he was going to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars. Musk’s Relationship With Crypto Musk’s relationship with cryptocurrencies is well-documented, with SpaceX and Tesla both holding BTC on their corporate treasuries. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in early 2021, making it one of the first publicly listed companies to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The EV maker currently holds 11,509 BTC , worth approximately $1.2 billion, making it the eighth-largest publicly traded company to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. Bitcoin OG Adam Back recently suggested that Musk should buy 1 million in BTC to “front-run the US government and the Trump family” in their ongoing feud. While Musk already owns some Bitcoin, Back believes that the eccentric centibillionaire’s current allocation is too low for his enormous net worth. The X owner has also been a Dogecoin evangelist over the years. His obsession with shitposting helped boost the biggest and oldest meme coin to a top 10 cryptocurrency. Interestingly, Musk even called himself the “ Dogefather ” ahead of a “Saturday Night Live” skit about the cryptocurrency back in 2021 — sending the coin’s price rocketing higher.

The Las Vegas-based firm produced 685 BTC last month, bringing its year-to-date output to 3,968 BTC. All coins were self-mined, and total bitcoin holdings reached 12,608, ranking the company seventh among publicly traded bitcoin holders, one spot ahead of Tesla. CleanSpark sold 578.51 BTC for $61.2 million, with an average sale price of $105,860, outpacing the volume-weighted average price for the month. ""June 2025 marked a milestone month for CleanSpark,"" said CEO Zach Bradford. ""We achieved our mid-year target of reaching 50 EH/s... through fully self-operated infrastructure."" The company secured contracts for an additional 179 megawatts (MW) of power, raising its total contracted capacity to 987 MW. The new capacity is expected to support more than 10 EH/s of incremental hashrate. CleanSpark also launched its Digital Asset Management program, which includes a spot sales strategy and derivative overlay. The initiative showed initial gains in June, supporting the company’s broader focus on optimization and operating leverage.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/07/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-produced-685-btc-in-june-hit-1615-jth-in-efficiency,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MINING","Markets|CleanSpark|Bitcoin Miner|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T18:17:54,"XRP Proponent Claims Ripple Is a U.S. Government Agency, Shares Proofs","A provocative theory shared by XRP proponent Edo Farina has stirred debate in the crypto space. According to Farina, Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP token, may not be just a private fintech enterprise but a possible extension of U.S. intelligence infrastructure. He supports this claim by highlighting corporate trademark histories, overlapping personnel, and early domain registrations tied to Ripple Communications and OpenCoin. A Trademark Trail from 1991 The foundation of Farina’s argument lies in trademark records. “Ripple Communications, Inc.” was incorporated in Nevada on March 21, 1991—17 years before Bitcoin’s white paper. Public records show that Ripple Labs , Inc., the entity known today for developing XRP, currently holds the trademark originally belonging to Ripple Communications. That trademark was transferred through OpenCoin, Inc.—Ripple Labs’ former name before rebranding. This raises an immediate question: why would a crypto startup inherit trademarks and branding from a 1991 telecom company? While the connection could appear coincidental, Farina insists it hints at a deeper institutional lineage. RIPPLE IS A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY. $XRP The truth behind @Ripple , INSA, and intelligence contractors , and why Ryan Fugger is the key. Ryan Fugger claims the name “Ripple” came from a Grateful Dead song. But the real story? It traces back to U.S. intelligence ties, secret… pic.twitter.com/yyQTmBmD9q — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 7, 2025 Early Digital Footprints and INSA Overlap According to Farina, three key domains—RipplePay, RippleCom, and OpenCoin—were all launched in 2005, reportedly hosted under the same IP block. This was also the year the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) underwent reorganization. Farina suggests that this timeline convergence indicates the quiet development of a broader intelligence-linked fintech infrastructure. Supporting this idea is the involvement of Karen Nussle, listed as a principal at Ripple Communications. The uploaded image shows that she was also listed as a press contact at INSA, using an “@insaonline.org” email address. This strongly suggests a crossover between Ripple Communications and the U.S. intelligence policy space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Suzanne Heckenberg and the Disappearing Entity Another key figure cited is Suzanne Wilson Heckenberg, now President of INSA. According to INSA’s website, she served as Vice President of Marketing for Ripple Communications from September 2010 to October 2012. Her departure coincided with a significant transition: that same month, Ripple.com was acquired, and the Ripple Communications trademark changed hands, eventually ending up under Ripple Labs. After this point, Ripple Communications seemingly disappeared from public records. To Farina, the sequence is too aligned to ignore. He suggests Ripple Communications may have acted as a shell company or soft-launch vehicle for a government-aligned financial infrastructure, later consolidated under Ripple Labs. What Happened to Ryan Fugger? Farina also casts doubt on the official story surrounding Ryan Fugger, the original mind behind RipplePay . Fugger once claimed that the name “Ripple” was inspired by a Grateful Dead song. But if Ripple Communications predates his work by over a decade, and already held the trademark, Farina argues that Fugger’s explanation may have been a public narrative masking institutional involvement. Fugger’s quiet exit from the project only fuels further suspicion. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-07T18:15:52,"Ethereum Eyes 16.7M Gas Cap Under Vitalik Buterin’s New Proposal","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter have proposed a ceiling on how much gas a single transaction can use, and aim to tighten security while preserving efficiency as the protocol matures. The draft proposal, EIP-7983, sets a 16.77 million gas limit per transaction. Interestingly, this is a significant change from the current architecture, where a single transaction can consume an entire block’s gas allowance. Developers argue this open-ended design exposes Ethereum to denial-of-service (DoS) risks, inconsistent network load, and slower block verification, especially as the chain supports increasingly complex DeFi and zero-knowledge applications. EIP-7983 By introducing a hard cap, Buterin and Wahrstätter seek to enforce more predictable resource usage without significantly disrupting typical user activity, noting that most transactions currently fall well below the proposed threshold. Transactions of more than the 16.77 million gas cap would be rejected during validation. Such a move would ensure oversized transactions cannot enter blocks, while the block gas limit itself would remain adjustable by validators under existing consensus rules. The authors frame the move as part of a broader effort to simplify Ethereum’s base layer and improve network reliability, which essentially echoes Buterin’s recent calls to streamline protocol design inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist ethos. Easing zkVM Constraints Developers working on zkVMs and parallel execution engines have highlighted difficulties in handling transactions with unpredictable gas sizes. They believe a fixed ceiling could ease engineering constraints and allow better subdivision of workloads across threads. The cap is also expected to reduce the risk of any single transaction monopolizing block resources, thereby improving consistency in execution times and block propagation. While the proposed limit may require some large deployments to split transactions into smaller segments, it aligns with Ethereum’s longer-term goal of supporting modular and provable systems while maintaining user experience. EIP-7983 builds on the now-stagnant EIP-7825 but with a lower ceiling. The proposal is currently in draft status and is now open for community discussion as developers assess its practical impact on the network.
