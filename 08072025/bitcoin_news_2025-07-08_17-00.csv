2025-07-08T14:51:16,"Bitcoin ETFs Thrive, Just 1 Outflow in 17 Days: Santiment","Santiment has revealed that the Bitcoin ETF streak is still going strong, with only one day of outflows recorded in the last 17 trading days. This comes as analysts say the steady stream of money into the investment vehicles is helping drive Bitcoin prices higher. Sustained ETF Demand According to data shared by Santiment on X, since June 6, there has only been one day with more money leaving than coming into these products. The market intelligence platform also said that this ongoing trend is a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. As of July 7, information from Farside Investors shows that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net flow of $216.5 million across all issuers. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $164.6 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s (FBTC) with $66 million. ARK Invest’s (ARKB) and Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of $10.1 million and $10.2 million, while other ETFs, including Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, recorded no activity for the day. This follows a major net outflow of approximately $342 million experienced on July 1, which marked the first negative movement since June 6. Before this, there had been a 15-day streak that had brought in nearly $4.7 billion. This period of sustained demand had also pushed cumulative net inflows to about $49 billion and total ETF assets under management (AUM) to above $131 billion. Bullish Price Predictions So far, spot Bitcoin ETFs have brought in over $14.4 billion this year, including $4.5 billion just in July. Fueled by increased institutional demand, Bitcoin’s price outlook for July 2025 has turned increasingly bullish as analysts project fresh highs based on the record ETF inflows. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, has projected a rise in Bitcoin’s price to $116,000. He identified strong capital injection into spot Bitcoin ETFs as the main driver behind the outlook. “These flows are increasingly outpacing price action, signaling institutional demand driven more by macro concerns than short-term momentum,” he said. On June 30, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and head of research Ryan Rasmussen published a report confirming their $200,000 price target for Bitcoin in 2025. They pointed to historical trends, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $112,000 in May, supported by record ETF inflows. The report also highlighted increasing interest from Bitcoin treasury companies and the formation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve as bullish factors. Hougan and Rasmussen showed further confidence in strong ETF inflows continuing into the second half of the year.

Donald Trump’s Truth Social brand firm is expanding its crypto exposure with a new ‘blue chip’ ETF. On Tuesday, July 8, Trump Media and Technology filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 for a multi-asset crypto ETF. Pending U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the fund will include a 70% Bitcoin (BTC) and a 15% Ethereum (ETH) allocation, and will also feature three prominent altcoins. Specifically, it will have an 8% Solana (SOL) allocation, 5% for Cronos (CRO) , and 2% in XRP (XRP) . The Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, B.T., will be structured as a Nevada business trust and issue its shares on the NYSE Arca. Crypto.com, the issuer of Cronos, will act as the digital custodian for the ETF’s assets. It will also serve as the prime execution agent, as well as the staking and liquidity provider.

The fund with the two most popular crypto assets will likely appeal to more risk-averse investors. Crypto.com will also serve as a custodian for this fund. The filings come as the U.S. takes a more friendly approach to crypto regulation. On July 1, reports came out that the SEC is planning to fast-track regulatory approvals for crypto ETFs. In talks with major crypto exchanges, the agency discussed enabling issuers to just file a form S-1 and wait for the required 75 days. If the SEC implements this change, Truth Social’s ETFs may already have done all that is required to get approval. Still, the SEC may require further changes to the filings.

2025-07-08T14:35:46,"6 Best Crypto Presales to Buy in July 2025","The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement, and many savvy investors are considering investing in presales. These presales often offer lower prices and significant growth potential, but they also come with risks, so doing your homework is crucial. With Bitcoin staying strong around $107,000 and big players like BlackRock investing billions into crypto, it’s a great time for new and promising projects to shine. In this guide, we’ve picked six of the best crypto presales to check out this month. These projects stand out due to their strong ideas, growing communities, and real potential to grow fast. From Bitcoin Hyper’s plan to scale Bitcoin, to Snorter’s fun Telegram-based trading bot, these tokens could be the next big thing for investors hoping to multiply their returns. Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now - Top 6 List Here are the top 6 best crypto presales to buy now: Bitcoin Hyper - The First Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain Best Wallet Token - Best Next Gen Wallet Token TOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success SUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform BTC Bull - Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale Snorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot 6 Top Crypto Presales to Buy in July - Full Reviews In this section, you can read our full reviews for each of the best crypto presales to buy in July 2025: Bitcoin Hyper - The First Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain Bitcoin Hyper is a new project that helps make Bitcoin faster and easier to use. It does this by building a second layer (called Layer-2) on top of Bitcoin using Solana’s powerful technology (SVM). This enables super-fast transactions at a cost of as little as $0.01 while also making it possible to utilize Bitcoin in various applications, including DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and online payments. Crucially, the project supports DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and merchant payments, bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed. Its canonical bridge also allows users to lock BTC and mint HYPER tokens, to facilitate seamless DeFi participation. This crypto presales roadmap includes cross-chain interoperability and a mainnet launch by Q4 2025, positioning it as a top contender for investors eyeing Bitcoin’s evolution. Launched in early 2025, this first Bitcoin layer 2 chain project has already raised over $2 million in its presale, and its token, called $HYPER, is currently priced at $0.012175 per token. For those who want to jump on the bandwagon, it can be bought in exchange for ETH, USDT, or BNB; it can also be bought directly through a debit or credit card. Early investors interested in this crypto can stake their tokens to earn high rewards of over 300% APY. These features convinced many analysts and crypto investors that Bitcoin Hyper might be the next 100x crypto. Take note that Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contracts have been audited, and most of the token supply is being sold during the presale, which adds to its credibility. With big companies like BlackRock now investing in Bitcoin, a project like Bitcoin Hyper, which is focused on improving Bitcoin’s speed and usefulness, could be one of the best crypto presales to invest in this month. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Best Wallet Token - Best Next Gen Wallet Token Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the token behind Best Wallet, a non-custodial Web3 wallet that already has millions of users. This real utility non-custodial crypto wallet is designed to be secure, easy to use, and supports over 60 blockchains. With this wallet, users can swap tokens, bridge assets between chains, and even use a privacy mode to hide their private keys. The project is focused on privacy, and you don’t need to do any KYC (know your customer checks) to use it. Presently, $BEST is priced at just $0.025295 in its fifth presale stage, and it has already raised over $13.7 million, which makes it among the top crypto presales of the year. $BEST token holders get real benefits, like lower trading fees, staking rewards, early access to new token presales, and a say in the project’s future through voting. A beta version of the app is expected to launch after it lists on major exchanges like MEXC. The team behind Best Wallet has worked at top tech companies, and the project has been audited by CertiK, making it more trustworthy. It’s also certified by WalletConnect, which adds to its credibility. Looking ahead, if Best Wallet delivers its promised features on time, $BEST could be a great long-term investment, especially for mobile users, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy now. Visit Best Wallet TOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a fun, meme-based new crypto project. $T6900 was inspired by the wild success of SPX6900 in 2024, and it was built to make fun of traditional finance and big corporations. This crypto project has no serious roadmap or complicated plan, just community hype, humor, and a strong meme culture. The project has already raised over $207,000 in its presale, with tokens selling for $0.006475. 80% of the total supply is available to the public, and the hard cap is set at $5 million. Unlike utility-driven projects, TOKEN6900 leans into “vibe liquidity,” offering no roadmap but audited contracts and a developer’s 6,900-token “moonbag” which will be locked for five years to build trust. There’s also a staking feature called the “Brain Rot Vault” that offers a high percentage of over 200% APY, and over 20.7 million tokens have already been staked. Investors can purchase $T6900 using ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or directly through credit cards via the Best Wallet platform, with tokens distributed post-presale. While its transparency and staking rewards are strengths, the absence of real-world use cases means success depends on market sentiment and meme coin trends. So, for investors interested in high-risk, high-reward cryptos, TOKEN6900 is certainly a good investment choice to buy in July 2025. Visit TOKEN6900 SUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform SUBBD ($SUBBD) is an AI-powered Web3 platform that helps content creators use AI to make and share content like voice notes, videos, and personal profiles. Over 3,500 creators with a combined audience of 310 million people are already involved and using the platform.

Its token, $SUBBD, powers the platform and is now available through an ongoing presale at a discounted price of $0.05585 per token. To date, the project has raised over $754,000. Holders of the $SUBBD token get access to special perks like staking rewards (20% APY), early access to new features, and platform discounts. To help keep the token price steady, SUBBD uses anti-dumping measures such as gradual token releases. The project also plans to fully launch in Q3 2025 and is working with well-known creators to grow its reach. The team includes people with experience at top companies like OpenAI and Google, which helps build trust. Overall, SUBBD stands out because it solves a real problem in the creator space and has a huge potential audience. However, building all of its AI tools might take time.

Essentially, BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a meme token designed to follow Bitcoin’s price movements, giving investors an excellent way to take advantage of the BTC bullish uptrend. It rewards holders with real Bitcoin airdrops when Bitcoin reaches big milestones like $150K, $200K, and $250K. The token is currently in its final presale stage, having raised over $8.3 million to date. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at $0.002585 per token, and it can be bought in exchange for crypto or through a bank card on the BTC Bull official page. Much like Bitcoin, the total supply is 21 billion tokens, and to keep the token valuable, the team plans to burn 15% of the supply when Bitcoin hits $125K, $175K, and $225K. The token is built on Ethereum (ERC-20), so it works with most wallets and DeFi platforms. You can also earn a passive income of over 50% APY through staking. This crypto presale, whose success heavily depends on Bitcoin’s performance, ends on July 7, 2025, at 2 PM UTC. Also, BTC Bull’s smart contracts have been audited, and its token plan is clear, which helps reduce the risk of scam, making it an excellent crypto to buy right now Visit BTC Bull Snorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot Snorter Token powers a Telegram-native bot for sniping meme coins, with multi-chain support and high staking rewards. This exciting crypto project fuels a Telegram-based trading bot for sniping meme coins on Solana and Ethereum, with plans to expand to BNB, Polygon, and Base. The token is currently priced at $0.0973 in its presale, and the team has already raised over $1.4 million so far. Snorter offers cool features like automated sniping, a tool that detects rug pulls with 85% success (based on beta testing), and low trading fees of just 0.85%. Stakers can earn over 700% APY, and token holders get unlimited snipes plus voting power on future updates. As a result, price expectations for this token are huge, with some analysts predicting a significant increase by the end of the year. With over 5,000 users on Telegram and exchange listings planned after the bot launches in Q3 2025, Snorter aims to become a top tool for meme coin traders, making it one of the best crypto presales to consider in July 2025. Visit Snorter How Can You Buy a Crypto Presale? Here’s a step-by-step procedure on how you can buy a crypto presale; 1. Research: Start by visiting the project’s official website and then proceed to read the whitepaper to understand what the project is about, its goals, token supply, and how it plans to grow. You should also check their social media, like X (Twitter) and Telegram, to see what the community is saying and how active the team is. 2. Set Up a Wallet: You’ll need a crypto wallet that works with the blockchain the project is built on. For example, use MetaMask for Ethereum-based tokens like $BTCBULL, or Phantom for Solana-based tokens like $HYPER. Some projects also support Best Wallet, particularly for presales that utilize multiple payment options. 3. Fund Your Wallet: Buy the cryptocurrency you’ll need to invest using popular cryptos like ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT, or USDC. You can buy crypto on trusted exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, or even use a credit or debit card directly through some presale sites. 4. Connect and Purchase: Connect your wallet to the presale platform and follow the instructions to buy tokens. 5. Confirm and Secure Tokens: After you approve the transaction, you may need to wait for the tokens to be delivered because some projects send them after the presale ends. Furthermore, always keep your wallet’s recovery phrase (seed phrase) safe and never share it with anyone. This is because this phrase gives full access to your wallet, so store it offline in a secure place. What Should You Check Before Investing in a Crypto Presale The following are some of the things you should check before investing in a crypto presale; Whitepaper The whitepaper is like the project’s blueprint. It explains what the project is trying to do, how it works, how the token will be used, and what the future plans are. So, one of the first things you should do before investing in a crypto presale is to read the project’s white paper. Team Credibility Another thing you should check/do before investing in a crypto presale is to verify the team’s experience via LinkedIn or public profiles. For example, SUBBD’s team includes people with backgrounds at OpenAI and Google, which adds trust to the project. On the other hand, if the team is anonymous, be extra cautious and avoid investing. Smart Contract Audits Ensure contracts are audited by firms like CertiK or Hacken, as seen with BTC Bull and Snorter, to reduce rug-pull risks. Community Engagement A strong, active community is a good sign. So, before you invest, look at how many people are following the project on X (Twitter), Telegram, or Discord. Tokenomics and Vesting Tokenomics means how the tokens are created, distributed, and used. Look at how many tokens will exist, who gets them, and how they’re released over time before you invest in any crypto presale. Market Fit and Utility Is the project actually useful, or just hype? Bitcoin Hyper solves Bitcoin’s speed issues, and SUBBD helps content creators use AI. These real-world uses give the project more staying power compared to purely speculative meme coins. Look at the Presale’s Performance Check how much money the project has raised and how much attention it’s getting online. A presale that raises millions and builds buzz on social media often shows strong investor interest. You can also follow updates on sites like CoinMarketCap, ICOBench, or crypto news platforms. Final Word In summary, crypto presales in July 2025 offer a diverse mix of exciting new projects, catering to investors with varying interests. Whether you’re interested in serious utility projects like Bitcoin Hyper and SUBBD or high-risk, high-reward meme tokens like TOKEN6900 and BTC Bull, there’s something for every type of investor. However, it’s essential to remember that presales also come with risks, as prices can fluctuate rapidly, and not all projects will ultimately succeed. That’s why doing your own research is very important. Always read the whitepaper, check if the smart contracts are audited, and look at how active the community is. If you take time to understand the project and only invest what you can afford to lose, presales can be a great way to get in early and see big rewards.

The macro analyst tells the 938,700 followers of The Kobeissi Letter on the social media platform X that the corporate demand for Bitcoin is “incredibly strong.” According to Kobeissi, public companies and ETFs acquired a combined 242,766 BTC in the quarter that ended on June 30th. “Public companies purchased 131,355 Bitcoins in Q2 2025, growing holdings by +18%, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Furthermore, ETFs acquired 111,411 BTC, posting an +8% rise during the same period. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which companies have bought more Bitcoin than ETFs. Year-to-date, public companies have purchased 237,664 Bitcoin… Now, public companies hold ~855,000 Bitcoin, or ~4% of the total supply. Corporate demand for Bitcoin is incredibly strong.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X As companies and ETFs gobble up Bitcoin at a rapid pace, the pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader, DonAlt, is warning investors that he doesn’t see the accumulation ending well for BTC. But for now, he notes that it might be a good idea to be cautiously bullish on Bitcoin. “To me this is very clear, right? Like this is a clear kind of Ponzi/bubble forming. And it’s really hard to be bullish into that, right? Because you know like, ‘Hey, this is going to implode.’ Like you know how this is going to end. Everyone knows how it’s going to end. That has been around for a little bit. The thing is that in the time that I have been in crypto, whenever a bubble has formed, this is when you actually start having a lot of fun, right?

2025-07-08T14:29:29,"Jack Mallers: How We Started Our Bitcoin Treasury Company","It’s hard to believe Jack Mallers is still only 31. The Bitcoin star has already founded several companies (including Strike and Zap) and had a hand in getting El Salvador to adopt BTC as legal tender , the first country to do so. Now, he’s forming a bitcoin treasury company — Twenty One — to rival the biggest on the market. Speaking to CoinDesk recently for an interview, Mallers explained how his new company came about (through friendship) and what motivates him about bitcoin’s continued advance to the heart of capital markets. Mallers said the idea for Twenty One came out of a Telegram group chat with executives at Tether. Mallers is a long-time friend of Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, which now has its headquarters in El Salvador. “We've overlapped on similar projects, whether it's open source, bitcoin development, El Salvador, just ways that we can push the world in what we believe is the right direction. And so Twenty One is kind of the latest iteration of that,” Mallers said. “We were watching the story [of evolve and we're like, ‘surely there's gonna be, you know, blue chip, credible Bitcoin treasury company, which just means you're capitalized on Bitcoin.’” “At a certain point we kind of started to challenge each other on like, should we do [a Bitcoin treasury company]? … And it came to a point of, you know, if no one is going to build it, you know, why not us?”“Friends should be the change they wanted to see in the world.” Twenty One came together within weeks of Mallers and Ardoino deciding to go ahead. It was joined by SoftBank, which came on as a launch partner. “They wanted to put in a billion bucks and we said, ‘well, we're a bitcoin company, so we're taking your contribution in bitcoin.’ I don't think in dollars, I think in Bitcoin. So at the time, a billion dollars was 10,500 Bitcoins. And so they denominated their contribution in Bitcoin.” It plans to launch with at least 2,000 Bitcoin, making it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury in the world. Mallers originally went down the rabbit hole after his ad, a futures trader, explained how money really worked to him. He described how the debasement of money through government printing and inflation is still what drives him on. Depoliticizing the issuance of money will set us free. “My message [is] Bitcoin before its computer code, before it's an asset, before it's an ETF, to me, it's moral code. Bitcoin is, you shall not censor, you shall not inflate, you shall not confiscate, you shall not counterfeit and you shall not steal,” Mallers said. “Bitcoin not as a bunch of Miami Club hedge fund bros. Think of it as ethical, moral code that we're all working on to create a place in this world where we can safely exist,” he said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/08/jack-mallers-how-we-started-our-bitcoin-treasury-company,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|USDT","Finance|Feature",cryptocompare

The move, part of its strategy to make the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap the backbone of its corporate treasury, lifted its total holdings to 205,634 ETH, the company said. The Minneapolis-based online gaming firm spent roughly $19.2 million on the latest purchase, paying an average of $2,501 per coin. ETH is at the time of writing trading at $2,591. The shares climbed as much as 26% to $15.93, the highest since they hit $37.18 on June 12, before dropping back to trade recently around $14.55. SharpLink Gaming also said it raised $64 million last week through an at-the-market share sale, with $37.2 million of that earmarked for buying more ETH in the coming days. All of the company’s ETH holdings are staked or restaked in protocols meant to earn yield, it said. To date, the company has collected 322 ETH, around $2.1 million, in staking rewards since starting the effort on June 2. To help shareholders track how deeply the company’s finances are tied to crypto, SharpLink rolled out a new metric called ETH Concentration. It measures the number of ETH held for every 1,000 diluted shares outstanding. That figure has grown to 2.37 ETH from 2.00 in three weeks, according to the company. Other companies have also seen their shares soar after moving forward with ether treasuries.

2025-07-08T14:28:54,"Trump Media files for third crypto ETF","Trump Media is planning to increase its crypto offerings as the company files for its third crypto-related ETF with the SEC. The new fund will own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, Ether, Cronos, and XRP. The proposed fund – the Crypto Blue Chip ETF, was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. According to the filing, the fund would allocate nearly 75% of its holdings to Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The remaining share would be distributed across the other listed tokens, with direct exposure to each. While ETFs holding Bitcoin and Ether are already available in the US market, the inclusion of Cronos and XRP would make the Trump-backed product one of the first to hold these assets directly. Part of broader strategy The Crypto Blue Chip ETF marks the third ETF filing from Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social and a firm majority-owned by President Donald Trump. Previous filings include a Bitcoin-only ETF and a Bitcoin-Ether hybrid fund. More than ten Bitcoin-focused ETFs currently trade in the US, alongside various other digital asset funds. The Trump Media filings would enter an already crowded field, potentially intensifying competition among issuers seeking to differentiate their offerings. If approved, these ETFs could attract investors looking for diversified exposure to multiple leading cryptocurrencies in a single product. Apart from the crypto offerings, the Trump Organization has also unveiled a $499-priced Trump smartphone and a mobile network. The company said the call centres of Trump Mobile will be entirely in the US. Ethical concerns and policy implications Trump’s deepening involvement in the cryptocurrency space has drawn scrutiny from ethics experts, who have raised concerns about the potential for financial conflicts of interest, given his dual roles as president and a business owner. Critics have pointed to the overlap between policymaking and personal financial interests in sectors such as digital assets. The White House has stated that President Trump is walled off from his businesses, and he has transferred control of his media holdings — including approximately $4 billion in Trump Media shares — to a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr. Despite the controversy, Trump has maintained a pro-crypto stance throughout his second term, pledging support for the industry on the campaign trail and backing related initiatives. Bitcoin surges during Trump’s second term The latest ETF filing comes against the backdrop of a broader bull run in cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin has risen roughly 55% since October and currently trades around $108,900. The surge aligns with Trump’s pro-crypto policies and reflects continued investor appetite for exposure to digital assets. Should the Crypto Blue Chip ETF gain regulatory approval, it would offer investors a new vehicle for diversified exposure to top digital tokens, further cementing Trump Media’s role in shaping the next phase of crypto investment products in the US.

Only Focuses on ADA and These 50 Altcoins!","A new proposal came from Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson, who stands out with his interesting ideas and sharp tongue and is one of the most important names in the cryptocurrency industry. At this point, Hoskinson proposed a treasury built solely on Cardano’s native tokens to support the Cardano ecosystem, breaking away from his previous controversial idea of holding Bitcoin reserves. At this point, Hoskinson laid out a treasury plan for the Cardano ecosystem. Hoskinson’s proposal proposes a treasury reserve by bringing together ADA, Midnight token, and the top 50 native tokens within the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal could lay the groundwork for Cardano’s future in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Hoskinson’s proposed Cardano ecosystem reserve includes native token ADA, privacy-focused Midnight token and leading native tokens such as SNEK, World Mobile Token (WMTYX), Liquid Finance (LQ), Minswap (MIN), and Indigo Protocol (INDY). Hoskinson’s model aims to spread risk across multiple projects, encourage collaboration between token teams, and increase total value locked (TVL) through cross-token incentives and shared liquidity pools. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-08T14:22:20,"From $0.58 to $12 Cardano Price? Why One Analyst Believes ADA Could Replicate Its 2021 Parabolic Rally","Cardano (ADA) traded relatively flat on Tuesday despite a strong resurgence of over 6% in the past seven days. Generally, ADA has been navigating a challenging recovery following a sharp decline earlier this month, driven by a broader crypto market downturn and substantial whale sell-offs. On February 4, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez underscored the severity of this exodus, noting, “Whales have offloaded over 330 million ADA and haven’t bought the dip yet.” However, there has been a shift in whale activity with Martinez now reporting significant whale accumulation, as over 70 million ADA tokens have been acquired in the past four days. “Whales have moved over 70 million ADA in the past 96 hours,” Martinez tweeted on Thursday, highlighting the renewed interest from large investors. In a separate analysis, Martinez compared ADA’s current trajectory to its 2020-2021 cycle, suggesting history may be repeating itself. “ Looking back at history, ADA seems to be following the same pattern from 2020 to 2021 at a slower pace, which could soon lead to a parabolic rally” he stated. During the previous bull cycle, ADA skyrocketed by approximately 1,400% within nine months, reaching an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021. If Martinez’s prediction proves accurate, ADA could surge to around $12 before year-end. Supporting the pundit’s analysis, on-chain data from crypto analytics firm Santiment indicates that ADA whales and sharks have been consistently accumulating since late November 2023. On Wednesday, the firm highlighted ADA’s surprising price surge despite other crypto assets retracing, pointing to the aforementioned accumulation. “Wallets holding at least 1M ADA have been consistently accumulating since late November of 2023, adding 1.41B more coins and 2.35% of the entire supply during this 15-month stretch.” wrote Santiment . Despite market volatility, the firm also noted that ADA’s price has surged by 107% since this accumulation cycle began. Elsewhere, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also weighed in on the market outlook during a Thursday interview with crypto analyst David Gokhshtein, noting that liquidity could soon begin rotating from meme coins back to ADA and other legacy crypto assets, which could boost prices. “The markets are going back to bluechips, the reliable ‘dinosaur’ coins like Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP. It’s institution-led. Give it another 6 to 12 months. We’ll see a bull market probably when the stablecoin bill passes,” he said. He also emphasized the evolving regulatory landscape, predicting that the U.S. could pass foundational crypto legislation within the next 90 to 120 days, paving the way for a stronger framework for crypto businesses. Additionally, Hoskinson predicted that the U.S. government, which currently holds 212,000 Bitcoin, will first allow it to be stored in a sovereign wealth fund. Following that, he expects Senator Lummis and President Trump to begin acquiring other assets, suggesting ADA could be on the list. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.58, representing a 0.24% drop over the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/from-0-58-to-12-cardano-price-why-one-analyst-believes-ada-could-replicate-its-2021-parabolic-rally/,"ADA|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T14:20:01,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: Analysts Uncover Next Bull Market Peak","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: Analysts Uncover Next Bull Market Peak Are you ready to dive deep into the enigmatic world of Bitcoin ? For many, the recent price action of the world’s leading cryptocurrency has been nothing short of a roller coaster. Yet, amidst the volatility and the whispers of a new bull run, some of the sharpest minds in the crypto analysis space are suggesting something even more profound: Bitcoin might still be trading at a significant discount, poised for an unprecedented surge. This isn’t just about day-to-day fluctuations; it’s about understanding the underlying cycles and metrics that have historically dictated Bitcoin’s most dramatic ascents. Prepare to uncover why the current market might be setting the stage for an truly explosive future for Bitcoin . Unpacking Bitcoin’s Current Price Position In the dynamic realm of digital assets, understanding Bitcoin’s current price position relative to its historical performance is crucial for any investor. Recently, prominent crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted a fascinating metric: the Mayer Multiple . According to Adler, as reported by Cointelegraph, this crucial indicator currently sits at 1.1. What does this seemingly small number signify? It means that Bitcoin’s price is only slightly above its 200-day simple moving average. Historically, during peak bull markets, this multiple has soared much higher, often reaching levels that suggest significant overvaluation. The fact that it’s currently at 1.1 indicates that despite recent gains, Bitcoin is still far from the speculative frenzy seen at the apex of previous cycles. This suggests a foundational strength rather than an overheated market, providing a compelling argument for its continued upward trajectory. It’s a signal that the asset might be more undervalued than overvalued, a rare opportunity in an asset class known for its rapid movements. The Significance of the Mayer Multiple The Mayer Multiple is a simple yet powerful tool, conceived by Trace Mayer, designed to help investors understand when Bitcoin might be overbought or oversold. It’s calculated by dividing the current Bitcoin price by its 200-day moving average. A low Mayer Multiple suggests undervaluation, while a high one suggests overvaluation. Here’s why the current 1.1 reading is so significant for the crypto market : Historical Context: In past bull market peaks, the Mayer Multiple has often exceeded 2.4, sometimes even reaching above 4.0. For instance, during the 2013 peak, it hit over 4.0, and in 2017, it touched approximately 2.8. Even in the 2021 bull run, it reached around 2.4. A value of 1.1 is remarkably low by comparison, especially considering Bitcoin has already seen significant recovery from its bear market lows. Discounted Price: Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis emphasizes that this level suggests Bitcoin is trading at a “discount” relative to previous bull market peaks. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it’s a historical pattern indicating that the asset has substantial room to grow before reaching levels traditionally associated with market tops. Investor Sentiment: A lower Mayer Multiple often correlates with less euphoric, more rational investor behavior. It implies that the market isn’t yet driven by irrational exuberance, which is often a precursor to a market correction. Instead, the current state suggests a more measured accumulation phase. This metric serves as a crucial sanity check for investors, urging them to look beyond the daily noise and consider Bitcoin’s long-term potential based on its historical cycles and fundamental valuation. Navigating the Bitcoin Halving Cycle One of the most anticipated and impactful events in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the Halving Cycle . This pre-programmed event, occurring approximately every four years, reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half, effectively cutting the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Historically, each halving has been followed by a significant bull run, driven by the principles of supply and demand. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, and analysts are now closely watching how this cycle will unfold. Renowned analyst Rekt Capital recently shared insights on X, noting that if Bitcoin follows its historical halving cycle patterns, the current bull market could reach its apex as soon as September or October 2025. This prediction is not just a random guess; it’s based on meticulous observation of previous cycles: Halving Year Post-Halving Bull Run Duration (Approx.) Peak Year (Approx.) 2012 ~12 months 2013 2016 ~18 months 2017 2020 ~18 months 2021 2024 ~17-18 months (projected) 2025 (Sept/Oct projected) The “diminishing returns” theory suggests that while each cycle sees a new all-time high, the percentage gain from the previous peak might decrease. However, the absolute price increase can still be substantial. The halving creates a supply shock, making new Bitcoin scarcer, and when combined with growing demand, it typically ignites a powerful upward trend. Understanding this cycle is paramount for anyone looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s future movements. What Are the Broader Crypto Market Trends Saying? Beyond specific metrics and cycles, it’s essential to consider the broader crypto market trends that could fuel Bitcoin’s next leg up. The landscape has evolved significantly since previous bull runs. Institutional adoption, for instance, has never been stronger. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marked a watershed moment, opening doors for traditional finance investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of institutional capital provides a new demand vector that was largely absent in earlier cycles. Furthermore, the regulatory environment, while still evolving, is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions, which adds a layer of legitimacy and stability to the market. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, such as the growth of the Lightning Network and the emergence of Ordinals, are also expanding its utility and appeal. These factors, combined with a potential easing of global monetary policies, could create a perfect storm for a sustained rally. The sentiment across the broader crypto market appears cautiously optimistic, with many altcoins also showing signs of life, often following Bitcoin’s lead. This interconnectedness means that a strong Bitcoin performance often acts as a rising tide, lifting other digital assets. Preparing for the Bull Market Peak: Opportunities and Challenges If analysts like Rekt Capital are correct and the next bull market peak for Bitcoin is indeed projected for September or October 2025, what does this mean for investors? This timeframe, just two to three months away from the traditional halving cycle peak, suggests that the most explosive phase of the bull run might be closer than many realize. This period could present unparalleled opportunities for wealth creation, but it also comes with its own set of challenges and risks. Key Opportunities: Significant Price Appreciation: Based on historical patterns and the current Mayer Multiple, there’s a strong probability of substantial price appreciation for Bitcoin. Altcoin Season: A strong Bitcoin bull run often precedes an “altcoin season,” where other cryptocurrencies see even larger percentage gains. Increased Mainstream Adoption: A new all-time high for Bitcoin could draw in more retail and institutional investors, further solidifying its position in the global financial landscape. Potential Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Bull markets are characterized by extreme volatility. Sharp corrections can occur even during an uptrend. “Buy the Rumor, Sell the News”: Markets can sometimes front-run events. The predicted peak could be influenced by external factors or shift due to unforeseen circumstances. Regulatory Headwinds: While regulation is improving, sudden policy changes in major economies could impact market sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic slowdowns, inflation, or interest rate hikes could dampen investor enthusiasm. Investors should approach this period with a well-defined strategy, including risk management, profit-taking targets, and continuous market monitoring. The goal isn’t just to ride the wave but to navigate it intelligently to maximize gains while minimizing potential losses. Understanding the projected bull market peak allows for proactive planning rather than reactive decision-making. Conclusion: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future Potential The insights from analysts like Axel Adler Jr. and Rekt Capital paint a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s future. The current Mayer Multiple of 1.1 strongly suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to its historical bull market peaks, indicating significant room for growth. Coupled with the predictive power of the Halving Cycle , which points to a potential bull market peak in late 2025, the stage appears set for a remarkable period of appreciation. While the crypto market always carries inherent risks, the confluence of these on-chain metrics and historical patterns, alongside increasing institutional interest, presents a powerful narrative. For those willing to understand the underlying dynamics and navigate the volatility, Bitcoin continues to offer an exciting, potentially transformative investment opportunity. The journey to its next all-time high might be closer and more profound than many anticipate, truly unlocking its unseen potential.

2025-07-08T14:10:57,"XRP Futures: Unveiling the Bullish Surge as Open Interest Hits Five-Month High","BitcoinWorld XRP Futures: Unveiling the Bullish Surge as Open Interest Hits Five-Month High The world of cryptocurrency trading is always buzzing with activity, and recently, all eyes have been on Ripple’s native token, XRP. A significant development has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike: XRP futures open interest has reached a remarkable five-month high. This surge is not just a mere number; it’s a powerful indicator, predominantly driven by an influx of long traders, suggesting a growing wave of optimism for the asset’s future. What exactly does this mean for the XRP price and the broader crypto market ? Let’s dive deep into the data and uncover the implications of this exciting trend. Understanding the Explosive Rise in Open Interest On July 7, the total value of outstanding XRP futures contracts, known as open interest, climbed to an impressive $800 million. This figure marks the highest level recorded since January 19, according to reports from Cointelegraph, citing Velo data. But what is open interest, and why is this particular milestone so significant? What is Open Interest? Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. Unlike trading volume, which measures the number of contracts traded over a period, open interest indicates the total amount of money flowing into a market. A Barometer of Market Sentiment: A rising open interest, especially when accompanied by an increasing price, typically signals that new money is entering the market. It suggests growing conviction among traders and can often precede significant price movements. The current $800 million figure for XRP futures points to substantial capital commitment. Comparing the Current Surge: Reaching a five-month high indicates that the market’s interest in XRP derivatives is at a level not seen since early in the year. This suggests a renewed enthusiasm and potentially a shift in market dynamics for the digital asset. The Dominance of Long Traders: A Bullish Signal Further reinforcing the bullish narrative is the overwhelming presence of long traders in the market. Data tracked by Coinglass for the Binance-listed XRP/USDT market reveals that the ‘top trader long/short ratio’ stands at 1.90. This metric is crucial for understanding the prevailing sentiment among institutional and high-volume traders. What the Ratio Means: A ratio of 1.90 signifies that for every short position opened by top traders, there are 1.9 long positions. In simpler terms, nearly twice as many top traders are betting on an increase in XRP’s price compared to those expecting a decline. This heavy skew towards long positions hints at a strong buying dominance. Implications for XRP Price Action: Such a lopsided ratio can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy in the short term. As more traders open long positions, the buying pressure intensifies, potentially driving the XRP price upwards. This collective conviction among influential traders can create significant momentum. Confidence in Future Performance: The dominance of long positions suggests that these sophisticated traders believe XRP has considerable upside potential, perhaps anticipating positive developments related to Ripple’s ongoing legal battles or broader adoption of its technology. Aggressive Call Option Buying: Unlocking Potential Upside Beyond futures, the Deribit-listed options market has also provided compelling evidence of bullish sentiment. Last week, traders were observed aggressively buying higher strike XRP calls. This activity offers another layer of insight into market expectations. Understanding Call Options: A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. Traders buy call options when they anticipate a significant increase in the underlying asset’s price. Why ‘Higher Strike’ Matters: Aggressively buying higher strike calls means traders are willing to bet on XRP reaching prices significantly above its current trading level. This indicates a strong belief in substantial future price appreciation, not just minor fluctuations. A Strategic Bet: This strategy is often employed by traders looking to leverage potential large price movements. It signifies a high-conviction play, where the potential rewards outweigh the premium paid for the options. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Context The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is not isolated; it reflects a nuanced interplay with the broader crypto market . While Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead market trends, strong individual asset performance, especially from major altcoins like XRP, can contribute to overall market confidence. Altcoin Season Potential: A surge in specific altcoin derivatives, particularly one with a large market capitalization like XRP, could signal the beginning or continuation of an ‘altcoin season,’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies. Risk and Reward in the Current Climate: While optimism abounds, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Traders must consider the broader macroeconomic factors and regulatory landscape that continue to influence digital asset prices. The high concentration of long positions, while bullish, could also lead to significant liquidations if an unexpected downturn occurs, known as a ‘long squeeze.’ Actionable Insights for Traders: For those looking to participate, monitoring funding rates in the futures market is crucial. High positive funding rates often accompany strong long sentiment but can also indicate an overheated market. Furthermore, a diversified portfolio and robust risk management strategies are always advisable. What’s Next for XRP? The recent surge in XRP futures open interest, coupled with the dominance of long traders and aggressive call option buying, paints a compelling picture of growing confidence in XRP’s future. While no market movement is guaranteed, these indicators collectively suggest that a significant portion of the market anticipates an upward trajectory for the XRP price . As the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes will be on how these bullish bets play out and whether XRP can sustain its momentum. This period could prove to be a pivotal moment for Ripple’s token, potentially setting the stage for its next major move.

The proposed ""Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF"" would hold a portfolio of five tokens: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and cronos (CRO), according to a filing with the SEC . Eighty-five percent of the fund’s holdings would be split between bitcoin and ether. Solana would make up 8%, cronos 5% and XRP 2%. The ETF is being launched in partnership with Yorkville America Digital, the same asset manager backing Trump Media’s earlier filings for a combined Bitcoin and Ether ETF, as well as a standalone bitcoin fund. The SEC acknowledged the dual BTC-ETH ETF application on Monday, a step that initiates its review. Crypto.com’s custody arm, Foris DAX Trust Company, will serve as the fund’s custodian, responsible for safekeeping the underlying crypto assets. The S-1 registration filed with the SEC is one of two key documents required for an ETF to move forward. The next step lies with the exchange seeking to list the product, which must file a 19b-4 with the SEC. That submission would legally bind the regulator to a review timeline. This would mark at least the third crypto ETF attempt tied to Trump Media or related entities, signaling an intent to establish a broad crypto investment franchise.

2025-07-08T14:03:34,"Mike Novogratz Predicts the U.S. Will Purchase Bitcoin Within the Next Six Months","Renowned investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has predicted that the United States government will start adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet around Q2-Q3 2025. Speaking at a recent Ondo Summit, Novogratz expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s growing role in the financial system, particularly under the new presidential administration. Notably, the billionaire investor highlighted a shift in regulatory sentiment that could lead to a surge in institutional adoption of Bitcoin . With a new leadership direction at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Novogratz foresees an increase in cryptocurrency-related public listings on major U.S. exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. Galaxy Digital itself is among the firms planning to go public in the near future. Novogratz further shared insights from a high-profile event he attended, which included Vice President J.D. Vance, tech mogul Mark Zuckerberg, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and executives from various cryptocurrency companies. He noted a positive outlook on digital assets within influential circles, reinforcing his belief that Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a strategic financial asset. “I think Bitcoin will be on the government’s balance sheet within six months ,” Novogratz stated. He emphasized that Bitcoin has solidified its position as a reliable store of value and could soon play a key role in national financial strategies. “ Bitcoin has a store of value it’s carved out a lane it is becoming Global so I don’t think bitcoin’s going away,” he added. Meanwhile, while Novoratz acknowledged the potential for short-term volatility in Bitcoin’s price, he dismissed concerns, calling it a “buying opportunity” rather than a setback. He also emphasized that price fluctuations do not diminish Bitcoin’s value in the long run, as institutional demand is expected to drive sustained growth. This outlook aligns with a Wednesday tweet from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who predicted that individual U.S. states might soon begin acquiring Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. According to the pundit, the passage of Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (SBR) bills at the state level could create demand for over 240,000 BTC worth approximately $23.5 billion. He also suggested that pension funds and other institutional investors could follow suit, further accelerating Bitcoin’s adoption. That said, the idea of Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset has continued to gain momentum in both political and financial circles, particularly with President Donald Trump proposing a digital asset task force to explore integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system in last year’s campaigns. Major crypto advocacy groups and companies such as Satoshi Fund are actively lobbying for Bitcoin reserves at both the state and federal levels. Recently, MARA CEO Fred Thiel also reinforced this effort, stating, “We are now focused on bringing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to all 50 states and the federal government.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/mike-novogratz-predicts-the-u-s-will-purchase-bitcoin-within-the-next-six-months/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Mike Novogratz",cryptocompare

CME’s Bitcoin futures open interest reached 158,300 BTC ( $16.5 billion ) by June 1, surpassing Binance’s 118,700 BTC ( $12.3 billion ) for the first time in the history of crypto derivatives. Source: CoinGlass The milestone comes as BTC derivatives open interest climbed from $60 billion to over $70 billion during the first half of 2025, driven by massive ETF inflows and institutional demand . Total cryptocurrency derivatives trading volume maintained moderate upward momentum throughout H1 2025, with Binance continuing to dominate the overall derivatives volume, reaching nearly $200 billion on peak days. Source: CoinGlass However, the market structure consolidated around leading exchanges including OKX, Bybit, Bitget, and Gate, with top platforms capturing the majority of market share through the Matthew effect. Hyperliquid emerged as the standout performer in decentralized derivatives, processing an average daily volume of over $3 billion with peaks exceeding $17 billion . The platform now commands over 80% of the DeFi perpetual contracts market share while capturing 10.54% of Binance’s market share, up from 9.76% in April. Institutional Adoption Drives Regulated Exchange Growth The rise of regulated exchanges marks a significant shift in the trading patterns associated with cryptocurrency derivatives. CME’s dominance in Bitcoin futures open interest stems from increasing institutional participation through compliant channels, with ETFs serving as major sources of incremental demand alongside traditional institutional allocators. Bitcoin’s market dominance strengthened throughout H1 2025, reaching 65% by the end of Q2, the highest level since 2021. Spot ETF assets under management exceeded $140 billion, creating sustained demand for hedging instruments on regulated platforms. Ethereum and altcoins experienced pronounced weakness during the period. ETH dropped over 60% from its $3,700 early-year high to below $1,400 in April, with the ETH/BTC ratio declining from 0.036 to 0.017, representing a 50% collapse. Major altcoins, including Solana , also fell by over 60% from their peaks, despite brief early-year rallies. The CoinGlass Derivatives Risk Index (CDRI) remained at moderate levels throughout H1, reaching 58 by June 1, indicating “moderate risk/volatility neutral” conditions. Multiple liquidation events helped flush excessive leverage, with February 3 recording $2.23 billion in forced liquidations during a single 24-hour period. Funding rates remained predominantly positive throughout the period, staying above the baseline level of 0.01% and indicating persistent bullish sentiment. However, three notable negative funding rate episodes coincided with sharp market corrections in February, April, and June, serving as reliable sentiment inflection point indicators. Hyperliquid Dominates Decentralized Derivatives Revolution Hyperliquid’s explosive growth positioned the platform as the leading force in decentralized derivatives trading. The average daily volume consistently exceeded $3 billion, with month-over-month growth rates outpacing the entire DEX sector. The platform achieved sub-second finality and support for over 100,000 orders per second through its proprietary native-chain matching engine. The decentralized exchange ranks sixth among all DEXs by daily volume at over $420 million while capturing 6.84% of global perpetual flows. Annual trading volume reached $1.571 trillion, representing an 843% increase from $26.3 billion recorded twelve months ago. Revenue generation exceeded $56 million per month, resulting in cumulative revenue of over $310 million. The platform reinvests 97% of protocol fees into HYPE token buybacks, resulting in $910 million in buybacks over a six-month period. Total value locked reached $1.75 billion, ranking eighth among all blockchains. Notably, institutional adoption accelerated with Nasdaq-listed Lion Group announcing plans to hold $600 million reserves with HYPE as its primary treasury asset. The token reached a new peak at $44.86, surpassing its previous December high of $35.51, while positioning itself for a potential all-time high of $50. Moreover, market depth analysis revealed Binance’s continued dominance in Bitcoin spot trading, with a single-sided depth of $8 million and a 32% market share. However, the derivatives space is increasingly fragmenting between regulated institutional venues, such as the CME, and leading decentralized platforms, like Hyperliquid, both of which serve distinct investor segments.

2025-07-08T14:00:41,"Institutional activity boosted BTC derivative trading in H1 2025, CoinGlass report","The first half of 2025 saw capital inflows shift heavily to BTC. Most of the price action hinged on the derivative market, where institutions moved in, tempering the influence of crypto-native traders. Bitcoin dominated the first half of 2025, with a new all-time high above $112,000. Based on research by Coinglass, over 80% of the trading volume and price discovery came from the derivative market, with a shrinking share of spot deals. BTC open interest expanded on all crypto-native exchanges, but CME activity surpassed even Binance. | Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro Open interest on derivative exchanges kept expanding in H1, rising from around $60B in January to over $70B six months later. BTC open interest inched up in July, reaching $34B on crypto-native exchanges. Long and short positions were more balanced, avoiding a short squeeze. Institutions decreased BTC volatility For the whole of H1, institutions moved in with more active derivative trading. This boosted the share of CME futures, expanding beyond the activity on Binance. As a result, BTC volatility continued to slow down, gradually sliding to a six-month low of 1.27% . CME carried over $16.5B open interest, surpassing the $11.3B in open interest on Binance. Institutions on CME joined ETF buyers , expanding the effect of institutions on the Bitcoin market. The increased liquidity inflows helped lower the BTC volatility, as the leading crypto asset consolidated at a higher level. Binance remained the biggest crypto-native exchange by open interest, though its share was diluted. For the first half of 2025, the biggest liquidation events happened during the corrections in February and March-April. Outside those two episodes, traders were more cautious in allocating liquidity to BTC positions. As a result, BTC went through relatively smaller liquidation episodes, with more rational allocation and smaller daily liquidations. Crypto derivatives index recovered in Q2 The Coinglass Crypto Derivatives index staged a recovery in the second quarter of 2025. The index tracks the performance of derivative markets for BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP, applying value-based weighting on their open interest. As of July 2025, the index is at $2,231.02, up from the $1,600 range during the yearly lows in April. The index’s drop in the first half of the year was mostly due to the weak performance of Ethereum (ETH). The Coinglass derivative index recovered in Q2, but was mostly driven by the growth of BTC, with outflows from ETH, SOL, and XRP showing lower demand for altcoins. | Source: Coinglass Capital inflows in the first half of 2025 were still heavily concentrated on BTC, boosting the index despite the slowdown of other assets. However, the fall of ETH, SOL and XRP reflected the general weakness of altcoins, pulling the index lower despite the strength of BTC. According to the Coinglass analysis, the index had a boost driven by ETF demand and the usage of Bitcoin as a safe haven, while profit-taking and uncertainty put pressure on secondary assets and the broader altcoin market. The altcoin market expected in the first quarter of 2025 never materialized, instead pushing smaller assets even lower. The altcoin season index recovered to 28 points in July, still reflecting the overall BTC dominance. By the first half of 2025, the divergence of BTC and altcoins was at near-record levels. Based on market signals, altcoins are seen as extremely undervalued. Despite the low levels, traders have become more skeptical that older altcoins would make a return.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was largely flat as the blue-chip index shed 40 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% amid a slowdown from the benchmark’s record highs. A lull in early trading also saw the Nasdaq Composite fluctuate around the flatline, down 0.2%. Stocks shed gains on Monday amid Trump’s fresh threats of tariffs against major trading partners, with the Dow falling more than 400 points and the S&P 500 closing 0.79% down. Nasdaq ended the day 0.92% lower. Although futures tied to the major gauges cut these losses as traders took note of the new August 1, 2025 tariffs deadline, the potential flare up in trade tensions is tempering the overall market mood. In other market sectors, cryptocurrencies were also largely flat as Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovered near $108k. Meanwhile, oil prices steadied around $67.

Other countries, Thailand, Malaysia, and South Africa, also face proposed tariffs of between 25% and 40% by August 1, according to the White House.

This alone showcases Michael Saylor’s confidence in his Bitcoin strategy, and he’s not the only one boarding this train. Crypto analyst NLNico shared some interesting facts about the Bitcoin adoption rate, including a list of 42 companies raising billions to secure their place at the Bitcoin table. Metaplanet is one of them, after announcing a massive $238.7M Bitcoin acquisition , translating to 2,205 coins to bring its reserves up to 15,555 tokens. Canadian Bitcoin infrastructure company, LQWD Technologies, also announced its 10 Bitcoin purchase at an average price of $109.240 for a total investment of $1.09M, bringing its reserves to 181 Bitcoins and joining the growing list of Bitcoin adopters. While the investors flocking to Bitcoin is sure to increase the token’s chart performance, it can also lower it if whale sales hit the market, which is why Bitcoin’s true value comes from blockchain innovations. One such innovation is AMBOSS’s Rail system , the self-custodial yield service allowing you to earn Bitcoins while supercharging the Lightning Network. Advancements like these shape the crypto landscape, attracting more investors and allowing projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) to reach the public’s attention faster than ever.

2025-07-08T13:53:50,"Core Scientific Cut to Neutral as CoreWeave Deal Adds Complexity: H.C. Wainwright","Shares of bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) were downgraded to neutral from buy by broker H.C. Wainwright, which cited heightened risk exposure following the company's r ecently announced deal with AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV). The brokerage removed its price target on the stock, noting that Core Scientific’s performance is now more tightly linked to CoreWeave’s trajectory. Core Scientific shares were 1.3% higher at publication time, trading around $15. The stock fell 18% yesterday following news of the deal. CoreWeave was 2.6% lower. AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave said Monday it agreed to buy Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valuing the bitcoin miner at about $20.40 per share, based on recent closing prices. While the broker continues to view its own Core Scientific sales estimates as conservative, particularly as it hasn’t factored in next year’s planned HPC (high-performance computing) buildout, it flagged several unresolved variables, including outstanding infrastructure procurement. Still, the firm's analysts expect shareholder approval for the transaction, with no indication of delays in the closing timeline. H.C. Wainwright characterized Core Scientific as carrying “the inherent high-risk levels of cryptocurrency companies,” citing network hashrate volatility and crypto market fluctuations. While Core’s diversified operations help offset some of that risk compared with smaller peers, the company now also takes on exposure to CoreWeave’s AI adoption risks, customer concentration and leverage, the report said. Additional headwinds include potential dilution, mining equipment shortages, increasing regulatory scrutiny and operational hurdles. On a more positive note, the expected contribution of HPC revenues in future quarters could help reduce the company’s sensitivity to bitcoin price cycles and stabilize results, the report added.

2025-07-08T13:50:50,"Bitcoin Salary: Japan’s Remixpoint Unveils Revolutionary Executive Pay in Crypto","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Salary: Japan’s Remixpoint Unveils Revolutionary Executive Pay in Crypto In a groundbreaking move that signals a deepening embrace of digital assets within traditional corporate structures, Japan’s energy consulting firm, Remixpoint, has announced a significant shift in its executive remuneration strategy. This isn’t just another company dipping its toes into the crypto waters; Remixpoint has declared that its CEO will now receive his salary in Bitcoin (BTC). This decision marks a historic first for a publicly listed company in Japan, setting a precedent that could reverberate across the global corporate landscape and reshape how we perceive executive compensation. The Dawn of Bitcoin Salary: Remixpoint’s Bold Leap The news, first reported by JinSe Finance, highlights Remixpoint’s commitment to its adopted Bitcoin investment strategy. With a reported holding of 1,051 BTC, the company isn’t merely speculating on the digital asset; it’s integrating it into the very fabric of its operations, starting from the top. The move to pay its chief executive officer a Bitcoin salary is a powerful statement of conviction, demonstrating a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its potential as a legitimate form of payment. For years, discussions around cryptocurrency adoption have often centered on retail investors or specialized crypto firms. Remixpoint , an established energy consulting firm, is now bridging that gap, bringing Bitcoin directly into the realm of traditional corporate finance. This pioneering step by Remixpoint goes beyond just holding Bitcoin on a balance sheet; it’s about operationalizing it as a medium of exchange for one of its most critical expenditures – executive pay. This strategic decision aligns perfectly with their existing investment in BTC, creating a cohesive and forward-thinking financial ecosystem within the company. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Traction Globally Remixpoint’s decision isn’t isolated; it’s part of a growing global trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve, an inflation hedge, and even a potential payment rail. The past few years have seen major corporations like MicroStrategy lead the charge, accumulating substantial Bitcoin reserves and openly advocating for its integration into corporate treasuries. While most of these adoptions have focused on balance sheet investments, Remixpoint’s move into salary payments signifies a new frontier. The benefits driving this trend for companies are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a compelling alternative to traditional fiat currencies, which can be devalued by quantitative easing. Asset Appreciation Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering companies the potential for substantial returns on their digital asset holdings. Signaling Conviction: For companies deeply invested in the blockchain space or those seeking to project an innovative image, holding and utilizing Bitcoin sends a strong message of future-forward thinking and commitment to emerging technologies. Attracting Talent: Especially in tech and finance, offering crypto-based compensation can be a powerful tool to attract and retain top talent who are often early adopters and believers in the crypto economy. Remixpoint’s move is a clear manifestation of these benefits, showcasing how a company can not only invest in Bitcoin but also integrate it into its core financial operations, leading by example in the evolving digital economy. Navigating the Japan Crypto Market: Regulation and Innovation Japan holds a unique position in the global cryptocurrency landscape. It was one of the first major economies to recognize Bitcoin as legal property, fostering an environment that has historically been both innovative and highly regulated. Following high-profile incidents like the Mt. Gox collapse and the Coincheck hack, Japanese regulators implemented stringent measures, aiming to protect investors and ensure market integrity. This robust regulatory framework has made the Japan crypto market a benchmark for compliance and security. Given this backdrop, Remixpoint’s announcement carries even greater weight. It suggests that despite strict regulations, there’s ample room for innovation and practical application of cryptocurrencies within the legal framework. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan has been proactive in licensing crypto exchanges and setting clear guidelines for digital asset businesses. Remixpoint, being a publicly listed entity, operates under intense scrutiny, making its decision to pay in Bitcoin a testament to its confidence in navigating the existing regulatory environment. This development could potentially inspire other Japanese companies to explore similar avenues. As the global financial landscape continues to evolve, Japan’s blend of innovation and regulation could position it as a leader in mainstream corporate crypto adoption, particularly if more companies follow Remixpoint’s pioneering path. The Nuances of Executive Compensation Bitcoin: Benefits and Challenges Paying executive compensation Bitcoin is not without its complexities, offering both significant advantages and potential pitfalls. For the executive, receiving a portion or all of their salary in BTC can be incredibly appealing: Benefits for the Executive: Upside Potential: The primary allure is the potential for significant appreciation in value, turning a fixed salary into a potentially much larger asset over time, aligning the executive’s personal financial growth with the growth of the digital asset economy. Philosophical Alignment: For executives who are true believers in the decentralized future, receiving compensation in Bitcoin is a powerful statement of personal and professional alignment with the company’s vision and the broader crypto movement. Diversification (for some): While Bitcoin can be volatile, for individuals with diverse asset portfolios, adding Bitcoin as a compensation component can be a form of diversification into a new asset class. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly, meaning the real-world value of the salary could change dramatically between payment and when it’s needed for expenses. This introduces a significant level of financial risk for the recipient. Tax Implications: The tax treatment of crypto salaries is complex and varies by jurisdiction. In many places, receiving crypto is considered a taxable event based on its fiat value at the time of receipt. Subsequent appreciation or depreciation would then incur further capital gains or losses when sold or spent. Navigating these regulations requires careful planning and expert advice. Liquidity and Utility: While Bitcoin’s utility is growing, it’s not yet universally accepted for everyday expenses. The executive might need to convert BTC to fiat currency for many transactions, incurring conversion fees and potentially triggering additional taxable events. Security and Custody: Managing a Bitcoin salary requires secure custody solutions, whether through self-custody with hardware wallets or trusted third-party custodians. This adds a layer of responsibility and technical understanding. Remixpoint’s CEO, by accepting Bitcoin, is not only embracing the potential rewards but also the inherent risks and responsibilities that come with holding a volatile, cutting-edge asset. This decision underscores a high level of confidence in Bitcoin’s future and a willingness to lead by example in navigating its practical application. What Does This Mean for the Future of Compensation? Remixpoint’s move begs the question: Is this an isolated incident, or does it herald a broader shift in how companies compensate their employees, particularly executives? While a full transition to crypto salaries for all employees might be a distant future, the concept of offering a portion of compensation in digital assets is gaining traction, especially in the tech and blockchain sectors. This pioneering step by Remixpoint could: Inspire Replication: Other forward-thinking companies, especially those with existing crypto holdings or strategies, might consider similar models for executive or even key employee compensation. Attract Crypto-Native Talent: For companies looking to hire individuals deeply entrenched in the crypto ecosystem, offering crypto compensation can be a significant draw, signaling an understanding and commitment to their world. Accelerate Infrastructure Development: Increased demand for crypto payroll solutions, tax reporting tools, and secure custody services will drive further innovation in the blockchain industry. Ultimately, Remixpoint’s decision is a powerful testament to the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. It challenges traditional notions of compensation and opens up new possibilities for how value is exchanged in the corporate world. A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future Remixpoint’s decision to pay its CEO in Bitcoin is more than just a headline-grabbing announcement; it’s a tangible demonstration of confidence in the digital asset economy. As the first publicly listed company in Japan to make such a move, Remixpoint is not only validating Bitcoin as a legitimate form of executive compensation but also paving the way for other Japanese companies and global corporations to explore similar innovative strategies. This bold step marks a significant milestone in the journey towards widespread corporate Bitcoin adoption and could fundamentally reshape the future of how we earn, save, and invest in an increasingly digital world.

2025-07-08T13:50:19,"Semiconductor giant Sequans ditches cash for Bitcoin in $384m treasury overhaul","Sequans Communications is swapping traditional reserves for Bitcoin, funneling $384 million in newly raised capital into BTC. The company’s CEO cites Bitcoin’s “unique properties” as the driving force behind the strategic shift. On July 8, France-based Sequans Communications announced the close of a $384 million private placement, with over 40 institutional investors backing its bold pivot toward a Bitcoin ( BTC )-dominated treasury. The raise, comprising $195 million in equity and $189 million in convertible debt, will be deployed almost entirely into BTC. This marks the most aggressive corporate move toward Bitcoin since Michael Saylor’s Strategy began the trend in 2020. Saylor’s Tysons Corner-based firm now holds 597,325 BTC, valued at $64.4 billion, with a $22 billion unrealized gain on its $42.4 billion investment. Sequans CEO Georges Karam framed the Bitcoin pivot as a long-term hedge, pointing to the asset’s scarcity and resilience as superior to traditional cash reserves. “With the closing of this financing, we are excited to begin executing our bitcoin treasury strategy,” said Georges Karam, CEO of Sequans. “We believe bitcoin’s unique properties will enhance our financial resilience and create long-term value for our shareholders. Our intention is to continue acquiring bitcoin in the future, using excess cash generated from our core business operations and additional proceeds.” You might also like: Metaplanet eyes second stage of BTC strategy, plots acquisition spree How Sequans pulled off its $384 million pivot The speed of Sequans’ Bitcoin conversion is as notable as its scale. The raise came just weeks after the company first floated its pivot in a June announcement, suggesting investor interest was strong and the plan already in motion. While Sequans has not disclosed the more than 40 participating investors, the involvement of regulated placement agents Northland Capital Markets and B. Riley Securities signals traditional finance’s ongoing willingness to back Bitcoin-centric strategies. Yorkville Securities, known for its deals with Crypto.com and Trump Media’s digital asset ventures, also played a role in closing the transaction. In addition to the $195 million in equity and $189 million in convertible debt, investors received common stock warrants exercisable within 90 days. If fully executed, those warrants could add another $57.6 million to Sequans’ balance sheet. According to the company, proceeds will be used primarily to acquire Bitcoin, with the remainder allocated to support treasury-related corporate functions. To carry out its new strategy, Sequans tapped Swan Bitcoin, an institutional service provider, to handle custody and execution. Swan’s involvement suggests Sequans prioritizes regulatory compliance and security, critical concerns for public companies dabbling in digital assets. Meanwhile, Sequans’ NYSE listing remains in jeopardy. After the company’s market cap fell below $50 million, it entered a cure period to avoid delisting. The Bitcoin pivot, along with the capital injection, appears aimed at resetting its financial trajectory. Investors welcomed the move, with shares jumping 60% in pre-market trading, according to Yahoo Finance data .

2025-07-08T13:48:05,"XRP Bulls Eye Breakout as Price Holds Key Support Levels","XRP’s price remained relatively unchanged on Tuesday, registering a marginal 0.1% decline over the past 24 hours and trading at $2.26. Although momentum appears stagnant on the surface, technical analysts suggest a potential bullish breakout may be forming if key resistance levels are breached. Traders are closely watching the $2.20–$2.30 range, which holds both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2.22 and the 100-day SMA at $2.20. A daily close above this range would be the first major hurdle for bulls. Further up, XRP must flip the 200-day SMA at $2.36 into support to pave the way for a rally toward $3 and beyond. Historical Pattern Points to Potential Rally Historically, XRP has demonstrated strong rallies after reclaiming the 200-day SMA. In November 2024, the XRP/USD pair crossed above this level, triggering a significant price surge of over 430%, peaking at $2.90 by December 3, 2024. This historical trend reinforces optimism among market participants expecting another upward move. Analysts Signal Strengthening Momentum Crypto analyst CasiTrades took to X on Monday to highlight a bullish continuation setup forming on the daily chart. “The momentum is building, and XRP’s breakout is close,” the analyst wrote. CasiTrades pointed to the convergence of the multimonth trendline apex with the 50- and 100-day SMAs around $2.25, noting this as a key support level. “We’re now sitting just below $2.30, our local resistance. Once this level breaks, the next likely targets are $2.69 and $3.04.” In a similar analysis, pseudonymous trader Dom emphasized that XRP had moved above a crucial breakout zone near $2.25. He noted that the area includes all major Volume Weighted Average Prices (VWAPs) and the 160-day downtrend line. “This is the exact momentum bulls need to aggressively show up and it can send [XRP] to $2.40s,” Dom stated. XRP/BTC Pair Shows Bullish Divergence Beyond USD trading, XRP is also displaying strength against Bitcoin. Over the weekend, the XRP/BTC pair broke above a multimonth descending trendline at 0.00002065 BTC. This trendline had acted as resistance since March. A successful retest of this level could confirm a shift in trend, potentially leading to more gains for XRP relative to Bitcoin. Technical indicators further support the bullish outlook. Between May and July, the XRP/BTC pair formed lower lows while its daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbed from 28 to 55—creating a bullish divergence. This divergence suggests waning selling pressure and renewed investor interest. Upside Confirmation Nearing Market analyst Mikybull Crypto believes that XRP’s next major test lies at the 0.000022 BTC resistance level. “Break this trendline resistance and XRP will rally strong,” the analyst said. Analysts also noted that a breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern on the XRP/BTC chart could trigger gains of up to 70%. Such a rally would almost certainly propel XRP’s price above $3, echoing historical price behavior.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/xrp-bulls-eye-breakout-as-price-holds-key-support-levels/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS","Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

He attributes this to Solana’s advanced blockchain technology, growing ecosystem, and rising investor interest. If Pal’s prediction holds, Solana’s price could exceed $400 in the coming months, a significant surge from its previous peak. Despite market trends, Solana has shown resilience, maintaining a strong performance with consistent buying pressure. CoinPedia’s Solana (SOL) Price Prediction With the improving network conditions of Solana and the slow but steady rise in the DeFi sector, the SOL prices project a bullish future. According to CoinPedia’s formulated Solana price prediction 2025, the price might surge to $400. On the flip side, a failure to sustain recovery will plunge Solana prices to $250 during that year.

This is primarily thanks to DDC Enterprise, which added 230 BTC to its treasury, 48.3% of its total, bringing the total to 368 BTC. The company bought the coins at an average price of $90,764 per coin. This is ahead of schedule for DDC’s six-month plan to buy 500 BTC. DDC’s CEO, Norma Chu, reiterated the company’s long-term vision: Bitcoin is part of its treasury model, and this purchase cements that.

Last week’s $790 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows was a notable dip from the $1.5 billion weekly average in June. Analysts attribute this to rising macro uncertainty and softer spot market demand. However, BTC’s overall trend remains supported by institutions. Companies like Metaplanet have been accumulating during low volume periods and helping to hold BTC above $108K. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bulls Hold the Line From a technical perspective, Bitcoin price prediction remains strong. It’s holding above the trendline and 50-period SMA ($108,353) on the 2-hour chart. A strong bounce from the $107,490 area has formed a higher low, and the RSI is at 57.12, indicating room for further upside. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A break above $109,727 could see $110,561 and $111,523 come into play, the next major targets from earlier July. Trade: Entry: Above $109,000 on breakout Targets: $110,561 to $111,523 Stop-Loss: $108,150 As long as BTC holds trendline and SMA support, the short-term bias is up. However, traders should wait for confirmation and avoid overexposure if the volume doesn’t support the price. Despite short-term hesitation in ETF flows, DDC’s buying and Strategy’s funding round suggest institutions are still hungry. If momentum surpasses $109K, BTC could be poised for a significant Q3. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,061,881 out of a $2,510,240 target. The token is priced at $0.012175, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025.

The plan is to bring top digital coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cronos, and Ripple under one “blue chip” fund for everyday investors. But what does this new ETF offer, and how might it change the game? A Big Bet on Top Coins According to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF plans to directly hold five major cryptocurrencies. The breakdown shows 70% of its value in Bitcoin, 15% in Ether, 8% in Solana (SOL), 5% in Cronos (CRO), and the last 2% in Ripple’s XRP. The idea is to let investors benefit from the performance of these coins together, without having to hold each one on their own. To make this plan work, Truth Social is partnering with big crypto players. Crypto.com will handle custody, staking, and liquidity. Green Light Still Needed For now, the plan is waiting for approval. The SEC must clear the registration statement and sign off on a special filing called Form 19b-4. If approved, the ETF shares will trade on NYSE Arca, giving it access to one of the biggest U.S. trading floors for exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, Yorkville America Digital is acting as the sponsor of the ETF New Era of Crypto ETFs The timing of this launch isn’t random. Many believe that the SEC, under the new Trump-led administration, could take a friendlier approach to crypto than before. Other big names like Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton are also lining up to launch their crypto ETFs.

2025-07-08T13:32:01,"Vitalik Buterin Proposes EIP-7983 to Boost Ether Security and Prevent DDoS Attacks on Ethereum","Vitalik Buterin , Ethereum co-founder, finalised Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7983 (EIP-7983), which significantly reduces the gas limit to prevent DDoS attacks. EIP-7983 was proposed in late June, but had to wait for Buterin to sign it off. The imposed gas limit will place a cap of 16.77 million gas usage, which is 2^24. Buterin wishes to stabilise the network and make transactions more predictable. The gas limit was initially meant to be 30 million. The Ethereum community has debated the topic vigorously and has arrived at a new figure of roughly 16 million. Toni Wahrstatter, an Ethereum researcher, co-authored EIP-7983 and released the final version on GitHub. Any transactions that exceed the 16.77 million threshold will be cancelled. The new protocol will prevent entities from monopolizing entire blocks. EIP-7983 will introduce numerous enhancements to the Ethereum blockchain, including DDoS protection, improved zero-knowledge Virtual Machine design, and more equitable distribution of gas fees within each block. Validators may be able to set their gas limits, but will need to adhere to the 16 million global limit. A transaction that exceeds that amount will receive an error code. The functioning of this new protocol will be implemented in the EVM. Transactions, meanwhile, wait on the txpool before being processed. It is at this stage that transactions can be filtered out if they exceed the 16 million limit. The economic benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem are currently minimal. A simple back-of-the-envelope analysis reveals that an average gas price of 0.2, with an ETH price of $2,500, utilizing a maximum transaction cap of 16.77, would result in a cost of $11. The impact of EIP-7983 would largely affect future transactions, adding more predictability for developers to know in advance what a transaction cost would entail. Vitalik Buterin has expressed a desire to improve the reliability and security of Ethereum. He envisions an ecosystem that is more straightforward, like Bitcoin, so that there are fewer bugs in the code. At this point, Ethereum is at risk of developing clusters of legacy code that could increase the likelihood of a fault. Hackers may attempt to exploit such vulnerabilities to compromise the network or even steal customers’ funds. Ethereum is well-designed in terms of modularity, but could benefit from a serious cleanup to avoid a disaster. A critical vulnerability exists in the Ethereum system, where a single transaction could completely consume a block’s gas limit. EIP-7983 addresses this flaw to decentralize the blockchain further and enhance its security. A DDoS attack could destabilize the blockchain by creating an uneven number of transactions, adding to bottlenecks in the system, and putting users’ funds at risk. EIP-7983 could be part of Vitalik Buterin’s vision for a minimalist Ethereum, as it allows simple transactions to coexist with complex transactions without the latter dominating the blockchain. EIP-7983, therefore, contributes to a more harmonious blockchain with less bottlenecks and more opportunities for regular users to make simple transactions without exorbitant gas fees. The Pectra upgrade marked a significant milestone for Ethereum’s price, leading to an improvement in trading activity after its implementation. Transactions have reached levels comparable to those of 2021. This is a promising sign for both crypto traders and Ethereum developers. Many developers believe that the price improvements are directly related to the Pectra upgrade. There have been improvements in US regulations and corporate treasuries emerging regularly. There have even been Ethereum corporate treasuries, indicating a renewed sense of optimism for the crypto token. Ethereum traders are particularly interested in two major things: faster transaction speeds and lower gas fees.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-eip-7983-to-boost-ether-security-and-prevent-ddos-attacks-on-ethereum/,"ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC|MARKET","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T13:30:48,"Delio CEO Attack: Shocking Consequences for Crypto Losses","BitcoinWorld Delio CEO Attack: Shocking Consequences for Crypto Losses The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to volatility, but a recent incident in South Korea has brought the emotional and financial stakes into stark relief. The news of a South Korean man attacking Delio CEO James Jung over significant crypto losses has sent ripples through the community, serving as a powerful reminder of the intense frustrations that can arise when investments go awry. This isn’t just a story about a fine; it’s a window into the human cost of market instability and the critical need for robust investor protection . Delio CEO Attack: Unpacking the Incident In a turn of events that underscores the raw emotions tied to digital assets, a man in his 40s was recently fined 1.5 million won (approximately $1,100 USD) by a Seoul court. His transgression? Assault and unlawful entry into the home of Delio CEO James Jung. The motive behind this drastic action was directly linked to the man’s substantial financial losses following the suspension of deposits and withdrawals at Delio, a prominent crypto lending platform in South Korea, in 2023. This wasn’t just any investor; reports indicate he was Delio’s largest creditor, having entrusted the platform with a staggering portfolio including 87 Bitcoin (BTC) and 190 Ethereum (ETH). At the time of the incident, these assets were valued at an estimated 10 billion won, or roughly $7.31 million. The attacker’s decision not to contest the summary order and pay the fine without a formal trial suggests a desire to move past the legal repercussions, though the underlying financial pain undoubtedly persists. Understanding the Roots of Crypto Losses at Delio The incident is a direct consequence of the operational halt at Delio. But what exactly led to these widespread crypto losses ? Delio, like many crypto lending platforms, operated by taking user deposits and lending them out, often promising attractive returns. However, this model carries inherent risks, especially in an unregulated or under-regulated environment. When market conditions sour, or if the platform’s internal risk management fails, it can lead to severe liquidity issues, preventing users from accessing their funds. Key factors contributing to such losses often include: Market Volatility: Sudden and sharp drops in cryptocurrency prices can devalue collateral and loans, leading to insolvencies. Counterparty Risk: The risk that the entities borrowing from the platform (or the platform itself) default on their obligations. Lack of Transparency: Many platforms operate with limited visibility into their reserves, lending practices, and financial health. Regulatory Uncertainty: An evolving regulatory landscape can create ambiguities, leaving both platforms and investors vulnerable. The Delio case serves as a poignant example of how these factors can converge to create devastating outcomes for investors. The Broader Picture: South Korean Crypto Market Challenges The assault on the Delio CEO isn’t an isolated event but rather a symptom of broader challenges facing the South Korean crypto market. South Korea has a vibrant and highly engaged crypto community, but it has also been a hotspot for significant market events and regulatory crackdowns. The country has grappled with balancing innovation with consumer protection, often leading to strict measures after major incidents. Past events, such as the collapse of Terra-Luna, have deeply impacted South Korean investors and pushed regulators to take a harder stance on crypto businesses. This has led to increased scrutiny, stricter licensing requirements, and ongoing efforts to establish a more robust legal framework for digital assets. However, as the Delio incident shows, the path to comprehensive investor protection is complex and ongoing. Navigating Risks in a Crypto Lending Platform: What Should Investors Know? For those considering or currently involved with a crypto lending platform , the Delio case offers crucial lessons. While the allure of high yields can be strong, understanding and mitigating the associated risks is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence is Non-Negotiable: Research the platform’s background, team, and track record. Look for information on their security measures, insurance policies, and audit reports. Understand the Terms: Fully grasp how your assets are being used, the interest rates, withdrawal policies, and any lock-up periods. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your funds into a single platform or asset. Spreading your investments can mitigate the impact of a single failure. Prioritize Regulation and Transparency: Opt for platforms that are regulated in reputable jurisdictions and provide clear, transparent reporting on their financial health and asset reserves. Start Small: If you’re new to crypto lending, begin with a small amount that you can afford to lose, gradually increasing your investment as you gain confidence and understanding. The financial world, particularly crypto, is dynamic. Staying informed and exercising caution are your best defenses against potential pitfalls. Lessons for Investor Protection in the Digital Age The unfortunate incident involving the Delio CEO and the ensuing fine highlights a critical need for enhanced investor protection mechanisms in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. While regulators globally are striving to catch up, individual investors also bear a significant responsibility in safeguarding their own interests. The emotional toll of substantial crypto losses can be immense, as evidenced by the extreme actions taken by the Delio creditor. This underscores the importance of not just financial literacy but also emotional resilience when dealing with highly volatile assets.

2025-07-08T13:24:27,"The Ghost Wallet: $1 Billion Bitcoin Hoard Untouched Since 2011 Signals a Surprising BTC Price Movement","A Bitcoin wallet untouched for 14 years just came back to life , and it’s not going unnoticed. On July 3, 2025, blockchain analytics firm Spot on Chain flagged the transfer of 10,000 BTC—worth approximately $1.09 billion. The event immediately triggered discussions across crypto markets, drawing attention not just for the size of the transfer but for the age of the coins involved. The Bitcoin address was originally created in the network’s first year. Back then, BTC was worth less than $0.30 and could be mined using a basic CPU. The wallet received 10,000 BTC in 2011. Source: Spot on Chain According to Arkham, the coins were transferred in full to a newly created wallet in a single transaction. The receiving address has not moved the funds further. The shift from $108,800 to $108,120 today reflects a volatile crypto landscape broader than isolated whale transactions. The transaction does not appear to be exchange-related. Arkham’s team confirmed that the funds were not routed through any centralized platforms or mixing services. The fact that the coins were not split or partially moved adds to the intrigue. Glassnode data shows that long-term dormant coin movements often correlate with volatility. Although not all such movements lead to selling pressure, they tend to raise market alert levels. Open interest in Bitcoin futures dipped following the event. CoinGlass reported a 2.66% drop in open interest to $73.17 billion by July 4. Despite the large transfer, there is no evidence that the BTC was sold. The destination wallet remains inactive, and no exchange inflows have been registered. Bitcoin Market Outlook Bitcoin’s current market dynamics reflect several key forces likely to influence its price movement. Since April 2025, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted nearly $14 billion in net inflows—roughly $4 billion more than historical price patterns would suggest. This indicates a growing trend toward long-term holding rather than short-term trading. According to Matrixport, the market is facing reduced capital efficiency. Inflows for 2025 are projected to fall short of the $37 billion peak reached in 2024, with an estimated annualized rate of $29 billion. This implies that maintaining upward price momentum now requires greater capital input, with each dollar invested needing to generate a 2.0x to 2.6x effect on Bitcoin’s market cap. Wall Street’s involvement is also expanding, with over $100 billion in crypto-related IPOs anticipated. Circle’s recent public debut exceeded valuation forecasts, highlighting institutional interest driven by operational scalability and tech-driven growth. Seasonal trends support a bullish outlook for July. Historically, Bitcoin has closed higher in 7 of the last 10 Julys, with an average return of 9.1%. However, activity tends to slow in August and September, months often marked by weaker performance and broader economic uncertainty.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/the-ghost-wallet-1-billion-bitcoin-hoard-untouched-since-2011-signals-a-surprising-btc-price-movement/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ZRX|ARKM","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T13:20:46,"Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: Japan’s Bold Move Towards a Digital Bank Revolution","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: Japan’s Bold Move Towards a Digital Bank Revolution Imagine a future where a publicly traded company leverages its significant Bitcoin holdings not just as an investment, but as a strategic war chest to acquire and transform traditional financial institutions. This isn’t a distant dream; it’s the ambitious path being forged by Metaplanet, a pioneering Japanese firm. Their Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy is poised to redefine how businesses interact with digital assets, promising a revolutionary shift in the financial landscape, particularly in Japan. Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy: Charting a New Financial Frontier Metaplanet, once a relatively unknown entity in Japan’s bustling corporate world, has rapidly gained global attention for its audacious pivot towards Bitcoin. Emulating the strategy of MicroStrategy, the company has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, positioning itself as a significant institutional holder of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. But their vision extends far beyond mere accumulation. According to CEO Simon Gerovich, the core of Metaplanet’s long-term plan is to leverage its substantial Bitcoin reserves to acquire profitable businesses. This isn’t just about diversification; it’s about creating a vertically integrated ecosystem where Bitcoin is the foundational asset powering new ventures. The strategic intent is clear: to utilize the appreciating value and liquidity of Bitcoin to fuel expansion into lucrative sectors, ultimately enhancing shareholder value and establishing a unique business model. This proactive approach signals a profound belief in Bitcoin’s future as a global reserve asset and a powerful tool for corporate finance. It challenges conventional corporate treasury management and sets a precedent for how companies might increasingly integrate digital assets into their core business strategies. Why a Japan Digital Bank is Pivotal to Metaplanet’s Vision? The most compelling aspect of Metaplanet’s expansion strategy is its consideration of acquiring a Japan Digital Bank. Why is this move so crucial? A digital bank offers a direct conduit to retail financial services, allowing Metaplanet to move beyond just holding Bitcoin to actively providing innovative financial solutions to a broad customer base. Here’s why a digital bank acquisition is a game-changer: Enhanced Retail Offerings: A digital bank would enable Metaplanet to offer a suite of financial services that could significantly outperform existing traditional offerings. Think faster transactions, lower fees, seamless integration with digital assets, and user-friendly interfaces designed for the modern digital consumer. Leveraging Bitcoin Holdings: With a banking license, Metaplanet could potentially offer Bitcoin-backed loans, crypto-friendly accounts, and other services that directly utilize its BTC reserves, creating new revenue streams and increasing the utility of its digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: Operating as a licensed digital bank in Japan provides a robust regulatory framework, instilling greater trust and facilitating broader adoption of crypto-related financial services among the general public. Japan has a well-defined, albeit strict, regulatory environment for financial institutions, which can be an advantage for compliant operations. Direct Customer Access: Owning a bank allows Metaplanet to directly onboard and serve customers, bypassing traditional intermediaries and building a direct relationship with its user base, fostering loyalty and innovation. This strategic move is not merely about expanding services; it’s about embedding Bitcoin and digital assets into the very fabric of everyday finance, making them accessible and practical for the average Japanese consumer. The Evolving Landscape of Bitcoin Investment Japan Japan has a unique and often paradoxical relationship with cryptocurrency. As the birthplace of Mt. Gox, it was an early pioneer in Bitcoin adoption, yet it also implemented stringent regulations following major exchange hacks. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Investment Japan continues to evolve, driven by growing institutional interest and a maturing regulatory environment. Metaplanet’s strategy stands out because it’s not just an investment firm; it aims to become a financial services provider powered by Bitcoin. This represents a significant maturation of the crypto industry in Japan, moving beyond speculative trading to practical, regulated financial applications. Other Japanese companies, while cautious, are also exploring blockchain and digital asset integration, but Metaplanet’s direct approach to banking is a bold step. The increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class by institutional players globally provides a strong tailwind for Metaplanet’s ambitions. As more companies and governments explore digital currencies, Japan, with its advanced technological infrastructure and regulatory experience, is well-positioned to be a leader in this financial evolution. Metaplanet Acquisition: A Strategic Play for Market Dominance The prospect of a Metaplanet Acquisition of a digital bank is more than just a business deal; it’s a strategic maneuver aimed at achieving significant market dominance and setting a new industry standard. By acquiring an existing entity, Metaplanet can bypass the lengthy and complex process of building a bank from scratch, accelerating its entry into the regulated financial sector. Key considerations for such an acquisition include: Regulatory Hurdles: While acquiring an existing bank simplifies some aspects, stringent regulatory approvals from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will be paramount. Metaplanet will need to demonstrate robust compliance, risk management, and a clear business plan. Integration Challenges: Merging a traditional banking infrastructure with a Bitcoin-centric strategy will require significant technological and cultural integration. Ensuring seamless operations while innovating with digital assets will be a complex task. Competitive Landscape: Metaplanet will enter a competitive market with established banks and emerging fintechs. Its unique selling proposition will be its Bitcoin foundation and potentially superior digital offerings. If successful, this acquisition would not only expand Metaplanet’s revenue streams but also position it as a trailblazer in the global convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy. It would demonstrate a powerful new model for corporate growth fueled by Bitcoin. Expanding Crypto Financial Services: What This Means for You The potential for Metaplanet to offer Crypto Financial Services through a digital bank is exciting for both individual consumers and businesses. Imagine a world where: You can easily convert fiat to Bitcoin within your banking app, and vice versa, with competitive rates. Access to Bitcoin-backed lending is streamlined, allowing you to unlock liquidity from your digital assets without selling them. International remittances become faster and cheaper, leveraging the efficiency of blockchain technology. Innovative investment products that blend traditional assets with digital currencies become readily available. Businesses can accept Bitcoin payments seamlessly and manage their crypto treasuries with integrated banking solutions. Metaplanet’s move could usher in an era of greater financial inclusivity and innovation, making the benefits of digital assets accessible to a wider audience. It signifies a future where the line between traditional banking and cryptocurrency services blurs, leading to a more efficient, transparent, and user-centric financial system. Conclusion: A Bold Vision for a Bitcoin-Powered Future Metaplanet’s strategic consideration of acquiring a digital bank in Japan is a truly transformative development. It underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational asset for corporate growth and financial innovation. By aiming to leverage its Bitcoin holdings to acquire and operate a regulated financial institution, Metaplanet is not just investing in Bitcoin; it’s building a future where Bitcoin is an integral part of mainstream financial services. This ambitious Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy could set a powerful precedent for other companies globally, demonstrating a viable and regulated path for integrating digital assets into core business operations. As Japan continues to navigate the complexities of digital finance, Metaplanet’s bold move positions it at the forefront of a potential revolution, promising a future where finance is more accessible, efficient, and truly digital.

Example: A hedge fund betting ETH prices will fall by heavily shorting contracts.</p></li><li><p>Dealer Intermediaries (Market Makers): Banks and brokers providing liquidity, usually hedging risk.
Example: A bank buying futures contracts to offset risk from customer transactions.</p></li><li><p>Asset Managers/Institutions: Long-term investors who manage retirement funds or mutual funds.
Example: A pension fund holding long futures positions to invest for the long-term growth of Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Other Reportables: Large traders who don’t fit neatly into other categories.</p></li><li><p>Nonreportable (Small traders): Smaller investors whose holdings are too small to be individually reported.</p></li></ul><p>Simple Example:</p><p>Let's say last week’s report showed leveraged funds holding 1,000 contracts betting ETH prices will go down (""short"") and only 100 contracts betting they'll rise (""long"").

This clearly shows their expectation that Ethereum's price will decline. In contrast, Dealer Intermediaries are primarily long (66.5%), likely reflecting their role in hedging or providing liquidity. Asset Managers and Institutions also lean toward the bullish side, with 12.4% of total open interest long compared to just 2.2% short.</p><p>Putting it Together - The Guestimate:</p><p>Given the current setup, here's my guestimate for Ethereum's next move:</p><ul><li><p>Immediate Term (next few days to a week or two): Increased Downward Pressure and Volatility. The substantial short position from leveraged funds is likely to exert strong downward pressure on Ethereum's price in the very short term. We could see a move lower as these funds try to capitalize on their short bets. This might manifest as quick dips or a sustained downtrend, potentially testing significant support levels.</p></li><li><p>Medium Term (next few weeks to a month): Potential for Reversal or Consolidation Around Support. If the price does decline, the bullish leanings of Asset Managers and Institutions could act as a floor. They might start accumulating at lower prices, which could lead to a bounce or a period of consolidation. The market will be watching to see if new long positions emerge from non-leveraged players to counter the speculative shorts.</p></li><li><p>Key Indicator to Watch: How far leveraged funds are willing to press their shorts.
