2025-07-08T03:34:02,"Crypto Funds Break Records: $188B AuM After $1B Weekly Inflows","Last week, digital asset investment products saw $1.04 billion in inflows. The figure marks twelve straight weeks of positive momentum, logging total inflows at $18 billion. Price increases during the week lifted total assets under management to a record $188 billion. Meanwhile, trading volumes hit $16.3 billion, which aligned with the average weekly volume observed in the year so far. Ethereum Dominates Proportional Inflows The latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin investment products attracted $790 million in inflows last week, a slowdown from the previous three-week average of $1.5 billion. The asset manager explained that this deceleration hints at growing caution among investors as Bitcoin nears its record highs. This sentiment is further validated by a minor $0.4 million in inflows to short-bitcoin products in a turnaround from the previous week’s direction. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its 11th straight week of inflows as it added $226 million and pushed the total for this period to $2.85 billion. On a relative basis, Ethereum’s weekly inflows have averaged 1.6% of its assets under management, which is notably higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%, which points to a change in sentiment toward Ethereum. Next up was Solana with inflows of $21.6 million, followed by XRP with $10.6 million, and Sui at $1.6 million during the same period. Chainlink and Cardano also saw modest but steady inflows, as each attracted $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, over the week. On the other hand, the multi-asset product was the only category that flashed red across the leaderboard as it witnessed $12.4 million in outflows. Regional Divide The United States topped regional inflows last week with $1 billion, followed by Germany at $38.5 million and Switzerland at $33.7 million over the past week. Australia also saw a smaller inflow of $4.1 million. Contrastingly, Canada and Sweden experienced weaker sentiment, recording outflows of $29.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Brazil and Hong Kong also saw capital leaving, as they saw outflows of $9.7 million and $3 million.

2025-07-08T02:41:44,"Bitcoin holds above $108K as Trump raises tariffs","The cryptocurrency market was bearish on Monday, erasing some of the gains recorded over the weekend. Bitcoin slipped to the $107,500 region on Monday but has now recovered and currently trades above $108k. Institutional demand continues to be Bitcoin’s primary driver and could empower it to rally higher over the coming days and weeks. Bitcoin stays above $108k despite renewed tariff talks It’s the start of the new week, and tariff talks are back. On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States has set a 25% tariff against South Korea and Japan starting August 1. The president also revealed a 25% levy against Kazakhstan and Malaysia, 30% against South Africa, and 40% for Myanmar and Laos. Furthermore, Trump threatened additional tariffs on countries aligning with the policies of the BRICS. The announcement saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $108k, but the leading cryptocurrency has since bounced back and could rally higher soon. Bitcoin’s resilience can be attributed to increasing institutional demand. On Monday, Japanese firm Metaplanet added over 2k bitcoins to its balance sheet for $239 million. Furthermore, recent data by SoSoValue revealed that US-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded over $769 million in inflows last week. These figures suggest that institutional investors continue to demand Bitcoin, and this could be a catalyst for a price surge in the medium to long term. Bitcoin price forecast; technical strength hints at new highs The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish as buyers remain in control. The pair is also efficient, suggesting that liquidity on the downside has been swept and Bitcoin could be preparing for another leg up. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $108,040, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52 indicates that Bitcoin could experience buying pressure soon, while the MACD lines are still within the positive territory. BTC seems to be currently consolidating tightly around $110,000, just beneath overhead resistance. A decisive move above the all-time high price of $111k in the short term could see Bitcoin target $120k, setting a new all-time high in the process. Analysts still expect Bitcoin to touch $150k in this cycle, and this could be possible if BTC breaks out and hits $120k. However, failure to break out from this consolidation area could see Bitcoin retest the support and Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $105,328. This level could serve as a springboard for Bitcoin to rally higher. However, if the bulls fail to take advantage of this, BTC could drop to the next major support level at $98k. Bitcoin’s short-term performance depends on institutional demand for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the renewed tariff talks could play a significant role in how the broader crypto market performs over the next few weeks.

2025-07-08T02:00:39,"Bitcoin Institutional Pressure Builds – Coinbase Premium Reveals US Whale Accumulation","Bitcoin is once again struggling to break into uncharted territory, hovering just below the $112,000 all-time high it has tested multiple times since late May. While bulls continue to defend key demand zones above $105K, bears are starting to speculate that a correction may be near if the breakout fails. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin’s structure remains intact, showing strength in the face of growing volatility. Top analyst Darkfost suggests that institutional players are behind the current price action. One of the clearest indicators is the Coinbase Premium Gap — the difference in BTC prices between Coinbase Pro and Binance. Unlike ETF flows, which are open to all types of investors, Coinbase Pro primarily caters to institutions and professional traders. This makes the premium gap a valuable tool for tracking institutional demand. Over the past weeks, the premium has widened significantly, showing strong US-based buying pressure that isn’t always reflected in ETF inflows. This discrepancy suggests that spot demand from institutional investors remains robust, offering support for Bitcoin’s current range. If this pressure continues, it could be the catalyst BTC needs to finally push into price discovery — but failure here could fuel a bearish reversal. Institutional Demand Holds Bitcoin Amid Political And Economic Shifts Bitcoin has endured a volatile stretch over the past few weeks, consolidating below its all-time high of $112,000. Despite repeated bearish attempts, the price has remained resilient above $105,000, indicating strong demand and bullish control. This consolidation phase is unfolding against a backdrop of significant macroeconomic and political developments. The US Congress passed President Donald Trump’s highly anticipated “big, beautiful” bill ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline, introducing tax cuts and elevated spending levels. Combined with strong job reports, these factors are expected to fuel market optimism in the short term, though they could reignite inflation concerns. According to Darkfost , institutional activity is playing a key role in sustaining Bitcoin’s price. One of the most telling indicators is the Coinbase Premium Gap — the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro and Binance. Since Coinbase Pro is tailored for advanced traders and institutions, a rising premium suggests significant institutional buying pressure. The monthly average premium recently reached +$78, the widest in history, signaling consistent accumulation by large players. Interestingly, this trend isn’t always reflected in ETF flows, which are available to all investor types. Still, recent ETF inflows have aligned closely with the premium, averaging nearly $1 billion between June 16 and June 27. This dual surge — institutional buying on spot exchanges and large ETF inflows — suggests robust US-based demand from both professional investors and traditional financial vehicles. While the broader market hesitates at resistance, this underlying accumulation may set the stage for Bitcoin’s next major move into price discovery. BTC Price Action: Bulls Defend Support The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a tight consolidation phase just below the $109,300 resistance, with price currently trading around $108,715. After a failed breakout attempt last week, bulls have successfully defended the $106,000–$106,300 support range, maintaining higher lows and suggesting continued strength. This level coincides with the 50 and 100 simple moving averages (SMAs), reinforcing it as key short-term support. Notably, Bitcoin has remained well above the crucial $103,600 demand zone, which served as the launchpad for the late June rally. The flattening 200 SMA suggests that momentum is neutral for now, but the short-term moving averages turning upward hint at bullish bias resuming if resistance breaks. Volume remains relatively low, which could precede a sharp move once a breakout or breakdown occurs. A decisive close above $109,300 could open the door for a retest of the all-time high near $112K, while failure to hold above the moving averages could send BTC back toward $103,600.

2025-07-08T01:30:00,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Crosses $11.8 Million Milestone, Becomes The Top Crypto Under $0.5 This Week","In the fast-paced crypto market, one name has emerged as a game-changer: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is fast-gaining attention amongst investors and analysts alike as it powers through its presale. The only close match to the expected returns of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Bitcoin (BTC). From less than $1 over a decade ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a major force in the crypto sector and is now valued at over $107k. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market today to rekindle the massive returns that early BTC investors experienced. One of the main factors that is working in its favor is that it is built on the solid foundation of utility. In the crypto market of 2025, the push towards utility continues to gain momentum as hype-based meme coins lose out. Let us take a close look at MUTM tokens and why they could deliver the life-changing returns you have been looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to receive interest. Interests are calculated based on an annual percentage yield (APY). MUTM Presale Powers Past $11.8 Million The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised over $11.8 million from around 12,800 unique buyers. These figures are expected to continue rising geometrically as word of the success of the presale spreads. Tokens in the current phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the next phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This price increase is something you do not want to be caught up in. The reason for this is that the token price increase will wipe out the massive 50% discount currently available to buyers in the current phase 5. So far, many investors have rushed to capitalize on this massive discount, with over 65% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 already sold out. The pace has been blazing, with the tokens selling out barely a month after they launched. At the current pace, analysts rightly assess that the tokens will have sold out by the end of July. That means you need to act fast and direct capital into the presale in anticipation of the expected returns. MUTM Tokens Could Rise By 53x According to the latest estimates by analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 53x when they go live. That means if you purchase $1400 worth of tokens in the current phase, you could see your investment grow to over $74,000. It is worth noting that there is no upper cap on how much you can invest in the presale. Consequently, you could make some truly life-changing returns with the MUTM token presale. One reason why there is so much optimism for MUTM tokens is the expected crypto market rally. The crypto market is currently going through a consolidation phase, which is expected to pass quickly. Already, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of retracing its most recent all-time high, which signals a massive breakout is on the way. The best way to capitalize on these expected returns is to hold MUTM tokens at the current low price and await this massive wave to come and take you to the top. Another reason for the optimism for the MUTM token price is that the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. Unlike other projects like Pi Network, where the team made the community wait for years, the Mutuum Finance developer team will hit the ground running. This launch is expected to stir up excitement in the crypto community and provide a great opportunity for feedback from future users. One of the direct effects of the beta launch is that it will push doubters to act and get their MUTM tokens. This fresh inflow of capital could push the price to new highs. By joining the presale now while there is still a massive 50% discount, you ensure that you get the full benefits of this expected surge. CertiK Partnership Mutuum Finance has recently announced that they are partnering with CertiK on a massive $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. This program will reward security experts who help identify vulnerabilities in the protocol and the overall ecosystem. To ensure rewards are distributed fairly, the program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. Those who identify the most pressing issues on the protocol will receive the biggest rewards. Whales in the crypto market, who are known for their due diligence, an ability to spot massive gains early, have already secured their token in the MUTM token presale. With tokens available at a 50% discount, this represents your best opportunity to copy the whales. However, the window is fast closing, and over 65% of the tokens available at the discount have already sold out. If you fail to act fast enough, you will have to contend with a massive increase in price in the next phase.

2025-07-08T01:12:10,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC’s Institutional Waves Are Building, Not Breaking","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Fund manager Jeff Dyment of Saphira Group wants you to zoom out and stop sweating the short-term charts. His thesis: Data points that suggest institutional bitcoin (BTC) buying is losing steam miss the bigger picture. In a note shared with CoinDesk, Dyment argues that fears of fading institutional demand for bitcoin are overblown, rooted in narrow snapshots of the market. Yes, ETF and corporate purchases have cooled recently – Michael Saylor's Strategy bought just 16,000 BTC last month, down sharply from December’s 171,000 BTC haul. But this, Dyment insists, is not a sign of decline. It’s a natural ebb in what he calls a “cyclical wave” of adoption. “Institutional flows often come in waves rather than a steady linear increase,” Dyment wrote. “Short-term demand fluctuations in the spot market are minor ripples on what is, in fact, a rising tide of institutional engagement.” Dyment points to the addition of 51 new corporate BTC treasuries in the first half of 2025 alone, equal to the total from 2018 to 2022 combined, and a 375% year-over-year increase in corporate BTC buying. Public companies now hold 848,902 BTC, or approximately 4% of the total supply, with Q2 2025 alone seeing 131,000 BTC added to their balance sheets. He also highlights the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs as further evidence of deepening institutional participation. BlackRock’s IBIT fund, now the largest in the world, holds 699,000 BTC, more than 3.3% of total supply, after becoming the fastest-growing ETF in history. U.S. spot ETFs have collectively captured approximately 1.25 million BTC , or roughly 6% of the total supply, in just 18 months since their launch, he points out in the note. Dyment's thesis is finding echoes in the options market. In QCP Capital's recent note, the Singapore-based fund pointed to whales that are continuing to build exposure to upside risk, snapping up September $130K BTC calls and holding $115K/$140K call spreads. “Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110K resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid,” QCP wrote in a Monday note. So while bears may point to stagnant spot flows and the nearly empty mempool as signs of fatigue , Dyment argues those are just surface-level ripples. Underneath, the tide is rising, and Wall Street, with its trillions upon trillions of regulated capital, is hungry for crypto. It's just not going to come all at once. BTQ Pushes Quantum-Safe Framework for Stablecoins BTQ Technologies has introduced the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN), a framework designed to help banks, payment firms, and digital asset platforms future-proof stablecoin issuance against threats from quantum computing. In a press release , BTQ detailed how the system could support quantum-secure versions of popular stablecoin models, including JPMorgan’s proposed USD deposit token (JPMD), by upgrading privileged actions like minting and burning with dual cryptographic signatures (ECDSA and Falcon-512), while preserving compatibility with existing token standards, workflows, and wallets. The launch comes as the stablecoin market surpasses $225 billion and lawmakers push for regulation with an eye on cybersecurity. The GENIUS Act, currently advancing in the U.S. Congress, would formalize federal standards for fiat-backed stablecoins and encourage quantum-safe architecture. BTQ, which has worked with NIST for over a decade, aims to shape those standards and position QSSN as critical infrastructure. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin fell 1.02% from July 6 at 22:00 to July 7 at 21:00, testing key support at $107,519.64 amid heavy selling, before staging a V-shaped recovery off $107,800 as on-chain data showed strong support clusters at $106,738 and $98,566 held by 1.68 million addresses, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis bot. ETH: ETH rose 1.67% amid volatile trading, swinging nearly 3% between $2,529 and $2,604 as support at $2,530 held firm, institutional inflows topped $1.1 billion, and above-average volume marked both the surge and subsequent sell-off. Gold: Gold dipped on a stronger dollar but rebounded on tariff-driven safe-haven demand, with central bank buying and de-dollarization fueling forecasts of a rally toward $4,000. S&P 500: Stocks fell Monday as Trump announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, sending the S&P 500 down 0.79% to 6,229.98. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose despite Trump announcing steep U.S. tariffs on 14 trading partners, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.36% as duties of up to 40% were outlined for countries including South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand.

2025-07-08T01:00:28,"Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned","The Global Money Supply has just hit a rare yearly growth rate of 9%. Here’s what followed for Bitcoin the last few times this signal appeared. Global Money Supply Is Currently Sharply Going Up In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about the latest trend in the Global Money Supply. The “Global Money Supply” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins—62% Held By Just 10 Whales Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the data for the year-on-year growth in the metric: As displayed in the graph, the metric’s value has recently been witnessing an increase, indicating that fiat supply is going up. “Central banks are flooding the market with fiat money,” notes the analyst. Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. “This is extreme and rare,” says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Interestingly, the Apparent Demand indicator has remained positive for Bitcoin even after these transactions, as Edwards has explained in another X post. This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). “Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand is still bullish,” says the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,400, up 0.7% over the last week.

2025-07-08T00:00:27,"Projected XRP Price if Bitcoin Hits $3.45 Million By 2030","Bitcoin’s performance has historically influenced the broader cryptocurrency market, often setting the pace for altcoins. If Bitcoin continues to double in value each year until 2030, it could drive substantial gains across the crypto sector, including for XRP. This projection, though ambitious, aligns with some market forecasts and long-term bullish expectations. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $108,000 . Should it sustain a doubling pattern annually, it would reach $216,000 in 2026, $432,000 in 2027, and by 2029, surpass $1.7 million. By 2030, its value could climb to roughly $3.45 million, representing a cumulative increase of around 3,100%. This outlook corresponds with previous predictions, such as one from Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer, who suggested Bitcoin could hit $3.5 million by the decade’s end. If XRP mirrors this percentage growth, the implications could be significant. With XRP currently valued at $2.28, a 3,100% increase would place its price at approximately $70.72 per token. While this is a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the potential upside should market dynamics remain favorable. XRP’s Correlation With Bitcoin and Market Behavior Although XRP and Bitcoin are different in utility and structure, their market prices often move in tandem. Over the past month, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has generally followed Bitcoin’s market direction. There was a brief exception from June 25 to June 28, when XRP experienced a sharp drop while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. However, since then, both assets have resumed similar movement patterns. This price correlation has both advantages and risks. When Bitcoin experiences upward momentum, XRP often benefits . Conversely, Bitcoin downturns tend to weigh on XRP’s value as well. In recent months, despite periods of divergence, XRP has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s trend, particularly during consolidation phases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs in the past five months, altcoins have remained mostly stagnant. This divergence has contributed to an increase in Bitcoin market dominance. However, some analysts anticipate a shift in this trend soon, as altcoins are expected to regain traction during what is commonly referred to as “altcoin season.” Outlook for XRP Amid a Possible Altcoin Recovery XRP, being one of the top altcoins by market capitalization, is well-positioned to benefit from any broader altcoin recovery. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins tend to follow, though often with a delay. If such a recovery materializes, XRP could see renewed momentum and price growth. If Bitcoin’s value increases dramatically over the next five years and XRP continues to follow its market trajectory, a substantial rise in XRP’s price is conceivable. Although market predictions are inherently speculative, the long-term potential remains compelling, especially for investors seeking exposure to top-tier altcoins influenced by Bitcoin’s performance.

2025-07-08T00:00:17,"Trader Says Matter of Time Before Crypto Breaks to New All-Time Highs, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin, Ethereum and One Other Altcoin","Widely followed trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that new record highs are bound to happen for the crypto market. The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins. According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we’re breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024. Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC . “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we’ll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. “The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it’s going to be providing a big move. Given that we’ve hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we’ll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor ( TAO ). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target. “TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

2025-07-07T23:30:27,"Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top","Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently – on June 16 – it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn’t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don’t rush to exit – historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC’s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action ​​The NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing? For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a “deceptive setup,” warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode forecasts BTC’s short-term peak at $117,000. At press time, BTC trades at $108,204, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining momentum. This scenario raises an intriguing question: which cryptocurrency will make the next big move? Readers will find an in-depth analysis of the current market trends and potential breakout opportunities for both BTC and ETH in this article. This spotlight analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , the leading crypto-native agency that blends media intelligence, strategic timing, and results-driven outreach to help web3 projects break through the noise and capture market attention at the moments that count. Bitcoin Eyes Upward Movement with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price hovers between a bit over $106K and $111K. Since last month, the value has increased by nearly 4%, showing signs of positive momentum. Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin testing the resistance level just under $114K, with further potential to reach nearly $119K if this barrier is crossed. This would mean a possible increase of around 12% from the lower price range. The coin's recent six-month gain of over 11% hints at long-term strength. Support levels at around $103K and $97K help cushion any downside. With such dynamic moves, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a growth opportunity. Ethereum on a Steady Climb: Will It Break New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently moving between two thousand four hundred and nineteen dollars to slightly over two thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. It's been on a gentle rise over the past week with a near two percent increase. Analysts see it challenging the next resistance level at two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars. If it manages to surge past this, the next target to watch is around the three thousand fifty-dollar mark. If achieved, this could mean an increase of about fourteen to twenty-four percent from its current range. As the crypto scene buzzes with anticipation, investors maintain a watchful eye on these key levels.

Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi — ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls “fairer deals.” By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House’s trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. “President Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,” Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz — CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , “Any decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.” Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on “the quality of deals, not the quantity,” but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin’s volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin’s trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC’s 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of “equal lows,” an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. “If buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,” one analyst warned. Still, there’s room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it’s the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump’s economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

2025-07-07T22:50:22,"TON Foundation clarifies that there is no official Golden Visa program","The foundation behind The Open Network (TON) has released a statement to clarify its role in a program that could have led to legal residency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , “TON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community’s interest and enthusiasm, it’s necessary to provide clarity.” According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,” the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE’s joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country’s ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: 🇦🇪 TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. – STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS – 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA – SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED – $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION 🚀 pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, “We fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.” This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk’s xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven’t always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country’s Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a “gold card” program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $18.09 Market cap $7.6B Trading volume $221.15M Circulating supply 422.2M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $18.59 24-hour low $17.84 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.70% 50-day SMA $20.25 200-day SMA $22.65 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Avalanche price analysis As of July 7, AVAX’s price dropped by 0.03% in 24 hours and 12.99% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 54.02% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $26.84. Last month, it fell back below $19.00. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility has dropped. The relative strength index is at 44.03 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which has dropped from the recent high at $19.17. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 51.09; the William Alligator trendlines show falling price volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22.

It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March.

2025-07-07T21:56:58,"Russia Wants to Eliminate Tax Dodgers in Bitcoin Mining: Report","According to a local newspaper, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Federal Tax Service have compiled a “registry” that has been sent to regions with increased mining activity. An official of the Finance Ministry, Ivan Chebeskov, stated that despite certain laws being adopted, only 30% of miners had signed the official register of the Federal Tax Service since the end of 2024. A Step Forward In Regulation Local newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the country is actively working on developing more stringent legislation to reduce the improper use of the country’s energy grid. The previously introduced framework requires individuals and businesses interested in mining to register with the Federal Tax Service. Citizens can mine up to 6,000 kWh per month without entrepreneur status, but must register as such if they exceed the limit. In an interview with the paper, Petr Konyushenko, the Deputy Energy Minister, noted that this is a step in the right direction for taxation and legalization (translated in English by Google): “The creation of such a register will allow for the precise identification of consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary for applying special regulation and taxation to them.” Two laws were signed by Putin in late 2024, one of which outlines key terms, such as mining and pools, and imposes requirements for registration and reporting for businesses. It also prohibits foreign nationals from mining in Russia while granting the government the right to restrict mining in specific areas. The second law outlines the rules governing the circulation of digital currency and establishes regulations for mining activities . Despite these legislations being signed into law, no clear regulations have been introduced, according to the chief analyst of local exchange BestChange, Nikita Zuborev: “The full legalization of mining has not happened. Instead, it can be said that some norms have been established by law that simplifies control over industrial mining,” Current Regulatory Landscape In Russia Due to the conflict with Ukraine that began in early 2022, the country has been facing serious sanctions from the European Union. As a consequence, some well-known exchanges, such as Deribit, had to cease providing their services to nationals unless certain specific requirements were met. Some of these requirements include Russian citizens with dual citizenship to other EEA countries, Switzerland, or individuals who permanently reside in either of these regions. Native companies were completely exempt from using the exchange. A ban was also enforced for the winter months, restricting mining in several regions to avoid blackouts. These restrictions vary between areas controlled by Russia and Ukraine and have different timeframes, from as early as March this year to as late as March 3031. Some will remain on an annual basis as well. The Russian power company PAO Rosseti has begun exploring the hosting of mining infrastructure by utilizing the country’s idle power. Although cryptocurrency mining is deemed legal, trading of them remains illegal as of this moment. CryptoPotato has previously reported that, despite these hurdles, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is seeing notable adoption from institutions.

Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.
