2025-07-08T00:30:29,"Something Big Is Coming For XRP On July 9—Here’s Why It Matters","Two days from now, the US Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee will give the XRP army its most closely watched stage since the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission began. At 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 9, the panel will convene in Dirksen 538 for a hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets.” The session will be webcast live and—crucially for XRP holders—will feature Ripple Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse alongside Blockchain Association chief executive (and former CFTC commissioner) Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin, and Paradigm general partner Dan Robinson. Committee staff have indicated that the discussion will focus on whether certain tokens should be treated as “digital commodities”—a category that would place primary oversight with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission. Why July 9 Critical For XRP? Garlinghouse enters the hearing with the wind at his back. On June 27 he announced that Ripple would withdraw its cross-appeal in the company’s long-running enforcement fight with the SEC, adding on X, “We’re closing this chapter once and for all.” The SEC is widely expected to drop its own appeal of Judge Analisa Torres’s July 2023 ruling, which held that XRP traded on secondary exchanges does not constitute an unregistered security—although the judge left a $125 million civil penalty in place for earlier institutional sales. The procedural détente has removed an immediate litigation cloud but left the larger statutory question—what is XRP?—squarely in Congress’s hands. That question sits at the heart of several bills now threading their way through Capitol Hill. The House last year passed the bipartisan FIT21 Act, while the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act of 2025 would expressly define tokens that achieve “functional decentralization” as commodities. In the Senate, Banking Chairman Tim Scott has set a self-imposed deadline to mark up a comprehensive market-structure bill by September 30. As he put it in a June 27 fireside chat, “I’ve been very clear that I believe the President’s mandate of moving the GENIUS Act immediately to his desk is in the best interest of the American people, and making sure that there is a timeline for market structure to be completed by September 30th.” Wednesday’s testimony will feed directly into that legislative drafting effort. Industry witnesses are expected to deliver sharply contrasting perspectives. In a preview on X, Mersinger wrote that “The United States urgently needs clear, comprehensive, and carefully designed rules for digital assets,” signaling that she will press lawmakers to codify CFTC jurisdiction over spot markets. Paradigm’s Robinson is expected to warn against rules that “lock in” incumbent custodians—concerns he has raised in prior testimony. Markets will have one eye on the policy debate and the other on XRP’s price tape. The token broke above $2.28 overnight after news of Ripple’s pursuit of a US bank charter , extending a two-week rally that options desks say is crowded with $3 strike calls. A formal Senate signal that XRP is more commodity than security could strengthen the (already very strong) odds for a spot ETF . For now, the only certainty is that Wednesday’s hearing will generate the most authoritative public record yet on how Congress plans to draw the line between securities and commodities in Web3—and whether XRP ultimately stands on the same side of that line as wheat, gold, and Bitcoin. At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/something-big-is-coming-for-xrp-on-july-9/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|US Senate|XRP Commodity|XRP news|XRP price",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T00:00:27,"Projected XRP Price if Bitcoin Hits $3.45 Million By 2030","Bitcoin’s performance has historically influenced the broader cryptocurrency market, often setting the pace for altcoins. If Bitcoin continues to double in value each year until 2030, it could drive substantial gains across the crypto sector, including for XRP. This projection, though ambitious, aligns with some market forecasts and long-term bullish expectations. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $108,000 . Should it sustain a doubling pattern annually, it would reach $216,000 in 2026, $432,000 in 2027, and by 2029, surpass $1.7 million. By 2030, its value could climb to roughly $3.45 million, representing a cumulative increase of around 3,100%. This outlook corresponds with previous predictions, such as one from Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer, who suggested Bitcoin could hit $3.5 million by the decade’s end. If XRP mirrors this percentage growth, the implications could be significant. With XRP currently valued at $2.28, a 3,100% increase would place its price at approximately $70.72 per token. While this is a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the potential upside should market dynamics remain favorable. XRP’s Correlation With Bitcoin and Market Behavior Although XRP and Bitcoin are different in utility and structure, their market prices often move in tandem. Over the past month, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has generally followed Bitcoin’s market direction. There was a brief exception from June 25 to June 28, when XRP experienced a sharp drop while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. However, since then, both assets have resumed similar movement patterns. This price correlation has both advantages and risks. When Bitcoin experiences upward momentum, XRP often benefits . Conversely, Bitcoin downturns tend to weigh on XRP’s value as well. In recent months, despite periods of divergence, XRP has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s trend, particularly during consolidation phases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs in the past five months, altcoins have remained mostly stagnant. This divergence has contributed to an increase in Bitcoin market dominance. However, some analysts anticipate a shift in this trend soon, as altcoins are expected to regain traction during what is commonly referred to as “altcoin season.” Outlook for XRP Amid a Possible Altcoin Recovery XRP, being one of the top altcoins by market capitalization, is well-positioned to benefit from any broader altcoin recovery. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins tend to follow, though often with a delay. If such a recovery materializes, XRP could see renewed momentum and price growth. If Bitcoin’s value increases dramatically over the next five years and XRP continues to follow its market trajectory, a substantial rise in XRP’s price is conceivable. Although market predictions are inherently speculative, the long-term potential remains compelling, especially for investors seeking exposure to top-tier altcoins influenced by Bitcoin’s performance.

2025-07-08T00:00:17,"Trader Says Matter of Time Before Crypto Breaks to New All-Time Highs, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin, Ethereum and One Other Altcoin","Widely followed trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that new record highs are bound to happen for the crypto market. The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins. According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we’re breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024. Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC . “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we’ll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. “The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it’s going to be providing a big move. Given that we’ve hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we’ll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor ( TAO ). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target. “TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

2025-07-07T23:30:27,"Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top","Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently – on June 16 – it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn’t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don’t rush to exit – historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC’s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action ​​The NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing? For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a “deceptive setup,” warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode forecasts BTC’s short-term peak at $117,000. At press time, BTC trades at $108,204, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining momentum. This scenario raises an intriguing question: which cryptocurrency will make the next big move? Readers will find an in-depth analysis of the current market trends and potential breakout opportunities for both BTC and ETH in this article. This spotlight analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , the leading crypto-native agency that blends media intelligence, strategic timing, and results-driven outreach to help web3 projects break through the noise and capture market attention at the moments that count. Bitcoin Eyes Upward Movement with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price hovers between a bit over $106K and $111K. Since last month, the value has increased by nearly 4%, showing signs of positive momentum. Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin testing the resistance level just under $114K, with further potential to reach nearly $119K if this barrier is crossed. This would mean a possible increase of around 12% from the lower price range. The coin's recent six-month gain of over 11% hints at long-term strength. Support levels at around $103K and $97K help cushion any downside. With such dynamic moves, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a growth opportunity. Ethereum on a Steady Climb: Will It Break New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently moving between two thousand four hundred and nineteen dollars to slightly over two thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. It's been on a gentle rise over the past week with a near two percent increase. Analysts see it challenging the next resistance level at two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars. If it manages to surge past this, the next target to watch is around the three thousand fifty-dollar mark. If achieved, this could mean an increase of about fourteen to twenty-four percent from its current range. As the crypto scene buzzes with anticipation, investors maintain a watchful eye on these key levels.

Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi — ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls “fairer deals.” By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House’s trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. “President Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,” Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz — CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , “Any decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.” Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on “the quality of deals, not the quantity,” but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin’s volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin’s trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC’s 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of “equal lows,” an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. “If buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,” one analyst warned. Still, there’s room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it’s the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump’s economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

2025-07-07T22:50:22,"TON Foundation clarifies that there is no official Golden Visa program","The foundation behind The Open Network (TON) has released a statement to clarify its role in a program that could have led to legal residency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , “TON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community’s interest and enthusiasm, it’s necessary to provide clarity.” According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,” the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE’s joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country’s ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: 🇦🇪 TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. – STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS – 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA – SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED – $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION 🚀 pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, “We fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.” This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk’s xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven’t always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country’s Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a “gold card” program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project.

2025-07-07T22:10:26,"Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?","Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $18.09 Market cap $7.6B Trading volume $221.15M Circulating supply 422.2M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $18.59 24-hour low $17.84 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.70% 50-day SMA $20.25 200-day SMA $22.65 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Avalanche price analysis As of July 7, AVAX’s price dropped by 0.03% in 24 hours and 12.99% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 54.02% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $26.84. Last month, it fell back below $19.00. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility has dropped. The relative strength index is at 44.03 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which has dropped from the recent high at $19.17. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 51.09; the William Alligator trendlines show falling price volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency.

At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22.

Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , CoinShares finds that inflows into institutional crypto investment vehicles in the last twelve weeks have pushed assets under management (AuM) to new all-time highs. “Digital asset investment products recorded inflows of US$1.04bn last week, marking the 12th consecutive week of inflows, which now total US$18bn. Price gains over the week pushed total assets under management (AuM) to a new all-time high of US$188bn.

Switzerland and Germany also provided inflows of $33.7 million and $38.5 million. Meanwhile, Canada and Brazil saw outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively. Bitcoin ( BTC ), as is the flagship crypto’s custom, enjoyed the biggest inflows, but this time, with a catch. “Bitcoin investment products saw inflows of US$790m last week, marking a slowdown from the previous three weeks, which averaged US$1.5bn. The moderation in inflows suggests that investors are becoming more cautious as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high price levels.” Ethereum ( ETH ) continued its 11th consecutive week of inflows, adding $226 million in inflows last week alone in a continued outperformance of altcoins. “On a proportional basis, weekly inflows during this run have averaged 1.6% of AuM, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%, highlighting a notable shift in investor sentiment in favor of Ethereum.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-07T21:56:58,"Russia Wants to Eliminate Tax Dodgers in Bitcoin Mining: Report","According to a local newspaper, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Federal Tax Service have compiled a “registry” that has been sent to regions with increased mining activity. An official of the Finance Ministry, Ivan Chebeskov, stated that despite certain laws being adopted, only 30% of miners had signed the official register of the Federal Tax Service since the end of 2024. A Step Forward In Regulation Local newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the country is actively working on developing more stringent legislation to reduce the improper use of the country’s energy grid. The previously introduced framework requires individuals and businesses interested in mining to register with the Federal Tax Service. Citizens can mine up to 6,000 kWh per month without entrepreneur status, but must register as such if they exceed the limit. In an interview with the paper, Petr Konyushenko, the Deputy Energy Minister, noted that this is a step in the right direction for taxation and legalization (translated in English by Google): “The creation of such a register will allow for the precise identification of consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary for applying special regulation and taxation to them.” Two laws were signed by Putin in late 2024, one of which outlines key terms, such as mining and pools, and imposes requirements for registration and reporting for businesses. It also prohibits foreign nationals from mining in Russia while granting the government the right to restrict mining in specific areas. The second law outlines the rules governing the circulation of digital currency and establishes regulations for mining activities . Despite these legislations being signed into law, no clear regulations have been introduced, according to the chief analyst of local exchange BestChange, Nikita Zuborev: “The full legalization of mining has not happened. Instead, it can be said that some norms have been established by law that simplifies control over industrial mining,” Current Regulatory Landscape In Russia Due to the conflict with Ukraine that began in early 2022, the country has been facing serious sanctions from the European Union. As a consequence, some well-known exchanges, such as Deribit, had to cease providing their services to nationals unless certain specific requirements were met. Some of these requirements include Russian citizens with dual citizenship to other EEA countries, Switzerland, or individuals who permanently reside in either of these regions. Native companies were completely exempt from using the exchange. A ban was also enforced for the winter months, restricting mining in several regions to avoid blackouts. These restrictions vary between areas controlled by Russia and Ukraine and have different timeframes, from as early as March this year to as late as March 3031. Some will remain on an annual basis as well. The Russian power company PAO Rosseti has begun exploring the hosting of mining infrastructure by utilizing the country’s idle power. Although cryptocurrency mining is deemed legal, trading of them remains illegal as of this moment. CryptoPotato has previously reported that, despite these hurdles, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is seeing notable adoption from institutions.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price up today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold above $1.5 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction July 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction July 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

The value of assets under management (AUM) reached a record $188 billion, according to a report by CoinShares. The trend of investment inflows into crypto funds has continued for the twelfth consecutive week since April. The trading volume for the reporting period was $16.3 billion, remaining roughly in line with the average weekly figure since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin-based investment products attracted $790 million in early July, which is less than the previous three weeks when inflows averaged $1.5 billion. The slowdown in inflows points to growing caution among investors as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high, according to CoinShares analysts. Ethereum products recorded their eleventh consecutive week of investment growth, raising $226 million at the beginning of July. On average, over the past seven days, inflows amounted to 1.6% of AUM, significantly higher than Bitcoin's 0.8%. According to the report's authors, this indicates a noticeable shift in investor sentiment in favor of the second-largest cryptocurrency. From June 28 to July 4, investments in Solana and Sui-related instruments totaled $21.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Analysts noted that Solana saw its highest investment inflows in the past 69 weeks.

This means that they closely follow BTC's movements.” Wedson also said that 1,400 altcoins that were active in the market no longer exist. The analyst, who interpreted this situation as a positive development, said, “This is excellent news. Because only the most durable projects survive. This makes the market stronger. The more secure, fast and solving a real problem a crypto project is, the more valuable it is.” Related News: BREAKING: SEC Issues Update on Fidelity Solana Spot ETF Alphractal, an analytics company led by Joao Wedson, announced that Bitcoin has entered a new phase of discovery in terms of on-chain metrics.

2025-07-07T20:30:38,"Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know","The liquidity engine that has supported risk assets, including Bitcoin, since the beginning of 2025 is now shifting into reverse. According to macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets), the six-month upswing in Federal Reserve liquidity has ended, and a potentially destabilizing wave of debt issuance by the US Treasury is about to begin. In a post published on X late Sunday, Tomas warned: “ Federal Reserve Liquidity set to fall… The Fed liquidity upswing that began on January 1 2025 is now over.” Bitcoin Enters Danger Zone The catalyst behind this reversal is the recent $5 trillion debt ceiling increase passed by Congress last week. That legislative decision gives the Treasury Department the green light to aggressively rebuild its cash balance at the Federal Reserve—known as the Treasury General Account (TGA)—which had been intentionally drained to inject liquidity into the system during the first half of the year. “The US Government had previously been draining the Treasury General Account (liquidity injection). But a new debt ceiling agreement was reached last week ($5 trillion raise). This means the Government will start to flood the market with new debt to ‘refill’ the TGA (liquidity drain),” Tomas wrote. He emphasized that the refill target is currently set at $850 billion, up from recent levels around $350 billion, implying roughly $500 billion in liquidity will be removed from the system in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means The implications for Bitcoin are stark. Risk assets have historically benefited from rising dollar liquidity—particularly in the context of elevated ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and a weakening US dollar. But that backdrop is now shifting. As Tomas put it, “All else being equal, this TGA rebuild process should be bullish for the US dollar.” A strengthening dollar, when coupled with falling bank reserves, is generally a bearish environment for Bitcoin. The pressure on liquidity won’t necessarily come all at once, but the mechanics are clear. Treasury will issue large volumes of new short-term debt—primarily T-bills—to finance the TGA refill. This issuance will compete with other dollar-denominated assets for funding, draining cash out of banks and money markets. Tomas notes that this dynamic could be softened if money market funds rotate their cash out of the Fed’s Overnight Reverse Repo Facility, which still holds about $214 billion. “It’s possible that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could lower the target level, meaning less of a refill,” he adds. “I’d expect we may see a lot of T-bill issuance, which could tempt some of the remaining $214bn left in the Reverse Repo to leave the facility (liquidity injection) and lessen any negative impact of the TGA refill.” Still, even with some reallocation from RRP, Tomas expects the overall effect to reduce reserve balances—bank reserves as a percentage of GDP are likely to fall below 10%, he estimates. While this is not as dire as the 7% level reached in 2019 (which triggered the repo crisis), it represents a sharp tightening compared to the first half of this year. “There could be some funding stress around the end of September (end-of-quarter),” Tomas cautioned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap—Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Bitcoin’s performance has coincided with the exact window Tomas outlines as a liquidity upswing. As documented, Bitcoin’s price has closely tracked the direction of aggregate G5 central bank balance sheets and the level of US bank reserves. When those reserves shrink—especially in the face of stronger Treasury issuance and a rebounding dollar—Bitcoin has historically struggled to sustain upside momentum. This concern is compounded by Tomas’s warning that speculative short positioning against the dollar has reached extremes. “Back in January, I was shouting about a fall in the dollar. Now everybody and their mothers are bearish on the dollar, and positioning is massively short across the board. It’s time for, at the very least, an upward correction/consolidation for the US dollar, in my opinion.” Such a reversal in the dollar would mark a critical macro headwind for Bitcoin. The 90-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin and the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains firmly negative. In environments where the dollar strengthens—especially when driven by tightening liquidity—Bitcoin has rarely outperformed. The next several weeks will be critical. If Treasury proceeds with aggressive issuance and market participants demand higher yields, liquidity could tighten faster than anticipated. While Tomas does leave open the possibility that Secretary Bessent may adjust the TGA target downward, the baseline scenario remains a $500 billion net liquidity drain—directly reversing the conditions that allowed Bitcoin to surge. At press time, BTC traded at $108,148.

Where Are the Option Data Pointing?","Cryptocurrency analysis company QCP Capital published an important analysis of Bitcoin's performance and the general mood in the market last weekend in its latest evaluation report. Bitcoin held its price over the long holiday weekend before reaching a new all-time weekly close, reaching as high as $109,700 during low-volume trading on Sunday, according to the report. This rise came despite the transfer of around $8.5 billion worth of BTC by eight old Bitcoin wallets that went into action on Saturday. It was reported that $4.3 billion worth of BTC was sold in the middle of the week, and the price was around $108,000 at the time. QCP Capital said that these large-scale “bearish” transactions were largely ignored by the market, while “bullish” scenarios found strong buyers. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market It was stated that TON's “Golden Visa” rumors, which were denied by the United Arab Emirates authorities, and Elon Musk's criticism of fiat money, along with his announcement of a new political formation called “The American Party”, also contributed to the rise in the market. QCP Capital also noted that large investors such as Metaplanet and Strategy continued to make strategic purchases throughout the weekend. However, due to new sell orders from these large wallets, the price could get stuck in the current range and implied volatility could drop to record lows. However, it is stated that a new increase in volatility may occur if the $ 110,000 resistance level is clearly broken. It is observed that institutional investors are showing interest in September term $ 130,000 call options and continue to maintain $ 115,000/140,000 call spread positions. According to QCP Capital, this situation points to a structurally optimistic picture for the third quarter of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6053 Market cap $456M Trading volume $21.02 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6177 24-hour low $0.6028 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.08% 50-day SMA $0.6589 200-day SMA $0.6789 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (July 7), APE’s price dropped by 1.08% in one week and dropped by 0.69% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.60. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume fell by 41.26% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders.

APE price analysis shows the market had little momentum in the last few days. It should move sideways in the short term. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction July 2025 The APE July price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.79, with an average of $0.69.

The bank is revamping its private banking arm in preparation to serve its richest customers who are looking to spread their money around the world to protect their wealth, the Wall Street Journal reports . JPMorgan’s service requires a minimum balance of $10 million from clients and caters to investors who no longer want all of their wealth to just sit in their main country of residence. In addition, investors are reportedly becoming more concerned about the war in the Middle East, as well as America’s trade war against other markets, prompting a migration of wealth. Says Mary Erdoes, head of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management unit, “Our clients have always been multi-jurisdictional but now their assets are too, and that’s becoming ever more so with how the world is changing.” JPMorgan recently appointed David Frame to head the private bank, which is a new role within the firm. Frame noted that sports teams are one of the high-flying investments that the super rich are currently looking to park their wealth, and when Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck asked JPMorgan to find buyers for the NBA team, the bank contacted roughly 186 different clients around the world to solicit interest. “The wealthier you get, the more you feel you’re a citizen of the world… If that doesn’t happen with the first generation of a family, it starts to happen with the second and the third. There are borders for sports teams, but it doesn’t feel that way when it comes to the wealthy who are investing in them.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to a new CNBC report , scammers impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, getting away with over $250,000 in stolen Per the complaint , “The United States of America seeks to lawfully forfeit the Defendant Property to punish and deter criminal activity by depriving criminals of property used in or acquired through illegal activities; to promote and enhance cooperation among federal and foreign law enforcement agencies; and most importantly, to recover assets that may be used to compensate victims.” The scammers reportedly employed fake e-mail addresses to fool victims into believing they were communicating with co-chair Steve Witkoff. The US government is seeking to seize $40,000 in USDT. Half of that sum has already been collected from a Binance account under the name of Ehiremen Aigbokhan with an address in Nigeria. The U.S. Secret Service is reportedly launching a new campaign against crypto scams with a new team that specializes in digital financial crimes. Bloomberg reports that the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) uses software, subpoenas and spreadsheets to identify and go after criminals behind fraudulent crypto scams, including pig butchering operations that offer fake investments to victims. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the GIOC has already seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the last 10 years. The Secret Service itself is already one of the world’s biggest crypto custodians after leading crackdowns on digital currencies such as Liberty Reserve and E-Gold in the 1990s.

2025-07-07T19:53:52,"Calamos unveils ‘Protected Bitcoin’ strategy for institutional investors","Investment firm Calamos has unveiled a new investment strategy aimed at limiting Bitcoin’s downside potential. Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming increasingly attractive to institutions, but many still view it as too risky. In response, on June 7, global investment firm Calamos introduced its “protected Bitcoin” strategy , designed to limit both the downside and the upside of Bitcoin exposure. The firm noted that although Bitcoin has reached a $2 trillion valuation, institutional investors remain concerned about its volatility. As a result, most allocate just 1–2% of their portfolios to BTC to avoid outsized risk exposure. Calamos has structured its strategy to offer some upside participation while managing risk by combining Bitcoin futures with U.S. Treasuries. Specifically, the firm purchases zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds maturing at the end of the year. You might also like: Over a third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is in instituitional hands: report Calamos pairs treasuries with Bitcoin These Treasuries act as a protective floor in predefined worst-case scenarios, limiting losses to 0%, 10%, or 20%, depending on the risk tier. Simultaneously, Calamos buys call options on the Bitcoin Index to capture potential gains. To fund these, the firm also sells out-of-the-money call options, effectively capping the upside between 25% and 60%. Calamos risk-reward tiers | Source: Calamos Each risk-return tier is benchmarked to familiar asset classes. The 100% protected Bitcoin tier mirrors the risk profile of Treasuries, offering capital preservation with virtually no downside risk. The second tier is comparable to gold or alternative assets, while the third tier aligns with equities in terms of expected returns and volatility. Calamos believes this structured approach could enhance Bitcoin’s appeal relative to traditional assets. However, timing remains critical. Traders must hold positions to maturity to benefit from the downside protection; early exits could result in loss of principal. While rare, another risk includes potential sovereign debt default, which the firm notes is highly unlikely.

2025-07-07T19:50:31,"Bit Digital has gone all-ETH by selling all of its Bitcoin to acquire 100,603 ETH","Bit Digital has gone all-ETH after selling all of its Bitcoin. The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from BTC and acquired over 100,000 Ethereum, making it one of the largest corporate ETH treasuries. Bit Digital revealed its plans to focus solely on ETH staking last month. From a holding of 24,434 ETH as of the end of March, Bit Digital now has approximately 100,603 ETH worth approximately $254 million. Sam Tabar, Chief Executive Officer of Bit Digital said, “Bit Digital is aligning itself with Ethereum’s long-term potential and positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets. We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” This is not a first. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, dumped $561 million in Bitcoin holdings and reallocated the capital straight into Ethereum last month. THIS COMPANY SOLD ALL OF THEIR BTC AND BOUGHT $200M OF ETH Bit Digital just acquired $192.9M ETH after raising ~$172M from a public offering, and selling their entire holdings of BTC, worth ~$28M. Bit Digital now holds a total of $254.8 Million of ETH. pic.twitter.com/nV3P9vhZU8 — Arkham (@arkham) July 7, 2025 The possible gains and the risks. Sam Tabar asserts that, “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system. Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.” This move might offer a model for other mining companies. They can make money with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake method by locking up ETH to support network security. The returns are usually between 4% and 6.5% per year. This is a great option for traditional mining, which needs a lot of money. However, while Bitcoin miners can use different hedging techniques, staking Ethereum is directly exposed to changes in the price of Ethereum on the market. A big drop in the value of Ethereum could be very bad for the company’s finances, even if the staking rates are high. This method increases both the possible gains and the risks. Meanwhile, different markets initially had different reactions to Bit Digital’s news. The company’s stock price went down and hit a low point of $1.86. It then started to rise again after the company announced its strategy shift and sold 150 million shares. Ethereum has turned into a hot commodity for governments too’ According to recent reports, the United States government has deposited $218k ETH to Coinbase. According to analysts, the change in price projects investors’ uncertainty on whether the shift will work and if it will be financially viable in the long run. Ethereum vs Bitcoin mining Bit Digital’s move wasn’t entirely unexpected given the more challenging environment Bitcoin miners have experienced since last year’s halving. The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This reduction has led to significant declines in revenue and gross profits for miners. According to JPMorgan, average mining revenues have dropped by 46% since the halving, and gross profits have fallen by 57%. Also, BTC mining burns through electricity, and the miner must constantly upgrade hardware. On the other hand, Ethereum staking gives you steady returns with way less overhead. BTCS CEO Charles Allen states, “Ethereum staking, by contrast, offers cleaner economics — yield without the expensive energy costs and rapidly depreciating assets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-07T19:30:53,"Jack Dorsey releases details of his p2p messaging app Bitchat","The co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, announced the launch of a new decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app named Bitchat. The application is currently available on Apple’s beta‐testing service TestFlight. On Sunday evening, Dorsey shared Bitchat’s whitepaper along with a TestFlight link for anyone interested in trying the app. He said his weekend project was to learn about “bluetooth mesh networks, relays and store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things.” Bitchat works without the internet Bitchat’s whitepaper states that the application doesn’t rely on internet infrastructure. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks, which provide ephemeral, encrypted communication. This setup ensures the application stays operational even during internet blackouts or censorship. When somebody sends a message to another user, the message is end-to-end encrypted and it stays in the device memory. No data is saved on a server. Also, using the app doesn’t require a phone number or an email address. This makes Bitchat more private compared to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp that rely on Meta’s data servers. Since Bitchat relies on BLE mesh networks, each device acts as both a client and a server. Nearby devices (within 30 meters) form clusters. When a device from one cluster comes into the range of a device from another cluster, they act as a bridge, linking the two groups. This allows messages to hop from cluster to cluster until they reach their intended recipient. The whitepaper further dives into the messaging app’s architecture, protocols, and safety mechanisms. Source: Jack Dorsey via X. How does Bitchat enhance privacy? Bitchat injects dummy messages at random intervals of 30–120 seconds and it adds 50–500 milliseconds delays to real transmissions. This makes it statistically impossible for anyone to distinguish genuine messages or correlate timing with user activity. Messages do not stay in the device’s memory forever. The decentralized app saves any message for 12 hours for regular peers while the time for favorite peers is indefinite. So even if somebody gains access to a device, they can’t trawl through years of old conversations. Bitchat has no metadata leaks since there’s no centralized servers or a service provider who can see your messages or who you’re talking to. Instead, each node only examines a TTL (time-to-live) counter and a message ID. Nodes do not keep any record of who sent the message, who will get it, or when it was sent—just enough data to know when to stop forwarding. Bitchat provides uninterruptible communication channels in situations like protests or disaster areas where the internet may be down, overloaded, or actively blocked. Besides founding Twitter and building Bitchat today, Jack Dorsey co-founded and led Block (formerly Square). He backed decentralized social protocols such as Bluesky and Nostr. In recent years Dorsey drove the development of Web5 and other decentralized applications while advocating for Bitcoin adoption.
