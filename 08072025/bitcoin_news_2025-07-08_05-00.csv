2025-07-08T02:19:53,"Bitcoin Price Stalls Below $110K — Another Rejection for Bulls","Bitcoin price started a fresh decline from the $110,000 zone. BTC is now declining and might trade below the $107,500 support zone. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $110,000 zone. The price is trading below $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $108,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $106,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $108,500 resistance. BTC cleared many hurdles near $109,000 to start a decent increase but it failed to clear $110,000. A high was formed at $109,700 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $109,200 and $108,500 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $108,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $108,150 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,674 low. The first key resistance is near the $108,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,674 low. A close above the $108,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $110,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,000 level. The main target could be $115,000. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $108,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $107,500 level. The first major support is near the $106,500 level. The next support is now near the $105,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $104,200 support in the near term. The main support sits at $103,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $107,500, followed by $106,500.

2025-07-08T01:30:00,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Crosses $11.8 Million Milestone, Becomes The Top Crypto Under $0.5 This Week","In the fast-paced crypto market, one name has emerged as a game-changer: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is fast-gaining attention amongst investors and analysts alike as it powers through its presale. The only close match to the expected returns of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Bitcoin (BTC). From less than $1 over a decade ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a major force in the crypto sector and is now valued at over $107k. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market today to rekindle the massive returns that early BTC investors experienced. One of the main factors that is working in its favor is that it is built on the solid foundation of utility. In the crypto market of 2025, the push towards utility continues to gain momentum as hype-based meme coins lose out. Let us take a close look at MUTM tokens and why they could deliver the life-changing returns you have been looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to receive interest. Interests are calculated based on an annual percentage yield (APY). MUTM Presale Powers Past $11.8 Million The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised over $11.8 million from around 12,800 unique buyers. These figures are expected to continue rising geometrically as word of the success of the presale spreads. Tokens in the current phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the next phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This price increase is something you do not want to be caught up in. The reason for this is that the token price increase will wipe out the massive 50% discount currently available to buyers in the current phase 5. So far, many investors have rushed to capitalize on this massive discount, with over 65% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 already sold out. The pace has been blazing, with the tokens selling out barely a month after they launched. At the current pace, analysts rightly assess that the tokens will have sold out by the end of July. That means you need to act fast and direct capital into the presale in anticipation of the expected returns. MUTM Tokens Could Rise By 53x According to the latest estimates by analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 53x when they go live. That means if you purchase $1400 worth of tokens in the current phase, you could see your investment grow to over $74,000. It is worth noting that there is no upper cap on how much you can invest in the presale. Consequently, you could make some truly life-changing returns with the MUTM token presale. One reason why there is so much optimism for MUTM tokens is the expected crypto market rally. The crypto market is currently going through a consolidation phase, which is expected to pass quickly. Already, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of retracing its most recent all-time high, which signals a massive breakout is on the way. The best way to capitalize on these expected returns is to hold MUTM tokens at the current low price and await this massive wave to come and take you to the top. Another reason for the optimism for the MUTM token price is that the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. Unlike other projects like Pi Network, where the team made the community wait for years, the Mutuum Finance developer team will hit the ground running. This launch is expected to stir up excitement in the crypto community and provide a great opportunity for feedback from future users. One of the direct effects of the beta launch is that it will push doubters to act and get their MUTM tokens. This fresh inflow of capital could push the price to new highs. By joining the presale now while there is still a massive 50% discount, you ensure that you get the full benefits of this expected surge. CertiK Partnership Mutuum Finance has recently announced that they are partnering with CertiK on a massive $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. This program will reward security experts who help identify vulnerabilities in the protocol and the overall ecosystem. To ensure rewards are distributed fairly, the program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. Those who identify the most pressing issues on the protocol will receive the biggest rewards. Whales in the crypto market, who are known for their due diligence, an ability to spot massive gains early, have already secured their token in the MUTM token presale. With tokens available at a 50% discount, this represents your best opportunity to copy the whales. However, the window is fast closing, and over 65% of the tokens available at the discount have already sold out. If you fail to act fast enough, you will have to contend with a massive increase in price in the next phase.

2025-07-08T01:12:10,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC’s Institutional Waves Are Building, Not Breaking","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Fund manager Jeff Dyment of Saphira Group wants you to zoom out and stop sweating the short-term charts. His thesis: Data points that suggest institutional bitcoin (BTC) buying is losing steam miss the bigger picture. In a note shared with CoinDesk, Dyment argues that fears of fading institutional demand for bitcoin are overblown, rooted in narrow snapshots of the market. Yes, ETF and corporate purchases have cooled recently – Michael Saylor's Strategy bought just 16,000 BTC last month, down sharply from December’s 171,000 BTC haul. But this, Dyment insists, is not a sign of decline. It’s a natural ebb in what he calls a “cyclical wave” of adoption. “Institutional flows often come in waves rather than a steady linear increase,” Dyment wrote. “Short-term demand fluctuations in the spot market are minor ripples on what is, in fact, a rising tide of institutional engagement.” Dyment points to the addition of 51 new corporate BTC treasuries in the first half of 2025 alone, equal to the total from 2018 to 2022 combined, and a 375% year-over-year increase in corporate BTC buying. Public companies now hold 848,902 BTC, or approximately 4% of the total supply, with Q2 2025 alone seeing 131,000 BTC added to their balance sheets. He also highlights the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs as further evidence of deepening institutional participation. BlackRock’s IBIT fund, now the largest in the world, holds 699,000 BTC, more than 3.3% of total supply, after becoming the fastest-growing ETF in history. U.S. spot ETFs have collectively captured approximately 1.25 million BTC , or roughly 6% of the total supply, in just 18 months since their launch, he points out in the note. Dyment's thesis is finding echoes in the options market. In QCP Capital's recent note, the Singapore-based fund pointed to whales that are continuing to build exposure to upside risk, snapping up September $130K BTC calls and holding $115K/$140K call spreads. “Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110K resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid,” QCP wrote in a Monday note. So while bears may point to stagnant spot flows and the nearly empty mempool as signs of fatigue , Dyment argues those are just surface-level ripples. Underneath, the tide is rising, and Wall Street, with its trillions upon trillions of regulated capital, is hungry for crypto. It's just not going to come all at once. BTQ Pushes Quantum-Safe Framework for Stablecoins BTQ Technologies has introduced the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN), a framework designed to help banks, payment firms, and digital asset platforms future-proof stablecoin issuance against threats from quantum computing. In a press release , BTQ detailed how the system could support quantum-secure versions of popular stablecoin models, including JPMorgan’s proposed USD deposit token (JPMD), by upgrading privileged actions like minting and burning with dual cryptographic signatures (ECDSA and Falcon-512), while preserving compatibility with existing token standards, workflows, and wallets. The launch comes as the stablecoin market surpasses $225 billion and lawmakers push for regulation with an eye on cybersecurity. The GENIUS Act, currently advancing in the U.S. Congress, would formalize federal standards for fiat-backed stablecoins and encourage quantum-safe architecture. BTQ, which has worked with NIST for over a decade, aims to shape those standards and position QSSN as critical infrastructure. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin fell 1.02% from July 6 at 22:00 to July 7 at 21:00, testing key support at $107,519.64 amid heavy selling, before staging a V-shaped recovery off $107,800 as on-chain data showed strong support clusters at $106,738 and $98,566 held by 1.68 million addresses, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis bot. ETH: ETH rose 1.67% amid volatile trading, swinging nearly 3% between $2,529 and $2,604 as support at $2,530 held firm, institutional inflows topped $1.1 billion, and above-average volume marked both the surge and subsequent sell-off. Gold: Gold dipped on a stronger dollar but rebounded on tariff-driven safe-haven demand, with central bank buying and de-dollarization fueling forecasts of a rally toward $4,000. S&P 500: Stocks fell Monday as Trump announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, sending the S&P 500 down 0.79% to 6,229.98. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose despite Trump announcing steep U.S. tariffs on 14 trading partners, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.36% as duties of up to 40% were outlined for countries including South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand.

2025-07-08T01:00:28,"Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned","The Global Money Supply has just hit a rare yearly growth rate of 9%. Here’s what followed for Bitcoin the last few times this signal appeared. Global Money Supply Is Currently Sharply Going Up In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about the latest trend in the Global Money Supply. The “Global Money Supply” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins—62% Held By Just 10 Whales Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the data for the year-on-year growth in the metric: As displayed in the graph, the metric’s value has recently been witnessing an increase, indicating that fiat supply is going up. “Central banks are flooding the market with fiat money,” notes the analyst. Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. “This is extreme and rare,” says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Interestingly, the Apparent Demand indicator has remained positive for Bitcoin even after these transactions, as Edwards has explained in another X post. This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). “Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand is still bullish,” says the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,400, up 0.7% over the last week.

2025-07-08T00:30:29,"Something Big Is Coming For XRP On July 9—Here’s Why It Matters","Two days from now, the US Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee will give the XRP army its most closely watched stage since the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission began. At 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 9, the panel will convene in Dirksen 538 for a hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets.” The session will be webcast live and—crucially for XRP holders—will feature Ripple Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse alongside Blockchain Association chief executive (and former CFTC commissioner) Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin, and Paradigm general partner Dan Robinson. Committee staff have indicated that the discussion will focus on whether certain tokens should be treated as “digital commodities”—a category that would place primary oversight with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission. Why July 9 Critical For XRP? Garlinghouse enters the hearing with the wind at his back. On June 27 he announced that Ripple would withdraw its cross-appeal in the company’s long-running enforcement fight with the SEC, adding on X, “We’re closing this chapter once and for all.” The SEC is widely expected to drop its own appeal of Judge Analisa Torres’s July 2023 ruling, which held that XRP traded on secondary exchanges does not constitute an unregistered security—although the judge left a $125 million civil penalty in place for earlier institutional sales. The procedural détente has removed an immediate litigation cloud but left the larger statutory question—what is XRP?—squarely in Congress’s hands. That question sits at the heart of several bills now threading their way through Capitol Hill. The House last year passed the bipartisan FIT21 Act, while the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act of 2025 would expressly define tokens that achieve “functional decentralization” as commodities. In the Senate, Banking Chairman Tim Scott has set a self-imposed deadline to mark up a comprehensive market-structure bill by September 30. As he put it in a June 27 fireside chat, “I’ve been very clear that I believe the President’s mandate of moving the GENIUS Act immediately to his desk is in the best interest of the American people, and making sure that there is a timeline for market structure to be completed by September 30th.” Wednesday’s testimony will feed directly into that legislative drafting effort. Industry witnesses are expected to deliver sharply contrasting perspectives. In a preview on X, Mersinger wrote that “The United States urgently needs clear, comprehensive, and carefully designed rules for digital assets,” signaling that she will press lawmakers to codify CFTC jurisdiction over spot markets. Paradigm’s Robinson is expected to warn against rules that “lock in” incumbent custodians—concerns he has raised in prior testimony. Markets will have one eye on the policy debate and the other on XRP’s price tape. The token broke above $2.28 overnight after news of Ripple’s pursuit of a US bank charter , extending a two-week rally that options desks say is crowded with $3 strike calls. A formal Senate signal that XRP is more commodity than security could strengthen the (already very strong) odds for a spot ETF . For now, the only certainty is that Wednesday’s hearing will generate the most authoritative public record yet on how Congress plans to draw the line between securities and commodities in Web3—and whether XRP ultimately stands on the same side of that line as wheat, gold, and Bitcoin. At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/something-big-is-coming-for-xrp-on-july-9/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|US Senate|XRP Commodity|XRP news|XRP price",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T00:00:27,"Projected XRP Price if Bitcoin Hits $3.45 Million By 2030","Bitcoin’s performance has historically influenced the broader cryptocurrency market, often setting the pace for altcoins. If Bitcoin continues to double in value each year until 2030, it could drive substantial gains across the crypto sector, including for XRP. This projection, though ambitious, aligns with some market forecasts and long-term bullish expectations. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $108,000 . Should it sustain a doubling pattern annually, it would reach $216,000 in 2026, $432,000 in 2027, and by 2029, surpass $1.7 million. By 2030, its value could climb to roughly $3.45 million, representing a cumulative increase of around 3,100%. This outlook corresponds with previous predictions, such as one from Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer, who suggested Bitcoin could hit $3.5 million by the decade’s end. If XRP mirrors this percentage growth, the implications could be significant. With XRP currently valued at $2.28, a 3,100% increase would place its price at approximately $70.72 per token. While this is a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the potential upside should market dynamics remain favorable. XRP’s Correlation With Bitcoin and Market Behavior Although XRP and Bitcoin are different in utility and structure, their market prices often move in tandem. Over the past month, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has generally followed Bitcoin’s market direction. There was a brief exception from June 25 to June 28, when XRP experienced a sharp drop while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. However, since then, both assets have resumed similar movement patterns. This price correlation has both advantages and risks. When Bitcoin experiences upward momentum, XRP often benefits . Conversely, Bitcoin downturns tend to weigh on XRP’s value as well. In recent months, despite periods of divergence, XRP has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s trend, particularly during consolidation phases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs in the past five months, altcoins have remained mostly stagnant. This divergence has contributed to an increase in Bitcoin market dominance. However, some analysts anticipate a shift in this trend soon, as altcoins are expected to regain traction during what is commonly referred to as “altcoin season.” Outlook for XRP Amid a Possible Altcoin Recovery XRP, being one of the top altcoins by market capitalization, is well-positioned to benefit from any broader altcoin recovery. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins tend to follow, though often with a delay. If such a recovery materializes, XRP could see renewed momentum and price growth. If Bitcoin’s value increases dramatically over the next five years and XRP continues to follow its market trajectory, a substantial rise in XRP’s price is conceivable. Although market predictions are inherently speculative, the long-term potential remains compelling, especially for investors seeking exposure to top-tier altcoins influenced by Bitcoin’s performance.

2025-07-08T00:00:17,"Trader Says Matter of Time Before Crypto Breaks to New All-Time Highs, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin, Ethereum and One Other Altcoin","Widely followed trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that new record highs are bound to happen for the crypto market. The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins. According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we’re breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024. Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC . “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we’ll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. “The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it’s going to be providing a big move. Given that we’ve hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we’ll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor ( TAO ). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target. “TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

2025-07-07T23:30:27,"Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top","Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently – on June 16 – it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn’t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don’t rush to exit – historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC’s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action ​​The NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing? For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a “deceptive setup,” warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode forecasts BTC’s short-term peak at $117,000. At press time, BTC trades at $108,204, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining momentum. This scenario raises an intriguing question: which cryptocurrency will make the next big move? Readers will find an in-depth analysis of the current market trends and potential breakout opportunities for both BTC and ETH in this article. This spotlight analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , the leading crypto-native agency that blends media intelligence, strategic timing, and results-driven outreach to help web3 projects break through the noise and capture market attention at the moments that count. Bitcoin Eyes Upward Movement with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price hovers between a bit over $106K and $111K. Since last month, the value has increased by nearly 4%, showing signs of positive momentum. Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin testing the resistance level just under $114K, with further potential to reach nearly $119K if this barrier is crossed. This would mean a possible increase of around 12% from the lower price range. The coin's recent six-month gain of over 11% hints at long-term strength. Support levels at around $103K and $97K help cushion any downside. With such dynamic moves, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a growth opportunity. Ethereum on a Steady Climb: Will It Break New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently moving between two thousand four hundred and nineteen dollars to slightly over two thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. It's been on a gentle rise over the past week with a near two percent increase. Analysts see it challenging the next resistance level at two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars. If it manages to surge past this, the next target to watch is around the three thousand fifty-dollar mark. If achieved, this could mean an increase of about fourteen to twenty-four percent from its current range. As the crypto scene buzzes with anticipation, investors maintain a watchful eye on these key levels.

2025-07-07T22:52:06,"Bitcoin Crashes on Trump’s New Trade War Threat—August 1 Could Be the Day Everything Breaks","Financial markets reeled on Monday as President Donald Trump reignited fears of a global trade war, triggering a ripple effect that extended into the crypto sector. Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi — ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls “fairer deals.” By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House’s trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. “President Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,” Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz — CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , “Any decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.” Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on “the quality of deals, not the quantity,” but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin’s volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin’s trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC’s 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of “equal lows,” an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. “If buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,” one analyst warned. Still, there’s room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it’s the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump’s economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

2025-07-07T22:50:22,"TON Foundation clarifies that there is no official Golden Visa program","The foundation behind The Open Network (TON) has released a statement to clarify its role in a program that could have led to legal residency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , “TON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community’s interest and enthusiasm, it’s necessary to provide clarity.” According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,” the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE’s joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country’s ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: 🇦🇪 TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. – STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS – 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA – SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED – $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION 🚀 pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, “We fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.” This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk’s xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven’t always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country’s Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a “gold card” program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $18.09 Market cap $7.6B Trading volume $221.15M Circulating supply 422.2M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $18.59 24-hour low $17.84 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.70% 50-day SMA $20.25 200-day SMA $22.65 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Avalanche price analysis As of July 7, AVAX’s price dropped by 0.03% in 24 hours and 12.99% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 54.02% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $26.84. Last month, it fell back below $19.00. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility has dropped. The relative strength index is at 44.03 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which has dropped from the recent high at $19.17. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 51.09; the William Alligator trendlines show falling price volatility. Avalanche technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 17.32 BUY SMA 5 18.38 SELL SMA 10 18.30 SELL SMA 21 18.01 BUY SMA 50 20.25 SELL SMA 100 20.70 SELL SMA 200 22.65 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 18.71 SELL EMA 5 19.32 SELL EMA 10 19.69 SELL EMA 21 19.74 SELL EMA 50 21.05 SELL EMA 100 24.36 SELL EMA 200 27.56 SELL What to expect from AVAX price analysis next? The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down?

At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22.

It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , CoinShares finds that inflows into institutional crypto investment vehicles in the last twelve weeks have pushed assets under management (AuM) to new all-time highs. “Digital asset investment products recorded inflows of US$1.04bn last week, marking the 12th consecutive week of inflows, which now total US$18bn.

2025-07-07T21:56:58,"Russia Wants to Eliminate Tax Dodgers in Bitcoin Mining: Report","According to a local newspaper, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Federal Tax Service have compiled a “registry” that has been sent to regions with increased mining activity. An official of the Finance Ministry, Ivan Chebeskov, stated that despite certain laws being adopted, only 30% of miners had signed the official register of the Federal Tax Service since the end of 2024. A Step Forward In Regulation Local newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the country is actively working on developing more stringent legislation to reduce the improper use of the country’s energy grid. The previously introduced framework requires individuals and businesses interested in mining to register with the Federal Tax Service. Citizens can mine up to 6,000 kWh per month without entrepreneur status, but must register as such if they exceed the limit. In an interview with the paper, Petr Konyushenko, the Deputy Energy Minister, noted that this is a step in the right direction for taxation and legalization (translated in English by Google): “The creation of such a register will allow for the precise identification of consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary for applying special regulation and taxation to them.” Two laws were signed by Putin in late 2024, one of which outlines key terms, such as mining and pools, and imposes requirements for registration and reporting for businesses. It also prohibits foreign nationals from mining in Russia while granting the government the right to restrict mining in specific areas. The second law outlines the rules governing the circulation of digital currency and establishes regulations for mining activities . Despite these legislations being signed into law, no clear regulations have been introduced, according to the chief analyst of local exchange BestChange, Nikita Zuborev: “The full legalization of mining has not happened. Instead, it can be said that some norms have been established by law that simplifies control over industrial mining,” Current Regulatory Landscape In Russia Due to the conflict with Ukraine that began in early 2022, the country has been facing serious sanctions from the European Union. As a consequence, some well-known exchanges, such as Deribit, had to cease providing their services to nationals unless certain specific requirements were met. Some of these requirements include Russian citizens with dual citizenship to other EEA countries, Switzerland, or individuals who permanently reside in either of these regions. Native companies were completely exempt from using the exchange. A ban was also enforced for the winter months, restricting mining in several regions to avoid blackouts. These restrictions vary between areas controlled by Russia and Ukraine and have different timeframes, from as early as March this year to as late as March 3031. Some will remain on an annual basis as well. The Russian power company PAO Rosseti has begun exploring the hosting of mining infrastructure by utilizing the country’s idle power. Although cryptocurrency mining is deemed legal, trading of them remains illegal as of this moment. CryptoPotato has previously reported that, despite these hurdles, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is seeing notable adoption from institutions.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price up today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold above $1.5 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction July 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8.

This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

2025-07-07T20:57:16,"CoinShares: Crypto Funds Maintain Inflows Above $1 Billion Per Week","Cryptocurrency funds attracted $1.04 billion from June 28 to July 4. The value of assets under management (AUM) reached a record $188 billion, according to a report by CoinShares. The trend of investment inflows into crypto funds has continued for the twelfth consecutive week since April. The trading volume for the reporting period was $16.3 billion, remaining roughly in line with the average weekly figure since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin-based investment products attracted $790 million in early July, which is less than the previous three weeks when inflows averaged $1.5 billion. The slowdown in inflows points to growing caution among investors as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high, according to CoinShares analysts. Ethereum products recorded their eleventh consecutive week of investment growth, raising $226 million at the beginning of July. On average, over the past seven days, inflows amounted to 1.6% of AUM, significantly higher than Bitcoin's 0.8%. According to the report's authors, this indicates a noticeable shift in investor sentiment in favor of the second-largest cryptocurrency. From June 28 to July 4, investments in Solana and Sui-related instruments totaled $21.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Analysts noted that Solana saw its highest investment inflows in the past 69 weeks. By region, the U.S. led with inflows of $1 billion, followed by Germany ($38.5 million) and Switzerland ($33.7 million). Canada and Brazil saw outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9836/coin-shares-crypto-funds-maintain-inflows-above-1-billion-per-week,"BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|ETH|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

They Are Following Closely”","Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson and his CEO, the analytics firm Alphractal, made remarkable assessments regarding the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. Wedson provided important data on correlation changes in the market and the future of altcoins. Joao Wedson stated in his statement that altcoins have started to follow Bitcoin's footsteps again. Stating that the correlation between XRP and BTC decreased by 10% from 0.79% to 0.70%, Wedson stated that Solana's (SOL) correlation increased from 0.53% to 0.75%. Wedson said, “ETH and THETA stand out as the altcoins with the highest correlation with Bitcoin. This means that they closely follow BTC's movements.” Wedson also said that 1,400 altcoins that were active in the market no longer exist. The analyst, who interpreted this situation as a positive development, said, “This is excellent news. Because only the most durable projects survive. This makes the market stronger. The more secure, fast and solving a real problem a crypto project is, the more valuable it is.” Related News: BREAKING: SEC Issues Update on Fidelity Solana Spot ETF Alphractal, an analytics company led by Joao Wedson, announced that Bitcoin has entered a new phase of discovery in terms of on-chain metrics. The company stated, “The SOPR Trend Signal is rising for the third time in this bull cycle. This is a never-before-seen situation.” The metric is used to analyze periods when investors are selling at a profit. “What’s unique about this signal is that it reflects market trends through on-chain behavior. If the blue line goes below the orange line, it could be a bearish signal. But that’s not the case right now, so we just have to observe and stay calm,” Alphractal said. *This is not investment advice.

The service is available on the bank's mobile app for all adult customers. The launch was preceded by the submission of an application to the National Securities Market Commission in March 2025. The bank independently holds client assets and does not engage third-party custodians. Users perform transactions themselves. BBVA does not provide investment advice. ”We want to make it easier for our retail customers in Spain to invest in crypto assets with a simple solution on their cell phones,” said BBVA's head of retail banking in Spain, Gonzalo Rodriguez. The service is compliant with the European MiCA regulation. BBVA previously launched similar services in Switzerland and Turkey through a subsidiary—in 2021 and 2023, respectively. Spain is the third market where the bank has launched this service, and the first where it is targeted directly at retail customers. Head of digital assets Francisco Maroto said BBVA will continue to develop business in this area. The bank plans to add new cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and real-world tokenized assets (RWA), such as bonds and ETFs, in the future. Other Major Banks Integrating Crypto Services BBVA is not alone in embracing digital assets. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered have also integrated cryptocurrency services, offering trading, custody, and blockchain-based solutions to their clients. This growing trend reflects the increasing demand for regulated crypto access within traditional banking, signaling a shift in the financial industry toward broader digital asset adoption.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9835/bbva-opens-access-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-retail-clients,"BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
