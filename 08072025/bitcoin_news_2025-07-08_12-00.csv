Trump’s Tariff Shock Sparks 4.5% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong start to the week, market sentiment took a sharp turn as traders adopted a more cautious tone. Early excitement around Pump.fun’s PUMP token cooled quickly after Gate.io mysteriously removed its presale announcement, which had briefly teased a $600 million target for July 12. Meanwhile, Bit Digital made waves by selling all its Bitcoin holdings and shifting its entire treasury to Ethereum, now holding over 100,000 ETH worth $254.8 million, making it one of the largest public ETH holders. But the real shock came, as the crypto market plunged 4.5% following President Trump’s unexpected tariff letters to 14 countries. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and especially Dogecoin tumbled, with the fallout spreading to crypto stocks and broader markets, triggering renewed investor anxiety. BREAKING: President Trump sends out more “tariff letters” with the following tariff rates announced today: 1. Cambodia: 36% 2. Thailand: 36% 3. Bangladesh: 35% 4. Serbia: 35% 5. Indonesia: 32% 6. Bosnia: 30% 7. Tunisia: 25% 8. Japan: 25% 9. South Korea: 25% These tariffs are… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 7, 2025 Tariffs Target 14 Nations—More to Come The new tariffs, ranging between 25% to 40%, will take effect on August 1, 2025. Countries like South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and South Africa were among the first to receive the notices. Trump justified the tariffs as a response to persistent trade deficits, warning of further hikes if retaliation follows. However, critics like economist Peter Schiff say these measures miss the mark entirely. According to Schiff, the issue lies more with U.S. competitiveness than unfair foreign practices. Trump's letters to Japan and South Korea demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of trade. Tariffs have nothing to do with America's trade deficits with either nation. Japan's tariffs on U.S. goods average less than 2%, and Korea's average less than 1%. Our trade deficits… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 7, 2025 While many agree with Schiff, other crypto users think that countries like South Africa and Malaysia are being targeted for aligning with BRICS and China, while pressure on Japan and South Korea aims to secure loyalty in key supply chains. Tariff 2.0 war is getting more intense. Rate Cut Hopes Fade as Uncertainty Grows Adding to the chaos, hopes for a Fed rate cut are fading. The CME FedWatch Tool shows chances of a cut by September dropping to 61.9%, down from 90% just weeks ago. Yields are rising regardless of trade war news, signaling that deficit spending is now steering the economy. With tariffs set to begin in August and the crypto market already reacting harshly, traders are bracing for more turbulence ahead. Crypto Implications Tariff deadline uncertainty has shaken investor confidence, weakening overall risk appetite, something crypto markets heavily rely on. As a result, price action remains choppy, with most altcoins already struggling to gain momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) took a dip of 1.56% below the $108K mark. After settling at $107K. Ethereum dipped slightly to $2,554, while XRP and Polygon bucked the trend with modest gains. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Solana saw deeper losses. Looking ahead, investor focus is shifting to the upcoming “Crypto Week” starting July 14, when key U.S. bills like the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act could shape the next regulatory chapter for digital assets. Stocks and Miners Join the Slide It wasn’t just crypto that felt the sting; stocks took a tumble, too. Bitcoin miners saw steep declines, and tech-related equities like MicroStrategy and Robinhood fell 2% and 1%, respectively. The Dow Jones dropped by 422 points, while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ also closed significantly lower.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-8th-july/,"ASIA|MARKET|BTC|ETH|BUSINESS","News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Its Digital Asset Task Force is preparing a new crypto policy report, which is expected to be submitted on July 22. This move follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January, focused on strengthening America’s position in the crypto industry and pushing the country closer to becoming the world’s “crypto capital.” Proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Funding The comprehensive crypto report may propose a fundraising plan for a strategic bitcoin reserve that does not increase the burden on taxpayers, as reported by industry insiders. However, the details of the report have not been disclosed yet. If, ultimately, the proposal for fundraising for the Bitcoin reserve is finalized, the American government will acquire even more power in the digital assets arena. The US’s leadership in the cryptocurrency sector will be redefined with a new crypto report. New Crypto Regulatory Report in the US The US federal crypto leaders David Hacks and Bo Hines, along with the senior officials from the Treasury, Commerce Department, SEC, and CFTC, collaborated to form a new crypto report for America.

This ambitious effort seeks to awaken $ADA’s dormant reserves, giving rise to an interesting debate among Cardano users. By incorporating $ADA, the Midnight token, and the top 50 Cardano native tokens, Hoskinson’s concept could establish a foundation for Cardano’s future in decentralized finance (DeFi). Backing $ADA and Native Tokens In a strategic X post, Hoskinson described a digital asset treasury to back Cardano’s ecosystem, departing from his prior contentious idea of maintaining a Bitcoin reserve. That concept had drawn skepticism, with detractors claiming it relied too much on a competing initiative. What do you guys think about a digital asset treasury for ada, the top 50 cardano native assets, and midnight? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 7, 2025 At present, Hoskinson is dedicated to Cardano, working on a treasury reserve that supports $ADA, the privacy-focused Midnight token, as well as prominent native tokens like SNEK, World Mobile Token (WMTYX), Liquid Finance (LQ), Minswap (MIN), and Indigo Protocol (INDY), according to CoinGecko data. Cardano’s Treasury Plan: Top 50 Too Generous? The proposed treasury aims to boost Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and stimulate total value locked (TVL), firming its position in the competitive blockchain space. By enabling synergy among high-ranking native tokens, Hoskinson looks forward to a prosperous, interconnected Cardano network. Yet, the plan has mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some users have hailed the proposal, while others say the top 50 would be too generous. One user pointed out that the treasury should not be holding the native token. A Defining Moment for Cardano Hoskinson’s commitment to activate Cardano’s treasury highlights his devotion to a dynamic, ready-to-use ecosystem. With $ADA and its native tokens at the core of this proposal, Cardano’s growth will be determined. Will this be the movement that propels Cardano to new heights?

According to the official press release , the over-the-counter crypto platform plans to use the funds generated from the seed round financing to develop and expand its team to accommodate the rise in institutional demand for infrastructure that reduces exposure to exchanges. The company prides itself in serving as a bridge that connects investors to crypto, while eliminating the need to deposit funds on exchanges for prefunding needs. Additionally, it also offers a solution to credit and settlement risk through real-time messaging and by coordinating collateral management. The seed round was led by Abu Dhabi-based venture capital firm Further Ventures. The round was also backed by representatives from major venture capital and web3 -focused firms including Virtu, XBTO, Blockchain Founders Fund, Fun Fair Ventures, and Humla Ventures. CEO of BridgePort, Nirup Ramalingam, said the $3.2 million seed funding round marks a “major milestone” in the company’s journey towards providing a solution for capital inefficiencies and risks associated with prefunding, especially in the crypto space.

Managing Partner at Further Ventures, Mohamed Hamdy, explained why the venture capital firm decided to invest in the middleware crypto platform. He believes that BridgePort’s mission to solve the problems and risks posed by prefunding and credit fragmentation is going to be vital for the future of the crypto industry as it sees an increase in institutional interest. “We see BridgePort’s infrastructure becoming foundational to the next phase of crypto market structure evolution,” said Hamdy in his statement. Once regarded as a backdoor option for settling off-chain, OTC platforms like BridgePort have shifted into a solution for traditional finance institutions like banks and corporations that wish to dabble in crypto without needing to commit funds into centralized exchanges . Keeping money on exchanges is often seen as a risk by institutional investors looking to play it safe. Crypto exchange exploits like the Bybit hack, DMM Bitcoin ( BTC ) and WazirX demonstrated how real the risk was for investors keeping large amounts of funds on exchanges.

2025-07-08T09:48:12,"AI Data: Unlocking the Future of Enterprise AI Through Strategic Data Consolidation","BitcoinWorld AI Data: Unlocking the Future of Enterprise AI Through Strategic Data Consolidation In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where blockchain innovations and decentralized finance are constantly reshaping industries, another seismic shift is underway: the profound impact of artificial intelligence on the very foundation of data itself. For anyone tracking the pulse of technological progress, it’s clear that AI is not just a tool; it’s a catalyst forcing a dramatic reshaping of the data industry. This transformation, marked by significant data industry consolidation , is driven by an urgent need to empower the next generation of AI applications. The success of AI hinges entirely on access to high-quality, well-managed AI data , and companies are now racing to acquire the pieces they need to build a robust foundation. The Unstoppable Wave of Data Industry Consolidation The past few months have seen a flurry of high-profile acquisitions signaling a clear trend: the data industry is consolidating at an unprecedented pace. Giants like Databricks and Salesforce are making strategic moves, with Databricks acquiring Neon for $1 billion and Salesforce snapping up Informatica for a staggering $8 billion. These deals, varying in size and focus, share a common goal: to secure the necessary technology to drive enterprise AI adoption. The underlying belief is simple yet profound: AI’s value is directly proportional to the quality of its foundational data. Without superior data, AI applications struggle to deliver meaningful insights or create real value. Enterprise VCs echo this sentiment. A Bitcoin World survey from December 2024 highlighted that data quality is a critical differentiator for AI startups. Gaurav Dhillon, former CEO of Informatica and current chairman and CEO at SnapLogic, emphasized this shift in an interview with Bitcoin World: “There is a complete reset in how data is managed and flows around the enterprise. If people want to seize the AI imperative, they have to redo their data platforms in a very big way. And this is where I believe you’re seeing all these data acquisitions, because this is the foundation to have a sound AI strategy .” This push for consolidation isn’t just about growth; it’s about survival and relevance in an AI-first world. Companies are realizing that their existing data infrastructure, often built over decades, simply isn’t equipped for the demands of modern AI. Why Quality AI Data is the New Gold Standard The success of any artificial intelligence endeavor, from complex machine learning models to advanced AI agents, is intrinsically tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying data. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a practical necessity. Imagine trying to train a sophisticated AI model on incomplete, inconsistent, or poorly structured data – the results would be unreliable, biased, and ultimately, useless. This fundamental truth is driving the current wave of acquisitions. For enterprises aiming to leverage AI for competitive advantage, investing in robust AI data pipelines and management systems is no longer optional. It’s the core differentiator. Companies are recognizing that fragmented data, residing in disparate silos, severely limits AI’s potential. The acquired technologies are seen as the missing puzzle pieces that can unify these data sources, clean them, and prepare them for AI consumption. This ensures that when AI applications are deployed, they are fed with the precise, high-fidelity data they need to perform optimally, delivering accurate insights and automating processes effectively. Navigating the Fragmented Data Management Solutions Landscape For the past decade, the data industry has evolved into a sprawling, often disjointed ecosystem. Over $300 billion was invested into data startups from 2020 to 2024 across more than 24,000 deals, according to PitchBook. This venture capital boom led to a proliferation of specialized startups, many focusing on niche areas or even single features within the broader data stack. While this fostered innovation, it also created a highly fragmented landscape. The problem arises when enterprises attempt to implement comprehensive AI solutions. The current industry standard, which often involves bundling together numerous disparate data management solutions , each with its own specific focus, proves inefficient and ineffective for AI. AI models require seamless access to vast quantities of interconnected data to crawl, analyze, and build applications. A patchwork of incompatible systems simply doesn’t cut it. A prime example illustrating this challenge is Fivetran’s recent acquisition of Census. Fivetran specializes in moving data into cloud databases, while Census facilitates moving data out. Prior to the acquisition, Fivetran customers needed a second company to achieve an end-to-end solution. As George Fraser, co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, explained to Bitcoin World, even though moving data in and out seems similar, the underlying technical challenges are distinct. This scenario highlights how customers are growing frustrated with a multitude of incompatible products, pushing for integrated solutions. Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst, now running SanjMo, his data trend advisory firm, notes: “This consolidation is being driven by customers being fed up with a multitude of products that are incompatible. We live in a very interesting world where there are a lot of different data storage solutions… but the one area where we have failed is metadata. Dozens of these products are capturing some metadata but to do their job, it’s an overlap.” This fragmentation has made the industry ripe for consolidation, with AI serving as the ultimate catalyst. Strategic AI Adoption: Benefits for Startups and Enterprises While the focus is often on the acquiring giants, this wave of consolidation also brings significant benefits to the startups being acquired. In the current venture capital climate, marked by a quiet IPO market and slower funding rounds, an acquisition often represents a highly favorable exit strategy. As Derek Hernandez, a senior emerging tech analyst at PitchBook, told Bitcoin World: “The best solutions are being acquired currently. Even if you have an award-winning solution, I don’t know that the outlook for staying private ultimately wins over going to a larger [acquirer].” For startups struggling to raise capital, being acquired provides much-needed liquidity and, in many cases, allows founding teams to continue building their vision with the resources of a larger entity. This symbiotic relationship benefits both sides: For Startups: It offers a viable exit in a challenging market, validates their technology, and provides access to greater resources, distribution channels, and talent. For Acquirers: It allows them to quickly integrate missing features, fill existing gaps in their data stack, gain a competitive edge, and improve pricing leverage by offering more comprehensive solutions. This accelerated path to enhanced capabilities is crucial for achieving widespread enterprise AI adoption . The Informatica deal, even with a slight haircut from initial discussions, exemplifies this win-win scenario, proving to be the best solution for their board. The Future of AI Strategy: Merging Data and Intelligence Despite the current acquisition spree, a lingering question remains: will this strategy of acquiring companies built in a pre-ChatGPT era truly facilitate rapid enterprise AI adoption in today’s dynamic market? Gaurav Dhillon himself expressed doubts, noting that the current AI landscape is only about three years old. He suggests that larger companies aiming for truly transformative AI innovations, particularly for the ‘agentic enterprise,’ will require substantial retooling. This brings us to a critical juncture for future AI strategy . If the company with the best data ultimately wins the AI race, does it make sense for data management companies and AI development companies to remain separate entities? Derek Hernandez of PitchBook posits a compelling future: “I think a lot of the value is in merging the major AI players with the data management companies. I don’t know that a standalone data management company is particularly incentivized to remain so and, kind of like, play a third party between enterprises and AI solutions.” This suggests a future where the lines between data management and AI development blur, possibly leading to a more integrated approach where AI capabilities are deeply embedded within the data infrastructure itself. The current wave of consolidation might just be the first step towards a more unified ecosystem where data and intelligence are inseparable. Conclusion: Building the Foundation for an AI-Powered Tomorrow The ongoing data industry consolidation is a clear indicator of AI’s transformative power. It underscores the critical importance of high-quality AI data as the bedrock for any successful AI endeavor. While the strategy of acquiring existing data management solutions is a pragmatic response to the immediate need for better data infrastructure, the long-term success of enterprise AI adoption may depend on even deeper integration and retooling. As companies navigate this complex landscape, the focus will remain on building robust, unified data platforms that can truly unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence. The future of AI is not just about algorithms; it’s about the data that fuels them.

Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Support Holds On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is bouncing off the ascending trendline support, with the 50-SMA at $108,146 providing dynamic support. The $108,941 resistance remains the ceiling to break. The recent price structure features small-bodied candles and long wicks, indicating indecision rather than rejection. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI sits neutral at 49.60, and no bearish divergence is present, suggesting momentum is steady but still searching for conviction. A breakout above $108,941 could drive BTC toward $109,727 and $110,561. Losing the trendline and 50-SMA could drag it to $107,323 or even $106,422. Trade Setup: Buy Entry: Above $108,950 on strong bullish candle Target 1: $109,727 Target 2: $110,561 Stop-Loss: Below $108,100 For now, Bitcoin’s technical structure remains intact.

Analyst CrediBULL Crypto highlighted the XRP/BTC pair's price action in his latest post on X. According to his analysis, XRP/BTC is now making its fifth attempt at a breakout at a level that has faced strong rejection multiple times in recent weeks.XRP's Fifth Attempt at 0.00002162 BTCNotably, the resistance zone is around 0.00002162 BTC. It has acted as a ceiling for XRP/BTC since early June. Each time the pair approached this level, it was rejected, resulting in four failed breakout attempts marked on the chart.The current move marks the fifth retest, and market watchers are speculating whether XRP can finally close above this stubborn level. XRP/BTC 4H chart by CrediBULL Rejection or Breakout?CrediBULL’s chart shows a horizontal barrier at the 100% Fibonacci level, which has capped every bullish rally for the past month. He suggested that a successful breakout and daily close above this zone could trigger a bullish continuation.In that scenario, the next major target for XRP is around 0.00002646 BTC, a level not seen since April.However, if history repeats itself, another rejection could pull XRP/BTC back toward the 0.00001938 BTC support level. This has served as the last line of defense for bulls. In particular, XRP has tested this support twice in recent weeks, rebounding shortly after each time.Broader Context: XRP Lagging Behind BTCWhile Bitcoin continues to maintain strong dominance, XRP has struggled to gain relative strength. The coin has found it difficult to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum in recent months. XRP’s price has remained largely around $2 for several weeks, while Bitcoin has been retesting its all-time high.However, the anticipated breakout from the current move could mark a turning point. Should XRP/BTC rally to 0.00002646 BTC, as CrediBULL's chart suggests, it would translate to a unit price of approximately $2.86. This puts XRP on track to challenge the $3 level.Overcoming the 0.00002646 BTC resistance would set XRP up to challenge the next barrier at 0.00003411 BTC, equivalent to around $3.70. This paints a promising path for XRP to potentially break its all-time high.XRP Could Still Reach $20–$30 Against BitcoinWhile these are short-term outlooks, CrediBULL has projected an even more promising future for XRP this cycle. Specifically, he believes XRP could reach new all-time highs against both BTC and ETH.Based on previous ATHs in the XRP/BTC and XRP/ETH pairings, he suggested that with Bitcoin at $100K, XRP could reach $22 or more. Similarly, with Ethereum at $5K, XRP could climb to $18.Interestingly, CrediBULL emphasized that these are conservative end-of-cycle targets, and BTC has already surpassed one of them. In parallel, he sees a $20–$30 XRP as a realistic and even conservative projection if XRP regains its prior strength relative to BTC or ETH.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/08/xrp-against-btc-nears-critical-resistance-for-the-fifth-time-in-30-days-will-xrp-finally-outpace-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-against-btc-nears-critical-resistance-for-the-fifth-time-in-30-days-will-xrp-finally-outpace-bitcoin,"XRP|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

However, the bulls stepped up at this point and didn’t allow another price drop. Instead, the cryptocurrency started to recover and quickly returned to $108,000. Moreover, it kept pumping and tapped a multi-week at $110,500 on the next day. These fluctuations, though, seem to be doomed from the start during this calm summer consolidation phase, and BTC went back down to $108,000 almost immediately. It spent the weekend there but started to gain traction once again on Monday morning when it jumped past $109,600. The scenario repeated once again, and bitcoin is now back to $108,000. Its market cap has slipped to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is back to 63% on CoinGecko. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE Heads South While yesterday was a good day for major altcoins, the landscape has changed slightly today, and most are in the red. Ethereum has slipped by around 1% but has remained well above $2,500. Similar minor losses are evident from BNB, SOL, ADA, SUI, and LEO, while DOGE and LINK have dropped slightly more. HYPE has declined the most from the larger-cap alts, having lost almost 5% of value on a 24-hour scale. As a result, the popular altcoin is below $38 now. The biggest loser from the top 100 alts is FARTCOIN (-8%), followed by SPX (-7.7%) and TIA (-7%). In contrast, TKX has surged by 11% to over $15. The total crypto market cap has shed around $20 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.420 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-08T09:30:25,"50% Bitcoin Price Crash On The Horizon? Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target","Despite the Bitcoin price holding up quite nicely above $100,000 and remaining very close to its all-time high levels, there continues to be expectations of a massive crash that would rock the market. Pseudonymous crypto analyst FriendlyRox points to a number of indicators for this, going from volume to momentum, all pointing to a possible price crash. What is the expected result of this? Losing the $100,000 psychological level and then falling to previous peaks. Bitcoin Price At Risk With Dwindling Volume And Momentum In the analysis, FriendlyRox highlighted the decline in major metrics such as momentum and volume as the major driver of the forecasted price crash. This comes amid bullish news dominating the headlines, such as institutions increasing their Bitcoin holdings and supply on exchanges falling toward new lows, meaning investors are choosing to hold for higher prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Explosive Breakout: $5,791 The Minimum Target–Analyst The decline in the volume has been apparent after the Bitcoin price had fallen below $100,000 before bouncing back up in June. So far, in the month of July, the Bitcoin trading volumes have trended lower, with data from Coinglass showing consistent daily volumes below $100 billion. At the same time, there has also been a decline in momentum, with the analyst pointing out a negative divergence in this metric. Furthermore, the Bitcoin price has also flashed a historical trend that has usually predated market tops. This is price reaching the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and then retracing. FriendlyRox revealed that in the past, whenever the price touched the 50 EMA and then extended back, it usually signalled a crash, and the Bitcoin price has done this now, extending even further. Other metrics that have also flashed bearishness include the RSI and the MACD, both of which are now showing a loss of momentum as they moved into the negative. All of these factors happening together at the same time have painted a pretty bleak picture for the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. BTC Bottom Targets With the lineup of bearish developments, the crypto analyst has predicted an approximately 50% from here. As volume continues to decrease and momentum slides into the negative, they expect that the Bitcoin price will be looking to retrace back to the 50 EMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The interesting fact here is that the 50 EMA falls below the previous Bitcoin price peak, putting it at $60,000. A crash of this magnitude would only be rivaled by the COVID crash in 2020 and the FTX-induced market crash back in 2022. But nevertheless, it would mean a wipeout for altcoins across the board. As for the timeframe for when this could happen, there is no definite timeline. Going by the analyst’s chart, it could take a couple of years for this to completely play out, with the analyst closing with: “Let us see how it unfolds.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/50-bitcoin-price-crash-60000/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T09:30:04,"Bitcoin Bulls Eye $120,000 – Will Falling Funding Rates Trigger The Next Breakout?","After a short weekend dip, Bitcoin (BTC) is back on track, continuing to follow both the increase in M2 global money supply and the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. While some analysts predict BTC may reach a new all-time high of $120,000 in the coming weeks, declining funding rates are raising some caution. Bitcoin To Hit $120,000 Soon? In an X post published today, seasoned crypto market commentator Ted Pillows noted that Bitcoin remains in sync with the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern and is tracking the growth in global M2 money supply. For the uninitiated, The M2 global money supply refers to the total amount of money in circulation worldwide, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money like savings deposits. It is a key indicator of global liquidity and central bank monetary policy, often used to assess inflation risk and economic growth potential. The analyst shared the following chart, showing M2 money supply growth (in white) leading Bitcoin’s price action (in blue). Based on the chart, BTC may climb to $120,000 in the coming weeks and potentially as high as $153,000 by October 2025. Fellow crypto trader Merlijn The Trader echoed Ted’s view, stating that BTC is “playing out the classic Wyckoff script.” Following April 2025’s false breakdown that saw BTC tumble to $75,600, the digital asset is now entering the “liftoff” phase, which typically features strong upward price movement. BTC Funding Rates Decline On Binance While the Wyckoff pattern suggests further gains for BTC, exchange data shows a different story. Specifically, funding rates on Binance indicate growing short interest among traders. According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, a significant number of traders are betting against the rally. However, if BTC’s price continues to climb, these traders may be at risk of liquidation. The analyst noted that a mismatch between funding rates and price action often triggers forced short liquidations or margin calls. Both outcomes can amplify upward momentum in price. Since Binance is the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, its funding rates often serve as a proxy for broader market sentiment. BorisVest explained: As Bitcoin continues to rise, these shorts face growing pressure and are gradually forced out of the market – either through liquidations or margin calls. This process accelerates the bullish momentum, creating a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. That said, the strong June 2025 US employment data showed no signs of economic weakness, reducing the likelihood of a near-term rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which could weigh on risk-on assets like Bitcoin. At press time, BTC trades at $108,435, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bulls-eye-120000-will-falling-funding-rates-trigger-the-next-breakout/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|funding rate|M2 global money supply|Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T09:30:00,"SEC Acknowledges Trump Media Bitcoin and Ether ETF","The ETF’s launch would coincide with the growing momentum in the crypto ETF space and speculation about a more streamlined SEC approval process. While Trump Media’s application progressed, the SEC delayed Fidelity’s Solana ETF by reopening public commentary. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to dominate the market, and even recently surpassed 700,000 BTC in holdings. Additionally, it drove 42% of last week’s crypto ETF inflows. Crypto investment products saw $1.04 billion in total weekly inflows, with Ethereum posting its 11th consecutive week of gains. Investor sentiment also still looks optimistic, buoyed by strong institutional demand, record AUM, and Bitcoin’s recovery. SEC Starts Review of Trump Media Crypto ETF The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally acknowledged Trump Media's application to launch a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), triggering the regulatory countdown for the agency to make a decision on the proposal. The ETFwill be listed on NYSE Arca, and give investors direct exposure to the two leading cryptocurrencies. It will allocate 75% of its holdings to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether. According to the filing, Crypto.com’s Foris DAX Trust Company will serve as the custodian, and Yorkville America Digital will sponsor the fund. The ETF’s valuation will rely on the CME CF reference rates , with Bitcoin tracked via the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and Ethereum via the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, unless otherwise decided by the sponsor. To boost security, the fund’s crypto assets will be stored in cold storage and held in separate accounts from other customers. This development happened during a wave of crypto ETF applications and speculation that the SEC may soon streamline its ETF approval process through a simplified listing structure. Under the proposed structure, issuers would only need to file a Form S-1 and wait 75 days, during which the SEC can object. Trump Media initially submitted its S-1 form for the crypto ETF on June 16, and this latest update indicates a step forward in the process. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s proposed Solana ETF was delayed once again by the SEC, which has opened a new public comment period. Interested parties now have 21 days to respond and 35 days to submit rebuttals. The application to list the fund was originally submitted by Cboe BZX Exchange on March 25. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that the delay was anticipated and tied it to the broader lack of clarity around a comprehensive digital asset exchange-traded product framework. Despite the delay, Seyffart still believes that recent SEC interactions, including requests for amendments to SOL ETF filings, should be interpreted as a constructive sign. While not approvals, the back-and-forth between the agency and ETF issuers means that there is ongoing engagement with the crypto ETF landscape. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Tops 700K BTC Another crypto ETF is also turning heads. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF surpassed a major milestone as it now holds over 700,000 BTC , valued at approximately $75.5 billion. This achievement happened after its $164.6 million inflow on Monday, bringing the fund’s total holdings to 700,307 BTC according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) launched in January of 2024, and it saw very rapid growth. In fact, it currently represents over 55% of the total Bitcoin held across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data from BlackRock’s own website shows the fund added 1,388 BTC in just two trading sessions, up from 698,919 BTC last Thursday. Since its inception, IBIT delivered a return of 82.67%. The success of IBIT is not only measured in holdings and performance. Reports suggest BlackRock is now earning more revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. This means that there is a dramatic shift in investor appetite towards digital assets over traditional equities. Demand for Bitcoin by major financial institutions continues to outpace supply. According to Galaxy Research , US Bitcoin ETFs and Michael Saylor’s Strategy together acquired $28.22 billion worth of BTC in 2025. This overshadows the $7.85 billion worth of new Bitcoin that was issued by miners during the same period. The aggressive accumulation outpaced supply every month this year except February, when the combined entities offloaded $842 million in Bitcoin. At the same time, regulators seem to be softening their stance on crypto-related ETFs. This regulatory momentum follows the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF , the first US ETF to offer exposure to a staked crypto asset. The product allows investors to gain exposure to SOL while also benefiting from its staking rewards. BlackRock Drives 42% of Crypto Inflows Cryptocurrency investment products continued to attract strong capital inflows last week, despite the heightened market volatility that affected major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a report from CoinShares , global crypto exchange-traded products recorded $1.04 billion in inflows for the week ending Friday, pushing year-to-date inflows to nearly $19 billion. This is a new historical record. Assets under management in crypto ETPs also reached an all-time high of $188 billion, up from $184.4 billion the previous week. Weekly crypto asset flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin products led the charge after bringing in $790 million, and accounting for 76% of the total inflows. However, inflows into Bitcoin products were still lower than the $1.5 billion weekly average that was seen over the previous three weeks. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill attributed this slowdown to investors adopting a more cautious approach as Bitcoin nears its previous all-time highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum investment products saw their 11th consecutive week of inflows, with $225 million added. Butterfill pointed out that Etheeumr’s weekly inflows averaged 1.6% of assets under management, outpacing Bitcoin’s 0.8%. A big portion of the total crypto inflows was funneled through BlackRock’s crypto funds, which brought in $436 million, or 42% of last week’s total issuer inflows. (Source: CoinShares ) The United States dominated regional inflows once again by bringing in $1 billion despite markets being closed last Friday for the July 4th holiday. Germany and Switzerland followed with inflows of $38.5 million and $33.7 million, respectively. In contrast, Canada and Brazil recorded outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million. Canada’s outflows happened in the same month that local issuer 3iQ launched a spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Despite the volatility, investor sentiment remained bullish, with the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index holding at 66, firmly in “Greed.” Bitcoin’s price dipped as low as $105,400 last Tuesday before rebounding above $110,000 by Thursday.

Gareth West was arrested in Quebec on behalf of American authorities and is now facing extradition to the United States to face fraud charges, reports CBC/Radio-Canada. West is alleged to have posed as a wealthy real estate developer while running a complex “grandparent scam network” that employed more than 20 people and included multiple call centers in the Montreal area. He faces charges in the US of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). West is alleged to have been the mastermind behind grandparent scammers since at least 2021. The scammers would allegedly phone older Americans, pretend they were their grandchildren who had been arrested or hurt, and say they needed cash right away. Scammers would connect the elderly victims to fake lawyers or bail agents and arrange for cash pickups. Some 23 of West’s alleged scammer employees were arrested in March. Police allege that documents they’ve recovered from the suspected scammers show they scammed $30 million during a span of about 67 weeks. West faces up to 40 years in prison if extradited to the US and convicted of the crimes.

2025-07-08T09:15:24,"Two Genesis Ethereum Wallets Reactivate After Nearly a Decade","Two Ethereum wallets that had remained untouched for almost ten years became active on Monday, transferring a combined 1,140 ETH valued at approximately $2.9 million. The wallets, starting with “ 0x27 ” and “ 0x7f ,” were created on July 30, 2015, aligning with the network’s “Frontier” mainnet launch. Records on Etherscan indicate these wallets received their initial Ether through “GENESIS” transactions, confirming they were funded at launch. When Ethereum debuted in 2015, it operated on a proof-of-work model similar to Bitcoin, allowing miners to earn rewards by securing the network. In September 2022, Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake system during The Merge, reducing the network’s energy consumption while maintaining its security and decentralization. Market data suggests that ETH has appreciated nearly 89,450% since these wallets first received their funds, reflecting Ethereum’s significant growth in value and adoption over the past decade. A Wave of Dormant Wallet Activity Across Crypto The activation of these Ethereum wallets is part of a broader trend of long-dormant wallets reawakening . Last Friday, three Bitcoin wallets inactive for 14 years moved billions in funds, and earlier this year, several Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallets transferred coins worth around $44 million, sparking renewed curiosity in the crypto community. These movements often trigger speculation regarding their owners and the reasons behind their sudden activity after years of silence. While some view these reactivations as signs of early adopters securing profits, others see them as potential indicators of shifting strategies among crypto whales as markets mature. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and New Proposals Meanwhile, Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve with recent technological upgrades and governance proposals. On May 7, blockchain developers launched the Pectra upgrade , which introduced smart accounts, improved scalability features, and higher staking limits. Following the upgrade, the price of ETH climbed from $1,812 to $2,540, according to CoinMarketCap. Vitalik Buterin, alongside researcher Toni Wahrstätter, proposed a gas cap for individual transactions at 16.77 million, aiming to improve the network efficiency and security. The proposal argues that this cap will enhance the network’s resilience against potential denial-of-service attacks and improve stability, while providing users with more predictable transaction costs.

Following the close of its underwritten public offering, Bit Digital now controls approximately 100,603 ETH, positioning the company among the largest public Ethereum holders globally, alongside existing institutional players such as SharpLink Gaming. As of today, Bit Digital has accumulated over 100,000 ETH. But we are not new to Ethereum, nor to our conviction in its opportunity. Since 2022, Bit Digital has been holding, accumulating, and staking ETH, with a belief from day 1 that it can become the dominant infrastructure… — Bit Digital, Inc. NASDAQ:BTBT (@BitDigital_BTBT) July 7, 2025 This strategic shift comes as CEO Sam Tabar doubles down on Ethereum’s long-term potential, describing the network’s programmable nature and staking yield model as foundational to the future of digital assets. The company has converted all of its BTC holdings into ETH, rather than maintaining a diversified crypto portfolio with a complete exit from its Bitcoin holdings as part of its new treasury approach. From Mining Struggles to ETH Accumulation Strategy Bit Digital’s journey to becoming an Ethereum treasury company began with mounting challenges in its traditional Bitcoin mining operations throughout 2024 and early 2025. Prior to the offering, the company held 24,434 ETH as of March 31 , 2025, representing an early commitment to Ethereum that predated its current all-in strategy. Bit Digital plans to sell its Bitcoin mining assets and to redeploy net proceeds into Ethereum, as a part of its transition to become a “pure play” ETH staking firm. #EthereumStaking #BitcoinMining #BitDigital https://t.co/PEbFYrdKDp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 B. Riley Securities led the underwritten public offering, which raised approximately $172 million in gross proceeds specifically earmarked for Ethereum purchases rather than traditional business expansion. “ We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system ,” Tabar stated in the company’s announcement. Beyond simple price speculation, Bit Digital’s strategy centers on Ethereum’s staking capabilities, allowing the company to generate yield on its treasury holdings while supporting network security. Company data shows Bit Digital already operates approximately 21,568 ETH in native staking protocols , earning 211 ETH in staking rewards during Q1 2025 alone. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining revenue plummeted 64% year-over-year in Q1 2025, with the company earning just 83.3 Bitcoin during the quarter, an 80% decline that accelerated management’s strategic pivot away from proof-of-work operations. Tabar’s vision extends beyond current holdings, with plans to “ aggressively add more ” ETH to establish Bit Digital as “ the preeminent ETH holding company in the world. “ Source: StrategicEthReserve.xyz Corporate Ethereum Adoption Gains Institutional Momentum Bit Digital’s strategic treasury reallocation contributes to a broader institutional momentum that is gearing toward Ethereum, as companies recognize the network’s programmability and staking capabilities as superior to Bitcoin’s store-of-value proposition. SharpLink Gaming currently holds the title of world’s largest publicly traded Ethereum holder with 188,478 ETH worth approximately $457 million, accumulated through a similar equity-to-crypto conversion strategy. SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the world’s largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum (ETH), after acquiring 176,271 ETH for $463 million. #ETH #Sharplink https://t.co/ynahjYt7Hd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust recently recorded 23 consecutive days of inflows, while Fidelity and other institutional managers poured over $21 million into Ethereum ETFs in recent weeks. Ethereum staking rewards provide a more compelling yield advantage over Bitcoin’s primarily store-of-value proposition, with over 35 million ETH currently staked , representing more than 28% of the total supply locked in smart contracts. Corporate adoption also appears to be concentrated among companies seeking alternatives to traditional cash management, and potential SEC guidance on staking components within ETF products could unlock additional institutional capital. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors describes Ethereum as a “higher beta” asset compared to Bitcoin, due to its foundational role in stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance applications. Stablecoin transaction volume, which primarily occurs on Ethereum’s network, could further drive significant demand for ETH as the market grows from $250 billion to a projected $2 trillion by 2028 .

2025-07-08T08:51:16,"Mexican hotel chain Murano adopts Bitcoin treasury and considers accepting BTC payments","Nasdaq-listed hotel franchise Murano decides to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, joining a global trend of companies inching towards BTC. The company is also considering accepting payments in BTC. According to a recent press release , the Mexican real estate and hotel chain has already made a starting purchase of 21 BTC prior to the announcement being made. At press time, the company’s BTC ( BTC ) holdings is worth $2.27 million. In order to carry out this new strategy, the firm plans to execute a standby equity purchase agreement of up to $500 million with Yorkville. Most of the funds raised from the sale of shares will be used primarily to stock up on BTC for its treasury. The company also claimed to be reviewing and exploring operational initiatives, including accepting BTC payments and the deployment of BTC reward programs in the future, especially with regards to its hotel operations. In addition, the Nasdaq -listed firm also plans to pursue sale and leaseback transactions to “unlock” the funds necessary for a long-term goal of Bitcoin accumulation. It claimed that it will not abandon its real estate and hotel management strategy, instead it will run both alongside its BTC strategy. Murano’s business model is similar to that of Metaplanet, Asia’s largest corporate BTC holder. Metaplanet started off as a Tokyo-based hotel management firm but is now mostly known for its Bitcoin-focused operations. In fact, Metaplanet still owns and runs a hotel in Tokyo that it plans to reopen under the name “The Bitcoin Hotel.” According to the company’s “ manifesto “, the hotel will be open to the public by the first quarter of 2026.

One of the real estate development projects mentioned include residential condominiums planned for the next phase of then firm’s ongoing Grand Island Cancun project. Chairman and CEO of Murano, Elias Sacal, said that the new Bitcoin treasury strategy will complement the firm’s core business model built upon the real estate and hospitality sectors. He hopes that the adoption of BTC investments would serve to enhance the value of the company’s holdings. “We see Bitcoin as a transformative asset that not only offers long-term growth potential but also strengthens our balance sheet against inflation and systemic risk,” said Sacal. Earlier this month, Murano joined an alliance of companies led by BTC Inc & Michael Saylor’s Strategy dubbed “Bitcoin for Corporations.” The aim of the alliance is to drive corporate adoption of Bitcoin among its members, led by the largest corporate BTC holder in the world.

2025-07-08T08:48:38,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bid-Ask Spread Tightens-Here What it Means for the BTC Price Rally","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bid-Ask Spread Tightens-Here What it Means for the BTC Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price has surged significantly throughout the past week and closed the weekly trade on a bullish note. Moreover, the levels marked the local highs above $110,500, which flashed the possibility of marking a new ATH above $112,000. Unfortunately, the bulls experienced exhaustion, causing the token to drop back below $108,000. With the second attempt failing, market participants now seem uncertain about the next price move as they wait for the price to break above the range before jumping in. Bid-Ask Spread Tightens The current price movement of Bitcoin may seem sluggish, but from a broader perspective, the bulls and bears appear to be reaching an agreement. The bid-ask spread is compressing, meaning there is not much gap left between them, hinting towards a potential trade to occur anytime from now. The data from Coinglass shows that the ‘bids,’ or the highest prices buyers are willing to pay, are around $106,300 to $105,550, while the ‘ask,’ or the lowest price the sellers are willing to accept, is around $108,400. The difference between the bid & the ask is called the bid-ask spread, and if the spread is small, it indicates higher liquidity (easy to buy or sell). It also indicates the demand for the token is rising, which is a bullish signal for the token. Alongside this, the balance on the CEX exchanges is also marking new lows every day, hinting towards strong optimism among the traders. What’s the BTC Price Game Plan for the Week? The Bitcoin price went up during the weekend and created a significant CME gap between $105,745 and $106,660. However, the current pullback has closed the gap, signalling massive bullish signals for the token. On the other hand, the current rejection raises some concerns but eventually, the BTC price is primed to mark new highs in the coming days. As seen in the above chart, the price broke above the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone. Meanwhile, the CMF continues to consolidate above 0, suggesting a decent money inflow onto the platform. On the other hand, the on-balance volume, the volume indicator, has been consistently rising, suggesting a constant rise in the buying activity. This, with a rising price trend, may offer a strong bullish case, and hence the BTC price is now believed to mark new highs anytime from now.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-bid-ask-spread-tightens-here-what-it-means-for-the-btc-price-rally/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The challenge stems from the underlying tokenomics of cryptocurrencies. Modern business relies on cooperative equilibrium to thrive. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson thinks the biggest challenge facing cryptocurrency growth is the lack of a cooperative equilibrium.

Hoskinson linked the highlighted challenge to the underlying tokenomics of cryptocurrencies, which makes them intrinsically adversarial.

2025-07-08T08:11:16,"“Crypto Week” agenda revealed and top bills to watch","The cryptocurrency market may be on the cusp of a major rally as US politicians prepare for the upcoming crypto week, which will be the first one of its kind. If successful, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could jump as the market embraces regulatory clarity in the industry. Top bills to be considered during the crypto week The US House of Representatives and the Senate will consider three key bills that could have a major impact on the crypto industry. First, there is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, also known as the GENIUS ACT . This bill has already passed in the Senate and is scheduled for deliberation in the House. It has gained significant popularity by focusing on the growing stablecoin industry, which is currently valued at over $250 billion. The bill sets the parameters to ensure the safety of customer funds. For example, it ensures that all funds in these stablecoins are backed by liquid assets like the US dollar and short-term treasury bills. It also maintains monthly reserve disclosures and annual audits. Additional provisions include allowing state supervision of certain tokens, while companies are required to ensure compliance with AML laws. The bill will have some winners and losers when passed. The biggest loser will be Tether, a company that is working on establishing its headquarters in El Salvador. As things stands, Tether does not meet all the conditions in the GENIUS Act since its reserves are in a combination of assets like the US dollar and other assets like gold. Tether has hinted that it will create a new regulated stablecoin focused on the US market. The top beneficiaries for the stablecoin are PayPal and Ripple, which launched regulated stablecoins like PYUSD and RLUSD. Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY) The CLARITY Act is another major bill that will be in the spotlight during the crypto week . This bill seeks to address one of the biggest issues in the industry in the past few years: jurisdiction. It specifically makes it clear who should regulate the crypto industry between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposal is that most crypto exchanges should register with the CFTC. It also establishes rules for disclosure, recordkeeping, and customer asset segregation. This bill has already passed in the House Financial Services and Agricultural Committees. It now needs to pass in the House of Representatives and in th Senate. Democrats have criticized the bill because of Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. Anti-CBC Surveillance State Act The other notable bill to be considered is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, which prohibits the Fed from testing, developing, creating, and issuing a central bank digital currency. It also prevents the bank from offering financial services to individuals itself. Republicans and some Democrats argue that CBCs will promote surveillance by the state. They also argue that the party in power may use CBDCs to spy on the opposition. This bill has passed the House Financial Services Committee and is yet to get the full floor vote. Remember the Infrastructure Week? The main risk with the upcoming Crypto Week is that it may turned into another “Infrastructure Week”, which happened in Trump’s first term. Trump aimed to use the infrastructure weeks to pass his $1 trillion agenda, which failed. It became synonymous with unfulfile promises in that administration. As such, there is a risk that some of these crypto bills will not pass in the House and the Senate.

According to Reuters , Metaplanet’s trading volume rose to 1.86 trillion yen ($12.87 billion) in June. Tokyo Stock Exchange data shows that the numbers are nearly double the 997.6 billion yen ($6.82 billion) in May. The firm’s June trading volume surpassed that of Toyota Motor and Sony Group on the prime market, while the top spot was taken by Advantest. Further, the company has been maintaining its top position since November last year, the report added. The hotelier-turned Bitcoin acquisition company is currently the world’s fifth-largest corporate buyer of Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s Tokyo-listed shares have surged more than 345% this year, after it made a “strategic pivot” to become a Bitcoin treasury firm in 2024. ロイター報道：メタプラネット、6月の売買代金は1.86兆円でスタンダード市場首位。トヨタやソニーなどプライム市場の大型株を上回る取引規模に。 pic.twitter.com/Bv12J2BbuY — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) July 8, 2025 Japanese Bond Market Chaos: Investors Turn to Metaplanet Due to Transparency Per Metaplanet’s website , the company now holds 15,555 Bitcoin worth $1.69 billion at press time. With Japan’s 30-year government bond prices dropping 45% since 2019, investors are increasingly looking into Metaplanet as a Bitcoin proxy, due to the instability in fixed-income markets. Analysts noted that despite the rally, the company’s market net asset value (mNAV) is reasonable and has room to grow. Additionally, Metaplanet has been transparent in providing Proof of Reserves for its Bitcoin holdings, unlike its peers. The company CEO, Simon Gerovich, has publicly released on-chain verification of the company’s BTC assets. This comes in contrast with the largest BTC corporate holder, Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, who recently called on-chain proof-of-reserves a “bad idea” that could pose security threats. On Monday, Metaplanet announced a 2,205 Bitcoin acquisition , the latest purchase in its aggressive accumulation strategy. Since early 2025, the company has expanded its Bitcoin holdings from just 4,000 BTC in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, a fourfold increase in its position in just four months. Crypto Community Raise Concerns Over Corporate BTC Treasury Strategy However, there is skepticism among the community around the sustainability of the growing Bitcoin treasury trend. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, noted that BTC holding firms may have shaky ground , as rising threats might erode shareholder value. VanEck exec @matthew_sigel warns Bitcoin treasury strategies could backfire, as firms nearing NAV risk eroding shareholder value through continued BTC accumulation. #VanEck #BitcoinTreasury https://t.co/jEINL4NuxY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 Besides, Glassnode lead analyst James Check, raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy.

He has been persistently seeking ways to put the ecosystem’s dormant ADA treasury to work, with a suggestion in a July 8 X post becoming the latest proposition. Recall that he had earlier proposed using a portion of the stash to buy Bitcoin or a native stablecoin, teasing that it would boost Cardano DeFi and TVL.New Proposal for Treasury UtilityIn the Tuesday tweet, Hoskinson sought the thoughts of the Cardano community on an ecosystem digital asset treasury containing ADA, Midnight, and the top 50 Cardano native tokens.Notably, this proposal bears a resemblance to his initial suggestions, but this time, he has looked inward. Recall that his call to buy and hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset sparked widespread criticism, with skeptics alleging that a top 10 project has found solace in another major rival. The proposal would see Cardano set up a treasury that includes the Midnight token and other high-ranking native tokens. Data from CoinGecko shows that some of the top Cardano ecosystems include SNEK meme coin, World Mobile Token (WMTYX), Liquid Finance (LQ), Minswap (MIN), and Indigo Protocol (INDY).Top 50 Too Broad?Interestingly, the proposal started a community discussion as proponents shared their thoughts. Notably, a few users emphasized that the top 50 Cardano native tokens would encompass a lot of random tokens without intrinsic use cases.A user stated that he is not a fan of using Cardano’s treasury to buy meme coins, while a few other reactions suggested that the proposal would be more productive if it focused on the top 20 or 25 Cardano-native tokens. Comments On Hoskinsons Proposal Comments On Hoskinson's Proposal However, while a handful of the reactions supported the proposal or something similar, a few others disagreed. For instance, a user favored Hoskinson’s initial idea of a stablecoin investment, insisting that Cardano should fix its stablecoin liquidity issues.Remarkably, Hoskinson’s proposals all aim at moving Cardano’s treasury from an unmanaged single-asset on-chain reserve to a multiple-coin off-chain treasury.

This forecast ties together market momentum, investor psychology, and broader adoption patterns within the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market, speculation grows regarding its long-term price potential. One prediction suggests that a major Bitcoin rally could ignite large-cap and meme-based altcoins alike. Ethereum's Potential at $18,500: Market Factors and Network Strength Ethereum remains one of the most widely adopted innovative contract platforms. Its position as the leading Layer 1 network for decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi supports ongoing demand for ETH. If Bitcoin were to climb to $300,000, market analysts expect Ethereum to follow closely due to historical correlations and investor rotations from Bitcoin profits into altcoins. Ethereum’s ecosystem strength lies in its network effect. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supports a broad range of applications across finance, gaming, and social platforms. Upgrades like the Merge and ongoing scalability improvements through Layer 2 solutions continue to enhance its efficiency. If institutional investment increases alongside a Bitcoin surge, ETH could benefit from capital inflows and renewed developer interest. Little Pepe's $3 Projection: Meme Utility Meets Layer 2 Technology The forecast also placed the meme-inspired token, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), at $3, presenting a dramatic rise from its current presale value of $0.0013. Little Pepe distinguishes itself from other meme coins by building on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network that prioritizes speed and low fees. Its $LILPEPE token functions as a utility asset, supporting staking, transaction fees, and ecosystem activity. For LILPEPE to reach $3, several market conditions must align. One critical factor would be a surge in user adoption fueled by community growth, influencer promotion, and viral interest across social media. Moreover, if Layer 2 usage expands in applications like gaming and microtransactions, demand for efficient platforms like Little Pepe could rise substantially. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $3.41 million by selling over 2.93 billion tokens, signaling strong investor confidence. Stage 1 launched on June 10 at a price of $0.001 per token and saw 500 million tokens sold, raising $500,000 within just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed with tokens priced at $0.0011, selling 1.167 billion tokens and raising $1.325 million ahead of schedule. The momentum carried into Stage 3, where tokens were offered at $0.0012—over 2 billion tokens were sold, bringing total funds raised to more than $2.5 million. Now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, Little Pepe is closing in on its $4.475 million presale hard cap. The meme coin also allows purchases through Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and card payments. This accessibility, along with its focus on zero taxes and high transaction speeds, adds to its appeal as a scalable and user-friendly alternative in the meme coin space. Conditions Required for a $300,000 Bitcoin and Its Impact on Altcoins The prediction centers on Bitcoin reaching $300,000, a level far above its current price. To get such a target, global macroeconomic conditions would need to favor risk assets. This scenario may include lower interest rates, increased inflation hedging, or rising institutional investment in digital assets. Capital inflows could also be achieved by spot Bitcoin ETFs, growth in corporate holdings, and the embrace of sovereign funds. In the past, altcoins followed the rise of Bitcoin when Bitcoin was experiencing a rally. This trend is referred to as altcoin season, with retail and institutional investors spreading investments across the board and generally gaining huge appreciation in the prices of smaller investments. In this regard, Ethereum and LILPEPE can also gain more attention, particularly if their utility and ecosystems are extended further. The movement of Bitcoin is usually a signal in the market. If the $300,000 target comes true, the total sum of all the crypto market caps would be higher than $10 trillion. In this environment, Ethereum can gain a larger share of this market, and well-utilized meme coins such as LILPEPE can do better because of speculative and viral marketing. Conclusion Ethereum's speculations at 18500 and Little Pepe's at three are based on the most optimistic view of Bitcoin. Although a hypothetical situation, it shows the level of interconnectedness that cryptocurrency markets find themselves in. When Bitcoin goes to new highs, Ethereum and tokens based on memes that have actual use might gain tremendously. Investors and analysts will still pay attention to the events occurring in macroeconomics, technological innovation (in blockchain), and regulatory policy to determine how probable a future it may be.

Users note that it has been a year with no refunds and no clear answers, and now the exchange is demanding a potential re-vote. With the next hearing on July 15, many are asking: When will they finally get their tokens back? July 18 marks one year since the big hack. A year later, victims are still stuck in the same place they started and are waiting, with no resolution in sight. Recently, just days before the July 18 hack anniversary, a user Romy Johnson filed a fiery 40-page affidavit demanding the return of unhacked funds. He accuses the company of hiding a Panama shell entity and shifting asset classifications. The key question now is whether this serves justice or if there is more courtroom drama ahead. Will Justice Be Delayed For Everyone? However, one user warns that the affidavit could yet again delay the WazirX Fund Recovery. He warns that this move could derail the entire recovery plan, which is designed to treat all users, hacked and unhacked, fairly. If approved, it risks leaving 45% of users with hacked funds waiting even longer. Thread: One affidavit could delay your #WazirX fund — again.

2025-07-08T08:00:18,"No New Bitcoin Buys: Strategy Takes A Breather After 3 Consecutive Months","Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), the Bitcoin proxy firm co-founded by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has made headlines once again on Monday, but not for its usual Bitcoin acquisitions, but for its notable absence of purchases during the week of June 30 to July 6. This marks the first time since late March that the largest corporate holder of BTC has not added to its impressive treasury, which currently stands at 597,325 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $64.71 billion. Strategy Bitcoin Investment Hits A Pause The lack of activity in Bitcoin acquisitions is surprising, especially given Strategy’s aggressive purchases over the past few months. These purchases have brought the company close to holding nearly 3% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. From April 7 through June 29, the company invested $6.77 billion in acquiring 69,140 BTC, averaging about $97,906 per coin. At current market prices, these investments have appreciated by 10.4%, now worth around $7.49 billion. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 In terms of trading, Strategy’s stock (trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR) saw a slight decline of 0.7% during morning trading hours, which is in line with the 0.8% drop in Bitcoin prices. As of this writing, MSTR closed the day at $395. This highlights the close relationship between the company’s performance and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the company’s stock has enjoyed a rise of 38.5% in 2025, outpacing BTC’s 16.1% increase and the S&P 500’s modest gain of 6.1%. Up To $4.2 Billion For Future BTC Investments In addition to this pause in BTC purchases, Strategy did not issue any new common or preferred shares during the specified week. However, the company announced a sales agreement to potentially issue and sell up to $4.2 billion in 10% preferred stock. According to Monday’s press release on the matter by the Bitcoin proxy firm, the proceeds from this sales agreement are earmarked for general corporate purposes, which include future BTC acquisitions and working capital needs. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target The new preferred stock, known as Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, will be sold in a “disciplined manner,” taking market conditions into account, highlighting the firm’s ongoing commitment to leveraging its financial strategies to enhance its BTC holdings, even as it temporarily steps back from direct purchases. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,855, marking a 1.5% decline within the last 24 hours, increasing the gap between the current price and its record by 3.5%. This follows a failed attempt last week to overcome the cryptocurrency’s most significant resistance level of $110,000 and establish a new all-time high above its current record of $111,800.
