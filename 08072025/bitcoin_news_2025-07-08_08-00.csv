After raising $172 million from investors, the company now wants to become the world’s biggest corporate holder of ETH. With over 100,000 ETH already in its hands, Bit Digital wants to go big & wants to accumulate more ETH. From Bitcoin to Ethereum Treasury Bit Digital recently announced that it had sold off all 280 BTC from its balance sheet, using the funds to buy Ethereum. But that was just the beginning. The company also raised $172 million through a public offering, and every penny of that is being used to buy more ETH. Before this major shift, Bit Digital had about 24,000 ETH. Now, it owns over 100,603 ETH, making it one of the biggest corporate holders. Ethereum can rewrite the entire financial system. We are aligning ourselves with Ethereum’s long-term potential. Bit Digital accumulated 100,603 ETH — and we intend to aggressively add more to become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.

He believes Ethereum’s smart contracts, growing use, and staking rewards make it a better bet for the future than Bitcoin. Following this announcement, Bit Digital’s stock jumped nearly 18% , trading at $3.48 and gaining more than 73% in just one week.

BitMine Immersion Technologies recently raised $250 million privately to build its own Ethereum treasury, stepping away from its previous Bitcoin-first plan. Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming made an even bigger splash by buying over 176,000 ETH for $463 million, becoming the biggest public company holder of Ether so far. Where’s ETH Price Heading? While Bit Digital doubles down on its Ethereum vision, the ETH price has been moving higher too. Meanwhile, recently it climbed above $2,550 and may aim for $2,650 or even $2,800 if momentum holds.

2025-07-08T05:41:29,"Analyst Says This XRP Resistance Could Trigger Price Rally to All-Time Highs","In the crypto market, structural technical signals can carry significant weight, and these signs suggest that XRP has recently moved into a potentially pivotal phase. According to a monthly chart shared by crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), breaking above the 0.886 logarithmic Fibonacci retracement level, positioned at approximately $2.258, could kickstart a major rally. The chart starts from 2017 to the present, and highlights XRP’s long consolidation phase between 2021 and early 2025, during which the price remained largely suppressed despite broader market fluctuations. This stagnation was followed by a breakout surge that pushed XRP beyond the significant 0.786 ($1.61) and 0.707 ($1.23) levels. $XRP monthly chart Break 0.886 log fib, making all time highs https://t.co/Whs31W09HF pic.twitter.com/AOVoFy2vrY — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 5, 2025 Multiple analysts have predicted an impending breakout , and a monthly close above $2.258 would draw attention to the full Fibonacci extension target near $3.32 and speculative higher targets extending to $8.29 (1.272) and $13.38 (1.414), should momentum persist. Historical Importance of this Resistance Level The 0.886 Fibonacci level is often viewed as the last meaningful resistance before an asset revisits its prior highs. For XRP, this level has held firm since its all-time high in January 2018. While other large-cap assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum reached new all-time highs in subsequent years, XRP has remained below its former peak, constrained by legal uncertainties and shifting investor sentiment. The digital asset closed above this level in January, when it recorded its highest monthly close ever , but market pressure held it down in subsequent months. Now, with momentum building , the digital asset could retest this level again. While XRP has not yet surpassed its historic peak, breaking this barrier would signal an end to its extended accumulation and position the asset in a stronger technical stance than at any point in recent years, setting the stage for a push toward a new all-time high.

The broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery throughout 2025, supported by improving macroeconomic conditions and increased institutional participation. Analysts have expressed confidence in XRP’s short-term trajectory, and ChatGPT’s forecast for July 31 suggests that it will breach the resistance level, as the AI tool expects the asset to trade at $ 2.50. XRP is currently trading at $2.27, sitting above the $2.258 level. If it can maintain this position or continue climbing throughout July, it may be the last time we see the digital asset at current prices.

2025-07-08T05:40:54,"SEC Acknowledges Truth Social’s Groundbreaking Bitcoin & Ether ETF Applications: A New Dawn for Digital Asset Investment?","BitcoinWorld SEC Acknowledges Truth Social’s Groundbreaking Bitcoin & Ether ETF Applications: A New Dawn for Digital Asset Investment? The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at the heart of this transformation lies the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrencies. For years, investors have eagerly awaited regulated, accessible pathways into this volatile yet potentially lucrative market. The latest news has sent ripples through the industry: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged receipt of applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) products from an unexpected player – Truth Social. This development marks a potentially pivotal moment for digital asset investment , signaling a new chapter in the ongoing integration of digital currencies into mainstream finance. What Exactly Happened? The SEC and Truth Social’s Bold Move In a move that caught many by surprise, the SEC , the primary regulator for the U.S. securities markets, confirmed it had received formal applications from Truth Social for both a spot Bitcoin ETF and a spot Ether ETF. For those unfamiliar, Truth Social is a social media platform launched by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). While the company’s primary focus has been on social media and media services, its foray into the cryptocurrency ETF space through these applications signifies a bold and intriguing diversification strategy. This acknowledgment by the SEC is a procedural step, indicating that the applications have been received and the formal review process will now commence. It does not imply approval, but it certainly puts these applications on the regulatory radar. Understanding the Landscape: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Why Does it Matter? To fully grasp the significance of Truth Social’s applications, it’s crucial to understand what a Spot Bitcoin ETF entails and how it differs from other crypto investment vehicles. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot Bitcoin ETF directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This means that if you invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF, you are essentially gaining exposure to the actual price movements of Bitcoin without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency yourself. This contrasts sharply with futures Bitcoin ETFs, which invest in Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the actual cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETF Futures Bitcoin ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds actual Bitcoin Holds Bitcoin futures contracts Price Tracking Aims to track Bitcoin’s real-time market price closely Tracks the price of futures contracts, which can deviate from spot price Custody Fund manager handles secure custody of Bitcoin No direct Bitcoin custody needed by the fund Investor Experience More direct exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price Indirect exposure, subject to futures market dynamics The significance of a spot Bitcoin ETF lies in its ability to democratize access to Bitcoin. It removes technical barriers for traditional investors, offering a familiar, regulated investment product that can be bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts. This dramatically expands the pool of potential investors beyond crypto-native individuals. The Journey to Acceptance: A Look at Past SEC Deliberations The path to a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long and arduous, marked by numerous rejections from the SEC over several years. The commission’s primary concerns consistently revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, a landmark shift occurred in January 2024 when the SEC finally approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, following a court ruling that challenged the basis of their previous rejections. This approval was a monumental victory for the crypto industry, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream adoption. The precedent set by these approvals is crucial for understanding the current landscape and the potential trajectory of new applications, including those from Truth Social. Ether ETF Applications: Following in Bitcoin’s Footsteps? With the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, attention has now firmly shifted to Ether ETF applications . Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a robust ecosystem supporting decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Proponents argue that Ether, like Bitcoin, is mature enough for a spot ETF, citing its increasing institutional adoption and the evolution of its underlying blockchain. Several major financial institutions have already filed for spot Ether ETFs, and the SEC’s acknowledgment of Truth Social’s application adds another interesting dimension to this developing narrative. While the regulatory hurdles for Ether may differ slightly due to its smart contract functionality and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the general sentiment in the market is optimistic, anticipating similar approvals down the line. Truth Social’s Play: A New Frontier for Digital Asset Investment? Why is Truth Social , primarily known as a social media platform, venturing into the complex world of cryptocurrency ETFs? This move could be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it might be an attempt to diversify revenue streams and capitalize on the growing interest in digital asset investment . By offering regulated crypto investment products, Truth Social could potentially attract a new user base interested in both their social platform and financial offerings. Secondly, it aligns with a broader trend of technology companies exploring Web3 and blockchain technologies. For a platform that champions free speech and aims to disrupt traditional media, embracing decentralized finance could be seen as a natural extension of its ethos. It also presents a unique marketing angle, potentially appealing to a demographic that values both alternative media and alternative investments. The question remains how the SEC will view an application from a non-traditional financial entity like Truth Social, given their strict scrutiny of financial products. Benefits of Spot Crypto ETFs: Unlocking New Avenues for Investors The introduction of spot crypto ETFs, including the potential ones from Truth Social, offers several compelling benefits for investors and the broader market: Enhanced Accessibility: These ETFs make investing in Bitcoin and Ether as straightforward as buying a stock, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, exchanges, or understanding complex blockchain technology. Increased Liquidity: Being traded on major stock exchanges, ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, providing a layer of investor protection and transparency that may be perceived as lacking in direct crypto purchases on unregulated exchanges. This is a key focus for the SEC . Diversification Opportunities: For traditional investors, spot crypto ETFs offer a simple way to diversify their portfolios with exposure to a new asset class, potentially enhancing returns. Lower Entry Barriers: Investors can gain exposure with smaller capital amounts compared to directly buying whole units of Bitcoin or Ether. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Risks for Crypto ETFs Despite the excitement, the path for crypto ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. The SEC ‘s historical reluctance stems from legitimate concerns that still persist to some degree: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations, which can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses for investors. ETFs do not mitigate this inherent volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the U.S. has seen some clarity with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the broader regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving. Future policy changes could impact these products. Custody Risks: While the ETF provider handles custody, the underlying risks associated with securing large amounts of digital assets (e.g., hacks, loss of private keys) remain, albeit managed by professional custodians. Market Manipulation Concerns: Despite improvements, the crypto market is still susceptible to manipulation due to its relative immaturity and concentration of ownership. The SEC remains vigilant on this front. Operational Risks: The infrastructure supporting these ETFs, including the underlying exchanges and custodians, must be robust and secure to prevent operational failures. The Road Ahead: What to Expect from the SEC’s Review Process The SEC ‘s review process for ETF applications is rigorous and follows a specific timeline, typically involving several stages. After acknowledgment, the applications enter a period of public comment, followed by a series of deadlines for the SEC to make a decision, which can be extended. For Truth Social’s Ether ETF applications and their spot Bitcoin ETF, the process will involve: Initial Review: The SEC staff examines the application for completeness and compliance with securities laws. Public Comment Period: The public, including industry experts and investors, can submit comments on the proposed ETF. Potential Amendments: Based on feedback and SEC inquiries, the applicant may need to amend their filing multiple times. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines (e.g., 45 days, extendable to 90, then 180, and potentially 240 days) to approve, deny, or delay a decision. Given the precedent set by previous spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, and the ongoing discussions around Ether ETFs, the market will be closely watching each stage of Truth Social’s applications. The SEC’s ultimate decision will hinge on whether the proposed ETFs meet the necessary investor protection and market integrity standards. Broader Market Implications: How Could Approvals Reshape Digital Asset Investment? If Truth Social’s applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Ether ETF applications are eventually approved, the implications for digital asset investment could be profound. Firstly, it would further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The entry of a high-profile, non-traditional applicant like Truth Social could signal a broader acceptance of crypto across diverse sectors. Secondly, it would likely drive increased institutional capital into both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially leading to greater price stability and market depth. Thirdly, it could spur more innovation in crypto-related financial products, as other companies seek to follow suit. Finally, it might encourage a more favorable regulatory environment globally, as other jurisdictions observe the success and impact of regulated crypto products in the U.S. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Should You Consider? For investors considering exposure to the crypto market through ETFs, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Due Diligence: Even with SEC-regulated products, understand the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ether), its volatility, and the specific ETF’s structure and fees. Understand the Risks: Recognize that while ETFs offer convenience, they do not eliminate the inherent market risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Only invest what you are prepared to lose. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on the SEC ‘s decisions regarding Truth Social’s applications and other pending crypto ETF filings. Regulatory changes can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Crypto ETFs can be a valuable addition, but they should be part of a well-diversified investment strategy, not the sole focus. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice, especially if you are new to crypto or complex financial products, seek guidance from a qualified financial professional. Conclusion The acknowledgment by the SEC of Truth Social’s applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications marks a fascinating and potentially transformative moment for the world of digital asset investment . While it’s merely a procedural step and not an approval, it underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and demand for regulated crypto investment products. Truth Social’s unexpected entry into this space adds a unique dimension, blending social media with financial innovation. As the regulatory review process unfolds, the industry will be watching closely, anticipating how these developments could further shape the future of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The journey towards fully integrated crypto finance continues, promising both opportunities and challenges for investors worldwide.

2025-07-08T05:30:36,"Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels","An analyst has pointed out three key resistance levels for Dogecoin that could be to keep an eye on, based on on-chain data. Dogecoin URPD Shows These Price Levels Stand Out In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared DOGE levels that could be important resistance boundaries. The levels in question correspond to major supply walls on the Dogecoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator from the analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the total amount of the memecoin’s supply that was last purchased at the different price levels that it has visited over history. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned Now, here is the chart posted by Martinez that shows how the URPD looks for Dogecoin right now: As displayed in the above graph, the level closest to the latest Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of the URPD is $0.18. The investors last purchased around 8.94% of the asset’s supply around this mark. Naturally, as the level is above the spot price, all of these holders would be in the red at the moment. Generally, investors in loss look forward to retests of their break-even mark so that they can get their money ‘back.’ Often, these holders push for the exit as soon as this happens, fearing that the price would go back down again in the near future. As such, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a notable part of the supply from below, a significant selling reaction can sometimes appear in the market. This can provide resistance to the cryptocurrency. Considering that the $0.18 level is particularly large, it can act as a point of notable resistance. Similarly, the analyst has also flagged two other levels: $0.21 (7.24% of supply) and $0.36 (3.82% of supply). Interestingly, between these two, there aren’t any significant supply walls, meaning that if Dogecoin can get into this zone, it may, at least in theory, have an easier time climbing up. In the scenario that DOGE gets rejected at the resistance, however, it may have to find support at the in-profit supply zones. Holders belonging to these levels can react to declines to their cost basis by buying more, as they may believe the drawdown to be just a dip-buying opportunity. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins—62% Held By Just 10 Whales The only level below the current Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of supply is all the way down at $0.07. It hosts the acquisition mark of 20.03% of the memecoin’s supply, which means that it’s massive in size, and so, could be a strong support center. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, up 1.6% in the last seven days.

2025-07-08T05:30:00,"Strategy Posts $14B in Bitcoin Gains, Pauses Weekly Buys","Despite the gains, the firm paused its consistent Bitcoin accumulation last week, maintaining its total holdings at 597,325 BTC. This move coincided with a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering that is aimed at funding future BTC purchases. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet continued to ramp up its Bitcoin reserves by acquiring another 2,204 BTC and solidifying its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder. CleanSpark also saw major growth when it boosted its mining output by over 50% year-over-year and raised its hashrate to 50 EH/s. However, its stock dipped nearly 8% despite the operational progress. Strategy Tops $14B Gains Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, reported $14.05 billion in unrealized gains on its digital asset holdings for the second quarter of 2025. Alongside this impressive figure, the company disclosed a deferred tax expense of $4.04 billion, according to its latest filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of June 30, the carrying value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings reached $64.36 billion, while the related deferred tax liability stood at $6.31 billion. Despite the very impressive gains, Strategy paused its consistent Bitcoin accumulation last week. The firm’s total holdings stayed unchanged at 597,325 BTC after its most recent acquisition of 4,980 BTC. This break in weekly purchases was the first since April 2025 and came as Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped to $105,400 before rebounding above $110,000. The company previously halted purchases when Bitcoin fell below $87,000 earlier in the year. After that pause, Strategy resumed buying with a 3,459 BTC purchase on April 14, just two weeks after its massive 22,048 BTC acquisition on March 31. The newly reported unrealized gains slightly exceeded Bloomberg’s earlier projections, which estimated Strategy would post at least $13 billion in such gains for the quarter. In conjunction with the earnings announcement, Strategy also unveiled a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for its 10% Series A perpetual Stride (STRD) preferred stock, priced at $0.001 per share. This latest ATM program is part of the company’s equity-raising strategy that is designed to fund future Bitcoin purchases. According to an investor presentation , Strategy already issued $477 million under the STRK ATM and $163 million under the STRF ATM. The firm reported a total remaining ATM capacity of $44.8 billion across its various programs, which includes $18.1 billion for MSTR, $4.2 billion for STRD, $20.5 billion for STRK, and $1.9 billion for STRF. These strategic funding mechanisms are part of Strategy’s continued effort to maintain its dominant position in the Bitcoin market while navigating short-term volatility and tax considerations. Metaplanet Buys More BTC It does not seem like Metaplanet plans to slow down its Bitcoin buys at all. Japan’s leading corporate Bitcoin holder expanded its holdings with the acquisition of 2,204 BTC for $237 million, according to a filing on Monday. The purchase was made at an average price of 15.64 million yen per Bitcoin, or roughly $107,700. This latest acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 15,555 BTC, with an average purchase price of approximately $99,985 per coin. With this addition, Metaplanet solidified its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company surpassed Tesla in late June when it added 1,234 BTC to its reserves, raising its total to 12,345 BTC while Tesla stayed at 11,509 BTC. It then outpaced Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark's holdings of 12,502 BTC with another strategic buy of 1,005 BTC valued at $108 million, which was disclosed on June 30. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The news comes during a surge in activity among corporate Bitcoin treasuries. ProCap , the investment firm led by Anthony Pompliano, made its first entry into the Bitcoin space with a 3,724 BTC purchase totaling $386 million. Semler Scientific also announced plans to dramatically increase its Bitcoin holdings from 3,808 BTC to 105,000 BTC. Despite the growing trend, some analysts are a bit more cautious. James Check , lead analyst at Glassnode, recently warned that the Bitcoin treasury strategy may already be losing its luster for new entrants. He suggested that the biggest gains may have already been captured by early adopters and pointed out that latecomers could struggle to stand out, saying “nobody wants the 50th Treasury company.” A report by venture firm Breed also warned that only a few firms will manage to avoid a potential “death spiral” in the Bitcoin treasury space, due to the risks that come with chasing a strategy already embraced by many. CleanSpark BTC Output Jumps In other Bitcoin-related news, CleanSpark reported a big surge in its Bitcoin mining output, with production rising over 50% year-over-year despite the increasingly challenging post-halving environment for miners. In June, the company achieved an operational hashrate of 50 EH/s, up from 20.4 EH/s a year ago, which was a 145.1% increase in mining capacity. This boosted output to 685 BTC mined last month, valued at approximately $74.2 million based on current market prices, compared to 445 BTC mined in June of 2024. (Source: CleanSpark ) CEO and president Zach Bradford credited the achievement to the efforts of the operations and technology teams, and pointed out that more than 10 EH/s of capacity was added across four US states, representing a 9.6% month-over-month growth. CleanSpark sold 578 BTC in June, most of its production for the month, and now holds 12,608 BTC—up slightly from 12,502 in May. This places CleanSpark seventh among publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Only MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms hold more BTC among miners, with MARA holding 50,000 BTC and Riot holding 19,225 BTC. Bradford noticed the growing adoption of Bitcoin by global corporations, and mentioned that corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have outpaced ETF net inflows for three straight quarters. CleanSpark stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the operational gains, CleanSpark’s stoc k saw an almost 8% drop on Monday after the update. This decline took place amid broader market softness, with the Nasdaq index falling over 1% thanks to U.S. trade policy discussions that weighed on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty continued to rise, and reached an all-time high of 126.9 trillion on May 31, compounding the economic pressures on miners from reduced block rewards and rising energy costs. Since February of 2024, CleanSpark greatly expanded its US operations by establishing facilities in Georgia, Mississippi, Wyoming, and Tennessee. In August 2024, the company also purchased 26,000 Bitmain immersion mining rigs in a $168 million deal.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9837/strategy-posts-14-b-in-bitcoin-gains-pauses-weekly-buys,"BTC|REGULATION|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T05:10:08,"Bitcoin Struggles to Surpass $110,000: But Why? Experts Weigh In on the Latest Developments","Despite topping $111,000 in May, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain higher levels in recent weeks. The slowdown could be due to long-term investors taking profits, according to Tom Lee, director of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “We have clients who bought Bitcoin at $100. Even if Bitcoin goes to $1 million, they’ll probably sell at $100,000,” Lee said on CNBC’s “ETF Edge.” While the Bitcoin price is stuck at psychological resistance levels, other areas of the cryptocurrency market continue to rise. While digital asset infrastructure providers stand out in this process, Coinbase shares in particular experienced their best month since November 2023, rising 40% in June. Coinbase also became the only stock to double its value in the S&P 500 index in the second quarter of 2025, closing its first three-month rise since 2023. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market Factors that contributed to this rise include the Genius Act passed by the US Senate, Circle’s successful IPO, and the growing optimism towards stablecoins. For crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana, which have seen limited price increases throughout the year, investors are turning to alternative methods such as “staking” to make a profit. According to independent ETF expert Dave Nadig, thanks to staking, investors can make significant returns not only from price increases but also by contributing to blockchain networks. “These returns can often be several percentage points higher than classic fixed-income instruments,” he said. Financial giants like BlackRock believe in the growth potential of staking. Speaking to CNBC, Johann Kerbrat, head of Robinhood’s crypto division, said the proliferation of Ethereum and Solana staking services is a significant step towards “mass adoption.” Another notable trend is the preference for ETFs that provide the same exposure, rather than buying crypto assets directly. Nadig comments on this situation as follows: “Let's be realistic, it's much easier and cheaper to buy ETFs.” Nadig added: “Bitcoin has moved from one wallet to another; this new wallet is now ETFs.” *This is not investment advice.

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $620 support zone.

A close above the $672 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $662 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $655 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high.

2025-07-08T04:44:15,"Another Public Company Treasury Pivots to Ethereum With $172M Raise","Bit Digital has gone all-in on Ethereum after offloading all of its Bitcoin to buy ETH. The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from its BTC sales and acquired over 100,000 ETH, becoming the latest corporate Ethereum treasury firm. “Following a $172 million public equity raise and conversion of its balance sheet from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Bit Digital has accumulated over 100K ETH to become one of the largest corporate treasury companies in the world,” the firm stated on July 7. Ethereum Treasury Firms Growing Prior to the offering, the publicly traded digital asset platform held 24,434 ETH as of March 31. Following the additional ETH acquisitions funded by the net proceeds of the public offerings and the sale of its BTC, the firm has accumulated approximately 100,603 ETH worth around $254 million at current market prices. 0/ Another public-company treasury just went full-ETH. Bit Digital (NASDAQ $BTBT ) sold its entire BTC stack, raised $172mn, and now holds ≈100,603 ETH, vaulting into the top tier of corporate ETH treasuries. — Eric Conner (@econoar) July 7, 2025 “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system,” said Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar, who added: “Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.” He said the firm was aligning itself with Ethereum’s “long-term potential” while positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” Bit Digital has joined the ranks of Joe Lubin’s gaming firm SharpLink and Tom Lee’s Bitmine , which launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury last week. “Tom Lee lit the fuse, Lubin showed the playbook, and Bit Digital just proved scale. ETH-forward treasury strategies are graduating from thesis to trend,” commented former Ethereum developer Eric Conner. ETH Price Reaction As usual, Ethereum prices have not reacted and have gone in the opposite direction again, in line with the wider market retreat today. ETH has declined 2% on the day in a fall to $2,528 at the time of writing. The asset failed to break resistance at $2,600 late last week and has followed the rest of the market into the red this week as US President Donald Trump started dishing out his trade tariff letters. Ethereum is still tightly range-bound, in a sideways channel where it has been stuck for the past two months.

2025-07-08T04:43:12,"Strategy Announces $4.2 Billion Capital Raise After Halting Bitcoin Buys For The First Time In 3 Months","Strategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, did not add to its BTC holdings last week, ending a streak of weekly purchases that extended to April 14. “Some weeks you just need to HODL,” Strategy Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor posted on Twitter (aka X) on Sunday, hinting at the company’s pause. Strategy currently owns a total of 597,325 BTC — worth over $64 billion — bought at an average price of $70,982 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $42.4 billion. That’s the equivalent of over 2.8% of the flagship crypto’s total supply. Strategy Reports Unrealized Profit Of $14 Billion On BTC In Q2 According to a recent 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Strategy added nearly $7 billion of Bitcoin during Q2. The company reported an unrealized gain of $14.05 billion on its Bitcoin holdings as the price of BTC jumped from around $82,000 to $108,000 during the three months ended June 30. As a result, it also incurred a deferred tax expense of roughly $4.04 billion. Subsequently, Strategy also announced it has signed a sales agreement allowing it to issue and sell up to $4.2 billion of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (known as STRD), at the price of $0.001 per share under a new at-the-market program. Like other Strategy offerings, including the $21 billion STRK ATM , the new offering is an equity-raising mechanism designed to allow the company to sell newly issued shares over time to acquire more Bitcoin. Bitcoin was recently down 0.5% on the day to $108,066, but remains up around 2.4% over the last month, according to CoinGecko. Treasury Companies Are Following Strategy’s Lead Strategy’s latest announcement comes as those other companies are doubling down on their BTC treasury plans in a bid to emulate the firm, which began amassing the top crypto under the leadership of Saylor in 2020. Metaplanet, which bills itself as the Strategy of Japan, announced on Monday that it had added another 2,205 BTC to its balance sheet, bringing its total holdings of the token to 15,555 BTC — over $1.6 billion worth.

2025-07-08T04:00:53,"$332M Raised! BlockDAG Locks $0.0016 Price Until GLOBAL LAUNCH Release on August 11","Q3 2025 has kicked off with strong energy across the crypto space. Altcoins are picking up steam, the online buzz is growing fast, and new capital is flowing in. In the middle of all this, one project keeps grabbing attention: BlockDAG (BDAG) . With $332 million already raised and over 23.6 billion BDAG coins sold, it’s turning heads as the best crypto to buy now in July. And with the $0.0016 price still in place, this might be the last chance to get in before it climbs. While others wait for a boost, BlockDAG is already moving. Its testnet is live, the community is growing, mining is running strong, and new partnerships are rolling in. The clock is ticking, with the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11. As interest rises, people are rushing to join while the price stays locked. What Makes BlockDAG Stand Out This Month BlockDAG is not a typical blockchain. It’s built on Layer 1 tech that mixes the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure with Proof-of-Work security. That means faster speeds, better scale, and more power than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. But the real excitement comes from what’s already live: A working testnet where developers can build and launch smart contracts and dApps A no-code dApp builder so anyone can launch without coding The X1 Miner App with over 2 million downloads, letting users earn BDAG through gamified mining More than 18,390 ASIC miners have been sold, expanding the hardware network A developer academy built to train new talent Buyer Battles, a fun in-app contest giving away 150 million BDAG daily All of this shows one thing clearly: BlockDAG isn’t waiting to start. It’s already in motion. And at $0.0016, many see this as a short window before the project goes public and prices rise. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, July could be the moment to act. Sports Deals Push BlockDAG Into the Spotlight In July, BlockDAG grabbed attention in both crypto and sports by teaming up with two big U.S. teams. It’s now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby champions) and the Seattle Orcas (a strong Major League Cricket team). These aren’t just for show. The deals include NFTs, fan tokens, shared social content, and behind-the-scenes videos with players. For BlockDAG, it’s a way to connect with millions of sports fans and bring them into Web3 using real, interactive digital tools. Even bigger news is that a large U.S. sponsorship deal is signed and waiting for regulatory clearance. Details haven’t been shared yet, but this could be one of the most important crypto partnerships to date. With cricket’s 2.5 billion fans and rugby’s global following, the timing couldn’t be better. Countdown to August 11 and What Comes Next Right now, the presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11. That’s the final day for this rate. After that, the offer ends and a new price will be set. Whether you’re new to crypto or have been here for years, this is one of the last windows to join before the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. What’s coming in the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release hasn’t been shared. The team is keeping it quiet for now, likely due to regulation and strategy. But looking at past crypto launches, the community is expecting big shifts in how people can access and use BDAG. BlockDAG’s presale is already one of the largest ever, passing past launches like Filecoin, Tezos, and Polkadot. With over 200,000 holders and fast-growing interest, the excitement is real. Online chatter across Twitter, Telegram, and forums keeps rising, driven by the fixed price and the coming launch date. So far, BlockDAG has raised more than $332 million and is aiming for $600 million. This isn’t just another early-stage project. It could be one of the leading Layer 1 networks of the decade. BlockDAG’s Low $0.0016 Price Entry Ends August 11 When you look at the best crypto to buy now in July , it’s no longer about hype. The focus is on which project is showing real progress. BlockDAG is not only gaining momentum, it’s turning that into users, deals, and working products. The current $0.0016 price, active until August 11, is seen by many as the last chance to join before the next stage begins. With a $600 million target, 2 million+ X1 app users mining daily, over 18,390 ASIC units sold, and two U.S. sports teams signed on, BlockDAG has built a working setup that few others can match. This is not just a coin launch. It’s a full working system, growing fast, and ready for the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. July might be the final moment to step in before everything shifts.

2025-07-08T04:00:46,"Will 600K Bitcoin Be The Tipping Point? Saylor’s Strategy Sparks Institutional Wave","MicroStrategy’s bitcoin stash sits at 597,325 BTC valued at nearly $65 billion, and the next move could put the company over the 600,000 mark. The company (rebranded to Strategy) snapped up 4,980 BTC last week for $531 million, marking its 12th straight weekly purchase. Now, all eyes are on whether CEO Michael Saylor will flip the switch for week 13. Rising Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries According to the company’s own portfolio chart, Strategy holds 597,325 BTC on its balance sheet. That haul is just 2,675 BTC shy of a symbolic milestone. Last week’s buy matched the record set between late 2024 and early 2025. If Strategy buys again this week, it will break its own buying record and push total holdings above 600,000 BTC. Some weeks you just need to HODL. pic.twitter.com/rVcFQkFoG0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 6, 2025 Many firms are watching Strategy’s moves. A fresh purchase announcement often sparks a rally in Bitcoin’s price. The chart’s release on X is widely seen as a precursor to new acquisitions. But Saylor’s caption—“Some weeks you just need to HODL”—has left some investors guessing. It might signal a pause rather than a green light. Bitcoin Balance Sheets Reach New Heights Based on reports from treasury firms, 18 companies added a combined 8,400 BTC to their coffers last week. Strategy led the charge with nearly 5,000 BTC, followed by design software maker Figma. This surge brings total corporate bitcoin holdings ever closer to levels once considered impossible. BlackRock ’s IBIT ETF recently crossed the 600,000 BTC threshold, proving that big asset managers are just as hungry for crypto as nimble startups. The combined action is pushing bitcoin ever closer to its record high. At press time, Bitcoin trades at about $108,650—just 28% below its $111,980 peak. Class-Action Suit Over Accounting Practices Strategy and Saylor are defending against a class-action lawsuit that accuses them of failing to disclose an unrealized Q1 2025 loss. The suit claims the company hid billions in markdowns. If the court sides against Strategy, the company could face hefty write‑downs. That might make it harder to funnel more cash into bitcoin. Bitcoin Trading Inches Closer To Record Bitcoin’s current trading level suggests a market on edge. A new purchase announcement from Strategy could nudge prices past $111,950. But if the company holds off, profit‑taking could drag bitcoin back. Investors will be watching Saylor’s next post for a clear signal. Strategy is just 2,675 BTC away from claiming a new buying streak record and hitting 600,000 BTC. If history repeats itself, the announcement will arrive any day now. For now, though, the market remains in suspense—and that uncertainty often brings its own kind of excitement.

2025-07-08T04:00:10,"Bitcoin Traders Are Betting Against the Rally, Will It Backfire?","Bitcoin has continued to trade within a tight range just below its previous all-time high, showing recent signs of upward movement but falling short of reclaiming its peak price. The asset recorded a seven-day high of $110,307, but it has since cooled, with current trading levels around $108,311, representing a slight 0.3% drop over the last 24 hours. While the broader market maintains cautious optimism, several indicators suggest that market participants remain split on where Bitcoin is headed next. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So Bitcoin Shorts Increase on Binance Despite Price Climb Despite the price strength seen in recent days, certain signals hint at increasing friction between bullish price action and bearish positioning from traders. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, Bitcoin’s rise is being met with a counterintuitive decline in funding rates on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume. This trend could play a crucial role in shaping short-term market behavior. BorisVest noted that as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000 to $110,000 range, funding rates on Binance have gradually declined. This suggests that a significant number of traders are taking short positions—essentially betting that Bitcoin’s rally will soon reverse. The analyst explained that this behavior indicates skepticism about the sustainability of the recent price gains, particularly among retail and leverage-focused traders. “The declining funding rates show that users on Binance are increasingly shorting Bitcoin,” he explained. “This dynamic often creates forced exits as short positions come under pressure, leading to liquidations or forced margin increases. These events can further propel upward price movement as positions get closed out automatically.” Given Binance’s dominance in trading volume, BorisVest emphasized that its funding rate trend serves as a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. If current positioning continues, the market may see a short squeeze, which could accelerate Bitcoin’s momentum toward new highs. On-Chain Metric Flags Caution as NVT Golden Cross Edges Higher While futures market dynamics are drawing attention, on-chain data is also showing signs worth monitoring. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlighted the movement of Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross metric, a tool used to assess market value in relation to on-chain transaction volume. This metric has historically signaled local tops when it moves above specific thresholds. In his analysis, Kesmeci pointed out that the NVT Golden Cross successfully identified three prior short-term peaks in 2025, each followed by corrections ranging from 9% to over 20%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High? The metric currently sits at 1.98, below the 2.2 threshold that has often indicated overheated market conditions, but is trending upward. “While the current level isn’t yet in the danger zone,” Kesmeci wrote, “its upward trajectory could be an early warning that price momentum is beginning to overextend.” However, the analyst cautioned against interpreting the signal as immediately bearish. In previous cases, the NVT Golden Cross remained elevated for several days before a correction followed. This behavior may instead point to continued strength among bulls, at least in the medium term, even if a near-term pullback remains possible.

2025-07-08T03:34:02,"Crypto Funds Break Records: $188B AuM After $1B Weekly Inflows","Last week, digital asset investment products saw $1.04 billion in inflows. The figure marks twelve straight weeks of positive momentum, logging total inflows at $18 billion. Price increases during the week lifted total assets under management to a record $188 billion. Meanwhile, trading volumes hit $16.3 billion, which aligned with the average weekly volume observed in the year so far. Ethereum Dominates Proportional Inflows The latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin investment products attracted $790 million in inflows last week, a slowdown from the previous three-week average of $1.5 billion. The asset manager explained that this deceleration hints at growing caution among investors as Bitcoin nears its record highs. This sentiment is further validated by a minor $0.4 million in inflows to short-bitcoin products in a turnaround from the previous week’s direction. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its 11th straight week of inflows as it added $226 million and pushed the total for this period to $2.85 billion. On a relative basis, Ethereum’s weekly inflows have averaged 1.6% of its assets under management, which is notably higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%, which points to a change in sentiment toward Ethereum. Next up was Solana with inflows of $21.6 million, followed by XRP with $10.6 million, and Sui at $1.6 million during the same period. Chainlink and Cardano also saw modest but steady inflows, as each attracted $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, over the week. On the other hand, the multi-asset product was the only category that flashed red across the leaderboard as it witnessed $12.4 million in outflows. Regional Divide The United States topped regional inflows last week with $1 billion, followed by Germany at $38.5 million and Switzerland at $33.7 million over the past week. Australia also saw a smaller inflow of $4.1 million. Contrastingly, Canada and Sweden experienced weaker sentiment, recording outflows of $29.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Brazil and Hong Kong also saw capital leaving, as they saw outflows of $9.7 million and $3 million.

2025-07-08T03:32:21,"Bitcoin Traders Chase $130K Bets in Anticipation of Renewed Bullish Volatility","Bitcoin BTC traders are increasingly chasing higher-level call options on Deribit, signaling that they are preparing for renewed bullish price volatility. ""Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110,000 resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid. Some larger players appear to be positioning for just that,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market update. ""They are continuing to add exposure to September $130,000 calls, while steadfastly holding September $115,000/$140,000 call spreads, underscoring a structurally bullish Q3 outlook,"" QCP added. A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. In other words, buyers of the $130,000 strike call expect BTC's spot price to rise above that level. BTC's price has been stuck between $100,000 and $110,000 for over 50 days as selling by wallets with a history of holding coins for the long term counteracts ETF inflows. Volatility may pick up soon as the June Fed minutes are due for release on Wednesday. Further, the 90-day tariff pause for many U.S. trading partners has reportedly been extended to Aug. 1.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/08/bitcoin-traders-chase-usd130k-bets-in-anticipation-of-renewed-bullish-volatility,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Deribit|Options|News",cryptocompare

ETH is now correcting some gains and might aim for a fresh move above $2,580. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $2,520 level. The price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,520 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Revisits Support Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,550 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,565 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. However, the bears remained active near the $2,600 resistance zone and protected more gains. The price faced rejection near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low.

There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,550 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,580 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. A clear move above the $2,600 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term.

2025-07-08T02:41:44,"Bitcoin holds above $108K as Trump raises tariffs","The cryptocurrency market was bearish on Monday, erasing some of the gains recorded over the weekend. Bitcoin slipped to the $107,500 region on Monday but has now recovered and currently trades above $108k. Institutional demand continues to be Bitcoin’s primary driver and could empower it to rally higher over the coming days and weeks. Bitcoin stays above $108k despite renewed tariff talks It’s the start of the new week, and tariff talks are back. On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States has set a 25% tariff against South Korea and Japan starting August 1. The president also revealed a 25% levy against Kazakhstan and Malaysia, 30% against South Africa, and 40% for Myanmar and Laos. Furthermore, Trump threatened additional tariffs on countries aligning with the policies of the BRICS. The announcement saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $108k, but the leading cryptocurrency has since bounced back and could rally higher soon. Bitcoin’s resilience can be attributed to increasing institutional demand. On Monday, Japanese firm Metaplanet added over 2k bitcoins to its balance sheet for $239 million. Furthermore, recent data by SoSoValue revealed that US-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded over $769 million in inflows last week. These figures suggest that institutional investors continue to demand Bitcoin, and this could be a catalyst for a price surge in the medium to long term. Bitcoin price forecast; technical strength hints at new highs The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish as buyers remain in control. The pair is also efficient, suggesting that liquidity on the downside has been swept and Bitcoin could be preparing for another leg up. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $108,040, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52 indicates that Bitcoin could experience buying pressure soon, while the MACD lines are still within the positive territory. BTC seems to be currently consolidating tightly around $110,000, just beneath overhead resistance. A decisive move above the all-time high price of $111k in the short term could see Bitcoin target $120k, setting a new all-time high in the process. Analysts still expect Bitcoin to touch $150k in this cycle, and this could be possible if BTC breaks out and hits $120k. However, failure to break out from this consolidation area could see Bitcoin retest the support and Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $105,328. This level could serve as a springboard for Bitcoin to rally higher. However, if the bulls fail to take advantage of this, BTC could drop to the next major support level at $98k. Bitcoin’s short-term performance depends on institutional demand for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the renewed tariff talks could play a significant role in how the broader crypto market performs over the next few weeks.

2025-07-08T01:30:00,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Crosses $11.8 Million Milestone, Becomes The Top Crypto Under $0.5 This Week","In the fast-paced crypto market, one name has emerged as a game-changer: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is fast-gaining attention amongst investors and analysts alike as it powers through its presale. The only close match to the expected returns of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Bitcoin (BTC). From less than $1 over a decade ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a major force in the crypto sector and is now valued at over $107k. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market today to rekindle the massive returns that early BTC investors experienced. One of the main factors that is working in its favor is that it is built on the solid foundation of utility. In the crypto market of 2025, the push towards utility continues to gain momentum as hype-based meme coins lose out. Let us take a close look at MUTM tokens and why they could deliver the life-changing returns you have been looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to receive interest. Interests are calculated based on an annual percentage yield (APY). MUTM Presale Powers Past $11.8 Million The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised over $11.8 million from around 12,800 unique buyers. These figures are expected to continue rising geometrically as word of the success of the presale spreads. Tokens in the current phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the next phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This price increase is something you do not want to be caught up in. The reason for this is that the token price increase will wipe out the massive 50% discount currently available to buyers in the current phase 5. So far, many investors have rushed to capitalize on this massive discount, with over 65% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 already sold out. The pace has been blazing, with the tokens selling out barely a month after they launched. At the current pace, analysts rightly assess that the tokens will have sold out by the end of July. That means you need to act fast and direct capital into the presale in anticipation of the expected returns. MUTM Tokens Could Rise By 53x According to the latest estimates by analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 53x when they go live. That means if you purchase $1400 worth of tokens in the current phase, you could see your investment grow to over $74,000. It is worth noting that there is no upper cap on how much you can invest in the presale. Consequently, you could make some truly life-changing returns with the MUTM token presale. One reason why there is so much optimism for MUTM tokens is the expected crypto market rally. The crypto market is currently going through a consolidation phase, which is expected to pass quickly. Already, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of retracing its most recent all-time high, which signals a massive breakout is on the way. The best way to capitalize on these expected returns is to hold MUTM tokens at the current low price and await this massive wave to come and take you to the top. Another reason for the optimism for the MUTM token price is that the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. Unlike other projects like Pi Network, where the team made the community wait for years, the Mutuum Finance developer team will hit the ground running. This launch is expected to stir up excitement in the crypto community and provide a great opportunity for feedback from future users. One of the direct effects of the beta launch is that it will push doubters to act and get their MUTM tokens. This fresh inflow of capital could push the price to new highs. By joining the presale now while there is still a massive 50% discount, you ensure that you get the full benefits of this expected surge. CertiK Partnership Mutuum Finance has recently announced that they are partnering with CertiK on a massive $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. This program will reward security experts who help identify vulnerabilities in the protocol and the overall ecosystem. To ensure rewards are distributed fairly, the program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. Those who identify the most pressing issues on the protocol will receive the biggest rewards. Whales in the crypto market, who are known for their due diligence, an ability to spot massive gains early, have already secured their token in the MUTM token presale. With tokens available at a 50% discount, this represents your best opportunity to copy the whales. However, the window is fast closing, and over 65% of the tokens available at the discount have already sold out. If you fail to act fast enough, you will have to contend with a massive increase in price in the next phase.

2025-07-08T01:12:10,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC’s Institutional Waves Are Building, Not Breaking","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Fund manager Jeff Dyment of Saphira Group wants you to zoom out and stop sweating the short-term charts. His thesis: Data points that suggest institutional bitcoin (BTC) buying is losing steam miss the bigger picture. In a note shared with CoinDesk, Dyment argues that fears of fading institutional demand for bitcoin are overblown, rooted in narrow snapshots of the market. Yes, ETF and corporate purchases have cooled recently – Michael Saylor's Strategy bought just 16,000 BTC last month, down sharply from December’s 171,000 BTC haul. But this, Dyment insists, is not a sign of decline. It’s a natural ebb in what he calls a “cyclical wave” of adoption. “Institutional flows often come in waves rather than a steady linear increase,” Dyment wrote. “Short-term demand fluctuations in the spot market are minor ripples on what is, in fact, a rising tide of institutional engagement.” Dyment points to the addition of 51 new corporate BTC treasuries in the first half of 2025 alone, equal to the total from 2018 to 2022 combined, and a 375% year-over-year increase in corporate BTC buying. Public companies now hold 848,902 BTC, or approximately 4% of the total supply, with Q2 2025 alone seeing 131,000 BTC added to their balance sheets. He also highlights the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs as further evidence of deepening institutional participation. BlackRock’s IBIT fund, now the largest in the world, holds 699,000 BTC, more than 3.3% of total supply, after becoming the fastest-growing ETF in history. U.S. spot ETFs have collectively captured approximately 1.25 million BTC , or roughly 6% of the total supply, in just 18 months since their launch, he points out in the note. Dyment's thesis is finding echoes in the options market. In QCP Capital's recent note, the Singapore-based fund pointed to whales that are continuing to build exposure to upside risk, snapping up September $130K BTC calls and holding $115K/$140K call spreads. “Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110K resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid,” QCP wrote in a Monday note. So while bears may point to stagnant spot flows and the nearly empty mempool as signs of fatigue , Dyment argues those are just surface-level ripples. Underneath, the tide is rising, and Wall Street, with its trillions upon trillions of regulated capital, is hungry for crypto. It's just not going to come all at once. BTQ Pushes Quantum-Safe Framework for Stablecoins BTQ Technologies has introduced the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN), a framework designed to help banks, payment firms, and digital asset platforms future-proof stablecoin issuance against threats from quantum computing. In a press release , BTQ detailed how the system could support quantum-secure versions of popular stablecoin models, including JPMorgan’s proposed USD deposit token (JPMD), by upgrading privileged actions like minting and burning with dual cryptographic signatures (ECDSA and Falcon-512), while preserving compatibility with existing token standards, workflows, and wallets. The launch comes as the stablecoin market surpasses $225 billion and lawmakers push for regulation with an eye on cybersecurity. The GENIUS Act, currently advancing in the U.S. Congress, would formalize federal standards for fiat-backed stablecoins and encourage quantum-safe architecture. BTQ, which has worked with NIST for over a decade, aims to shape those standards and position QSSN as critical infrastructure. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin fell 1.02% from July 6 at 22:00 to July 7 at 21:00, testing key support at $107,519.64 amid heavy selling, before staging a V-shaped recovery off $107,800 as on-chain data showed strong support clusters at $106,738 and $98,566 held by 1.68 million addresses, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis bot. ETH: ETH rose 1.67% amid volatile trading, swinging nearly 3% between $2,529 and $2,604 as support at $2,530 held firm, institutional inflows topped $1.1 billion, and above-average volume marked both the surge and subsequent sell-off. Gold: Gold dipped on a stronger dollar but rebounded on tariff-driven safe-haven demand, with central bank buying and de-dollarization fueling forecasts of a rally toward $4,000. S&P 500: Stocks fell Monday as Trump announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, sending the S&P 500 down 0.79% to 6,229.98. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose despite Trump announcing steep U.S. tariffs on 14 trading partners, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.36% as duties of up to 40% were outlined for countries including South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The “Global Money Supply” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins—62% Held By Just 10 Whales Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the data for the year-on-year growth in the metric: As displayed in the graph, the metric’s value has recently been witnessing an increase, indicating that fiat supply is going up. “Central banks are flooding the market with fiat money,” notes the analyst. Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. “This is extreme and rare,” says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking.

This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). “Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand is still bullish,” says the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,400, up 0.7% over the last week.
