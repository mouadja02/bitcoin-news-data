2025-07-08T11:53:12,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Now Holds 700K BTC","The post BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Now Holds 700K BTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETF sector continues to dominate headlines with its massive accumulation of Bitcoin. As of now, the collective holdings have surged to 1,253,032 BTC , valued at over $136.3 billion , according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. BlackRock’s IBIT Controls Over 55% of Sector Holdings BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the undisputed leader, holding more than 700,000 BTC , currently worth $75.9 billion . In just two trading sessions, IBIT added 1,388 BTC , highlighting strong institutional demand. At the start of 2024, IBIT held 551,917.9 BTC . As of now, its holdings have jumped 26.83% year-to-date , making it the largest ETF in the sector by a significant margin. Top 5 US Bitcoin Spot ETFs by Holdings Here’s a breakdown of BTC holdings in top ETFs: BlackRock’s IBIT : 700,000 BTC Fidelity’s FBTC : 203,508.5 BTC Grayscale’s GBTC : 184,226.9 BTC ARK 21Shares’ ARKB : 48,265 BTC Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust : 44,227.8 BTC These five ETFs dominate the U.S. Bitcoin ETF landscape, capturing the majority of institutional investment in Bitcoin. IBIT Outperforms Traditional ETFs With 82.67% Returns Since its launch in January 2024 , IBIT has delivered 82.67% returns , outperforming even BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF . For comparison: Bitcoin YTD Change (2025) : +16.5% S&P 500 YTD Change : +6.16% This performance reinforces the growing narrative that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset among institutional investors. Bitcoin Demand Surpasses Supply in 2025 Another key trend in 2025 is the Bitcoin supply and demand imbalance . So far this year: US Bitcoin ETFs bought : ~$28.22 billion worth of BTC Bitcoin mined globally : ~$7.85 billion worth This massive buying pressure led by BlackRock and others has significantly outpaced the newly mined supply, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price higher in the long term. ETF Approval Process May Soon Get Simpler Regulatory hurdles have long slowed down ETF approvals in the U.S., but that could soon change. Reports suggest that the SEC is considering streamlining the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval process , potentially requiring just Form S-1 with a 75-day waiting period . Currently, ETF issuers must submit both Form 19b-4 and S-1 , resulting in months of delays and regulatory back-and-forth. A simplified path could open doors for more ETF products shortly. The U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETF market is gaining momentum in 2025, with BlackRock’s IBIT at the center. With demand now far exceeding new supply and the SEC looking to simplify approvals, the sector may be on the verge of another growth wave.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-700k-btc/,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 869,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin will surge to an all-time high (ATH) price in the next few days. “Feel it in my flippers that we see BTC at ATH this week The market, especially ETH and BTC both have a lot of tailwinds so far (barring anything unexpected)… If we break out, I think we see $118,000-$120,000 pretty quick.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $108,047, an over 1% drop in the past day. Pentoshi is also keeping a close eye on the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), which he thinks is positioned to follow in the footsteps of fellow meme token Bonk ( BONK ). BONK is up about 100% from its June 25th low of $0.0000123. According to Pentoshi, FLOKI’s chart appears to be a carbon copy of BONK’s price action before the memecoin triggered a massive price explosion. “Similar chart to this (almost identical). I think we will see it trade up to TP1 to start, and that will be the spot to watch. If it gets into the previous range, that opens the door to TP2.” Source: Pentoshi/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FLOKI will first hit $0.000121 with the potential to surge to as high as $0.000206. At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.000081. As for BONK, the analyst thinks that the altcoin will cool off before sparking the next leg up. “BONK update: +50% but coming into resistance just above here. A little profit taking and consolidation likely around there before any attempts higher. Would like to see a three-day or one-week close above [$0.000024].” Source: Pentoshi/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BONK will rally to $0.0000367 if it takes out resistance at $0.0000258. At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.0000227.

2025-07-08T11:45:45,"Trump Media receives positive news on its proposed BTC & ETH ETF filing","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally accepted Trump Media’s application for a Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund, beginning the review period for the fund. As outlined in its filing, the social media company’s ETF will provide investors access to Bitcoin and Ether through NYSE Arca-listed shares. 75% of the fund would be invested in Bitcoin, and the remaining 25% in Ether. The Foris DAX Trust company will serve as the custodian Truth Social first submitted its S-1 form for its Bitcoin and Ether ETF on June 16. If approved, the firm’s fund would compete with industry heavyweights like BlackRock , whose iShares Bitcoin ETF has accumulated over $72.5 billion in assets. The SEC is also deliberating on many other ETF applications while preparing a simplified listing structure for all these funds. The Truth Social ETF will have Foris DAX Trust Company, part of the Crypto.com ecosystem, as the custodian for the fund, while Yorkville America Digital will sponsor it. The company’s ETF also plans to calculate its daily net asset value for Bitcoin using the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate for the Bitcoin portion, which aggregates pricing data from several leading crypto exchanges. The fund will also use the Ether CME CF reference rate for Ether evaluation “unless otherwise determined by the Sponsor at its sole discretion.” The crypto custodian will also store the fund’s Bitcoin and Ether in segregated accounts, separate from other clients, with private keys kept in cold storage. The SEC has delayed its decision on multiple crypto ETF applications The SEC recently held off on its decision on Fidelity’s spot Solana ETF, inviting public comments for 21 days and rebuttals for up to 35 days. The Cboe BZX Exchange initially filed a request on March 25 to list Fidelity’s proposed Solana ETF. James Seyffart, Bloomberg ETF analyst, commented on the delay, saying he expected it. He added that they were still waiting for some movement from the SEC on a generalized digital asset ETP framework. In May, the commission also delayed its decision on Bitwise’s Ether ETF and Grayscale’s XRP ETF, which analysts also anticipated. At the time, the agency pushed its decision on the Bitwise application for another 45 days, claiming it needed to review a rule change and the issues it may bring forth just two days before the expected decision date. On Grayscale’s XRP, the commission also sought public input and initiated proceedings for additional analysis to assess regulatory compliance. Seyffart also commented on the agency’s decision on both delays, saying it usually waits until the end of the review window to respond to a 19b-4 filing. With 50+ crypto ETFs awaiting approval, the SEC is reportedly drafting a universal listing standard to speed up the process. This comes after new guidance clarified rules on NAV, custody, and benchmark selection. Meanwhile, the SEC has been positive on crypto ETPs. In an X post on Monday, Seyffart described the SEC’s requests for SOL spot ETF issuers to revise and resubmit their filings by month’s end as an encouraging sign of regulatory progress on crypto ETPs. “Keep in mind that this would just be more amendments and more back and forth, NOT approvals, as I’ve seen some people hint. Pretty much any sort of interactions between the SEC and issuers/exchanges should be viewed positively,” he added. For the Trump Media and Technology Group, the SEC has so far been favorable. It even approved its registration statement for a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal in June. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-08T11:42:08,"Experienced Analyst Explained: ""Data That Always Brought an Increase in Bitcoin Said 'Bullish Again'!""","Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records in 2025 and reached its last record level on May 22. After this date, it fell below $100,000 for a short time towards the end of June, but generally consolidated above $100,000. Bitcoin has struggled to break above $110,000 several times, but has failed to reach a new ATH. Despite the failed attempts, the expectation of a new ATH continues, and one analyst said that Bitcoin is experiencing a squeeze on the Bollinger Bands, indicating a bullish breakout. On-chain analyst Axel Adler said in his latest analysis on his X account that Bitcoin is experiencing a classic Bollinger Bands squeeze. The analyst noted that this indicates an accumulation of bullish energy in BTC and a bullish breakout. “Bitcoin is currently experiencing a typical Bollinger Bands squeeze. The possibility of a breakout to the upside for Bitcoin is very high.” At this point, the analyst focused specifically on the range between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands, noting that the width of the band has narrowed to 7.7%. According to the analyst, this is one of the narrowest levels observed in the current bull cycle. This could be a sign that the price is accumulating upward pressure and a rally is imminent. “Currently, the range between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands is 7.7%, the lowest level in this bull market. This signals that upward pressure is gradually accumulating in the market, which could soon lead to strong price volatility.” Finally, the analyst, who also cited historical data, noted that four of the six similar squeezes during this cycle led to immediate sharp recoveries, while the remaining two first led to brief corrections and then to an increase. The analyst noted that this pattern suggests that the current squeeze could be a precursor to another upward move, but he also reminded that short-term consolidations or corrections are also possible. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-08T11:25:42,"Trump Tariffs Shake Markets — Discover the Best Altcoins to Weather the Tariff Storm","If there’s one constant in crypto, it’s that Donald Trump will either pump the market to the moon or smash it into the floor. This time, it’s the latter. Trump’s latest round of tariffs – 25% on Japan and South Korea, plus vague threats to BRICS-aligned countries – have spooked investors. The crypto market dipped 3.5%, Bitcoin flirted with dropping below $108K, and leveraged traders got flushed for $177M in liquidations. But if you’ve been in this space long enough, you know this dip won’t last. The question is: where do you park your crypto bags when the storm clouds roll in? We’ve rounded up the best altcoins for safety amidst Trump tariffs. Trump’s Market Madness: Tariffs, Tweets, and Temporary Turbulence Trump’s tariff tantrum came in the form of Truth Social posts and a flurry of letters to foreign leaders. He’s hitting Japan and South Korea with 25% tariffs starting August 1, threatening 10% on BRICS countries, and trying to spin it all as a deficit-fixing genius. Traders aren’t buying it. Historically, Trump talks big, then backpedals – remember the last tariff showdown in April? So the correct narrative would be: Bitcoin dipped to around $76K in April, then recovered to hit a new all-time high (ATH) just shy of $112 K in May. The same pattern is likely here. But until the smoke clears, savvy investors are rotating into crypto presales and new crypto projects with utility, strong narratives, and room to grow. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The High-Speed Escape Hatch for Bitcoin Purists With Trump rattling markets again through a new wave of tariffs, many investors are searching for assets that can thrive amid chaos – not just survive it. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in. More than a token, Bitcoin Hyper is the first true Layer 2 built for Bitcoin, unlocking fast, cheap, and scalable transactions on top of the slow, legacy Bitcoin base layer. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it gives devs, builders, and degens everything they love – blazing speed, near-zero gas fees, and full compatibility with Bitcoin and Solana. In short: Bitcoin Hyper is where the action happens. Meme coins , payments, dApps, DeFi – it’s all finally possible on Bitcoin. And at the core of it all? $HYPER, the native token fueling the ecosystem. It powers transactions, staking, governance, and access to future launches. Right now you can buy $HYPER in the presale phase for just $0.012175, and it just passed the $2M raised milestone, signaling strong early momentum. In a world where political noise keeps disrupting the markets, Bitcoin Hyper offers what Bitcoin was always meant to be – fast, useful, and unstoppable. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Smart Investor’s Shelter in a Storm In moments like this, with Trump’s tariff threats rattling global markets and Bitcoin dipping, smart investors look for real utility. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers exactly that. It’s the fuel behind Best Wallet , a sleek, secure, and highly functional multi-chain wallet built for both crypto newcomers and seasoned pros. Unlike clunky legacy wallets like MetaMask, Best Wallet is part of a new generation. It combines fast token swaps, bridging, buying, and portfolio management – all inside a clean interface backed by Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP security tech. There’s also a major advantage for early adopters: the $BEST presale is live exclusively inside the app, rewarding people with early access and lower costs. The token is currently priced at $0.025295 and has already raised $13.7M, backed by a growing 70K+ user community and 50% monthly growth. With powerful features like iGaming bonuses, staking perks, and exclusive presale access via Upcoming Tokens, it’s built to thrive even in shaky markets. Analysts predict $BEST could hit $0.072 in 2025 and $0.62 by 2026 – not bad for a ‘safe’ play during tariff season. 3. Bitcoin Solaris ($BTC‑S) – Mining From Your Pocket While Markets Tremble With Trump’s tariffs rattling crypto sentiment, Bitcoin Solaris ($BTC-S) is another altcoin that offers a compelling alternative – real utility built on Bitcoin’s legacy. This Layer‑1 hybrid blockchain combines Proof‑of‑Work security with a Delegated Proof‑of‑Stake layer, giving people 10K TPS and sub‑2‑second transaction finality – versus Bitcoin’s sluggish 7 TPS and 60‑minute block times. It cuts energy use by over 99%, making it both fast and green. But the real star is mobile mining. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, anyone can earn BTC‑S tokens on their phone, no ASICs required. You just tap ‘start,’ and the app runs lightweight mining in the background, offering passive earnings and governance rights. $BTC‑S is currently in Phase 11 of its presale at $5, with a launch set for $20. Over 13,650 participants have raised nearly $6M. In a nerve‑wracking market driven by Trump’s political noise, Bitcoin Solaris gives investors real issuing power – not just meme hype. It represents bitcoin’s evolution: scalable, accessible, and ready for action. Don’t Let the Trump Dump Fool You Tariffs come and go. Market jitters fade. But smart crypto plays. The ones with real use cases, clear narratives, and solid tokenomics stick around. Whether you’re betting on hyper-deflation with Bitcoin Hyper , better wallets with Best Wallet Token , or sharper tools with Bitcoin Solaris, these three altcoins could help you ride out the Trump storm in style. As always, remember this isn’t financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-tariffs-shake-markets-the-best-altcoins-to-weather-the-tariff-storm/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T11:15:00,"Bitcoin Bulls Bank on Fed's 'Stealth' Rate Cuts: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The one thing bitcoin (BTC) bulls constantly discuss is liquidity easing through Fed interest-rate cuts and the possibility of rates falling back to zero, just as in 2020-21. Back then, the zero rate triggered an unprecedented bull run throughout the financial markets, including low-cap altcoins. Now, new analysis from the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San Francisco shows a 9% chance of the benchmark fed funds rate falling to the so-called zero lower bound within the next seven years. Current data shows expectations for elevated interest rates, but the chance of a zero level remains significant over the medium to long term, it said. That's in the long term. The probability of rates falling that low in the next two years is just 1%. But remember, all it takes is just one black swan event like the Covid crash for the Fed to consider zero rates. For now, rates remain at 4.25% with traders pricing in a single 25 basis-point cut for the rest of the year. The central bank, however, has been conducting stealth rate cuts, that is it's easing liquidity through measures such as reducing the ""enhanced supplementary ratio"" and freeing up money for banks to buy Treasury notes, according to Alexander Blume, CEO at investment adviser Two Prime. Furthermore, the Treasury recently expanded its buyback program, injecting additional capital into the economy, Blume said. It's no surprise, then, that some large traders are anticipating renewed bullish volatility and pouring money into the $130K bitcoin call option on Deribit. The U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows for the third consecutive day on Monday, and traders are also chasing bullish futures bets in XRP. In other news, Bit Digital completed its strategic Treasury shift to ether (ETH)following a $172 million public equity raise and the sale of 280 BTC. Dubai approved the QCD Money Market Fund, a joint product from Qatar National Bank and DMZ Finance. Australia-listed crypto fund manager DigitalX (DCC) raised A$20.7 million ($13.5 million) to boost its BTC stash. Patrick Hansen, Circle's EU strategy director, disclosed on X that 53 companies have obtained licenses in the six months since the European Union implemented the MiCA crypto-asset regulation. The data shows strong demand for compliance-friendly products. Tether, the issuer of the world's largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, hasn't yet sought a license. In traditional markets, the yield on the Japanese 30-year government bond yield rose to 3.11%, the highest since May 22, a sign of renewed volatility in government bonds across advanced nations.

Analysts attribute the surge to increased on-chain activity and capital inflows, with daily active addresses spiking to a two-year high following regulatory approval for the token's listing on local exchanges from Japan’s Financial Services Agency. Sei’s entry into the highly regulated Japanese market is seen as a key catalyst, boosting both investor confidence and institutional interest. The SEI price doubled in June, fueled by a U.S. government-backed stablecoin pilot and momentum around a proposed shift to an EVM-only architecture in SIP-3. Despite long-term upside, SEI remains volatile, currently down over 78% from its March 2024 peak and trading at $0.2649. $0.25 is now a critical technical support level, with some market watchers warning that a break below could lead to a retest of $0.20. Investors are watching closely as Sei juggles rapid growth with high-stakes network changes, regulatory tailwinds and a still-fragile technical setup.

2025-07-08T11:10:43,"Bitcoin ETFs Soar: US Spot Funds Witness Astonishing $216M Inflows","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs Soar: US Spot Funds Witness Astonishing $216M Inflows The world of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is buzzing with renewed vigor! On July 7, these innovative investment vehicles in the U.S. recorded a substantial $216.29 million in total net inflows, marking an impressive third consecutive day of positive flows. This consistent upward trend, as reported by industry observer Trader T on X, signals a growing confidence among investors and underscores the evolving landscape of digital asset investment . What does this sustained positive momentum mean for the broader crypto market, and why are these inflows so significant? Decoding the Latest Surge in Spot Bitcoin ETFs The recent surge in Bitcoin inflows into U.S. spot ETFs highlights a robust appetite for regulated exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone attracted a formidable $164.3 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely, securing $66.05 million in new capital, demonstrating continued strong interest from a diverse range of investors. Even Grayscale’s BTC, a smaller player, managed to pull in $6.22 million, adding to the overall positive sentiment. However, the picture wasn’t entirely uniform. While most funds saw gains, some experienced modest outflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB recorded $10.07 million in net outflows, and Grayscale’s GBTC, which typically sees larger movements due to its conversion from a trust, noted $10.21 million in outflows. The remaining ETFs maintained stable holdings for the day, indicating a concentrated flow into specific, high-performing funds. Here’s a quick breakdown of the July 7th performance: ETF Ticker Net Flow (Millions USD) BlackRock (IBIT) +$164.30 Fidelity (FBTC) +$66.05 Grayscale (BTC) +$6.22 ARK Invest (ARKB) -$10.07 Grayscale (GBTC) -$10.21 Total Net Inflow +$216.29 Why Do Consistent Bitcoin Inflows Matter for the Market? Three consecutive days of positive Bitcoin inflows are more than just a fleeting statistic; they are a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics. This sustained interest suggests that both retail and institutional investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products. For the broader crypto market trends , this signifies: Growing Investor Confidence: A clear signal that market participants are looking beyond short-term volatility and are betting on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Increased Liquidity: Higher inflows contribute to greater liquidity within the ETF ecosystem, potentially leading to more efficient price discovery. Mainstream Acceptance: The continued success of these ETFs helps to normalize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, drawing in capital from traditional finance sectors. What Current Crypto Market Trends Do These Inflows Reflect? The consistent positive flows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a critical component of current crypto market trends . They reflect a maturing market where regulated products are becoming the preferred gateway for many investors. This trend is particularly evident post-Bitcoin halving, where the supply shock combined with steady demand through ETFs could lay the groundwork for future price appreciation. It also highlights a broader shift towards institutional-grade investment vehicles, offering convenience, security, and regulatory oversight that direct crypto ownership might not provide for all investors. The Accelerating Pace of Institutional Adoption The dominance of players like BlackRock and Fidelity in attracting significant capital underscores the accelerating pace of institutional adoption . These financial giants bring with them vast networks of clients, substantial capital, and a reputation for stringent due diligence. Their active participation in the Bitcoin ETF space lends immense credibility to the asset class. Institutions often seek: Regulatory Clarity: ETFs operate within established regulatory frameworks, offering a sense of security. Ease of Access: Investing in a Bitcoin ETF is as straightforward as buying a stock, integrating seamlessly into existing portfolio management systems. Diversification Opportunities: Bitcoin offers a new avenue for diversification, potentially uncorrelated with traditional assets. This institutional embrace is not just about capital; it’s about legitimization, paving the way for even wider acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets. Navigating Digital Asset Investment: Challenges and Opportunities While the recent inflows paint a bullish picture, engaging in digital asset investment through ETFs still requires a nuanced understanding of both opportunities and potential challenges. The crypto market, despite its maturation, remains inherently volatile. Regulatory landscapes can shift, and global macroeconomic factors can influence asset prices. Investors should always consider: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, impacting ETF values. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving, which could introduce new considerations. Due Diligence: Understanding the specifics of each ETF, its fees, and its underlying holdings is crucial. For those looking to capitalize on these trends, the opportunity lies in participating in a burgeoning asset class with increasing mainstream acceptance. The sustained inflows suggest a long-term conviction building among a diverse investor base, hinting at a promising future for Bitcoin as a recognized component of global investment portfolios. A Glimpse into Bitcoin’s Bright Future The consistent positive net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 7 are a powerful testament to the growing demand and confidence in Bitcoin as an investment asset. With major players like BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge, these inflows not only inject fresh capital into the market but also signify a pivotal moment in institutional adoption . As crypto market trends continue to evolve, the increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial products through ETFs is set to reshape the landscape of digital asset investment , offering both seasoned and new investors regulated and accessible pathways to participate in the future of finance.

At this point, while the market is eagerly waiting for an altcoin rally, the CEO of the analysis company announced four altcoins that whales have longed before the altcoin rally.

Which is a part of a meteoric Wave 3 Elliot structure. The thesis highlights that the altcoin could zoom past its highs to target the $13-$15 range. This theory has gained the attention of the community, amidst the recent bullish developments. Seems to good to be true? Is this prediction backed by facts, or speculation driven by hopes? CoinPedia decode the claim. Can $XRP pull another 600% gain like what we did in Nov-Jan in the next wave up? Usually the Wave 3 will be the strongest and most explosive wave. Which means we 'could' potentially expect more than 6x from current price. Personally I think $13-15 is possible. pic.twitter.com/TI0Gt6ktcM — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 7, 2025 Claim XRP will rally 600% in Wave 3 to hit $13–$15 Verdict No Guarantee Fact-Check by CoinPedia Also Read : Is XRP Price Heading for a Crash? Who Made This Claim? The theory is shared by XRPunkie, describing a chart projecting a 600% surge for XRP in the next bullish wave. The post as seen above highlights an Elliott Wave count suggesting XRP could mirror its previous +600% rally which was seen between Nov 2024 and Jan 2025. To reach its new all-time high between $13 and $15 in Wave III. Coinpedia’s Key Findings and Counter-Evidence 1. Elliott Wave Is Pattern-Based, Not an Evidence of Proof? The Elliott Wave framework is widely acknowledged but also subjective. While Wave 3 is generally the strongest, successful execution depends on the correct wave count and ideal market conditions. Many analysts debate XRP’s current wave positioning. 2. XRP Faces Roadblock Near $2.35 Technical indicators show that XRP is testing resistance near $2.35, with the Bollinger Band upper bound and RSI at 56.73, nearing its overbought territory. We believe that this short-term upside may be limited unless backed by a high-volume breakout. 3. Market Conditions Turn Back for Altcoin Explosions BTC dominance stands at 64.5%, overshadowing altcoin growth. Altcoin season index is only 25/100, showing weak alt momentum. The Fear & Greed index is neutral at 50, lacking emotional sentiments that often trigger large rallies. 4. On-Chain Metrics Improving, But Far from a Bull Drive Active addresses on the 90 day time frame and exchange outflows show a modest uptick, suggesting accumulation but not a full-blown demand surge. Volume rose 76.73% in 24 hours, which is positive but not unprecedented. Source: Santiment Also Read : Ripple Price Prediction After XRP ETF Approval 5. Fundamentals Are Strong, But Not Enough Alone XRP Ledger just launched its EVM-compatible sidechain, boosting DeFi prospects. Ripple secured an RLUSD collateral deal and received SEC approval for Grayscale’s XRP ETF, both bullish milestones. The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit could soon reach a resolution . Yet, the price remains modest at $2.26, up just 1.92% in 7 days, indicating skepticism in market reaction. Summary Table: Claim vs Coinpedia’s Evidence Claim Made by Theory Coinpedia’s Counter-Evidence XRP surged 600% in 73 days before, so it can again Past performance ≠ future results, depends on the cycle context Wave 3 will drive XRP to $13–$15 Fibonacci levels are projections, not price guarantees Strong fundamentals will ignite Wave 3 Fundamentals help, but don’t guarantee price spikes Breakout from consolidation is bullish Breakouts need volume + momentum to sustain big moves The market is ready for an altcoin wave BTC dominance is high, altcoin season is not confirmed yet Conclusion The theory that XRP could hit $13–$15 based on Wave 3 projections is plausible but highly speculative. While XRP’s strong fundamentals, recent ETF approval , and sidechain launch support bullish sentiment, technical and macro factors do not yet confirm the conditions needed for a 600% rally. We would suggest investors to watch for a breakout above $2.50 with rising volume and signs of altcoin dominance before considering this theory for purchases.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fact-check-is-xrp-price-set-for-a-600-rally-in-wave-3/,"TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC","News|FactCheck|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T11:00:46,"2025’s Biggest Bitcoin Bull Trigger Is Still Hidden, Expert Reveals","In a conversation with The Bitcoin Economy podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart argued that the next, and potentially largest, leg of institutional demand for spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds will not come from pension funds, endowments, or sovereign wealth managers. Instead, it will arise when the country’s fragmented network of registered investment advisers (RIAs) finally gains full discretionary clearance to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to ordinary clients. “The biggest bull case for the ETFs has been the unlocking of RIAs in 2025,” Seyffart said. “Right now the vast majority of the assets are stuck in that middle ground where, if a client specifically asks to buy a Bitcoin ETF, the adviser can act—but the adviser cannot initiate the recommendation.” The Biggest Bull Case For Bitcoin In 2025 Seyffart broke the compliance bottleneck into a traffic-light schema that most financial advisers will recognise. A red-light firm bars Bitcoin entirely; a yellow-light firm permits unsolicited purchases (“If you come to me and ask for it, I can do it”); and a green-light firm allows the adviser to solicit an allocation (“I can recommend that you put two percent of your portfolio in Bitcoin”). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know Wire-house broker–dealers—which still custody trillions of dollars—largely remain in the red or yellow camps, paralysed by multi-year due-diligence committees. Independent RIAs, by contrast, “were the early adopters,” Seyffart noted, because they “don’t have to wait for a due-diligence team of a bunch of people sitting in New York.” Yet even among independents, most advisers outsource portfolio construction to centralised model portfolios; until those models flag Bitcoin ETFs as eligible holdings, discretionary uptake will stay muted. Seyffart’s focus on 2025 is calendrical, not calendrical: the first full-calendar year after launch gives compliance teams twelve months of daily NAV history—often a hard requirement before a new ETF can graduate from yellow to green status. “Usually it can take two to three years before an ETF gets approved,” he said, but the extraordinary size and liquidity of the spot-Bitcoin cohort is already accelerating that cycle. Crucially, the next Form 13F reporting deadline on 15 August 2025 will reveal second-quarter holdings as of 30 June. Seyffart expects the data to confirm that “a lot more RIAs have come online and [are] buying this for their clients,” providing the first concrete measure of green-light conversions. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned If the gatekeeping retreats, model-portfolio architects can incorporate Bitcoin’s historically uncorrelated returns into strategic-allocation frameworks. That in turn would grant advisers legal cover to solicit Bitcoin exposure, unleashing a flywheel of inflows. Seyffart cautioned that the same compliance teams will demand iron-clad fiduciary justifications—volatility, custody and tax treatment remain live concerns—but he argued that the ETFs now provide a wrapper familiar to any wealth platform. Seyffart’s thesis is that the moment a critical mass of compliance committees flips from yellow to green—allowing advisers to recommend Bitcoin rather than merely transact it—flows could dwarf everything seen to date. Whether that inflection arrives in the next 12 months will determine, in his view, “the biggest bull case for Bitcoin.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,250.

2025-07-08T11:00:43,"Analyst Says XRP Will Rally 44,100% Once Banks Make This Announcement","Crypto analyst BarriC has made a bold prediction that’s stirring conversation across the XRP community: the moment banks and financial institutions publicly announce the adoption and utilization of XRP for real-world transactions, the digital asset could surge to a staggering $1,000 per coin. This would represent a 44,100% increase from its current price, and, according to him, signal the end of the era of cheap XRP forever. In a recent post on X, the analyst asserted that institutional adoption of XRP will fundamentally transform the asset’s value and market behavior. As banks adopt XRP for cross-border payments and liquidity management, demand is likely to surge, far exceeding the available supply. The result, he claims, will be a permanent price revaluation and stabilization at the four-figure level. Once banks and financial institutions announce they’re adopting and utilising $XRP That’s when $XRP skyrockets to $1,000 minimally And essentially #XRP will stabilise there That’s the moment where we will have to say goodbye to cheap $XRP forever No more big dips to buy… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) July 7, 2025 The Utility Behind the Forecast BarriC’s thesis is grounded in Ripple Labs’ long-term vision for XRP as a global bridge currency. Through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, XRP is already facilitating international money transfers by eliminating the need for pre-funded nostro accounts. While several regional financial institutions are currently experimenting with or deploying ODL, especially in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, major global banks have yet to make a full public commitment. He believes that when these larger players formally announce the integration of XRP into their systems, the utility-driven demand will cause a rapid surge in supply. With a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP tokens, an increase in institutional demand could quickly absorb available liquidity, potentially triggering a sharp price increase. “ That’s the moment where we’ll have to say goodbye to cheap XRP forever ,” he noted. No More Bear Markets? BarriC also argues that institutional adoption will insulate XRP from the broader cryptocurrency market cycles, particularly the four-year rhythm typically dictated by Bitcoin halvings. Instead of fluctuating with retail sentiment or macroeconomic trends, XRP’s price would be anchored by continuous utility, similar to traditional financial assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In this new paradigm, the analyst says XRP would no longer experience deep bear markets or 50% price crashes. Instead, it would stabilize at a baseline of $1,000 per token. From that point onward, anyone wishing to join the XRP ecosystem, whether banks, governments, or retail investors, would need to pay the premium. A Divisive Prediction At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.33, following a recent breakout above a major weekly resistance level. Technical analysts, such as Dark Defender and EGRAG Crypto, have issued bullish short-term price targets of $3.99 and beyond. However, BarriC’s forecast extends far beyond technicals, relying instead on the long-term assumption that XRP becomes an integral part of the global financial infrastructure. While many XRP supporters embrace this vision, skeptics point out that such a dramatic price movement would require massive regulatory clarity, widespread utility, and broad institutional trust, factors that remain in development. Still, BarriC’s perspective adds fuel to a growing belief within the XRP community: that the asset’s best days may not just be ahead, but transformative. In his view, the countdown to $1,000 begins the moment the banks go public. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-08T10:51:08,"Google Gemini Sets Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 31, 2025","As the cryptocurrency market faces yet another period of uncertainty, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the well-known meme coin, has come into focus. With July drawing to a close, both investors and enthusiasts are eager to see what the future holds. To offer an informed projection, we consulted Google Gemini, a leading AI model, for its prediction of SHIB’s possible price trajectory by July 31, 2025, based on current technical indicators and market dynamics. In a direct statement from its forecast module, Google Gemini noted, “SHIB would climb approximately 10% to $0.00003.” This projection comes at a time when Shiba Inu is showing modest gains on the daily charts but remains under pressure compared to its position a month ago. SHIB’s Recent Performance Highlights At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001178, reflecting a 3.82% increase in the past 24 hours, though it is still down 6.28% over the last month. The forecast by Google Gemini suggests a recovery trend over the coming weeks, implying that investor sentiment and broader market forces may start turning more favorable for the token. Analyst Views on an Impending Altseason This prediction aligns with broader expectations in the crypto sector about a potential resurgence of altcoins in the near term. A recent Times Tabloid article highlighted remarks from seasoned market analyst CryptoBull, who foresees a major altseason developing within the next three months. CryptoBull stated that market dynamics indicate a decisive shift of capital flows from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and other undervalued tokens, could be imminent. According to his analysis, such a phase would lead to altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in market gains, creating opportunities for significant price appreciation across the sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ecosystem Developments and Market Sentiment The anticipated altseason could directly benefit Shiba Inu, which remains one of the most widely traded and followed altcoins. CryptoBull’s forecast that “a decisive transition from Bitcoin to altcoins is likely to unfold within the next three months” lends further support to Google Gemini’s price target for SHIB, suggesting the AI’s projection is not an isolated outlook but rather one that is reinforced by broader market sentiment. Although SHIB has faced challenges in sustaining higher price levels in the past month, recent developments in its ecosystem, including growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and a surge in token burns, may help it capitalize on an incoming altcoin rally. Google Gemini’s forecast is notable for its tempered optimism, reflecting a realistic consideration of market conditions rather than extreme bullishness. Its estimate of about a 10% increase over the current price level suggests confidence in a gradual upward trend, contingent on improving market conditions and investor risk appetite returning to altcoins.

2025-07-08T10:51:04,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC at Risk of Pullback as New ATH Hopes Diminish","Bitcoin has slightly lost its bullish steam upon nearing the $111K all-time high, with strong selling pressure emerging at this key level. The price continues to struggle in reclaiming this threshold, signaling a likely period of consolidation or corrective movement in the days ahead. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s bullish rally toward its all-time high of $111K has shown signs of exhaustion, with the price losing momentum near this key resistance. The inability to reclaim the previous high around $110K suggests the potential formation of a double-top pattern, a classic bearish reversal signal. Currently, BTC is consolidating within a critical price range, bounded by the $111K ATH and a fair value gap between $103K and $104K. Given the visible weakness in bullish momentum, a short-term rejection and further consolidation within this zone are likely. That said, the FVG may act as a significant demand zone, potentially halting any deeper corrections and providing the base for another upward attempt toward the $111K mark. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, BTC failed to print a new higher high above $110K, encountering notable rejection at this resistance. This price action confirms the presence of heightened selling pressure and distribution behavior near the ATH zone, reinforcing $111K as a key barrier. Bitcoin now trades between two prominent liquidity zones: one just below $105K and the other above $110K. These liquidity pools are attractive targets for institutional players and could drive price volatility in the short term. As such, a range-bound movement is expected between these levels until a decisive breakout occurs, likely triggered by a liquidity sweep in either direction. Sentiment Analysis By ShayanMarkets Over the past 45 days, taker users on Binance Derivatives have persistently engaged in sell-side activity. Despite this, Bitcoin has remained range-bound between $100K and $110K, while the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has shown a consistent negative trend throughout the period. The CVD, which measures the net flow of buy and sell volume in real time, highlights a clear dominance of aggressive selling pressure. However, the price’s ability to hold steady, without further decline, points to a potential absorption phase, likely directed by institutional investors or large-scale players quietly accumulating. This ongoing divergence between persistent sell-side flow and stable price action suggests that Bitcoin may be forming a strong base. If the current structure holds, with continued absorption within the range, the likelihood of a bullish breakout increases, potentially setting the stage for a renewed uptrend.

2025-07-08T10:40:48,"Altcoin Season: Decoding the Bitcoin Market’s Dominant Shift","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Decoding the Bitcoin Market’s Dominant Shift The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, marked by cycles of growth, consolidation, and shifting dominance. Currently, all eyes are on the Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric that helps investors gauge the broader market sentiment and the prevailing power dynamics between Bitcoin and the vast universe of altcoins. With the index recently registering a low of 26, it unequivocally signals that the market is firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season. But what does this mean for your digital asset portfolio, and how should you navigate these turbulent waters? What Exactly is Altcoin Season, and Why Does it Matter? Before we delve into the current state, let’s clarify what defines an Altcoin Season . This highly anticipated period is when a significant majority of altcoins — cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin — experience substantial price gains, often outperforming Bitcoin itself. The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a quantifiable measure for this phenomenon. According to CMC’s methodology, for the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Historically, Altcoin Seasons have been characterized by: Explosive Growth: Many altcoins can see parabolic price increases, often far exceeding Bitcoin’s percentage gains. Innovation Spotlight: New projects, technologies, and use cases within the altcoin space gain traction and investment. Risk-On Sentiment: Investors become more comfortable taking on higher risk in pursuit of greater returns. Understanding Altcoin Season is vital because it can dictate investment strategies, highlighting periods where diversification into smaller, more volatile assets might yield significant profits. Conversely, misinterpreting the market can lead to substantial losses. Decoding Bitcoin Season: When the King Reigns Supreme The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 26 means we are experiencing a Bitcoin Season . This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the 90-day period. In essence, Bitcoin reasserts its dominance, often acting as a safe haven or the primary beneficiary of new capital entering the crypto market. Several factors typically contribute to a Bitcoin Season: Flight to Quality: During periods of uncertainty or market corrections, investors often consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, perceiving it as less volatile and more established than altcoins. Institutional Inflows: Large institutional investors often prioritize Bitcoin due to its liquidity, market cap, and perceived regulatory clarity compared to the fragmented altcoin market. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events can drive investors towards Bitcoin as a store of value. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reductions (halvings) often precede significant price rallies, drawing attention and capital away from altcoins. During Bitcoin Season, altcoins may stagnate, experience price declines, or simply fail to keep pace with Bitcoin’s upward momentum. This period tests the conviction of altcoin holders and often leads to a re-evaluation of portfolios. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: A Strategic Approach With the Altcoin Season Index at 26, the message is clear: Bitcoin is currently the dominant force in the market. This isn’t necessarily a negative signal for the entire crypto space; rather, it indicates a specific phase within the broader Crypto Market Trends . For investors, recognizing this shift is paramount to making informed decisions. Here’s a breakdown of what the index implies and how to interpret it: Altcoin Season Index Range Market State Implication for Investors 75 – 100 Strong Altcoin Season High potential for altcoin gains; consider diversifying into promising altcoins. 25 – 74 Bitcoin Season (Mixed/Transitional) Bitcoin shows strength; some altcoins may perform, but overall altcoin market lags. Focus on strong fundamentals. 0 – 24 Strong Bitcoin Season Bitcoin dominance is pronounced; altcoins likely to struggle. Prioritize Bitcoin or stablecoins. The current reading of 26 places us at the very cusp of a strong Bitcoin Season, indicating that the vast majority of altcoins are currently underperforming Bitcoin. This isn’t a call to panic, but rather a prompt for strategic adjustment. The Altcoin Index: Your Compass in Volatile Waters The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Index serves as a valuable compass in the often-volatile cryptocurrency markets. It’s a simple yet powerful tool that distills complex market dynamics into a single, digestible number. The index specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to ensure that its calculation accurately reflects the performance of native altcoin projects against Bitcoin. While the index is a useful indicator, it’s important to understand its nuances and limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on past 90-day performance, meaning it tells you what has happened, not necessarily what will happen tomorrow. It’s a reflection of the current trend, not a predictive tool. Top 100 Focus: It only considers the top 100 coins by market capitalization. This means smaller, emerging altcoins — which can sometimes explode in price independently — are not directly factored into its calculation. Context is Key: The index should always be viewed in conjunction with other market indicators, macroeconomic news, and fundamental analysis of individual assets. Think of the Altcoin Index as a barometer for market sentiment. A low reading signals caution for altcoin-heavy portfolios, while a high reading suggests a more favorable environment for speculative altcoin investments. Maximizing Cryptocurrency Performance: Strategies for Every Season Understanding the current Bitcoin Season is the first step; the next is to adapt your investment strategies to optimize your Cryptocurrency Performance . Here are some actionable insights: During Bitcoin Season (like now): Prioritize Bitcoin: Consider increasing your Bitcoin holdings. If Bitcoin is leading the market, a larger allocation to BTC can help you participate in the primary upward momentum. Accumulate Strategically: Look for opportunities to accumulate strong altcoins that have corrected significantly during Bitcoin’s dominance. Research projects with solid fundamentals, strong development teams, and clear use cases. Stablecoin Stance: Holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins can provide liquidity to buy dips or rotate into promising assets when the market shifts. Focus on Large Caps: Within the altcoin space, larger cap altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, BNB) tend to be more resilient during Bitcoin-led phases than smaller, highly speculative assets. Risk Management: Re-evaluate your risk exposure. During Bitcoin Season, highly speculative altcoins can experience significant drawdowns. Preparing for Altcoin Season (when the index rises): Diversify Wisely: Once the Altcoin Season Index begins to show sustained upward movement (e.g., crossing 50-60), consider rotating some profits from Bitcoin into a diversified basket of altcoins. Research Emerging Narratives: Keep an eye on new trends and sectors within crypto (e.g., AI, DePIN, Gaming, L2s) that could drive the next altcoin rally. Take Profits: Altcoin Season can be exhilarating, but it’s crucial to have a profit-taking strategy. Markets are cyclical, and what goes up often comes down. Stay Informed: Continuous learning and staying updated on market news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are crucial for long-term success. Ultimately, successful navigation of the crypto market depends on a blend of understanding market cycles, conducting thorough research, and maintaining disciplined risk management. The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool in this endeavor, providing a clear snapshot of the current landscape. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 26 firmly places us in a Bitcoin Season. This isn’t a time for reckless altcoin speculation, but rather an opportunity to consolidate, research, and strategically position your portfolio for future market shifts. By understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season, and by utilizing tools like the Altcoin Index, investors can make more informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and ultimately enhance their long-term cryptocurrency performance. Remember, the crypto market is cyclical, and adaptability is key to thriving in its ever-changing environment.

In an official press release , the company’s CEO, Yoshihiko Takahashi, explained that it was initially his own decision to receive his salary in BTC ( BTC ) from the company. He saw the move as a declaration of his loyalty to the company’s Bitcoin strategy as well as aligning himself with shareholders. “My decision to receive my entire compensation in Bitcoin is a clear signal that I am ‘in the same boat’ as our shareholders,” said Yoshihiko. According to the announcement, shareholders had urged Remixpoint’s management to hold company stocks so that the company’s fate is linked with those of its shareholders. However, Remixpoint claimed it could not hold its own stocks due to several regulatory constraints, including concerns regarding insider trading. Therefore, the company offered an alternative solution, which was to pay its President’s salary fully in Bitcoin. “By receiving compensation in Bitcoin, the company’s leadership will share the same economic fate as shareholders, fostering a system that aligns economic value with investors,” wrote the company in its statement.

2025-07-08T10:30:45,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding Crucial Market Sentiment at 65","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding Crucial Market Sentiment at 65 Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? If you’re invested in digital assets, you know that emotions can run high, often dictating price movements. This is precisely where tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index become invaluable. It’s more than just a number; it’s a snapshot of the collective emotional state of the market, helping investors navigate the often-turbid waters of cryptocurrency trading. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter for Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, is a unique barometer designed to gauge the prevailing market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. It aggregates various data points to produce a single, easy-to-understand score ranging from 0 to 100. 0 (Extreme Fear): Indicates that investors are overly worried, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for those brave enough to go against the crowd. 100 (Extreme Greed): Suggests that the market is overheated, with investors exhibiting irrational exuberance, which could precede a correction. As of July 8, the index stands at 65, a slight dip of eight points from the previous day, yet it firmly remains in the “Greed” zone. This isn’t just a random number; it tells us that despite a minor cooling off, the overall sentiment among crypto participants is still leaning towards optimism and eagerness to buy, rather than fear or panic selling. Understanding this index is crucial because emotional trading often leads to poor decisions. By providing an objective measure of market psychology, the index helps you identify when the market might be driven by irrational exuberance or undue panic, allowing for more strategic and less emotional investment choices. It’s a powerful tool to complement your technical and fundamental analysis, offering a holistic view of the crypto market trends . Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does a 65 Mean for Your Crypto Market Trends? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Greed’ zone, particularly at a score of 65, it signifies a market where optimism is high, and investors are feeling confident. But what does this really imply for you and the broader crypto market trends ? A score of 65 suggests that while the market isn’t at peak euphoria (which would be closer to 80-100), there’s a strong buying appetite. People are likely seeing recent gains and are keen to jump in, or perhaps add to their existing positions. This can be a double-edged sword: Positive Momentum: Continued greed can fuel further price increases as more capital flows into the market. Increased Risk: High greed levels can also indicate that assets might be overvalued, making them susceptible to sudden corrections if sentiment shifts or negative news emerges. It’s often said that ‘when everyone is greedy, be fearful.’ For investors, a 65 might suggest a need for caution. While it’s not extreme greed, it’s certainly not a time for complacency. It could be an opportune moment to: Review your portfolio: Consider taking some profits off the table, especially from assets that have seen significant gains. Tighten stop-losses: Protect your investments from potential downturns. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Resist the urge to chase pumps, as these often lead to losses if not timed perfectly. The slight dip from the previous day (from 73 to 65) also hints at a minor cooling of sentiment, perhaps a healthy consolidation rather than an outright reversal. This is where paying attention to daily movements, not just the zone, becomes crucial. The Pillars of Sentiment: Unpacking the Factors Behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The robustness of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on a single metric but combines six key factors, each weighted differently, to paint a comprehensive picture of investor psychology . Here’s a breakdown of what goes into this sophisticated calculation: Factor Weighting Description & Impact Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable periods can reflect confidence. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to average values. High buying volumes in a rising market indicate greed, while low volumes or high selling volumes suggest fear. Social Media 15% Scans various social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for keywords and hashtags related to Bitcoin. A higher rate of positive mentions and engagement can indicate growing greed. Surveys 15% Polls a large group of people on their perception of the market. (Note: Currently paused, so this weighting is temporarily redistributed among other factors or the index is adjusted.) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates fear (investors flocking to ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while falling dominance suggests greed (investors speculating on altcoins). Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin. Rising search volumes for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble” indicate fear, whereas generic searches like “buy Bitcoin” suggest greed. Each of these components offers a unique lens into the market’s collective mindset, making the index a powerful aggregate indicator. The pausing of surveys means the remaining factors temporarily bear a slightly higher implicit weight, emphasizing the importance of real-time market data and social sentiment. Navigating Volatility and Market Momentum: Key Drivers of Investor Psychology Among the six factors contributing to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , volatility and market momentum/volume stand out with the highest weighting at 25% each. This significant allocation underscores their profound impact on investor psychology and the overall market mood. Let’s delve into why these two elements are so critical: Volatility: The Pulse of Market Uncertainty Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset increases or decreases. In the crypto market, volatility is famously high. While some see it as an opportunity for quick gains, extreme volatility can induce significant fear. When Bitcoin’s price swings wildly, especially downwards, it triggers panic selling as investors rush to protect their capital. Conversely, sustained periods of lower volatility, or controlled upward volatility, can foster a sense of security and confidence, pushing the index towards greed. The index specifically looks at Bitcoin’s current volatility compared to its historical averages. A sudden spike in volatility, particularly on the downside, will pull the index towards ‘Fear’. A more stable or gradually ascending market, on the other hand, will contribute to ‘Greed’. It’s a direct reflection of how comfortable or uncomfortable investors are with the current price movements. Market Momentum and Volume: The Strength of Conviction This factor assesses the strength and direction of price movements, coupled with the trading volume. High trading volume during a strong upward price trend (bullish momentum) indicates strong buying interest and conviction among investors. This is a clear sign of greed, as participants are actively accumulating assets, driving prices higher. Conversely, if prices are falling on high volume, it suggests strong selling pressure and widespread fear. Low trading volumes, regardless of price direction, can indicate indecision or a lack of conviction, often preceding a significant move once sentiment solidifies. The combination of price direction and volume provides a powerful gauge of how committed investors are to their current positions, reflecting the true underlying market sentiment . These two factors, individually and combined, offer deep insights into the immediate market dynamics and the collective emotional response of traders and investors. They are often the first indicators to shift, reflecting changes in sentiment before they become widely apparent. Actionable Insights: Using the Index to Inform Your Crypto Trading Strategy The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, but like any indicator, it should not be used in isolation. Its true value comes when integrated into a broader, well-thought-out crypto trading strategy . Here’s how you can leverage its insights: 1. Counter-Cyclical Investing: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful This classic Warren Buffett quote perfectly encapsulates how to use the index. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-20), it often signals a bottom or a significant buying opportunity, as assets are likely undervalued due to widespread panic. Conversely, when the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’ (80-100), it might be time to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, as the market could be overbought and due for a correction. A reading of 65, while in ‘Greed,’ isn’t extreme, but it’s a prompt to exercise caution and perhaps trim positions rather than aggressively buy. 2. Complement with Technical and Fundamental Analysis The index provides a macro-level sentiment view. Combine it with: Technical Analysis (TA): Look at price charts, support/resistance levels, moving averages, and other indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD). If the index shows ‘Greed’ and TA indicates overbought conditions or resistance, it strengthens the case for caution. Fundamental Analysis (FA): Consider the underlying value of the cryptocurrency, project developments, partnerships, regulatory news, and adoption rates. Strong fundamentals can sometimes justify higher ‘Greed’ levels, while weak fundamentals in a greedy market are a red flag. 3. Risk Management and Portfolio Rebalancing Use the index as a trigger for risk management decisions: When in Fear: Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into your preferred assets, buying small amounts regularly to average down your entry price. This strategy minimizes the risk of trying to catch the absolute bottom. When in Greed: Rebalance your portfolio by selling a portion of your most profitable assets, or setting tighter stop-loss orders to protect gains. This helps you de-risk and secure profits before a potential downturn. 4. Understand Its Limitations The index is primarily focused on Bitcoin’s sentiment, as Bitcoin largely dictates the overall crypto market trends . While it provides a good proxy for the broader market, altcoin movements can sometimes diverge. Also, it’s a lagging or concurrent indicator, not a crystal ball. It reflects current sentiment, which can change rapidly based on breaking news or unexpected events. By thoughtfully integrating the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your decision-making process, you can gain a significant edge, moving beyond emotional reactions to more calculated and profitable investment actions. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and its Role in Overall Market Sentiment One of the intriguing factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Bitcoin dominance , weighted at 10%. While seemingly small, its role is pivotal in reflecting broader market sentiment and investor risk appetite. Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter? Historically, Bitcoin has been seen as the ‘safer’ or ‘less volatile’ asset compared to thousands of altcoins. Its established network, larger liquidity, and first-mover advantage often make it a refuge during times of uncertainty. Here’s how its dominance typically correlates with market sentiment: Rising Bitcoin Dominance (Fear): When investors are fearful or uncertain about the market’s future, they tend to sell off their more speculative altcoins and move their capital back into Bitcoin. This flight to quality increases Bitcoin’s market share, pushing the index towards ‘Fear’. It signals a consolidation of capital in the perceived safest asset. Falling Bitcoin Dominance (Greed): Conversely, when market sentiment is bullish and investors feel greedy, they tend to rotate their profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns from more volatile assets. This ‘altcoin season’ reduces Bitcoin’s dominance and pushes the index towards ‘Greed’, indicating a higher appetite for risk and speculation. Therefore, a high Bitcoin dominance often coincides with ‘Fear’ in the market, while a low dominance (and a thriving altcoin market) typically aligns with ‘Greed’. The index captures this dynamic, adding another layer of insight into the collective risk assessment of investors. It’s a subtle but powerful signal for understanding the underlying shifts in investor psychology . Beyond the Numbers: The Nuances of Crypto Market Trends While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a fantastic quantitative measure of market sentiment , it’s essential to look beyond just the numbers and understand the qualitative nuances driving crypto market trends . The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, influenced by a myriad of factors that extend beyond what a single index can capture. External Economic Factors The broader macroeconomic environment plays an increasingly significant role. Inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, global geopolitical events, and even traditional stock market performance can heavily influence crypto prices and, consequently, sentiment. For instance, rising interest rates often make riskier assets like crypto less attractive, potentially pushing the index towards fear. Regulatory Developments Government regulations, or even the anticipation of them, can cause dramatic shifts in market sentiment. Positive regulatory clarity can spur adoption and investment, leading to greed, while restrictive measures or outright bans can trigger widespread fear and sell-offs. Staying informed about legislative discussions in major economies is vital. Technological Innovations and Adoption Breakthroughs in blockchain technology, the launch of major decentralized applications (dApps), increased institutional adoption, or significant upgrades to existing protocols (like Ethereum’s move to Proof-of-Stake) can inject massive optimism into the market, driving the index towards greed. Conversely, security breaches or project failures can quickly erode confidence. Social and Cultural Shifts The growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, celebrity endorsements, or viral social media movements can also influence sentiment. While the index captures social media mentions, the underlying cultural shift towards digital assets is a long-term trend that reinforces overall market confidence. Understanding these broader currents allows investors to interpret the index’s readings with greater context. A ‘Greed’ reading of 65 might be sustainable if backed by strong fundamentals and positive external factors, but it could be precarious if global economic headwinds are looming. The index is a compass, but you still need a map of the wider world to navigate effectively. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The cryptocurrency market is an exhilarating, yet often unpredictable, environment. Emotions, particularly fear and greed, are powerful forces that can drive prices to irrational highs and devastating lows. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial beacon, offering an objective measure of the collective market sentiment , helping investors to cut through the noise and make more informed decisions. As the index currently sits at 65, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, it signals a prevailing optimism. However, as we’ve explored, this isn’t a signal to throw caution to the wind. Instead, it’s a reminder to exercise prudence, perhaps rebalance portfolios, and avoid succumbing to FOMO. By understanding the intricate factors that contribute to this index – from volatility and market momentum to Bitcoin dominance and social media trends – you gain a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the crypto market trends . Ultimately, the index is a powerful component of a comprehensive crypto trading strategy . It empowers you to think critically about investor psychology , acting as a counter-indicator when emotions run wild, and helping you identify potential opportunities or risks. In a market where emotions can dictate fortunes, having a tool that measures these very emotions is truly invaluable.

Here Are the Details","Murano Global Investments, a Nasdaq-listed real estate company that operates hotels across Mexico, has announced that it will create a treasury strategy based on Bitcoin (BTC). The company also plans to integrate BTC as a payment method and loyalty rewards system. Murano Builds Bitcoin Treasury with $500 Million Deal The company, which has a market value of about $800 million, saw its stock drop just over 1% following the announcement. Murano stated in its statement that it has signed a stock purchase agreement (SEPA) that could reach up to $500 million and that this capital will be used “primarily” for Bitcoin investment purposes. The company stated that it will continue its current hotel and real estate development activities, but new initiatives such as allowing guests to pay with BTC or earn loyalty rewards in BTC are also being evaluated. “We see Bitcoin not only as an asset with long-term growth potential, but also as a tool to strengthen our balance sheet against inflation and systemic risks,” said Elias Sacal, Chairman and CEO of Murano. Murano’s move comes on the heels of its participation in the industry alliance “Bitcoin for Corporations,” launched by Michael Saylor-led Strategy (MSTR) and BTC Inc. The company also recently announced that it purchased 21 BTC, which is worth over $2.1 million at current prices. Murano’s move is seen as a new example of institutional companies’ growing interest in expanding their digital asset strategies. *This is not investment advice.

Metaplanet, which has the largest corporate bitcoin stash outside of North America , will use BTC as collateral to finance acquisitions of cash-generating businesses, Gerovich said. The Japanese hotel company turned bitcoin investor acquired 2,205 BTC this week , increasing its holdings to 15,555 BTC ($1.7 billion) and is targeting a holding of 210,000 by the end of 2027. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can . . . to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up,"" Gerovich said, according to the FT's report. “Then we have phase two . . . when bitcoin, like securities or government bonds, can be deposited with banks and then they’ll provide very attractive financing against that asset. We’ll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses, cash-flowing businesses.” Cryptocurrency-backed lending is offered by a number of crypto-native companies , but is rare among traditional banks. Gerovich added that phase one would probably last four to six years, after which it would become incrementally more difficult to acquire BTC due to tightening availability. Metaplanet's Tokyo-listed shares closed at 1,565 yen ($10.71) on Tuesday, 0.84% higher on the day. The company did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

2025-07-08T10:21:37,"ARK Invest to launch four “buffer ETFs” after losing billions","After bleeding billions from its flagship funds, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is reportedly taking a defensive turn. It is entering into the booming “buffer ETF” arena with a fresh lineup of loss-limiting products. The firm filed proposals last week for four new exchange-traded funds, the ARK Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 Defined Innovation ETFs. These Exchange-traded funds are designed to cushion downside risks while limiting upside returns. Each product will follow a rolling 12-month strategy starting in January, April, July, and October, respectively. This space has turned out to be an investors’ hunt for protection in a slump while already being dominated by BlackRock, Allianz, and Innovator. Ark bets big on buffer ETFs According to the report, the proposed ETFs will aim to shield investors from around 50% of any decline in ARKK while offering full exposure to gains above a 5% threshold. ARKK is Ark’s $6.8 billion flagship innovation fund. It is expected that the buffer ETF market led by BlackRock could hit $650 billion by 2030. It added that assets in defined-outcome ETFs have already hit $69 billion in 2025. In an environment marked by rate volatility, trade tensions, and rising geopolitical risks, downside protection is becoming a hot commodity. Traditional, crypto, and all sorts of markets are already dealing with massive fluctuations led by an indecisive situation created by US President Donald Trump. In the fresh trade threats , Trump has set 14 countries on the list. This includes key US allies Japan and South Korea, on notice to face a 25% to 40% increase from August 1. Source: Bloomberg. ARK’s timing isn’t accidental as it is racking up strong returns in 2025. ARKK is up 50% over the past 12 months, and ARKW, the firm’s internet-focused fund, has gained 80%. The report mentions that the retail enthusiasm seems to be drying up as ARKK is now on pace for its 19th straight month of net outflows. It has shed $2 billion in the past year. ARKK price saw a minor decline in the last trading session. It traded around $70.44. “These are like Diet Ark,” stated Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence. “Investors want the kick, but without the sleepless nights.” Cathie Wood rebalances Ark Invest The buffer ETF push comes as Ark looks to fine-tune its core positions. On July 7, the firm added 659,428 shares of Beam Therapeutics (BEAM), approx. worth over $13 million. Meanwhile, it scaled back on Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), 908 Devices (MASS), and Roblox (RBLX), too. It sold 12,143 shares of IONS (approx. worth $522K) through the ARKG ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a total net inflow of $217 million on July 7. This marks three consecutive days of net inflows, suggesting stable market conditions. However, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) reported an outflow of $10.07 million in the same session. This comes in when ARKB saw a massive inflow of $114.25 million on July 3 (previous trading session). Bitcoin price dropped marginally over the last 24 hours. BTC is trading at an average price of $108,382 at press time. It is still up by 87% over the last year. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume spiked by 19% to hit $47.25 billion.

Key Takeaways: Remixpoint is now paying its CEO entirely in Bitcoin, a first for a Tokyo-listed firm. The company adopted Bitcoin over stock due to insider trading restrictions. This move strengthens its crypto-focused strategy and aligns leadership with shareholders. The move, announced Tuesday , is part of a broader strategy to align executive incentives with shareholder outcomes and reinforce commitment to the company’s financial performance. In its press release, Remixpoint said the initiative aims to ensure the leadership “shares the same economic fate as shareholders,” a response to previous shareholder requests that executives hold company stock. Remixpoint Executives Chose Bitcoin Over Company Stock Due to restrictions related to insider trading laws, however, holding equity was not a viable option for executives. Instead, the firm turned to Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency’s close price correlation with its own stock as a way to mirror the financial ups and downs of its investors. CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi described the decision as a “clear signal” of his commitment to corporate value and shareholder-focused governance. Remixpoint’s Bitcoin compensation policy builds on its crypto-forward strategy launched last year. In September last year, the company began investing in digital assets as a hedge against yen depreciation and to diversify currency exposure. Its crypto portfolio includes over 1,000 BTC, 900 ETH, nearly 14,000 SOL, 1.2 million XRP, and 2.8 million DOGE, according to its website.

Despite the BITPoint sale, Remixpoint has continued to pursue crypto-related business avenues. The firm began its crypto-buying strategy in 2024. Following the announcement, Remixpoint’s stock rose 0.71% on Tuesday. Japanese Firms Double Down on Bitcoin Strategy Japanese firms show no sign of slowing their Bitcoin-buying fervor. The famously Bitcoin-keen Metaplanet has been consistently boosting the size of its own BTC holdings . On Monday, Metaplanet expanded its Bitcoin treasury strategy with the purchase of 2,205 additional BTC . The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a key metric tracking the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share, rose 15.1% between July 1 and July 7, adding 2,017 BTC worth 31.7 billion yen in the quarter-to-date period. BTC Yield highlights the net Bitcoin growth relative to share dilution, which the firm views as a measure of shareholder accretion.

2025-07-08T10:15:10,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 8, 2025","The crypto market is down today again. The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap and all top 10 coins saw their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen 3.8% to $3.42 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $87.3 billion. TLDR: After one day of upward movement, the crypto market turned downwards; BTC and ETH are slightly down but overall largely unchanged, trading at $108,322 and $2,558, respectively; While crypto market saw a mild drop, stocks fell sharply on the tariff news coming from the US, reigniting global trade war fears; US BTC and ETH ETFs have resumed positive flows yesterday; ’Bitcoin is taking its place at the forefront of the conversation’; ’The lines between traditional finance, the DeFi ecosystem, and Bitcoin are blurring faster than ever’; Underlying metrics still reflect mixed investor sentiment. Crypto Winners & Losers In contrast to yesterday, the prices of all the top 10 coins per market cap have dropped today. However, only two fell above 0.5%, meaning that the majority of the coins in this category are practically unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.4%, currently trading at $108,322. This is still largely unchanged over the past five days. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 0.3%, currently changing hands at $2,558. The only two coins with increases above 0.5% are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) , with a drop of 2.5% and 1.3% to the price of $0.1682 and $149, respectively. When it comes to the top 100 coins, about a dozen are up at the time of writing. Bonk (BONK) is the best performer today. It’s up 6.8% to $0.00002347. POL (POL) is up 1.7% to $0.1868, while the rest are up below 1% each. On the other hand, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and SPX6900 (SPX) fell the most in this category. They’re down 7.7% and 6.8% to the prices of $1.08 and $1.24, respectively. Financial markets in general reacted to US President Donald Trump’s letters to several countries, threatening tariffs of 25%-40% and reigniting global trade war fears. Notably, he accused Japan and South Korea of unfair trade practices, and he warned of new 25% duties. The new deadline is 1 August. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each.

Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has argued that the crypto community should turn to “copyleft” licensing . He says that the sector is drifting away from its open-source roots. “The crypto space in particular has become more competitive and mercenary,” Buterin wrote. “We are less able than before to count on people open-sourcing their work purely out of niceness. Copyleft can be viewed as a very broad-based and neutral way of incentivizing more diffusion.” ‘Broader Mix of Market Signals’ James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented that Bitcoin surged to a record June closing at $107,100 and experienced its strongest week above $109,200, but “the ‘neutral’ reading reflects a broader mix of market signals.” “While institutions have been piling in, a lot of money is quite tentative right now as the world appears to be on a knife’s edge both geopolitically and macro-economically.” The index factors include volatility, trading volume, options activity, social‑media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and search‑trend data, Toledano says. “Price momentum may be strong, but muted volume and rising volatility suggest caution.” “Meanwhile, high hedging activity or increased wary sentiment on social media and search trends could also dampen greed. In short, while prices rally, underlying metrics still reflect mixed investor sentiment,” he concluded. Moreover, following EthCC 2025 , Alexei Zamyatin, BOB Co-Founder and BitVM researcher, commented that the conference made “one thing clear: the lines between traditional finance, the DeFi ecosystem, and Bitcoin are blurring faster than ever.” He continued: “From Robinhood’s tokenized equities to modular rollups and decentralised AI, the event showcased the accelerating convergence of these once-distant worlds. The growing interest in Bitcoin DeFi was also unmistakable, a sign that even at Ethereum’s flagship event, Bitcoin is taking its place at the forefront of the conversation.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,322. The price first increased to the intraday high of $109,056 but then swiftly dropped to $107,591. It has slightly recovered to the current price since. Bitcoin Price Chart.

2025-07-08T10:13:51,"Here’s the Mysterious XRP Ledger Co-Founder Who Holds 2% of All XRP","An analyst calls Arthur Britto one of crypto’s most important yet unknown figures after a rare public message from the XRP founder following a decade of silence. In a series of tweets , the widely followed XRP analyst “All Things XRP” spotlighted Arthur Britto, one of Ripple’s original architects. He described Britto as a key figure in crypto history who remains largely unknown to the public.The Hidden Founder of RippleArthur Britto notably co-founded Ripple Labs in 2012 alongside David Schwartz, Chris Larsen, and Jed McCaleb. More importantly, he helped build the XRP Ledger as an alternative to Bitcoin, aiming to offer faster, more scalable, and energy-efficient transactions.Britto played a pivotal role in shaping XRP’s design as a decentralized payment system intended to disrupt traditional finance. With a focus on low fees and high speed, XRP aimed to address the inefficiencies that plagued early cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. His early contributions helped establish XRP as one of the top digital assets by market capitalization.However, unlike his co-founders, Britto has largely avoided the limelight, rarely appearing in public or granting interviews.Is Arthur Britto Satoshi?His identity has remained largely unknown despite his legacy. Consequently, Britto's extreme privacy has drawn comparisons to that of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.Some even speculate that Britto could be Satoshi himself, though no evidence supports this theory. Interestingly, some find humorous hints in Satoshi’s last known public appearance, which coincided with the launch of the XRP Ledger.Meanwhile, his 2% stake in XRP, secured in a 2012 agreement, further cements his influence in Ripple’s foundation.Cryptic Return After 14 YearsLast month, Britto reemerged from the shadows and posted a single emoji on X. This marked his first public appearance in over a decade. The post was verified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz, sparking a wave of speculation.Some suggested it was a subtle hint about a major development in the XRP ecosystem, noting that Britto doesn’t post without reason.Interestingly, the XRP community has widely attributed to Britto the ambitious prediction that XRP could someday reach $10,000. However, this remains unconfirmed.Still, Pulling Strings Quietly?While Britto continues to stay behind the scenes, he remains active in blockchain innovation through PolySign, a crypto custody infrastructure firm he co-founded.Notably, PolySign was the parent company of Standard Custody & Trust Company, which is now part of Ripple and is referred to as Ripple Custody.

2025-07-08T10:10:15,"CoreWeave Acquisition: A Monumental $9B Deal Transforms AI Data Centers","BitcoinWorld CoreWeave Acquisition: A Monumental $9B Deal Transforms AI Data Centers For many in the cryptocurrency world, the evolution of digital infrastructure is a familiar narrative. Just as Bitcoin mining once demanded vast computational resources, the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence now drives an unprecedented race for data center capacity. The latest seismic shift in this landscape comes with the monumental announcement from CoreWeave: a staggering CoreWeave acquisition of data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at $9 billion. CoreWeave Acquisition: The $9 Billion Bet on AI On Monday, July 7, 2025, CoreWeave, a specialized cloud provider for AI workloads, confirmed its intent to acquire Core Scientific , a prominent data center infrastructure provider. This isn’t just another corporate merger; it’s a strategic move that underscores the intense demand for compute power fueled by generative AI. The $9 billion all-stock transaction immediately grants CoreWeave access to an astonishing more than one gigawatt of data center capacity. To put that into perspective, one gigawatt is enough energy to power over 850,000 homes, now earmarked for the insatiable demands of AI training and inference workloads. This acquisition is a clear signal of CoreWeave’s aggressive expansion strategy, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI compute revolution. The deal significantly bolsters CoreWeave’s ability to provide the specialized GPU-accelerated cloud services essential for cutting-edge AI development. Core Scientific’s Evolution: From Bitcoin Mining to AI Data Centers Interestingly, Core Scientific has a history deeply rooted in the digital asset space, much like CoreWeave itself. Both companies previously offered Bitcoin mining services, a sector known for its substantial energy consumption. However, as the AI boom gained momentum, Core Scientific shrewdly pivoted its focus. Its existing infrastructure, originally designed for energy-intensive cryptocurrency operations, is now being repurposed and optimized to run and train generative AI models. This transition highlights a broader industry trend: the repurposing of high-capacity data centers from crypto mining to AI, leveraging existing power grids and physical infrastructure for new computational frontiers. This pivot by Core Scientific makes it an ideal target for CoreWeave, which specializes in high-performance computing for AI. The synergy allows CoreWeave to rapidly expand its footprint without the lengthy and capital-intensive process of building new facilities from scratch. Unlocking Tremendous Gigawatt Capacity for AI Workloads The immediate benefit of this CoreWeave acquisition is the substantial increase in its operational capacity. Gaining access to over a gigawatt capacity is a game-changer in the fiercely competitive AI landscape. This vast energy potential will be directly applied to facilitating AI training and inference workloads, which are the backbone of developing and deploying advanced AI models. These workloads require immense parallel processing power, typically provided by thousands of GPUs. Key advantages of this expanded capacity include: Accelerated AI Development: More available compute power means AI companies can train larger, more complex models faster, reducing development cycles. Scalability for Demand: CoreWeave can better meet the surging demand from AI startups and enterprises looking for specialized cloud infrastructure. Competitive Edge: This move solidifies CoreWeave’s position as a leading provider in a market where computational resources are the new gold. Operational Efficiency: Leveraging Core Scientific’s existing, optimized data centers allows for quicker deployment and potentially lower operational costs compared to greenfield developments. The Escalating Race for Cloud Infrastructure Dominance The CoreWeave acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a significant marker in the escalating global race among cloud infrastructure providers to expand their data center footprints. The computational demands of AI companies appear seemingly endless, driving an unprecedented demand for specialized hardware and the facilities to house it. Just last week, Bloomberg reported another colossal deal: OpenAI, a key player in the generative AI space, struck an agreement with Oracle to rent an additional 4.5 gigawatts worth of data center capacity. This expansion builds upon their already massive “Stargate” infrastructure deal, illustrating the scale of investment required to power the next generation of AI. This arms race for compute capacity is redefining the technology landscape, pushing companies to acquire, build, and partner at an unprecedented pace to secure the necessary resources for AI innovation. Navigating the Future of AI Compute and Industry Consolidation This CoreWeave acquisition of Core Scientific highlights a critical trend: the forced consolidation within the data industry driven by enterprise AI. As AI models grow in complexity and size, the infrastructure required to support them becomes increasingly specialized and expensive. This naturally leads to larger players acquiring smaller, but strategically valuable, assets. What does this mean for the future of AI compute? We can anticipate: Further Consolidation: Expect more mergers and acquisitions as companies vie for control over limited data center space and energy resources. Increased Specialization: Cloud providers will continue to differentiate themselves by offering highly specialized services tailored for AI, rather than general-purpose computing. Energy Demands: The energy requirements for AI will continue to soar, putting pressure on power grids and accelerating the search for sustainable energy solutions for AI data centers . Innovation in Hardware: The intense demand will spur further innovation in GPU and other AI-specific hardware development. The strategic importance of owning and operating vast data center capacity cannot be overstated in the age of AI. CoreWeave’s move is a bold statement, positioning it as a formidable force in providing the backbone for the AI revolution. A New Era for AI Infrastructure The acquisition of Core Scientific by CoreWeave for $9 billion marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence. By securing over a gigawatt capacity , CoreWeave is not just expanding its footprint; it’s strategically investing in the very foundation of future AI development. This deal, set against the backdrop of an industry-wide race for compute power, underscores the immense value placed on data center resources capable of handling intensive AI workloads. As companies like CoreWeave and Core Scientific adapt and innovate, they are shaping the future of generative AI and the digital economy, proving that in the age of AI, compute power is indeed the ultimate currency.

2025-07-08T10:01:00,"Cardano Founder Claims He Rejected El Salvador Proposal Over Gang Links","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has alleged that he walked away from a potential deal to implement Cardano in El Salvador in 2021, citing concerns over the government’s plan to airdrop cryptocurrency directly to citizens, including members of the notorious MS-13 gang. In a recent interview on the Shawn Ryan Show, Hoskinson detailed a chaotic week of discussions with President Nayib Bukele’s administration, claiming the proposed airdrop risked violating U.S. sanctions and drawing severe backlash from Washington. Chaotic Encounters Hoskinson painted a picture of disarray within the Salvadoran government during a 2021 visit to the country. He described meetings with eccentric officials, including a Minister of Energy who declared, “The power of magma will be the destiny of El Salvador,” as plans for a geothermal-powered Bitcoin mining hub were pitched. According to the blockchain innovator, the implementation strategies for the national adoption of BTC in El Salvador lacked structure, with officials allegedly using WhatsApp and Facebook speeches from President Bukele as informal policy guides. “We asked, what are the compliance guidelines for adopting cryptocurrency here? [They said] ‘We don’t have any,’” Hoskinson reminisced. “Where are you getting your business requirements? They said Facebook.” However, the pivotal issue emerged during U.S. consultations. Hoskinson claimed discussions revealed Bukele’s intent for a universal airdrop, which he argued would funnel cryptocurrency to MS-13, designated a Transnational Criminal Organization by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). “Bukele, for example, wanted to do an airdrop to everybody in El Salvador,” Hoskinson stated. “And we’re like, okay, but MS-13 is on an OFAC list. And so if we give Bitcoin to all these people, we’re facilitating a transfer of value to a terrorist organization. That’s no bueno.” He also added that coordination with U.S. authorities proved impossible, particularly under the Biden administration, which he claimed adopted a “regime change” stance towards Bukele. “We just couldn’t get there. So, we passed on the deal after a week,” he concluded. Despite the withdrawal, El Salvador pressed forward with Bitcoin, making it legal tender and launching the government-backed Chivo wallet. Hoskinson admitted that the move was historic, with the Central American nation currently holding 6,230 BTC worth about $679 million. “It was a very pivotal moment,” He said. “It actually made Bitcoin the official currency and it forced the IMF, and it forced all the transnational bodies to actually start recognizing Bitcoin.” Market Reaction The explosive claims elicited swift skepticism, with Bitcoin advocate Cory Bates questioning the narrative’s accuracy: “I have a feeling this is not quite how the story went.” Pseudonymous analyst The Bitcoin Therapist was more blunt, calling it the “dumbest sh*t I’ve ever heard.” Neither Bukele’s administration nor U.S. officials have publicly verified Hoskinson’s account. Meanwhile, Cardano’s native ADA token is showing modest resilience. At the time of this writing, it was trading at $0.5768, up 2.0% in the last seven days to slightly outperform the broader crypto market. However, it remains down 12.5% over the last month and significantly lags its September 2021 all-time high of $3.09.

Trump’s Tariff Shock Sparks 4.5% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong start to the week, market sentiment took a sharp turn as traders adopted a more cautious tone. Early excitement around Pump.fun’s PUMP token cooled quickly after Gate.io mysteriously removed its presale announcement, which had briefly teased a $600 million target for July 12. Meanwhile, Bit Digital made waves by selling all its Bitcoin holdings and shifting its entire treasury to Ethereum, now holding over 100,000 ETH worth $254.8 million, making it one of the largest public ETH holders. But the real shock came, as the crypto market plunged 4.5% following President Trump’s unexpected tariff letters to 14 countries. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and especially Dogecoin tumbled, with the fallout spreading to crypto stocks and broader markets, triggering renewed investor anxiety. BREAKING: President Trump sends out more “tariff letters” with the following tariff rates announced today: 1. Cambodia: 36% 2. Thailand: 36% 3. Bangladesh: 35% 4. Serbia: 35% 5. Indonesia: 32% 6.

Countries like South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and South Africa were among the first to receive the notices. Trump justified the tariffs as a response to persistent trade deficits, warning of further hikes if retaliation follows. However, critics like economist Peter Schiff say these measures miss the mark entirely. According to Schiff, the issue lies more with U.S. competitiveness than unfair foreign practices. Trump's letters to Japan and South Korea demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of trade. Tariffs have nothing to do with America's trade deficits with either nation. Japan's tariffs on U.S. goods average less than 2%, and Korea's average less than 1%. Our trade deficits… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 7, 2025 While many agree with Schiff, other crypto users think that countries like South Africa and Malaysia are being targeted for aligning with BRICS and China, while pressure on Japan and South Korea aims to secure loyalty in key supply chains. Tariff 2.0 war is getting more intense. Rate Cut Hopes Fade as Uncertainty Grows Adding to the chaos, hopes for a Fed rate cut are fading. The CME FedWatch Tool shows chances of a cut by September dropping to 61.9%, down from 90% just weeks ago. Yields are rising regardless of trade war news, signaling that deficit spending is now steering the economy. With tariffs set to begin in August and the crypto market already reacting harshly, traders are bracing for more turbulence ahead. Crypto Implications Tariff deadline uncertainty has shaken investor confidence, weakening overall risk appetite, something crypto markets heavily rely on. As a result, price action remains choppy, with most altcoins already struggling to gain momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) took a dip of 1.56% below the $108K mark. After settling at $107K. Ethereum dipped slightly to $2,554, while XRP and Polygon bucked the trend with modest gains. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Solana saw deeper losses. Looking ahead, investor focus is shifting to the upcoming “Crypto Week” starting July 14, when key U.S. bills like the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act could shape the next regulatory chapter for digital assets. Stocks and Miners Join the Slide It wasn’t just crypto that felt the sting; stocks took a tumble, too.
