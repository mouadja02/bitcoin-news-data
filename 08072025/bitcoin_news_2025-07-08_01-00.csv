2025-07-07T22:52:06,"Bitcoin Crashes on Trump‚Äôs New Trade War Threat‚ÄîAugust 1 Could Be the Day Everything Breaks","Financial markets reeled on Monday as President Donald Trump reignited fears of a global trade war, triggering a ripple effect that extended into the crypto sector. Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi ‚Äî ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls ‚Äúfairer deals.‚Äù By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House‚Äôs trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,‚Äù Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz ‚Äî CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , ‚ÄúAny decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.‚Äù Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on ‚Äúthe quality of deals, not the quantity,‚Äù but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin‚Äôs trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC‚Äôs 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of ‚Äúequal lows,‚Äù an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. ‚ÄúIf buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,‚Äù one analyst warned. Still, there‚Äôs room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it‚Äôs the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump‚Äôs economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

2025-07-07T22:50:22,"TON Foundation clarifies that there is no official Golden Visa program","The foundation behind The Open Network (TON) has released a statement to clarify its role in a program that could have led to legal residency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , ‚ÄúTON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community‚Äôs interest and enthusiasm, it‚Äôs necessary to provide clarity.‚Äù According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. ‚ÄúTo clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,‚Äù the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE‚Äôs joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country‚Äôs ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: üá¶üá™ TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. ‚Äì STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS ‚Äì 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA ‚Äì SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED ‚Äì $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION üöÄ pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF ‚Äî Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE‚Äôs Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, ‚ÄúWe fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.‚Äù This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven‚Äôt always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country‚Äôs Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a ‚Äúgold card‚Äù program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with dropping volatility. Chart analysis shows it will trade sideways over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche‚Äôs C-Chain to store data on Filecoin‚Äôs decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‚Äòcrypto leaks‚Äô, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin G√ºn Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March.

2025-07-07T21:56:58,"Russia Wants to Eliminate Tax Dodgers in Bitcoin Mining: Report","According to a local newspaper, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Digital Development, and the Federal Tax Service have compiled a ‚Äúregistry‚Äù that has been sent to regions with increased mining activity. An official of the Finance Ministry, Ivan Chebeskov, stated that despite certain laws being adopted, only 30% of miners had signed the official register of the Federal Tax Service since the end of 2024. A Step Forward In Regulation Local newspaper RIA Novosti reported that the country is actively working on developing more stringent legislation to reduce the improper use of the country‚Äôs energy grid. The previously introduced framework requires individuals and businesses interested in mining to¬†register with the Federal Tax Service. Citizens can mine up to 6,000 kWh per month without entrepreneur status, but must register as such if they exceed the limit. In an interview with the paper, Petr Konyushenko, the Deputy Energy Minister, noted that this is a step in the right direction for taxation and legalization (translated in English by Google): ‚ÄúThe creation of such a register will allow for the precise identification of consumers using electricity for mining needs. This is necessary for applying special regulation and taxation to them.‚Äù Two laws were signed by Putin in late 2024, one of which outlines key terms, such as mining and pools, and imposes requirements for registration and reporting for businesses. It also prohibits foreign nationals from mining in Russia while granting the government the right to restrict mining in specific areas. The second law outlines the rules governing the circulation of digital currency and establishes regulations for mining activities .¬†Despite these legislations being signed into law, no clear regulations have been introduced, according to the chief analyst of local exchange BestChange, Nikita Zuborev: ‚ÄúThe full legalization of mining has not happened. Instead, it can be said that some norms have been established by law that simplifies control over industrial mining,‚Äù Current Regulatory Landscape In Russia Due to the conflict with Ukraine that began in early 2022, the country has been facing serious sanctions from the European Union. As a consequence, some well-known exchanges, such as Deribit, had to cease providing their services to nationals unless certain specific requirements were met. Some of these requirements include Russian citizens with dual citizenship to other EEA countries, Switzerland, or individuals who permanently reside in either of these regions. Native companies were completely exempt from using the exchange. A ban was also enforced for the winter months, restricting mining in several regions to avoid blackouts. These restrictions vary between areas controlled by Russia and Ukraine and have different timeframes, from as early as March this year to as late as March 3031. Some will remain on an annual basis as well. The Russian power company PAO Rosseti has begun exploring the hosting of mining infrastructure by utilizing the country‚Äôs idle power. Although cryptocurrency mining is deemed legal, trading of them remains illegal as of this moment. CryptoPotato has previously reported that, despite these hurdles, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is seeing notable adoption from institutions.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‚Äòs performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia‚Äôs scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price up today? TIA‚Äôs price is attempting to hold above $1.5 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA‚Äôs price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers‚Äô interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction July 2025 Celestia‚Äôs price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction July 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn‚Äôt felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

The trend of investment inflows into crypto funds has continued for the twelfth consecutive week since April. The trading volume for the reporting period was $16.3 billion, remaining roughly in line with the average weekly figure since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin-based investment products attracted $790 million in early July, which is less than the previous three weeks when inflows averaged $1.5 billion.

On average, over the past seven days, inflows amounted to 1.6% of AUM, significantly higher than Bitcoin's 0.8%.

Ogni salto non √® solo una questione di riflessi ma implica anche una scelta strategica che pu√≤ influenzare il risultato finale della partita. I giocatori devono considerare il loro progresso e l‚Äôaumento della posta in gioco ogni volta che riescono a superare un forno. Inizialmente, il gioco pu√≤ sembrare semplice, ma man mano che si avanza, le fiamme diventano pi√π aggressive e le sfide si moltiplicano.

Avere una buona strategia implica fare scelte ponderate su quando rischiare e quando giocare in modo pi√π conservativo. Analizzare il comportamento delle fiamme e adattare il proprio stile di gioco √® vitale. Un altro punto cruciale √® l‚Äôosservazione: i giocatori esperti tendono a studiare attentamente il comportamento degli avversari. Questo non solo aiuta a prevedere le mosse altrui, ma offre anche spunti su nuove strategie. Imparare a gestire la pressione e a non essere sopraffatti dalle emozioni √® fondamentale per raggiungere traguardi pi√π elevati. Pianifica ogni salto con attenzione. Non rischiare troppo, specialmente all‚Äôinizio. Osserva i movimenti degli avversari. Aggiusta la tua strategia in base al progresso. Usa il tuo istinto per valutare il rischio. Infine, √® importante adattare le proprie strategie nel tempo. Con l‚Äôevoluzione del gioco, le meccaniche possono cambiare, rendendo necessarie nuove approcci. Partecipare a forum e comunit√† online pu√≤ fornire nuove idee e strategie che possono essere applicate per migliorare le performance nel gioco. Comunit√† e Interazioni di Gioco Un aspetto molto interessante della Chicken Road √® la comunit√† di giocatori che si √® formata attorno a questo gioco. Condividere esperienze, strategia e approcci diversi arricchisce notevolmente l‚Äôesperienza. Giocare con altri permette anche di osservare nuove tecniche e di imparare da coloro che hanno pi√π esperienza. Inoltre, molte piattaforme offrono spazi di discussione dove i giocatori possono scambiarsi suggerimenti e trucchi. Questi forum diventano un luogo dove si celebra non solo il gioco, ma anche il senso di appartenenza a una comunit√† unita dalla passione per la Chicken Road. Le interazioni sociali possono migliorare l‚Äôesperienza di gioco, portando a legami pi√π forti e a migliori prestazioni individuali. Le Competenze Sociali nel Gioco Giocare alla Chicken Road non implica solo abilit√† meccaniche, ma anche competenze sociali. Il dialogo con altri giocatori pu√≤ portare a una migliore comprensione del gioco e ad un apprendimento pi√π veloce. Sostenersi a vicenda durante le sessioni di gioco √® fondamentale, creando quindi un ambiente positivo e collaborativo. Eventi e Tornei La comunit√† spesso si riunisce per eventi e tornei, dove i giocatori competono per premi e riconoscimenti. Questi eventi aumentano l‚Äôemozione del gioco e offrono un‚Äôopportunit√† per misurarsi con altri. Partecipare a un torneo pu√≤ motivare i giocatori a migliorare ulteriormente le proprie abilit√† e a scoprire nuove strategie. Esperienza Emotiva nel Gioco La Chicken Road non √® solo una questione di strategia, ma coinvolge anche un aspetto emotivo significativo. I giocatori possono sperimentare una vasta gamma di emozioni, dalla frustrazione per un fallimento a una gioia travolgente quando riescono a superare una prova difficile. Queste emozioni contribuiscono a rendere il gioco coinvolgente e avvincente. Il senso di rischio e ricompensa stimola anche l‚Äôadrenalina, creando un‚Äôesperienza di gioco soddisfacente. Ogni partita diventa un‚Äôopportunit√† per affrontare la paura e superare i propri limiti. Superare fiamme ardenti e pericoli pu√≤ fungere anche da metafora per affrontare le sfide quotidiane nella vita reale. Crescita Personale attraverso il Gioco Giocare a Chicken Road pu√≤ contribuire alla crescita personale. I giocatori che affrontano sfide e sviluppano strategie migliorano non solo le proprie abilit√† di gioco, ma anche la loro resilienza e capacit√† di problem solving nella vita reale.

Giocare insieme crea legami che si estendono oltre il gioco, rafforzando amicizie e portando a interazioni pi√π significative. La condivisione di successi e fallimenti durante le sessioni di gioco arricchisce le esperienze e crea ricordi duraturi. Conclusione In sintesi, la Chicken Road √® un gioco che offre una combinazione unica di sfide, strategia e interazione sociale.

2025-07-07T20:30:38,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut‚ÄîWhat You Need To Know","The liquidity engine that has supported risk assets, including Bitcoin, since the beginning of 2025 is now shifting into reverse. According to macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets), the six-month upswing in Federal Reserve liquidity has ended, and a potentially destabilizing wave of debt issuance by the US Treasury is about to begin. In a post published on X late Sunday, Tomas warned: ‚Äú Federal Reserve Liquidity set to fall‚Ä¶ The Fed liquidity upswing that began on January 1 2025 is now over.‚Äù Bitcoin Enters Danger Zone The catalyst behind this reversal is the recent $5 trillion debt ceiling increase passed by Congress last week. That legislative decision gives the Treasury Department the green light to aggressively rebuild its cash balance at the Federal Reserve‚Äîknown as the Treasury General Account (TGA)‚Äîwhich had been intentionally drained to inject liquidity into the system during the first half of the year. ‚ÄúThe US Government had previously been draining the Treasury General Account (liquidity injection). But a new debt ceiling agreement was reached last week ($5 trillion raise). This means the Government will start to flood the market with new debt to ‚Äòrefill‚Äô the TGA (liquidity drain),‚Äù Tomas wrote. He emphasized that the refill target is currently set at $850 billion, up from recent levels around $350 billion, implying roughly $500 billion in liquidity will be removed from the system in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‚ÄòVery Bullish‚Äô ‚Äî What This Means The implications for Bitcoin are stark. Risk assets have historically benefited from rising dollar liquidity‚Äîparticularly in the context of elevated ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and a weakening US dollar. But that backdrop is now shifting. As Tomas put it, ‚ÄúAll else being equal, this TGA rebuild process should be bullish for the US dollar.‚Äù A strengthening dollar, when coupled with falling bank reserves, is generally a bearish environment for Bitcoin. The pressure on liquidity won‚Äôt necessarily come all at once, but the mechanics are clear. Treasury will issue large volumes of new short-term debt‚Äîprimarily T-bills‚Äîto finance the TGA refill. This issuance will compete with other dollar-denominated assets for funding, draining cash out of banks and money markets. Tomas notes that this dynamic could be softened if money market funds rotate their cash out of the Fed‚Äôs Overnight Reverse Repo Facility, which still holds about $214 billion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could lower the target level, meaning less of a refill,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd expect we may see a lot of T-bill issuance, which could tempt some of the remaining $214bn left in the Reverse Repo to leave the facility (liquidity injection) and lessen any negative impact of the TGA refill.‚Äù Still, even with some reallocation from RRP, Tomas expects the overall effect to reduce reserve balances‚Äîbank reserves as a percentage of GDP are likely to fall below 10%, he estimates. While this is not as dire as the 7% level reached in 2019 (which triggered the repo crisis), it represents a sharp tightening compared to the first half of this year. ‚ÄúThere could be some funding stress around the end of September (end-of-quarter),‚Äù Tomas cautioned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap‚ÄîAnalyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Bitcoin‚Äôs performance has coincided with the exact window Tomas outlines as a liquidity upswing. As documented, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has closely tracked the direction of aggregate G5 central bank balance sheets and the level of US bank reserves. When those reserves shrink‚Äîespecially in the face of stronger Treasury issuance and a rebounding dollar‚ÄîBitcoin has historically struggled to sustain upside momentum. This concern is compounded by Tomas‚Äôs warning that speculative short positioning against the dollar has reached extremes. ‚ÄúBack in January, I was shouting about a fall in the dollar. Now everybody and their mothers are bearish on the dollar, and positioning is massively short across the board. It‚Äôs time for, at the very least, an upward correction/consolidation for the US dollar, in my opinion.‚Äù Such a reversal in the dollar would mark a critical macro headwind for Bitcoin. The 90-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin and the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains firmly negative. In environments where the dollar strengthens‚Äîespecially when driven by tightening liquidity‚ÄîBitcoin has rarely outperformed. The next several weeks will be critical. If Treasury proceeds with aggressive issuance and market participants demand higher yields, liquidity could tighten faster than anticipated. While Tomas does leave open the possibility that Secretary Bessent may adjust the TGA target downward, the baseline scenario remains a $500 billion net liquidity drain‚Äîdirectly reversing the conditions that allowed Bitcoin to surge. At press time, BTC traded at $108,148.

2025-07-07T20:30:08,"What is the Latest Situation for Bitcoin (BTC)? Where Are the Option Data Pointing?","Cryptocurrency analysis company QCP Capital published an important analysis of Bitcoin's performance and the general mood in the market last weekend in its latest evaluation report. Bitcoin held its price over the long holiday weekend before reaching a new all-time weekly close, reaching as high as $109,700 during low-volume trading on Sunday, according to the report. This rise came despite the transfer of around $8.5 billion worth of BTC by eight old Bitcoin wallets that went into action on Saturday. It was reported that $4.3 billion worth of BTC was sold in the middle of the week, and the price was around $108,000 at the time. QCP Capital said that these large-scale ‚Äúbearish‚Äù transactions were largely ignored by the market, while ‚Äúbullish‚Äù scenarios found strong buyers. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market It was stated that TON's ‚ÄúGolden Visa‚Äù rumors, which were denied by the United Arab Emirates authorities, and Elon Musk's criticism of fiat money, along with his announcement of a new political formation called ‚ÄúThe American Party‚Äù, also contributed to the rise in the market. QCP Capital also noted that large investors such as Metaplanet and Strategy continued to make strategic purchases throughout the weekend. However, due to new sell orders from these large wallets, the price could get stuck in the current range and implied volatility could drop to record lows. However, it is stated that a new increase in volatility may occur if the $ 110,000 resistance level is clearly broken. It is observed that institutional investors are showing interest in September term $ 130,000 call options and continue to maintain $ 115,000/140,000 call spread positions. According to QCP Capital, this situation points to a structurally optimistic picture for the third quarter of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T20:10:00,"ApeCoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will APE recover?","Key takeaways: Our ApeCoin price predictions anticipate a high of $1.59 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let‚Äôs explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6053 Market cap $456M Trading volume $21.02 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6177 24-hour low $0.6028 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.08% 50-day SMA $0.6589 200-day SMA $0.6789 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (July 7), APE‚Äôs price dropped by 1.08% in one week and dropped by 0.69% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.60. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs trading volume fell by 41.26% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. It started recovering last month as it rose above $0.65. The MACD histogram shows that the price is experiencing little momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show little price volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE‚Äôs bear run as it dropped below $0.65. It registered continuous bearish candles in the last 12 hours. At current levels, it registers little volatility and momentum.

APE price analysis shows the market had little momentum in the last few days. It should move sideways in the short term. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‚Äòhousehold‚Äô cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE‚Äôs utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction July 2025 The APE July price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.79, with an average of $0.69.

Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming increasingly attractive to institutions, but many still view it as too risky. In response, on June 7, global investment firm Calamos introduced its ‚Äúprotected Bitcoin‚Äù strategy , designed to limit both the downside and the upside of Bitcoin exposure. The firm noted that although Bitcoin has reached a $2 trillion valuation, institutional investors remain concerned about its volatility. As a result, most allocate just 1‚Äì2% of their portfolios to BTC to avoid outsized risk exposure. Calamos has structured its strategy to offer some upside participation while managing risk by combining Bitcoin futures with U.S. Treasuries. Specifically, the firm purchases zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds maturing at the end of the year.

Simultaneously, Calamos buys call options on the Bitcoin Index to capture potential gains. To fund these, the firm also sells out-of-the-money call options, effectively capping the upside between 25% and 60%. Calamos risk-reward tiers | Source: Calamos Each risk-return tier is benchmarked to familiar asset classes. The 100% protected Bitcoin tier mirrors the risk profile of Treasuries, offering capital preservation with virtually no downside risk. The second tier is comparable to gold or alternative assets, while the third tier aligns with equities in terms of expected returns and volatility. Calamos believes this structured approach could enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal relative to traditional assets. However, timing remains critical. Traders must hold positions to maturity to benefit from the downside protection; early exits could result in loss of principal. While rare, another risk includes potential sovereign debt default, which the firm notes is highly unlikely.

2025-07-07T19:50:31,"Bit Digital has gone all-ETH by selling all of its Bitcoin to acquire 100,603 ETH","Bit Digital has gone all-ETH after selling all of its Bitcoin. The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from BTC and acquired over 100,000 Ethereum, making it one of the largest corporate ETH treasuries. Bit Digital revealed its plans to focus solely on ETH staking last month. From a holding of 24,434 ETH as of the end of March, Bit Digital now has approximately 100,603 ETH worth approximately $254 million. Sam Tabar, Chief Executive Officer of Bit Digital said, ‚ÄúBit Digital is aligning itself with Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential and positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets. We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.‚Äù This is not a first. BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, dumped $561 million in Bitcoin holdings and reallocated the capital straight into Ethereum last month. THIS COMPANY SOLD ALL OF THEIR BTC AND BOUGHT $200M OF ETH Bit Digital just acquired $192.9M ETH after raising ~$172M from a public offering, and selling their entire holdings of BTC, worth ~$28M. Bit Digital now holds a total of $254.8 Million of ETH. pic.twitter.com/nV3P9vhZU8 ‚Äî Arkham (@arkham) July 7, 2025 The possible gains and the risks. Sam Tabar asserts that, ‚ÄúWe believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system. Ethereum‚Äôs programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.‚Äù This move might offer a model for other mining companies. They can make money with Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake method by locking up ETH to support network security. The returns are usually between 4% and 6.5% per year. This is a great option for traditional mining, which needs a lot of money. However, while Bitcoin miners can use different hedging techniques, staking Ethereum is directly exposed to changes in the price of Ethereum on the market. A big drop in the value of Ethereum could be very bad for the company‚Äôs finances, even if the staking rates are high. This method increases both the possible gains and the risks. Meanwhile, different markets initially had different reactions to Bit Digital‚Äôs news. The company‚Äôs stock price went down and hit a low point of $1.86. It then started to rise again after the company announced its strategy shift and sold 150 million shares. Ethereum has turned into a hot commodity for governments too‚Äô According to recent reports, the United States government has deposited $218k ETH to Coinbase. According to analysts, the change in price projects investors‚Äô uncertainty on whether the shift will work and if it will be financially viable in the long run. Ethereum vs Bitcoin mining Bit Digital‚Äôs move wasn‚Äôt entirely unexpected given the more challenging environment Bitcoin miners have experienced since last year‚Äôs halving. The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This reduction has led to significant declines in revenue and gross profits for miners. According to JPMorgan, average mining revenues have dropped by 46% since the halving, and gross profits have fallen by 57%. Also, BTC mining burns through electricity, and the miner must constantly upgrade hardware. On the other hand, Ethereum staking gives you steady returns with way less overhead. BTCS CEO Charles Allen states, ‚ÄúEthereum staking, by contrast, offers cleaner economics ‚Äî yield without the expensive energy costs and rapidly depreciating assets.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-07T19:30:53,"Jack Dorsey releases details of his p2p messaging app Bitchat","The co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, announced the launch of a new decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app named Bitchat. The application is currently available on Apple‚Äôs beta‚Äêtesting service TestFlight. On Sunday evening, Dorsey shared Bitchat‚Äôs whitepaper along with a TestFlight link for anyone interested in trying the app. He said his weekend project was to learn about ‚Äúbluetooth mesh networks, relays and store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things.‚Äù Bitchat works without the internet Bitchat‚Äôs whitepaper states that the application doesn‚Äôt rely on internet infrastructure. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks, which provide ephemeral, encrypted communication. This setup ensures the application stays operational even during internet blackouts or censorship. When somebody sends a message to another user, the message is end-to-end encrypted and it stays in the device memory. No data is saved on a server. Also, using the app doesn‚Äôt require a phone number or an email address. This makes Bitchat more private compared to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp that rely on Meta‚Äôs data servers. Since Bitchat relies on BLE mesh networks, each device acts as both a client and a server. Nearby devices (within 30 meters) form clusters. When a device from one cluster comes into the range of a device from another cluster, they act as a bridge, linking the two groups. This allows messages to hop from cluster to cluster until they reach their intended recipient. The whitepaper further dives into the messaging app‚Äôs architecture, protocols, and safety mechanisms. Source: Jack Dorsey via X. How does Bitchat enhance privacy? Bitchat injects dummy messages at random intervals of 30‚Äì120 seconds and it adds 50‚Äì500 milliseconds delays to real transmissions. This makes it statistically impossible for anyone to distinguish genuine messages or correlate timing with user activity. Messages do not stay in the device‚Äôs memory forever. The decentralized app saves any message for 12 hours for regular peers while the time for favorite peers is indefinite. So even if somebody gains access to a device, they can‚Äôt trawl through years of old conversations. Bitchat has no metadata leaks since there‚Äôs no centralized servers or a service provider who can see your messages or who you‚Äôre talking to. Instead, each node only examines a TTL (time-to-live) counter and a message ID. Nodes do not keep any record of who sent the message, who will get it, or when it was sent‚Äîjust enough data to know when to stop forwarding. Bitchat provides uninterruptible communication channels in situations like protests or disaster areas where the internet may be down, overloaded, or actively blocked. Besides founding Twitter and building Bitchat today, Jack Dorsey co-founded and led Block (formerly Square). He backed decentralized social protocols such as Bluesky and Nostr. In recent years Dorsey drove the development of Web5 and other decentralized applications while advocating for Bitcoin adoption.

Core Scientific shares were 18% lower, trading around $14.75 at publication time. CoreWeave stock was down 5%. While the deal offers CoreWeave strategic benefits, cutting over $10 billion in lease obligations and unlocking more than $500 million in annual cost savings by 2027, KBW views it as an opportunistic move, capitalizing on CRWV‚Äôs 295% post-IPO rally, the bank said in a report on Monday. ""While we view this as an opportunistic attempt by CRWV to capitalize on recent stock appreciation, the reaction signals disappointment and potential disagreement to the deal terms,"" wrote analyst Bill Papanastasiou. Under the terms of the agreement, Core Scientific shareholders will receive 0.1235 CoreWeave shares for each share held, valuing the business at around $9 billion. The deal requires approval from Core Scientific shareholders and is expected to close in Q4 2025. Core Scientific shareholders may push back on the terms of the deal, the analyst noted, given the unchanged asset base since CRWV‚Äôs first failed bid and lack of a cash component. The ""shareholder vote may see friction."" Still, with no competing offer expected, the deal is likely to proceed, the report said. KBW has an ""outperform"" rating on Core Scientific shares with a $19 price target. Rival Wall Street firm Bernstein noted the drop in the Core Scientific share price after the deal was announced and said ""shareholders were probably expecting a higher valuation,"" and ""investors were disappointed with an all stock deal.""

2025-07-07T19:00:41,"Ethereum Range Tightens ‚Äì Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350","Ethereum is approaching a pivotal moment as it pushes to reclaim the $2,600 level, aiming to break free from weeks of sideways action. After trading within a tight range since early May, ETH is now testing the upper boundary of its consolidation zone, a move that could mark the start of a new bullish phase for the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low ‚Äì Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Market participants are closely watching this level, as a successful breakout above $2,600 would likely attract momentum buyers and confirm renewed strength across the altcoin sector. However, the breakout is far from guaranteed. If bulls fail to sustain this move, Ethereum could face renewed selling pressure, with price potentially revisiting lower support zones. According to Coinglass data, liquidity clusters are clearly defined at $2,800 and $2,350. These levels will likely act as magnets in the coming days, depending on how Ethereum responds to current resistance. A clean break toward $2,800 would confirm bullish intent and broader altcoin surges, while a rejection could reinforce bearish sentiment. Ethereum‚Äôs Next Move Could Ignite Altseason Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but bullish momentum is quietly building. Ethereum, the leader of the altcoin market, has been consolidating in a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. This prolonged sideways action has kept much of the altcoin sector in a state of indecision. Now, traders and analysts agree: Ethereum must break out to lead the next major move. Market analyst Ted Pillows identifies two key liquidity levels for ETH: $2,800 on the upside and $2,350 on the downside. These zones represent the most likely destinations for price in the short term, depending on which side of the range breaks first. If Ethereum pushes above $2,800 with strength, it would likely trigger renewed risk appetite and a broad-based altcoin rally. On the other hand, a breakdown below $2,350 could lead to deeper corrections across the board. So far, bulls have defended the $2,500 level well, and growing open interest suggests that investors are positioning for an expansion. A decisive breakout in either direction will resolve weeks of consolidation and determine the short-term trend. Until then, Ethereum remains the gatekeeper of altcoin momentum‚Äîits next move could define the path for the entire market. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low ‚Äì Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Resistance Amid Range-Bound Structure Ethereum is currently trading at $2,563, hovering just below the $2,600 mark, a level that has acted as short-term resistance throughout June and early July. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has been trapped in a horizontal consolidation structure between $2,400 and $2,700, with multiple failed attempts to break either side convincingly. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs), which is a positive signal for bulls. The 100 SMA at $2,532 and the 200 SMA at $2,206 have offered strong dynamic support during recent pullbacks, reinforcing the current uptrend structure. Volume remains moderate, suggesting that market participants are waiting for a clear breakout before entering with conviction. A decisive close above $2,600 would open the door for a move toward $2,800, where large liquidity clusters have been identified by Coinglass. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook However, failure to maintain this short-term momentum could push ETH back toward the $2,400 support zone.

In a report seen by Bloomberg , analysts, including George Cole, say that they‚Äôre lowering their end-of-year targets for yields and are revising their expectations for Fed cuts in 2025.

Meanwhile, Goldman‚Äôs economists originally believed that the Fed would only achieve one rate cut near the end of the year, but are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. Even though strong labor numbers challenged the analysts‚Äô forecast, the Goldman analysts are standing firm on their call, noting that the strong data was distorted by the outsized figure of government hiring and a decline in the labor participation rate. ‚ÄúA benign path to lower short-term rates can dilute a potential source of additional fiscal risk premia and improve the economic appeal [of owning Treasuries.] We see scope for deeper cuts to support lower yields than previously envisioned.‚Äù The Financial Times reports that $11 billion in long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt have been dumped in just three months.
