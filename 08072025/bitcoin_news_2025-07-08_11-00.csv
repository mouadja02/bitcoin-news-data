2025-07-08T08:51:16,"Mexican hotel chain Murano adopts Bitcoin treasury and considers accepting BTC payments","Nasdaq-listed hotel franchise Murano decides to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, joining a global trend of companies inching towards BTC. The company is also considering accepting payments in BTC. According to a recent press release , the Mexican real estate and hotel chain has already made a starting purchase of 21 BTC prior to the announcement being made. At press time, the company’s BTC ( BTC ) holdings is worth $2.27 million. In order to carry out this new strategy, the firm plans to execute a standby equity purchase agreement of up to $500 million with Yorkville. Most of the funds raised from the sale of shares will be used primarily to stock up on BTC for its treasury. The company also claimed to be reviewing and exploring operational initiatives, including accepting BTC payments and the deployment of BTC reward programs in the future, especially with regards to its hotel operations. In addition, the Nasdaq -listed firm also plans to pursue sale and leaseback transactions to “unlock” the funds necessary for a long-term goal of Bitcoin accumulation. It claimed that it will not abandon its real estate and hotel management strategy, instead it will run both alongside its BTC strategy. Murano’s business model is similar to that of Metaplanet, Asia’s largest corporate BTC holder. Metaplanet started off as a Tokyo-based hotel management firm but is now mostly known for its Bitcoin-focused operations. In fact, Metaplanet still owns and runs a hotel in Tokyo that it plans to reopen under the name “The Bitcoin Hotel.” According to the company’s “ manifesto “, the hotel will be open to the public by the first quarter of 2026.

One of the real estate development projects mentioned include residential condominiums planned for the next phase of then firm’s ongoing Grand Island Cancun project. Chairman and CEO of Murano, Elias Sacal, said that the new Bitcoin treasury strategy will complement the firm’s core business model built upon the real estate and hospitality sectors. He hopes that the adoption of BTC investments would serve to enhance the value of the company’s holdings. “We see Bitcoin as a transformative asset that not only offers long-term growth potential but also strengthens our balance sheet against inflation and systemic risk,” said Sacal. Earlier this month, Murano joined an alliance of companies led by BTC Inc & Michael Saylor’s Strategy dubbed “Bitcoin for Corporations.” The aim of the alliance is to drive corporate adoption of Bitcoin among its members, led by the largest corporate BTC holder in the world.

2025-07-08T08:48:38,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bid-Ask Spread Tightens-Here What it Means for the BTC Price Rally","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bid-Ask Spread Tightens-Here What it Means for the BTC Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price has surged significantly throughout the past week and closed the weekly trade on a bullish note. Moreover, the levels marked the local highs above $110,500, which flashed the possibility of marking a new ATH above $112,000. Unfortunately, the bulls experienced exhaustion, causing the token to drop back below $108,000. With the second attempt failing, market participants now seem uncertain about the next price move as they wait for the price to break above the range before jumping in. Bid-Ask Spread Tightens The current price movement of Bitcoin may seem sluggish, but from a broader perspective, the bulls and bears appear to be reaching an agreement. The bid-ask spread is compressing, meaning there is not much gap left between them, hinting towards a potential trade to occur anytime from now. The data from Coinglass shows that the ‘bids,’ or the highest prices buyers are willing to pay, are around $106,300 to $105,550, while the ‘ask,’ or the lowest price the sellers are willing to accept, is around $108,400. The difference between the bid & the ask is called the bid-ask spread, and if the spread is small, it indicates higher liquidity (easy to buy or sell). It also indicates the demand for the token is rising, which is a bullish signal for the token. Alongside this, the balance on the CEX exchanges is also marking new lows every day, hinting towards strong optimism among the traders. What’s the BTC Price Game Plan for the Week? The Bitcoin price went up during the weekend and created a significant CME gap between $105,745 and $106,660. However, the current pullback has closed the gap, signalling massive bullish signals for the token. On the other hand, the current rejection raises some concerns but eventually, the BTC price is primed to mark new highs in the coming days. As seen in the above chart, the price broke above the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone. Meanwhile, the CMF continues to consolidate above 0, suggesting a decent money inflow onto the platform. On the other hand, the on-balance volume, the volume indicator, has been consistently rising, suggesting a constant rise in the buying activity. This, with a rising price trend, may offer a strong bullish case, and hence the BTC price is now believed to mark new highs anytime from now.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-bid-ask-spread-tightens-here-what-it-means-for-the-btc-price-rally/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T08:11:16,"“Crypto Week” agenda revealed and top bills to watch","The cryptocurrency market may be on the cusp of a major rally as US politicians prepare for the upcoming crypto week, which will be the first one of its kind. If successful, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could jump as the market embraces regulatory clarity in the industry. Top bills to be considered during the crypto week The US House of Representatives and the Senate will consider three key bills that could have a major impact on the crypto industry. First, there is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, also known as the GENIUS ACT . This bill has already passed in the Senate and is scheduled for deliberation in the House. It has gained significant popularity by focusing on the growing stablecoin industry, which is currently valued at over $250 billion. The bill sets the parameters to ensure the safety of customer funds. For example, it ensures that all funds in these stablecoins are backed by liquid assets like the US dollar and short-term treasury bills. It also maintains monthly reserve disclosures and annual audits. Additional provisions include allowing state supervision of certain tokens, while companies are required to ensure compliance with AML laws. The bill will have some winners and losers when passed. The biggest loser will be Tether, a company that is working on establishing its headquarters in El Salvador. As things stands, Tether does not meet all the conditions in the GENIUS Act since its reserves are in a combination of assets like the US dollar and other assets like gold. Tether has hinted that it will create a new regulated stablecoin focused on the US market. The top beneficiaries for the stablecoin are PayPal and Ripple, which launched regulated stablecoins like PYUSD and RLUSD. Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY) The CLARITY Act is another major bill that will be in the spotlight during the crypto week . This bill seeks to address one of the biggest issues in the industry in the past few years: jurisdiction. It specifically makes it clear who should regulate the crypto industry between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposal is that most crypto exchanges should register with the CFTC. It also establishes rules for disclosure, recordkeeping, and customer asset segregation. This bill has already passed in the House Financial Services and Agricultural Committees. It now needs to pass in the House of Representatives and in th Senate. Democrats have criticized the bill because of Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. Anti-CBC Surveillance State Act The other notable bill to be considered is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, which prohibits the Fed from testing, developing, creating, and issuing a central bank digital currency. It also prevents the bank from offering financial services to individuals itself. Republicans and some Democrats argue that CBCs will promote surveillance by the state. They also argue that the party in power may use CBDCs to spy on the opposition. This bill has passed the House Financial Services Committee and is yet to get the full floor vote. Remember the Infrastructure Week? The main risk with the upcoming Crypto Week is that it may turned into another “Infrastructure Week”, which happened in Trump’s first term. Trump aimed to use the infrastructure weeks to pass his $1 trillion agenda, which failed. It became synonymous with unfulfile promises in that administration. As such, there is a risk that some of these crypto bills will not pass in the House and the Senate.

2025-07-08T08:10:12,"Metaplanet Tops Tokyo Standard Market With $12.87B in June Trading Volume","Japanese Bitcoin investment giant Metaplanet, which has been continuously increasing its BTC holdings, has seen a significant rise in stock trading volume in June. According to Reuters , Metaplanet’s trading volume rose to 1.86 trillion yen ($12.87 billion) in June. Tokyo Stock Exchange data shows that the numbers are nearly double the 997.6 billion yen ($6.82 billion) in May. The firm’s June trading volume surpassed that of Toyota Motor and Sony Group on the prime market, while the top spot was taken by Advantest. Further, the company has been maintaining its top position since November last year, the report added. The hotelier-turned Bitcoin acquisition company is currently the world’s fifth-largest corporate buyer of Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s Tokyo-listed shares have surged more than 345% this year, after it made a “strategic pivot” to become a Bitcoin treasury firm in 2024. ロイター報道：メタプラネット、6月の売買代金は1.86兆円でスタンダード市場首位。トヨタやソニーなどプライム市場の大型株を上回る取引規模に。 pic.twitter.com/Bv12J2BbuY — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) July 8, 2025 Japanese Bond Market Chaos: Investors Turn to Metaplanet Due to Transparency Per Metaplanet’s website , the company now holds 15,555 Bitcoin worth $1.69 billion at press time. With Japan’s 30-year government bond prices dropping 45% since 2019, investors are increasingly looking into Metaplanet as a Bitcoin proxy, due to the instability in fixed-income markets. Analysts noted that despite the rally, the company’s market net asset value (mNAV) is reasonable and has room to grow. Additionally, Metaplanet has been transparent in providing Proof of Reserves for its Bitcoin holdings, unlike its peers. The company CEO, Simon Gerovich, has publicly released on-chain verification of the company’s BTC assets. This comes in contrast with the largest BTC corporate holder, Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, who recently called on-chain proof-of-reserves a “bad idea” that could pose security threats. On Monday, Metaplanet announced a 2,205 Bitcoin acquisition , the latest purchase in its aggressive accumulation strategy. Since early 2025, the company has expanded its Bitcoin holdings from just 4,000 BTC in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, a fourfold increase in its position in just four months. Crypto Community Raise Concerns Over Corporate BTC Treasury Strategy However, there is skepticism among the community around the sustainability of the growing Bitcoin treasury trend. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, noted that BTC holding firms may have shaky ground , as rising threats might erode shareholder value. VanEck exec @matthew_sigel warns Bitcoin treasury strategies could backfire, as firms nearing NAV risk eroding shareholder value through continued BTC accumulation. #VanEck #BitcoinTreasury https://t.co/jEINL4NuxY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 Besides, Glassnode lead analyst James Check, raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy.

2025-07-08T08:01:58,"ChatGPT Will Place Ethereum (ETH) at $18,500 and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) at $3 if Bitcoin (BTC) Soars to $300,000: How possible is this?","In a new projection shaking up digital asset discussions, ChatGPT has outlined a scenario where Ethereum (ETH) reaches $18,500 and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) hits $3—if Bitcoin (BTC) rises to $300,000. This forecast ties together market momentum, investor psychology, and broader adoption patterns within the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market, speculation grows regarding its long-term price potential. One prediction suggests that a major Bitcoin rally could ignite large-cap and meme-based altcoins alike. Ethereum's Potential at $18,500: Market Factors and Network Strength Ethereum remains one of the most widely adopted innovative contract platforms. Its position as the leading Layer 1 network for decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi supports ongoing demand for ETH. If Bitcoin were to climb to $300,000, market analysts expect Ethereum to follow closely due to historical correlations and investor rotations from Bitcoin profits into altcoins. Ethereum’s ecosystem strength lies in its network effect. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supports a broad range of applications across finance, gaming, and social platforms. Upgrades like the Merge and ongoing scalability improvements through Layer 2 solutions continue to enhance its efficiency. If institutional investment increases alongside a Bitcoin surge, ETH could benefit from capital inflows and renewed developer interest. Little Pepe's $3 Projection: Meme Utility Meets Layer 2 Technology The forecast also placed the meme-inspired token, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), at $3, presenting a dramatic rise from its current presale value of $0.0013. Little Pepe distinguishes itself from other meme coins by building on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network that prioritizes speed and low fees. Its $LILPEPE token functions as a utility asset, supporting staking, transaction fees, and ecosystem activity. For LILPEPE to reach $3, several market conditions must align. One critical factor would be a surge in user adoption fueled by community growth, influencer promotion, and viral interest across social media. Moreover, if Layer 2 usage expands in applications like gaming and microtransactions, demand for efficient platforms like Little Pepe could rise substantially. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $3.41 million by selling over 2.93 billion tokens, signaling strong investor confidence. Stage 1 launched on June 10 at a price of $0.001 per token and saw 500 million tokens sold, raising $500,000 within just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed with tokens priced at $0.0011, selling 1.167 billion tokens and raising $1.325 million ahead of schedule. The momentum carried into Stage 3, where tokens were offered at $0.0012—over 2 billion tokens were sold, bringing total funds raised to more than $2.5 million. Now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, Little Pepe is closing in on its $4.475 million presale hard cap. The meme coin also allows purchases through Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and card payments. This accessibility, along with its focus on zero taxes and high transaction speeds, adds to its appeal as a scalable and user-friendly alternative in the meme coin space. Conditions Required for a $300,000 Bitcoin and Its Impact on Altcoins The prediction centers on Bitcoin reaching $300,000, a level far above its current price. To get such a target, global macroeconomic conditions would need to favor risk assets. This scenario may include lower interest rates, increased inflation hedging, or rising institutional investment in digital assets. Capital inflows could also be achieved by spot Bitcoin ETFs, growth in corporate holdings, and the embrace of sovereign funds. In the past, altcoins followed the rise of Bitcoin when Bitcoin was experiencing a rally. This trend is referred to as altcoin season, with retail and institutional investors spreading investments across the board and generally gaining huge appreciation in the prices of smaller investments. In this regard, Ethereum and LILPEPE can also gain more attention, particularly if their utility and ecosystems are extended further. The movement of Bitcoin is usually a signal in the market. If the $300,000 target comes true, the total sum of all the crypto market caps would be higher than $10 trillion. In this environment, Ethereum can gain a larger share of this market, and well-utilized meme coins such as LILPEPE can do better because of speculative and viral marketing. Conclusion Ethereum's speculations at 18500 and Little Pepe's at three are based on the most optimistic view of Bitcoin. Although a hypothetical situation, it shows the level of interconnectedness that cryptocurrency markets find themselves in. When Bitcoin goes to new highs, Ethereum and tokens based on memes that have actual use might gain tremendously. Investors and analysts will still pay attention to the events occurring in macroeconomics, technological innovation (in blockchain), and regulatory policy to determine how probable a future it may be.

This marks the first time since late March that the largest corporate holder of BTC has not added to its impressive treasury, which currently stands at 597,325 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $64.71 billion. Strategy Bitcoin Investment Hits A Pause The lack of activity in Bitcoin acquisitions is surprising, especially given Strategy’s aggressive purchases over the past few months. These purchases have brought the company close to holding nearly 3% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. From April 7 through June 29, the company invested $6.77 billion in acquiring 69,140 BTC, averaging about $97,906 per coin. At current market prices, these investments have appreciated by 10.4%, now worth around $7.49 billion. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 In terms of trading, Strategy’s stock (trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR) saw a slight decline of 0.7% during morning trading hours, which is in line with the 0.8% drop in Bitcoin prices. As of this writing, MSTR closed the day at $395. This highlights the close relationship between the company’s performance and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the company’s stock has enjoyed a rise of 38.5% in 2025, outpacing BTC’s 16.1% increase and the S&P 500’s modest gain of 6.1%. Up To $4.2 Billion For Future BTC Investments In addition to this pause in BTC purchases, Strategy did not issue any new common or preferred shares during the specified week. However, the company announced a sales agreement to potentially issue and sell up to $4.2 billion in 10% preferred stock. According to Monday’s press release on the matter by the Bitcoin proxy firm, the proceeds from this sales agreement are earmarked for general corporate purposes, which include future BTC acquisitions and working capital needs.

Here’s The Target The new preferred stock, known as Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, will be sold in a “disciplined manner,” taking market conditions into account, highlighting the firm’s ongoing commitment to leveraging its financial strategies to enhance its BTC holdings, even as it temporarily steps back from direct purchases. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,855, marking a 1.5% decline within the last 24 hours, increasing the gap between the current price and its record by 3.5%. This follows a failed attempt last week to overcome the cryptocurrency’s most significant resistance level of $110,000 and establish a new all-time high above its current record of $111,800.

A post shared by Mr. Rhodesian on X falsely indicated that a private equity fund being established by CapSign holds 4.7 million Ripple shares held by Liquidishares. Statement Clarity: Ripple And Linqto In June, it was reported that the investment company, Linqto, was heading toward bankruptcy. The reports gained more credibility after Mr. Rosendin encouraged false information that his company, CapSign, holds $4.7 million of Ripple, further boosting the false idea of Linqto’s bankruptcy. Linqto denied the false statement shared by Mr. Rosendin by saying , “Contrary to published reports on X, Linqto confirms that Liquidshares’ holdings of Ripple shares remain unchanged.” Ripple Stepped in to Confirm Linqto Shares Due to the growing speculations of Linqto’s bankruptcy reports, users feared their Ripple shares, bought through Linqto, might be at risk. To clear the rising doubts, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified the confusion of Ripple’s connection to the Linqto. He stated– “What we know from our records is Linqto owns 4.7M shares of Ripple, solely purchased on the secondary market from other Ripple shareholders (never directly from Ripple).” Garlinghouse also said that, besides being a shareholder, Ripple has no connection with Linqto , and the trading between them was stopped in 2024 amid growing concerns. [post_titles_links postid=”479807″] Linqto Confirms the Security of Shares Linqto explained that the firm has incorporated a new management team to ensure the investments in the private held companies are secured. It also disclosed that Linqto retained an independent third-party analyst firm to review the internal analysis and check for any risks. Linqto has prioritized cooperating with regulators for the ongoing investigations regarding compliance violations. The company’s transactions will remain suspended until further notice from the officials is issued. Final Thought Currently, Linqto is under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and and US Department of Justice (DOJ) for its misleading sales practices. Until the legal clarity is confirmed with Linqto, Ripple is keeping its distance from the troubled firm.

Linqto, a private equity investment platform, is facing significant issues including a federal investigation by the SEC and DOJ for alleged “pervasive securities-law violations,” misleading sales practices, and potentially selling customer stock without authorization. Their operations are currently suspended, and customer accounts have been frozen since February 2025. The company is exploring restructuring, and there are concerns about potential bankruptcy. Is Linqto facing bankruptcy, and are investors’ Ripple shares at risk? Linqto has been subject to bankruptcy rumors, exacerbated by false information. While Linqto has stated its shares are secure and a new management team is in place, the firm’s transactions remain suspended.

Trump’s Big Promise Faces Harsh Reality appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News During the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Donald Trump, then-Republican presidential candidate, electrified the crypto crowd with a bold vision: “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA. If Bitcoin is going to the moon, I want America to be the nation that leads the way. It will be the policy of my administration to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires.” Fast forward a few months— Trump defeats Kamala Harris and steps into the White House. The Bitcoin community awaits what was touted as a game-changing policy: the launch of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . But has that promise vanished into thin air? Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Is “No More,” Says Prominent Bitcoiner Well-known Bitcoin advocate Justin Bechler declared that the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is nothing more than a “fantasy.” Bechler criticized the Trump administration for repeatedly failing to follow through on promises, pointing to: No release of the Epstein list No Fort Knox gold audit No major change in Ukraine policy No mass deportations No accountability for intelligence agencies No reversal of key COVID-era policies According to him, expecting the government to suddenly embrace Bitcoin wholeheartedly is unrealistic. [post_titles_links postid=”479828″] Will the U.S. Abandon the Dollar for Bitcoin? Bechler argues that Bitcoin threatens the very core of government control. The U.S. dollar isn’t just currency—it’s a tool of influence: It funds operations Manages debt Keeps allies financially dependent Controls internal stability Bitcoin, on the other hand, is decentralized, transparent, uncensorable, and cannot be printed or frozen, making it the opposite of what centralized governments want. “To replace the dollar with Bitcoin is to dismantle the U.S. government’s engine of control,” Bechler claims. Can the U.S. Even Manage a Bitcoin Reserve? Referencing a Treasury Department report, Bechler points out that the IRS has already mishandled seized Bitcoin in previous years. He questions whether the federal government is even competent enough to manage a trillion-dollar digital reserve. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Political Theater or Real Plan? In Bechler’s eyes, those who still push for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve are either politicians chasing headlines or, worse, “bad actors” misleading the public. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What is the purpose of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’s policy is to keep 100% of all Bitcoin the U.S. government holds or acquires. It aims to maximize Bitcoin’s strategic position as a unique store of value, enhancing financial resilience and positioning the U.S. as a leader in digital asset adoption. Could the U.S. dollar be replaced by Bitcoin as a national currency? Some argue that Bitcoin’s uncensorable, transparent, and unprintable nature directly opposes government control mechanisms that the U.S. dollar provides (funding operations, managing debt). Justin Bechler claims replacing the dollar with Bitcoin would “dismantle the U.S. government’s engine of control,” making it highly unlikely for the dollar to be fully replaced. What is the Trump administration’s broader stance on crypto beyond the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? The Trump administration, since January 2025, has issued executive orders supporting the responsible growth of digital assets and blockchain technology, positioning the U.S. as a crypto leader. Policies aim to provide regulatory clarity and have seen reduced SEC enforcement actions in some areas, with further policy papers expected by July 22, 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-dead-trumps-big-promise-faces-harsh-reality/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare

With its real-world utility, rising ETF inflows, and growing role in tokenized finance. Major institutions are shifting from Bitcoin to Ethereum . Bit Digital Goes All-In on ETH Recently, Bit Digital made a bold move by shifting its entire corporate strategy from Bitcoin to Ethereum. After a $172 million equity raise, the company has now accumulated over 100,000 ETH , making it one of the largest Ethereum-holding corporations globally. Bit Digital CEO said in an interview with CNBC that “Ethereum is the next wave.” With real economic activity, a massive developer base, and growing stablecoin and tokenization volume, he sees ETH as a new kind of strategic asset that captures value. Ethereum Takes the Center Stage at Cannes Ethereum also took the spotlight in Cannes as the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) turned the famous film venue into a hub for crypto leaders and builders. The event showcased how Ethereum is becoming the backbone of modern finance. Recently, Robinhood also made headlines by launching tokenized U.S. stocks on Ethereum’s Arbitrum network for European users. This news pushed its stock above $100 for the first time, which shows rising support for Ethereum from major players. Besides, Local governments are also exploring blockchain adoption. Trad-Fi Giants Choosing Ethereum Deutsche Bank is building a tokenization platform on zkSync, an Ethereum Layer 2, to help asset managers issue tokenized funds, stablecoins, and real-world assets. Coinbase and Kraken are gearing up to offer tokenized stock trading. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is already live on Ethereum, offering real-time yields. Even with newer blockchains boasting speed and low fees, Ethereum remains the backbone of tokenized finance. Around 65% of USDC transactions still run on Ethereum, and it holds nearly half the stablecoin market, according to CoinGecko. Vitalik Buterin noted that institutions value Ethereum not for speed, but for reliability, privacy, and long-term trust. Ethereum is up nearly 3% this week, and several Ethereum-linked stocks also surged alongside it. BitMine Immersion jumped over 1,200% after switching its treasury to ETH. Bit Digital, now focused on Ethereum staking, also rose over 34% last week. SharpLink Gaming recently added $20 million in ETH and climbed 28% in a day. Corporate ETH grab is going parabolic: • SharpLink (SBET) now holds 188,478 ETH ($490mn) • Bit Digital (BTBT) just flipped to 100,603 ETH ($260mn) • Tom Lee’s BitMine ready to buy ~100,000 ETH ($250mn) Total 388,000 ETH vs. only 70,000 ETH minted this month. — Eric Conner (@econoar) July 7, 2025 Eric Conner shared recently that corporate demand for Ethereum is exploding. Major firms are rapidly accumulating ETH, with nearly 388,000 ETH scooped up by SharpLink, Bit Digital, and BitMine combined. With only 70,000 ETH minted this month, demand is far outpacing supply. [post_titles_links postid=”479809″] Institutional Interest Grows With ETF Inflows ETH ETFs are also seeing steady inflows. Data from Coinglass shows that ETH-focused funds have seen two straight months of net inflows. But ETH ETFs remain small at $11B, a fraction of Bitcoin’s $138B. The gap is big, but the momentum is shifting. Data from Glassnode shows that Ethereum spot ETFs have seen positive flows for 8 straight weeks, with over 61,000 ETH added, which shows steady investor demand. Although its price has stayed relatively flat and is facing more competition from faster chains like Solana, big players are still choosing ETH because of its real-world use. Breakout For Ethereum? ETH peaked in 2017 and 2021. Analysts believe that it is showing the same breakout pattern in 2025. The structure looks strong, with a parabolic upside potentially on the way. Analyst Carl Moon says that Ethereum needs to break above $2,700 soon or it could risk a sharp drop from a rising wedge pattern. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,553, down 0.8% in the last 24 hours.

Despite bullish MACD signals earlier this week, BTC failed to hold above the critical $108,500 pivot point. However, on the brighter side, the institutional sentiment remains strong. Japanese investment giant Metaplanet acquired an additional 2,205 BTC for $239 million yesterday, taking its total holdings to 15,555 BTC. Curious where Bitcoin price is heading in the near future? Then this price analysis is a must-read for you. OnChain Suggests Short-Term Sell Pressure? The Exchange Flow Balance chart from Santiment , shows a recent positive net inflow of 217 BTC. This marks a shift from the previous outflows observed in late June. This change suggests that more Bitcoin is moving onto exchanges, typically a bearish signal as it may indicate an intent to sell. The uptick in inflows aligns with Bitcoin’s price rejection near the $108,500 resistance, justifying near-term caution among traders amid mounting regulatory uncertainty. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis As of press time, Bitcoin is being sold at $108,071.64, with a 0.93% price loss over the previous day. The market cap has also fallen to $2.14 trillion, while the intraday business volume surged 18.57% to $44.24 billion, signaling heightened trader activity around key levels. On the 4-hour chart, the price is currently testing the midline of the Bollinger Bands, with resistance at $110,046 and support near $106,890, forming a squeeze pattern. This suggests a potential breakout, but the direction remains uncertain. The RSI is hovering at 47.97, below the neutral 50 level, hinting at dwindling momentum. It is worth noting that, despite bullish efforts, the failure to close above the 20-SMA at $108,428 and the upper Bollinger Band points to strong overhead resistance. If bulls reclaim $109,200, a test of $110,000 is likely. On the downside, a loss of the $107,600 level could lead to a retest of $106,890.

According to a new AP report, the cyberattack targeted Brazil’s popular instant payment system, known as PIX, to steal the massive nine-figure sum. Hackers were able to pull off the scheme by infiltrating the C&M system, the software company that facilitates connections between financial institutions and the central bank to enable PIX payment transactions. Police say the hackers used security credentials they allegedly purchased from C&M employee João Roque, who they just arrested. Roque allegedly told investigators he was recruited by the hackers last year and sold them his credentials. The AP was unable to reach Roque’s attorneys for comment. After gaining access to the C&M system, the hackers initiated fake PIX operations, making off with $100 million in a single night from financial institutions that are plugged into the C&M network. Police say they are attempting to identify the hackers and that at least four other people participated in the crime. Authorities are also attempting to freeze the suspected stolen assets, and say they have blocked about half the stolen funds connected to the scheme. In a statement published by local media, C&M says that it is cooperating with authorities and that the breach was likely due to unauthorized access to security credentials, not system flaws.

He explained that “given how price barely Weekly Closed above the final Weekly resistance, it offers very little chance for price to cleanly retest this level into support; that is, this retest is likely going to be a volatile one.” Nonetheless, the analyst noted that the cryptocurrency has significant High Timeframe (HTF) support beneath it that “should act as a demand area to springboard price into Price Discovery Uptrend 2 over time.” Notably, Bitcoin reclaimed and held the high zone of its re-accumulation range, around the $104,400 mark, as support over the past two weeks. Meanwhile, June Monthly Closed above the $102,464 level and retested it post-breakout “to enable this current July upside candle,” setting it as a monthly support. Additionally, the $107,244 level also emerged as a crucial area after last month’s close, driving BTC “back to its retesting phase.” BTC To Breakout After The Summer? Rekt Capital considers BTC’s current phase as “the calm before the storm,” adding that “for as long as the post-breakout retest will continue, Bitcoin will continue to be positioned for its second Price Discovery Uptrend.” However, he pointed out that it is currently locked between $104,400 and $111,000 levels so far this month. Daan Crypto Trader warned investors that the upcoming days could be crucial for BTC’s price action this month. He highlighted that Bitcoin has tended to set its monthly high or low within the first 12 days over 80% of the time, before price trends around 20% in the opposite direction. Remarkably, June was an exception after Bitcoin remained relatively stable with only small moves in each direction. Now, the analyst thinks it’s time to be “on the lookout again for any big move up or down within the first 12 days” to potentially determine BTC’s trend for the rest of the month. “For now, there has been little action in July yet,” Daan stated, but added that “technically, we’re still looking perfectly” around the current levels. He asserted that, with the slower pace during the summer, BTC could remain within its current range until a real move up begins at the end of Q3 and start of Q4.

2025-07-08T06:41:06,"Bit Digital dumps 280 Bitcoin, amasses over 100K ETH in Ethereum treasury pivot","Bit Digital has officially pivoted to a fully Ethereum-based treasury strategy, dumping its remaining Bitcoin holdings in favor of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. According to a press release on July 7, the Nasdaq-listed company has sold about 280 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and now has about 100,603 Ethereum ( ETH ), making it one of the biggest institutional Ethereum holders in the world. The strategic pivot follows Bit Digital’s $172 million public offering in June, the proceeds of which were used exclusively to purchase Ethereum. The company already held 24,434 ETH as of March 31, 2025. With its recent acquisitions, it has now quadrupled its ETH reserves. Chief executive officer Sam Tabar framed the move as a long-term bet on Ethereum’s ability to reshape finance. “Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets,” Tabar said. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” You might also like: SharpLink Gaming aims to raise $1b from share sale to boost Ethereum Treasury This shift comes as Bit Digital exits its legacy Bitcoin mining business. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model, in contrast to mining, enables businesses to generate yield by staking tokens without the continuous expenses and selling pressure that come with mining. Bit Digital began building its Ethereum staking infrastructure in 2022. Today, it runs one of the biggest validator networks in the market, complete with institutional-grade custody and active governance involvement. With over $300 million in ETH and plans to scale further, Bit Digital is staking its future, and balance sheet, on Ethereum. The company’s move comes amid a wider institutional shift toward Ethereum as a treasury asset. Ethereum-centric treasury strategies have also been established by other publicly traded companies, such as BioNexus Gene Lab and SharpLink. Together, they form part of the Strategic ETH Reserve, a consortium that keeps track of more than 1.2 million ETH held in corporate treasuries. Although Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency treasury asset in the world, Ethereum is catching up because of its use in decentralized finance, its deflationary design, and its staking rewards, which usually range from 3 to 5% per year.

2025-07-08T06:40:39,"Bitcoin Unstoppable: Is $120K the Next Frontier for Its Price?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Unstoppable: Is $120K the Next Frontier for Its Price? Are you feeling the palpable shift in the air? After months of anticipation, the cryptocurrency market is buzzing with renewed vigor, and at its heart, Bitcoin price is leading the charge. Surging confidently past the $107,000 mark, the world’s leading digital asset isn’t just holding its ground; it’s signaling a powerful comeback that has many analysts eyeing unprecedented heights. The whispers of bearish sentiment that once echoed through trading floors are fading, replaced by a growing chorus of optimism. But what exactly is fueling this dramatic turnaround, and could Bitcoin truly be on the verge of reaching the ambitious $120,000 milestone? Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment : Why Are Bears Retreating? The shift in crypto market sentiment is perhaps the most compelling story unfolding right now. For weeks, a cautious, if not outright bearish, outlook dominated discussions. Traders were quick to bet against upward movements, hedging their portfolios with downside protection. However, recent data paints a drastically different picture, indicating a significant unwinding of these bearish positions. It’s a clear signal that confidence is returning, and fast. Key Indicators of Shifting Sentiment: Reduced Demand for Downside Protection: One of the most telling signs is the notable decrease in demand for put options, which are contracts that give investors the right to sell an asset at a specific price, effectively protecting against price drops. When demand for these declines, it suggests traders are less concerned about a significant price correction. Rebounding Futures Premiums: Futures contracts, agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date, are another crucial barometer. When futures trade at a premium to the spot price, it indicates bullish expectations for the future. The recent rebound in these premiums points to a growing belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to appreciate. Decreased Short Interest: Many trading platforms report a decrease in ‘short’ positions, where traders bet on a price decline. As these positions are closed, it often adds buying pressure, further propelling the price upwards. This collective unwinding of bearish bets creates a powerful self-reinforcing cycle. As more traders close their short positions and open long ones, it generates momentum, drawing in even more optimistic capital and accelerating the upward trajectory of Bitcoin price . BTC Derivatives : A Window into Investor Confidence The derivatives market for Bitcoin is a treasure trove of information, offering deep insights into the collective mindset of institutional and retail investors alike. Understanding BTC derivatives data is crucial for anyone trying to predict the asset’s next move. Derivatives, such as futures and options, allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without owning the underlying asset, and their activity often precedes significant price movements in the spot market. What the Derivatives Data Reveals: Derivative Metric Previous Trend (Bearish/Neutral) Current Trend (Bullish) Implication Funding Rates (Perpetual Futures) Neutral to Negative Positive Long positions are paying shorts, indicating bullish sentiment. Options Put/Call Ratio Higher Put Volume Higher Call Volume More traders are buying calls (betting on upside) than puts (betting on downside). Open Interest (OI) Stagnant or Declining Increasing Steadily More capital is entering the derivatives market, signaling conviction. The shift from stagnant or negative funding rates to consistently positive ones, coupled with a preference for call options over put options, indicates a robust and growing belief in Bitcoin’s appreciation. This isn’t just speculative fervor; it’s a calculated move by sophisticated traders who are positioning themselves for significant upside. The increasing open interest further solidifies this view, showing that new capital is flowing into the market with a clear bullish bias. Is Bitcoin as a Hedge Gaining Traction Amid Global Uncertainty? Beyond the technical indicators and derivatives data, a powerful macro narrative is bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal: its role as a potential safe-haven asset. In times of economic uncertainty, investors traditionally flock to assets like gold. However, a new contender is emerging. According to analysis from Cointelegraph, the current global economic landscape, marked by significant geopolitical shifts and trade tensions, is making Bitcoin as a hedge an increasingly attractive option. Current Global Economic Headwinds: U.S. Tariff Hikes: Recent announcements regarding U.S. tariff hikes on key trading partners like Japan and South Korea have introduced a fresh wave of economic uncertainty. Such measures can disrupt global supply chains, increase consumer prices, and potentially slow economic growth. Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflationary concerns in major economies continue to erode purchasing power, pushing investors to seek assets that can preserve or grow their wealth. Geopolitical Instability: Ongoing conflicts and political tensions in various parts of the world contribute to a climate of unpredictability, making traditional fiat currencies seem less stable. In this environment, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from government monetary policies present a compelling alternative. Unlike fiat currencies that can be devalued by central bank actions, Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it an appealing store of value. As traditional markets grapple with these uncertainties, the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is gaining significant traction, drawing in investors looking for protection against economic volatility. The Road to $120K Bitcoin : What Needs to Align? The question on everyone’s mind is: can Bitcoin truly reach $120,000? Analysts are increasingly optimistic, pointing to several crucial factors that need to align for this ambitious target to materialize. It’s not just about positive sentiment; it’s about the fundamental mechanics of the market supporting such a monumental climb for $120K Bitcoin to become a reality. Crucial Factors for the Ascent to $120,000: Sustained Liquidity Conditions: For Bitcoin to make such a significant leap, there needs to be ample liquidity in the market. This means a continuous flow of capital from both institutional and retail investors willing to buy and hold Bitcoin. Strong liquidity ensures that large buy orders can be absorbed without causing excessive volatility, providing a stable foundation for price appreciation. Reinforced Investor Sentiment: While sentiment is currently bullish, it needs to remain consistently positive. Any significant negative news or unexpected market shocks could dampen enthusiasm. Continued positive news, regulatory clarity, and growing mainstream adoption will be vital in maintaining this optimistic outlook. Technical Breakthroughs: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking through key resistance levels above $107,000 and establishing new support zones will be crucial. Analysts often look at Fibonacci extensions and previous all-time highs to project future targets. A decisive break above psychological barriers will reinforce confidence. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: The continuation of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures could further strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge, driving more capital into the asset. Conversely, a sudden resolution of these issues might reduce its safe-haven demand. Institutional Inflows: The sustained entry of large institutional players, through spot ETFs or direct investments, provides significant buying power and validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their continued participation is key to reaching higher valuations. If these conditions align, the path to $120K Bitcoin seems increasingly plausible. It would represent not just a new all-time high but a powerful statement about Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing role in the global financial landscape. The momentum is building, and the market is eagerly watching to see if this incredible prediction will come to fruition. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Bull Run With Bitcoin showing such strong signs of upward movement, what should investors consider? This is a time for both excitement and careful strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on derivatives data, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory news. These factors can rapidly influence market sentiment and price action. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, market volatility is inherent in crypto. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking partial profits as Bitcoin approaches key resistance levels to manage potential drawdowns. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment strategy is for short-term gains or long-term accumulation. For long-term holders, dips might be seen as buying opportunities. Diversification: While Bitcoin is strong, a diversified portfolio across different crypto assets or traditional assets can help mitigate risk. Beware of FOMO: The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) can lead to impulsive decisions. Always do your own research and stick to your investment plan. The Ascent Continues: A Compelling Summary The narrative surrounding Bitcoin has undergone a dramatic transformation. From the fading shadows of bearish sentiment to the robust signals emanating from BTC derivatives , every indicator points towards a powerful resurgence. The asset’s growing appeal as a reliable Bitcoin as hedge against global economic turbulence only adds to its compelling value proposition. With significant liquidity and investor sentiment aligning, the journey towards $120K Bitcoin is no longer a distant dream but a tangible possibility that could redefine the crypto landscape. As the digital gold continues its relentless climb, the world watches with bated breath, eager to witness what new frontiers it will conquer next.
