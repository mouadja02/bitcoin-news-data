2025-07-08T06:41:06,"Bit Digital dumps 280 Bitcoin, amasses over 100K ETH in Ethereum treasury pivot","Bit Digital has officially pivoted to a fully Ethereum-based treasury strategy, dumping its remaining Bitcoin holdings in favor of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. According to a press release on July 7, the Nasdaq-listed company has sold about 280 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and now has about 100,603 Ethereum ( ETH ), making it one of the biggest institutional Ethereum holders in the world. The strategic pivot follows Bit Digital’s $172 million public offering in June, the proceeds of which were used exclusively to purchase Ethereum. The company already held 24,434 ETH as of March 31, 2025. With its recent acquisitions, it has now quadrupled its ETH reserves. Chief executive officer Sam Tabar framed the move as a long-term bet on Ethereum’s ability to reshape finance. “Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets,” Tabar said. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” You might also like: SharpLink Gaming aims to raise $1b from share sale to boost Ethereum Treasury This shift comes as Bit Digital exits its legacy Bitcoin mining business. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model, in contrast to mining, enables businesses to generate yield by staking tokens without the continuous expenses and selling pressure that come with mining. Bit Digital began building its Ethereum staking infrastructure in 2022. Today, it runs one of the biggest validator networks in the market, complete with institutional-grade custody and active governance involvement. With over $300 million in ETH and plans to scale further, Bit Digital is staking its future, and balance sheet, on Ethereum. The company’s move comes amid a wider institutional shift toward Ethereum as a treasury asset. Ethereum-centric treasury strategies have also been established by other publicly traded companies, such as BioNexus Gene Lab and SharpLink. Together, they form part of the Strategic ETH Reserve, a consortium that keeps track of more than 1.2 million ETH held in corporate treasuries. Although Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency treasury asset in the world, Ethereum is catching up because of its use in decentralized finance, its deflationary design, and its staking rewards, which usually range from 3 to 5% per year.

2025-07-08T06:40:39,"Bitcoin Unstoppable: Is $120K the Next Frontier for Its Price?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Unstoppable: Is $120K the Next Frontier for Its Price? Are you feeling the palpable shift in the air? After months of anticipation, the cryptocurrency market is buzzing with renewed vigor, and at its heart, Bitcoin price is leading the charge. Surging confidently past the $107,000 mark, the world’s leading digital asset isn’t just holding its ground; it’s signaling a powerful comeback that has many analysts eyeing unprecedented heights. The whispers of bearish sentiment that once echoed through trading floors are fading, replaced by a growing chorus of optimism. But what exactly is fueling this dramatic turnaround, and could Bitcoin truly be on the verge of reaching the ambitious $120,000 milestone? Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment : Why Are Bears Retreating? The shift in crypto market sentiment is perhaps the most compelling story unfolding right now. For weeks, a cautious, if not outright bearish, outlook dominated discussions. Traders were quick to bet against upward movements, hedging their portfolios with downside protection. However, recent data paints a drastically different picture, indicating a significant unwinding of these bearish positions. It’s a clear signal that confidence is returning, and fast. Key Indicators of Shifting Sentiment: Reduced Demand for Downside Protection: One of the most telling signs is the notable decrease in demand for put options, which are contracts that give investors the right to sell an asset at a specific price, effectively protecting against price drops. When demand for these declines, it suggests traders are less concerned about a significant price correction. Rebounding Futures Premiums: Futures contracts, agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date, are another crucial barometer. When futures trade at a premium to the spot price, it indicates bullish expectations for the future. The recent rebound in these premiums points to a growing belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to appreciate. Decreased Short Interest: Many trading platforms report a decrease in ‘short’ positions, where traders bet on a price decline. As these positions are closed, it often adds buying pressure, further propelling the price upwards. This collective unwinding of bearish bets creates a powerful self-reinforcing cycle. As more traders close their short positions and open long ones, it generates momentum, drawing in even more optimistic capital and accelerating the upward trajectory of Bitcoin price . BTC Derivatives : A Window into Investor Confidence The derivatives market for Bitcoin is a treasure trove of information, offering deep insights into the collective mindset of institutional and retail investors alike. Understanding BTC derivatives data is crucial for anyone trying to predict the asset’s next move. Derivatives, such as futures and options, allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without owning the underlying asset, and their activity often precedes significant price movements in the spot market. What the Derivatives Data Reveals: Derivative Metric Previous Trend (Bearish/Neutral) Current Trend (Bullish) Implication Funding Rates (Perpetual Futures) Neutral to Negative Positive Long positions are paying shorts, indicating bullish sentiment. Options Put/Call Ratio Higher Put Volume Higher Call Volume More traders are buying calls (betting on upside) than puts (betting on downside). Open Interest (OI) Stagnant or Declining Increasing Steadily More capital is entering the derivatives market, signaling conviction. The shift from stagnant or negative funding rates to consistently positive ones, coupled with a preference for call options over put options, indicates a robust and growing belief in Bitcoin’s appreciation. This isn’t just speculative fervor; it’s a calculated move by sophisticated traders who are positioning themselves for significant upside. The increasing open interest further solidifies this view, showing that new capital is flowing into the market with a clear bullish bias. Is Bitcoin as a Hedge Gaining Traction Amid Global Uncertainty? Beyond the technical indicators and derivatives data, a powerful macro narrative is bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal: its role as a potential safe-haven asset. In times of economic uncertainty, investors traditionally flock to assets like gold. However, a new contender is emerging. According to analysis from Cointelegraph, the current global economic landscape, marked by significant geopolitical shifts and trade tensions, is making Bitcoin as a hedge an increasingly attractive option. Current Global Economic Headwinds: U.S. Tariff Hikes: Recent announcements regarding U.S. tariff hikes on key trading partners like Japan and South Korea have introduced a fresh wave of economic uncertainty. Such measures can disrupt global supply chains, increase consumer prices, and potentially slow economic growth. Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflationary concerns in major economies continue to erode purchasing power, pushing investors to seek assets that can preserve or grow their wealth. Geopolitical Instability: Ongoing conflicts and political tensions in various parts of the world contribute to a climate of unpredictability, making traditional fiat currencies seem less stable. In this environment, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from government monetary policies present a compelling alternative. Unlike fiat currencies that can be devalued by central bank actions, Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it an appealing store of value. As traditional markets grapple with these uncertainties, the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is gaining significant traction, drawing in investors looking for protection against economic volatility. The Road to $120K Bitcoin : What Needs to Align? The question on everyone’s mind is: can Bitcoin truly reach $120,000? Analysts are increasingly optimistic, pointing to several crucial factors that need to align for this ambitious target to materialize. It’s not just about positive sentiment; it’s about the fundamental mechanics of the market supporting such a monumental climb for $120K Bitcoin to become a reality. Crucial Factors for the Ascent to $120,000: Sustained Liquidity Conditions: For Bitcoin to make such a significant leap, there needs to be ample liquidity in the market. This means a continuous flow of capital from both institutional and retail investors willing to buy and hold Bitcoin. Strong liquidity ensures that large buy orders can be absorbed without causing excessive volatility, providing a stable foundation for price appreciation. Reinforced Investor Sentiment: While sentiment is currently bullish, it needs to remain consistently positive. Any significant negative news or unexpected market shocks could dampen enthusiasm. Continued positive news, regulatory clarity, and growing mainstream adoption will be vital in maintaining this optimistic outlook. Technical Breakthroughs: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking through key resistance levels above $107,000 and establishing new support zones will be crucial. Analysts often look at Fibonacci extensions and previous all-time highs to project future targets. A decisive break above psychological barriers will reinforce confidence. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: The continuation of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures could further strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge, driving more capital into the asset. Conversely, a sudden resolution of these issues might reduce its safe-haven demand. Institutional Inflows: The sustained entry of large institutional players, through spot ETFs or direct investments, provides significant buying power and validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their continued participation is key to reaching higher valuations. If these conditions align, the path to $120K Bitcoin seems increasingly plausible. It would represent not just a new all-time high but a powerful statement about Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing role in the global financial landscape. The momentum is building, and the market is eagerly watching to see if this incredible prediction will come to fruition. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Bull Run With Bitcoin showing such strong signs of upward movement, what should investors consider? This is a time for both excitement and careful strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on derivatives data, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory news. These factors can rapidly influence market sentiment and price action. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, market volatility is inherent in crypto. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking partial profits as Bitcoin approaches key resistance levels to manage potential drawdowns. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment strategy is for short-term gains or long-term accumulation. For long-term holders, dips might be seen as buying opportunities. Diversification: While Bitcoin is strong, a diversified portfolio across different crypto assets or traditional assets can help mitigate risk. Beware of FOMO: The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) can lead to impulsive decisions. Always do your own research and stick to your investment plan. The Ascent Continues: A Compelling Summary The narrative surrounding Bitcoin has undergone a dramatic transformation. From the fading shadows of bearish sentiment to the robust signals emanating from BTC derivatives , every indicator points towards a powerful resurgence. The asset’s growing appeal as a reliable Bitcoin as hedge against global economic turbulence only adds to its compelling value proposition. With significant liquidity and investor sentiment aligning, the journey towards $120K Bitcoin is no longer a distant dream but a tangible possibility that could redefine the crypto landscape. As the digital gold continues its relentless climb, the world watches with bated breath, eager to witness what new frontiers it will conquer next.

The US money supply is “re-surging,” observed Global Markets Investor on Tuesday. They noted that the M2 money supply in America jumped 4.5% year-over-year in May to a record $21.94 trillion. It has likely exceeded $22 trillion in July as money printing has continued, and if the trend is projected over the next decade, the M2 money supply will double. US money supply is re-surging: US M2 money supply jumped 4.5% year-over-year in May, to a record $21.94 TRILLION. This has now surpassed the March 2022 record of $21.86 trillion For perspective, the 2000-2025 annual growth rate has been 6.3%. https://t.co/FWsgYrccuy — Global Markets Investor (@GlobalMktObserv) July 8, 2025 The US money supply has grown rapidly, surging around 37% over the past five years since March 2020, when the money printers were ramped up to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic. Moreover, global money supply is at a record high of $93.7 trillion and growing 7.45% annually. This global figure combines the four major central banks: the Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). “As global money supply expands, Bitcoin’s next target sits around $170,000, following the flow,” said analyst Crypto Auris last week. Analysts had predicted a strong week for Bitcoin if the outcome of Trump’s tariff deadline was positive. However, the US president has issued letters to countries primarily in Asia that had yet to make a deal, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia, causing crypto markets to retreat on Tuesday. Debunking the Correlation Theory On July 7, Protos debunked the correlation between M2 money and Bitcoin prices, stating that the relationship falls apart when you simply change the time frame on the charts. When zoomed from 2021 to the present, the correlation looks strong; however, when zoomed from 2019 to the present, M2 rises two years before Bitcoin. M2 even hit new highs in November 2022, while Bitcoin crashed during the FTX collapse. Total money supply doesn’t measure liquidity available for Bitcoin purchases and correlates with the price of everything since it’s the denominator in all prices, they stated.

2025-07-08T06:34:51,"Two Ethereum wallets moved 1,140 ETH after nearly a decade","On Monday, two dormant Ethereum wallets dating back to the network’s genesis block became active for the first time in nearly a decade, transferring 1,140 ETH valued at approximately $2.9 million. For exactly 3,630 days since July 30, 2015, the wallets “0x27” and “0x7f” remained inactive until the recent move. Dormant wallets have been moving their assets recently Ethereum launched in 2015 as a proof-of-work blockchain, offering block rewards like Bitcoin. In September 2022, it shifted to a proof-of-stake model through The Merge , a transition designed to lower the network’s energy consumption. Since 2015, the wallets have remained dormant, and ETH has surged by 89,450%, per TradingView’s analysis. One of the two wallets moved 900 ETH while the other 240 ETH, and according to blockchain sleuth Whale Alert, the 900 ETH was worth only $279 in 2015. 900 ETH moved after nearly a decade of dormancy. Source: Whale Alert Lately, there’s been a spike in the number of reactivated wallets across the crypto market. Just last Friday, three Bitcoin wallets, inactive for over 14 years, moved billions of dollars in funds. Additionally, dormant since the early days of Bitcoin, some Satoshi-era wallets moved coins worth close to $44 million in 2024. Meanwhile, a US government-owned wallet recently sent 86.56 ETH—worth approximately $200,000—to Coinbase Prime. The crypto assets had been confiscated in 2022 from Chase Senecal on suspicion of NFT fraud and hacking operations. Arkham Intelligence said the wallet initially conducted a $10 test transaction before moving the full amount to the exchange. The network’s Pectra upgrade drove a price surge in ETH At press time, Ethereum remained relatively stable despite the two wallet transactions. Ethereum is currently trading at $2,542 . The ongoing network development heavily influenced the current token price. Ethereum developers advanced the network in May with the Pectra upgrade, adding support for smart accounts and scalability improvements. ETH rose from $1,812 to over $2,540 in the following weeks. Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Toni Wahrstätter have also proposed a few additional upgrades to the network. Most recently, Wahrstätter proposed to have a gas cap of 16.77M per transaction, stating that it would improve the network’s efficiency and robustness. Bit Digital bought more Ethereum for its treasury Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital also increased its Ethereum holdings to 100,603 ETH, over a 300% rise from its balance of 24,434 ETH at the end of the first quarter of 2025. The firm announced that it used the gains from a recent $172 million public offering and the sale of 280 BTC to support its ETH treasury strategy. Before, the company focused on building its BTC holdings but shifted to an ETH-native treasury in June. At the time, Bit Digital’s CEO, Sam Tabar, said they were starting with exposure to over 100,000 ETH and planned to aggressively increase their holdings to become the leading ETH holding company globally. In addition to Bit Digital, firms such as SharpLink Gaming (SBET) and BitMine (BMNR) are also ramping up their ETH acquisitions. BitMine recently announced a $250 million offering aimed at purchasing Ethereum. CF Benchmarks even projects that multiple other institutions will dive into ETH and SOL acquisitions.

2025-07-08T06:03:48,"SOL, ETH And XRP: Top Altcoins To Stack Before Next Bounce","The post SOL, ETH And XRP: Top Altcoins To Stack Before Next Bounce appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market might be choppy, but it’s creating opportunities for investors to stack promising altcoins before the next bounce. According to an analyst, with Bitcoin holding steady near $108,000, several altcoins are showing signs of bouncing back. Altcoin 1: Solana Solana (SOL) remains one of the top tokens to stack right now. Price recently bounced around the $150 support zone, and as long as it stays above $146, SOL could aim for $160-$165 in the short term. Solana continues to attract developers and is often seen as a high-potential layer-1 token for the next alt season. Altcoin 2: Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) is another solid bet, holding near its key $2,490 support. This zone marks ETH’s 200-day moving average and a crucial bullish level. If the market turns around, ETH could be one of the first majors to push higher , especially with activity on its network staying strong. Altcoin 3: XRP XRP’s latest chart action has traders watching closely as it approaches a critical resistance level, the 200-day moving average (MA). Historically, this level has acted as both strong support and resistance for XRP, and it’s currently blocking the token’s upward movement. For short-term, support levels to watch are around $2.31 and $2.295. These are possible dip-buy zones where a quick bounce might occur if the price drops. Other Altcoin Plays Lastly, meme coins like Bonk (BONK) and Popcat (POPCAT) are on analysts’ radars for high-risk, high-reward plays. Bonk has been seeing fresh interest from smart money, while Popcat is testing key support around $0.285, with expectations of a short-term bounce from these oversold levels. Virtuals is also hitting a big demand area near $1.47. With multiple indicators like trend lines and moving averages lining up, the analyst expects a bounce of 5-8% soon. It might not be a trend reversal yet, but it’s a spot where short-term upside could play out. SUI is approaching its first major support at $2.78. If the dip continues, a stronger demand zone sits at $2.60. These levels could offer good entries for those looking to build positions at lower risk points.

As of July 8, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed performance. Bitcoin is consolidating near $108,000, with some altcoins gaining while others show short-term weakness. The global crypto market capitalization is around $3.3 trillion. Institutional interest, particularly through Bitcoin Spot ETFs, remains strong, but caution exists due to geopolitical factors and upcoming tariff decisions. Which cryptocurrencies are considered best to buy now in July 2025? Analysts suggest Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) as “lowest risk, decent returns” options due to their established adoption. Other promising altcoins include XRP, BNB, and SUI. For higher risk/reward, some analysts point to DeFi and AI tokens like Hyperliquid (HYPE), Ethena (ENA), and Virtuals (VIRTUAL), and meme coins like Bonk (BONK). Is cryptocurrency still a good investment in July 2025? Yes, many experts believe cryptocurrency remains a good investment in 2025, especially considering growing institutional adoption, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and continued innovation in the Web3 space.

2025-07-08T06:00:46,"US Stock Market Plunge: Unpacking the Impact on Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Plunge: Unpacking the Impact on Crypto Investors When the US stock market sneezes, does the crypto market catch a cold? It’s a question on many investors’ minds, especially with the recent news of major U.S. stock indices closing lower. While the world of digital assets often prides itself on decentralization and independence, the reality is that traditional market movements can and often do ripple through the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the volatile waters of both financial worlds. Understanding the Recent US Stock Market Downturn The past trading session saw significant declines across the board for the three major U.S. stock markets, signaling a cautious, if not outright bearish, sentiment among investors. Let’s break down the numbers: S&P500: Dropped by -0.79% Nasdaq: Also saw a decline of -0.79% Dow: Led the losses with a more pronounced dip of -0.94% These figures represent more than just percentages; they reflect a collective decision by millions of investors to pull back, re-evaluate, or de-risk their portfolios. Such a broad-based market downturn often stems from underlying economic concerns, and its implications extend far beyond just traditional equities. Table: Major U.S. Stock Market Closures Index Percentage Change S&P500 -0.79% Nasdaq -0.79% Dow -0.94% What Drove the Market Downturn? While a single day’s movement doesn’t tell the whole story, several factors typically contribute to such a broad market downturn . These can include: Inflation Concerns: Persistent high inflation often prompts central banks to consider or implement stricter monetary policies, like interest rate hikes, which can dampen economic growth and corporate earnings. Interest Rate Hikes: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing down economic activity and making bonds more attractive relative to stocks. Geopolitical Tensions: Global conflicts or political instability can create uncertainty, leading investors to seek safer assets or reduce exposure to riskier ones. Corporate Earnings Reports: Disappointing earnings or cautious outlooks from major companies can trigger sell-offs, especially if they signal broader economic weakness. Recession Fears: Growing concerns about a potential economic recession can lead to widespread selling as investors anticipate reduced consumer spending and business activity. These macroeconomic headwinds create a challenging environment for all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Crypto Market Correlation For a long time, cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, were touted as uncorrelated assets – digital gold that would act as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, recent years have shown a growing crypto market correlation with the traditional stock market, particularly with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq. Why this increasing correlation? As institutional money flows into crypto, and as more traditional investors enter the space, crypto assets are increasingly treated like other risk assets. When there’s a broader ‘risk-off’ sentiment in the market – meaning investors are pulling money out of riskier assets – both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies tend to suffer. Conversely, during ‘risk-on’ periods, when investors are willing to take on more risk, both tend to perform well. Bitcoin, often seen as the bellwether for the crypto market, has frequently mirrored the movements of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq during periods of significant macroeconomic shifts. This doesn’t mean they move in lockstep every day, but the directional trend often aligns, especially during major market events. This growing correlation means that paying attention to the US stock market is no longer just for traditional investors; it’s crucial for anyone in crypto too. Analyzing Nasdaq Performance and Its Wider Implications The Nasdaq performance is particularly relevant for the crypto space. The Nasdaq Composite Index is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, many of which are speculative and sensitive to interest rate changes. Cryptocurrencies, too, are often viewed as growth assets, representing the cutting edge of financial technology. When the Nasdaq takes a hit, it often reflects a broader investor sentiment shift away from high-growth, high-risk assets towards more stable, value-oriented investments. This sentiment directly impacts crypto for several reasons: Investor Demographics: Many crypto investors also hold tech stocks, and a downturn in one can lead to liquidity needs or rebalancing in the other. Risk Appetite: A decline in tech stocks signals a reduced appetite for risk, which directly affects speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies. Valuation Metrics: While crypto doesn’t have traditional earnings, the general economic environment that depresses tech valuations can also lead to a reassessment of crypto’s perceived value and future potential. Therefore, understanding the nuances of Nasdaq performance provides valuable clues about the potential trajectory of the crypto market. Navigating the S&P 500 Decline: Strategies for Crypto Investors The S&P 500 decline , representing 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is a broad indicator of the health of the American economy. Its downturn suggests a widespread pullback in investor confidence. For crypto investors, this isn’t just a signal to panic, but an opportunity to refine strategies and think long-term. So, what actionable insights can crypto investors glean from this? Diversification Beyond Crypto: While you might be bullish on crypto, consider diversifying some of your portfolio into less correlated assets, or even traditional safe havens, if your risk tolerance dictates. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals can smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average purchase price during a downturn. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, solid projects with strong use cases, active development, and robust communities tend to weather the storm better than speculative tokens. Do your research! Manage Emotions: Fear and greed are powerful drivers in financial markets. A market downturn can trigger panic selling. Stick to your investment plan and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Stay Informed: Keep an eye not just on crypto news, but also on global economic indicators, central bank policies, and traditional market trends, as they increasingly influence the crypto market correlation . Challenges and Opportunities Amidst Market Volatility A broad market downturn , as seen with the recent declines in the US stock market , presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities for investors. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Downturns often lead to heightened price swings, making it difficult to predict short-term movements. Emotional Stress: Seeing portfolio values drop can be psychologically taxing, leading to fear and potentially irrational decisions like selling at a loss. Uncertainty: It’s hard to know how long a downturn will last or how deep it will go, which adds to investor anxiety. Opportunities: Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, market corrections can offer a chance to acquire assets at lower prices, potentially leading to significant gains when the market recovers. Portfolio Rebalancing: Downturns are a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio, shed underperforming assets, and reallocate to those with stronger long-term potential. Innovation Continues: Bear markets often weed out weaker projects, allowing truly innovative and resilient ones to shine and build for the future. The key is to approach these periods with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective, rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. In conclusion, the recent dips in the US stock market indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones serve as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While cryptocurrencies strive for independence, their growing maturity and institutional adoption mean they are increasingly susceptible to broader economic trends and investor sentiment that impact traditional assets. Understanding the crypto market correlation with traditional markets, especially the Nasdaq performance and S&P 500 decline , is no longer optional but essential for informed decision-making. By staying vigilant, employing sound investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging, and focusing on the long-term fundamentals of projects, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and potentially emerge stronger.

The war-torn European country has unleashed a dramatic wave of sanctions designed to choke off the digital pipelines that have been fueling Russia’s military campaign. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Decree No. 465/2025 , effectively freezing the assets and banning operations of 60 crypto firms—55 based in Russia and five scattered across Cyprus, Kazakhstan and the UAE. This sweeping action is meant to send a strong message: crypto won’t be a safe haven for money that bankrolls conflict. Sanctions Span Exchange Miners And Issuers According to the decree, five crypto exchanges are accused of moving funds for sanctioned Russian entities. Nineteen mining operations have been caught processing coins linked to sanctioned individuals. Ukrainian President Zelensky has sanctioned 60 companies aiding Russia’s sanctions evasion via crypto, including 55 from Russia and others from Cyprus, Kazakhstan, and the UAE. The move targets mining, exchange, and payment firms as Ukraine seeks to block Russia’s growing use of… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 7, 2025 Seventeen platforms that issue digital assets already under US restrictions are now blocked in Ukraine. Another 19 companies—from makers of payment terminals to brokers arranging international transfers—face asset freezes and activity bans. Ukraine didn’t stop at companies. The sanctions list also names 73 individuals, all Russian citizens, including high‑ranking central bank officials. Based on reports from Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, these measures will be shared with allies like the EU and the US. That way, they can mirror the bans and tighten the grip on every channel Russia uses. Coordination With Allies Aims To Close Loopholes Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine’s commissioner for Sanctions Policy, said Kyiv will urge its partners to adopt matching rules. The goal is to close every loophole Russia uses to fund its military. Zelenskyy revealed that one single firm moved “several billion dollars” since January to support Russia’s military‑industrial complex. That figure shows why digital channels have become critical for sanctioned players. New Stablecoin Highlights Growing Risks Based on reports by the Financial Times and the Centre for Information Resilience, Russia’s crypto use is on the rise. A new stablecoin called A7A5, pegged to the ruble, moved over $9 billion in just four months on the Grinex exchange. More than 12 billion A7A5 tokens now float in circulation, backed by roughly $156 million in reserves held at the US‑sanctioned Promsvyazbank. Only a few wallets handled most of that volume, showing how a small group can steer vast sums. Meanwhile, five non‑Russian companies also made the list: Token Trust Holdings Limited in Cyprus, EXMO RBC Limited in Kazakhstan, AWX Solutions and Crypto Explorer DMCC in the UAE, and Bitpapa IC FZC in the UAE. All five are already under US restrictions. Their inclusion highlights how sanctions evasion often relies on a global network of service providers.

While Bit Digital doubles down on its Ethereum vision, the ETH price has been moving higher too. Meanwhile, recently it climbed above $2,550 and may aim for $2,650 or even $2,800 if momentum holds. However, if it struggles to clear $2,580 cleanly, a pullback could follow.

Yes, Bit Digital’s bold pivot could influence other public companies to diversify into Ethereum. Its move, along with SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion Technologies also building ETH treasuries, signals a growing institutional interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem, particularly for its staking yields, programmable nature, and role in tokenized assets. What happens if Ethereum’s price drops significantly after Bit Digital’s investment? If Ethereum’s price drops significantly after Bit Digital’s large investment, it would negatively impact the company’s treasury value and potentially its stock price. While Bit Digital is bullish on ETH’s long-term potential, crypto markets are volatile, and a substantial downturn would reduce the value of their holdings and staking returns. Could Bit Digital’s focus on Ethereum staking impact the ETH network’s security or decentralization? Bit Digital’s focus on Ethereum staking, by adding over 100,000 ETH to its staked holdings, generally strengthens the ETH network’s security as more ETH is locked up to validate transactions. However, if a few large entities like Bit Digital accumulate a disproportionately large amount of staked ETH, it could raise concerns about decentralization, as control over block validation might become concentrated.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/nasdaq-firm-bit-digital-dumps-bitcoin-buys-100k-ethereum/,"ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T05:41:29,"Analyst Says This XRP Resistance Could Trigger Price Rally to All-Time Highs","In the crypto market, structural technical signals can carry significant weight, and these signs suggest that XRP has recently moved into a potentially pivotal phase. According to a monthly chart shared by crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), breaking above the 0.886 logarithmic Fibonacci retracement level, positioned at approximately $2.258, could kickstart a major rally. The chart starts from 2017 to the present, and highlights XRP’s long consolidation phase between 2021 and early 2025, during which the price remained largely suppressed despite broader market fluctuations. This stagnation was followed by a breakout surge that pushed XRP beyond the significant 0.786 ($1.61) and 0.707 ($1.23) levels. $XRP monthly chart Break 0.886 log fib, making all time highs https://t.co/Whs31W09HF pic.twitter.com/AOVoFy2vrY — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 5, 2025 Multiple analysts have predicted an impending breakout , and a monthly close above $2.258 would draw attention to the full Fibonacci extension target near $3.32 and speculative higher targets extending to $8.29 (1.272) and $13.38 (1.414), should momentum persist. Historical Importance of this Resistance Level The 0.886 Fibonacci level is often viewed as the last meaningful resistance before an asset revisits its prior highs. For XRP, this level has held firm since its all-time high in January 2018. While other large-cap assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum reached new all-time highs in subsequent years, XRP has remained below its former peak, constrained by legal uncertainties and shifting investor sentiment. The digital asset closed above this level in January, when it recorded its highest monthly close ever , but market pressure held it down in subsequent months. Now, with momentum building , the digital asset could retest this level again. While XRP has not yet surpassed its historic peak, breaking this barrier would signal an end to its extended accumulation and position the asset in a stronger technical stance than at any point in recent years, setting the stage for a push toward a new all-time high.

2025-07-08T05:40:54,"SEC Acknowledges Truth Social’s Groundbreaking Bitcoin & Ether ETF Applications: A New Dawn for Digital Asset Investment?","BitcoinWorld SEC Acknowledges Truth Social’s Groundbreaking Bitcoin & Ether ETF Applications: A New Dawn for Digital Asset Investment? The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at the heart of this transformation lies the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrencies. For years, investors have eagerly awaited regulated, accessible pathways into this volatile yet potentially lucrative market. The latest news has sent ripples through the industry: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged receipt of applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) products from an unexpected player – Truth Social. This development marks a potentially pivotal moment for digital asset investment , signaling a new chapter in the ongoing integration of digital currencies into mainstream finance. What Exactly Happened? The SEC and Truth Social’s Bold Move In a move that caught many by surprise, the SEC , the primary regulator for the U.S. securities markets, confirmed it had received formal applications from Truth Social for both a spot Bitcoin ETF and a spot Ether ETF. For those unfamiliar, Truth Social is a social media platform launched by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). While the company’s primary focus has been on social media and media services, its foray into the cryptocurrency ETF space through these applications signifies a bold and intriguing diversification strategy. This acknowledgment by the SEC is a procedural step, indicating that the applications have been received and the formal review process will now commence. It does not imply approval, but it certainly puts these applications on the regulatory radar. Understanding the Landscape: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Why Does it Matter? To fully grasp the significance of Truth Social’s applications, it’s crucial to understand what a Spot Bitcoin ETF entails and how it differs from other crypto investment vehicles. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot Bitcoin ETF directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This means that if you invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF, you are essentially gaining exposure to the actual price movements of Bitcoin without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency yourself. This contrasts sharply with futures Bitcoin ETFs, which invest in Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the actual cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETF Futures Bitcoin ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds actual Bitcoin Holds Bitcoin futures contracts Price Tracking Aims to track Bitcoin’s real-time market price closely Tracks the price of futures contracts, which can deviate from spot price Custody Fund manager handles secure custody of Bitcoin No direct Bitcoin custody needed by the fund Investor Experience More direct exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price Indirect exposure, subject to futures market dynamics The significance of a spot Bitcoin ETF lies in its ability to democratize access to Bitcoin. It removes technical barriers for traditional investors, offering a familiar, regulated investment product that can be bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts. This dramatically expands the pool of potential investors beyond crypto-native individuals. The Journey to Acceptance: A Look at Past SEC Deliberations The path to a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long and arduous, marked by numerous rejections from the SEC over several years. The commission’s primary concerns consistently revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, a landmark shift occurred in January 2024 when the SEC finally approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, following a court ruling that challenged the basis of their previous rejections. This approval was a monumental victory for the crypto industry, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream adoption. The precedent set by these approvals is crucial for understanding the current landscape and the potential trajectory of new applications, including those from Truth Social. Ether ETF Applications: Following in Bitcoin’s Footsteps? With the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, attention has now firmly shifted to Ether ETF applications . Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a robust ecosystem supporting decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Proponents argue that Ether, like Bitcoin, is mature enough for a spot ETF, citing its increasing institutional adoption and the evolution of its underlying blockchain. Several major financial institutions have already filed for spot Ether ETFs, and the SEC’s acknowledgment of Truth Social’s application adds another interesting dimension to this developing narrative. While the regulatory hurdles for Ether may differ slightly due to its smart contract functionality and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the general sentiment in the market is optimistic, anticipating similar approvals down the line. Truth Social’s Play: A New Frontier for Digital Asset Investment? Why is Truth Social , primarily known as a social media platform, venturing into the complex world of cryptocurrency ETFs? This move could be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it might be an attempt to diversify revenue streams and capitalize on the growing interest in digital asset investment . By offering regulated crypto investment products, Truth Social could potentially attract a new user base interested in both their social platform and financial offerings. Secondly, it aligns with a broader trend of technology companies exploring Web3 and blockchain technologies. For a platform that champions free speech and aims to disrupt traditional media, embracing decentralized finance could be seen as a natural extension of its ethos. It also presents a unique marketing angle, potentially appealing to a demographic that values both alternative media and alternative investments. The question remains how the SEC will view an application from a non-traditional financial entity like Truth Social, given their strict scrutiny of financial products. Benefits of Spot Crypto ETFs: Unlocking New Avenues for Investors The introduction of spot crypto ETFs, including the potential ones from Truth Social, offers several compelling benefits for investors and the broader market: Enhanced Accessibility: These ETFs make investing in Bitcoin and Ether as straightforward as buying a stock, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, exchanges, or understanding complex blockchain technology. Increased Liquidity: Being traded on major stock exchanges, ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, providing a layer of investor protection and transparency that may be perceived as lacking in direct crypto purchases on unregulated exchanges. This is a key focus for the SEC . Diversification Opportunities: For traditional investors, spot crypto ETFs offer a simple way to diversify their portfolios with exposure to a new asset class, potentially enhancing returns. Lower Entry Barriers: Investors can gain exposure with smaller capital amounts compared to directly buying whole units of Bitcoin or Ether. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Risks for Crypto ETFs Despite the excitement, the path for crypto ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. The SEC ‘s historical reluctance stems from legitimate concerns that still persist to some degree: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations, which can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses for investors. ETFs do not mitigate this inherent volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the U.S. has seen some clarity with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the broader regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving. Future policy changes could impact these products. Custody Risks: While the ETF provider handles custody, the underlying risks associated with securing large amounts of digital assets (e.g., hacks, loss of private keys) remain, albeit managed by professional custodians. Market Manipulation Concerns: Despite improvements, the crypto market is still susceptible to manipulation due to its relative immaturity and concentration of ownership. The SEC remains vigilant on this front. Operational Risks: The infrastructure supporting these ETFs, including the underlying exchanges and custodians, must be robust and secure to prevent operational failures. The Road Ahead: What to Expect from the SEC’s Review Process The SEC ‘s review process for ETF applications is rigorous and follows a specific timeline, typically involving several stages. After acknowledgment, the applications enter a period of public comment, followed by a series of deadlines for the SEC to make a decision, which can be extended. For Truth Social’s Ether ETF applications and their spot Bitcoin ETF, the process will involve: Initial Review: The SEC staff examines the application for completeness and compliance with securities laws. Public Comment Period: The public, including industry experts and investors, can submit comments on the proposed ETF. Potential Amendments: Based on feedback and SEC inquiries, the applicant may need to amend their filing multiple times. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines (e.g., 45 days, extendable to 90, then 180, and potentially 240 days) to approve, deny, or delay a decision. Given the precedent set by previous spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, and the ongoing discussions around Ether ETFs, the market will be closely watching each stage of Truth Social’s applications. The SEC’s ultimate decision will hinge on whether the proposed ETFs meet the necessary investor protection and market integrity standards. Broader Market Implications: How Could Approvals Reshape Digital Asset Investment? If Truth Social’s applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Ether ETF applications are eventually approved, the implications for digital asset investment could be profound. Firstly, it would further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The entry of a high-profile, non-traditional applicant like Truth Social could signal a broader acceptance of crypto across diverse sectors. Secondly, it would likely drive increased institutional capital into both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially leading to greater price stability and market depth. Thirdly, it could spur more innovation in crypto-related financial products, as other companies seek to follow suit. Finally, it might encourage a more favorable regulatory environment globally, as other jurisdictions observe the success and impact of regulated crypto products in the U.S. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Should You Consider? For investors considering exposure to the crypto market through ETFs, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Due Diligence: Even with SEC-regulated products, understand the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ether), its volatility, and the specific ETF’s structure and fees. Understand the Risks: Recognize that while ETFs offer convenience, they do not eliminate the inherent market risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Only invest what you are prepared to lose. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on the SEC ‘s decisions regarding Truth Social’s applications and other pending crypto ETF filings. Regulatory changes can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Crypto ETFs can be a valuable addition, but they should be part of a well-diversified investment strategy, not the sole focus. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice, especially if you are new to crypto or complex financial products, seek guidance from a qualified financial professional. Conclusion The acknowledgment by the SEC of Truth Social’s applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications marks a fascinating and potentially transformative moment for the world of digital asset investment . While it’s merely a procedural step and not an approval, it underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and demand for regulated crypto investment products. Truth Social’s unexpected entry into this space adds a unique dimension, blending social media with financial innovation. As the regulatory review process unfolds, the industry will be watching closely, anticipating how these developments could further shape the future of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

2025-07-08T05:30:36,"Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels","An analyst has pointed out three key resistance levels for Dogecoin that could be to keep an eye on, based on on-chain data. Dogecoin URPD Shows These Price Levels Stand Out In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared DOGE levels that could be important resistance boundaries. The levels in question correspond to major supply walls on the Dogecoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator from the analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the total amount of the memecoin’s supply that was last purchased at the different price levels that it has visited over history. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned Now, here is the chart posted by Martinez that shows how the URPD looks for Dogecoin right now: As displayed in the above graph, the level closest to the latest Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of the URPD is $0.18. The investors last purchased around 8.94% of the asset’s supply around this mark. Naturally, as the level is above the spot price, all of these holders would be in the red at the moment. Generally, investors in loss look forward to retests of their break-even mark so that they can get their money ‘back.’ Often, these holders push for the exit as soon as this happens, fearing that the price would go back down again in the near future. As such, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a notable part of the supply from below, a significant selling reaction can sometimes appear in the market. This can provide resistance to the cryptocurrency. Considering that the $0.18 level is particularly large, it can act as a point of notable resistance. Similarly, the analyst has also flagged two other levels: $0.21 (7.24% of supply) and $0.36 (3.82% of supply). Interestingly, between these two, there aren’t any significant supply walls, meaning that if Dogecoin can get into this zone, it may, at least in theory, have an easier time climbing up. In the scenario that DOGE gets rejected at the resistance, however, it may have to find support at the in-profit supply zones. Holders belonging to these levels can react to declines to their cost basis by buying more, as they may believe the drawdown to be just a dip-buying opportunity.

It hosts the acquisition mark of 20.03% of the memecoin’s supply, which means that it’s massive in size, and so, could be a strong support center. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, up 1.6% in the last seven days.

2025-07-08T05:30:00,"Strategy Posts $14B in Bitcoin Gains, Pauses Weekly Buys","Despite the gains, the firm paused its consistent Bitcoin accumulation last week, maintaining its total holdings at 597,325 BTC. This move coincided with a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering that is aimed at funding future BTC purchases. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet continued to ramp up its Bitcoin reserves by acquiring another 2,204 BTC and solidifying its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder. CleanSpark also saw major growth when it boosted its mining output by over 50% year-over-year and raised its hashrate to 50 EH/s. However, its stock dipped nearly 8% despite the operational progress. Strategy Tops $14B Gains Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, reported $14.05 billion in unrealized gains on its digital asset holdings for the second quarter of 2025. Alongside this impressive figure, the company disclosed a deferred tax expense of $4.04 billion, according to its latest filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of June 30, the carrying value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings reached $64.36 billion, while the related deferred tax liability stood at $6.31 billion. Despite the very impressive gains, Strategy paused its consistent Bitcoin accumulation last week. The firm’s total holdings stayed unchanged at 597,325 BTC after its most recent acquisition of 4,980 BTC. This break in weekly purchases was the first since April 2025 and came as Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped to $105,400 before rebounding above $110,000. The company previously halted purchases when Bitcoin fell below $87,000 earlier in the year. After that pause, Strategy resumed buying with a 3,459 BTC purchase on April 14, just two weeks after its massive 22,048 BTC acquisition on March 31. The newly reported unrealized gains slightly exceeded Bloomberg’s earlier projections, which estimated Strategy would post at least $13 billion in such gains for the quarter. In conjunction with the earnings announcement, Strategy also unveiled a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for its 10% Series A perpetual Stride (STRD) preferred stock, priced at $0.001 per share. This latest ATM program is part of the company’s equity-raising strategy that is designed to fund future Bitcoin purchases. According to an investor presentation , Strategy already issued $477 million under the STRK ATM and $163 million under the STRF ATM. The firm reported a total remaining ATM capacity of $44.8 billion across its various programs, which includes $18.1 billion for MSTR, $4.2 billion for STRD, $20.5 billion for STRK, and $1.9 billion for STRF. These strategic funding mechanisms are part of Strategy’s continued effort to maintain its dominant position in the Bitcoin market while navigating short-term volatility and tax considerations. Metaplanet Buys More BTC It does not seem like Metaplanet plans to slow down its Bitcoin buys at all. Japan’s leading corporate Bitcoin holder expanded its holdings with the acquisition of 2,204 BTC for $237 million, according to a filing on Monday. The purchase was made at an average price of 15.64 million yen per Bitcoin, or roughly $107,700. This latest acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 15,555 BTC, with an average purchase price of approximately $99,985 per coin. With this addition, Metaplanet solidified its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company surpassed Tesla in late June when it added 1,234 BTC to its reserves, raising its total to 12,345 BTC while Tesla stayed at 11,509 BTC. It then outpaced Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark's holdings of 12,502 BTC with another strategic buy of 1,005 BTC valued at $108 million, which was disclosed on June 30. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The news comes during a surge in activity among corporate Bitcoin treasuries. ProCap , the investment firm led by Anthony Pompliano, made its first entry into the Bitcoin space with a 3,724 BTC purchase totaling $386 million. Semler Scientific also announced plans to dramatically increase its Bitcoin holdings from 3,808 BTC to 105,000 BTC. Despite the growing trend, some analysts are a bit more cautious. James Check , lead analyst at Glassnode, recently warned that the Bitcoin treasury strategy may already be losing its luster for new entrants. He suggested that the biggest gains may have already been captured by early adopters and pointed out that latecomers could struggle to stand out, saying “nobody wants the 50th Treasury company.” A report by venture firm Breed also warned that only a few firms will manage to avoid a potential “death spiral” in the Bitcoin treasury space, due to the risks that come with chasing a strategy already embraced by many. CleanSpark BTC Output Jumps In other Bitcoin-related news, CleanSpark reported a big surge in its Bitcoin mining output, with production rising over 50% year-over-year despite the increasingly challenging post-halving environment for miners. In June, the company achieved an operational hashrate of 50 EH/s, up from 20.4 EH/s a year ago, which was a 145.1% increase in mining capacity. This boosted output to 685 BTC mined last month, valued at approximately $74.2 million based on current market prices, compared to 445 BTC mined in June of 2024. (Source: CleanSpark ) CEO and president Zach Bradford credited the achievement to the efforts of the operations and technology teams, and pointed out that more than 10 EH/s of capacity was added across four US states, representing a 9.6% month-over-month growth. CleanSpark sold 578 BTC in June, most of its production for the month, and now holds 12,608 BTC—up slightly from 12,502 in May. This places CleanSpark seventh among publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Only MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms hold more BTC among miners, with MARA holding 50,000 BTC and Riot holding 19,225 BTC. Bradford noticed the growing adoption of Bitcoin by global corporations, and mentioned that corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have outpaced ETF net inflows for three straight quarters. CleanSpark stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the operational gains, CleanSpark’s stoc k saw an almost 8% drop on Monday after the update. This decline took place amid broader market softness, with the Nasdaq index falling over 1% thanks to U.S. trade policy discussions that weighed on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty continued to rise, and reached an all-time high of 126.9 trillion on May 31, compounding the economic pressures on miners from reduced block rewards and rising energy costs. Since February of 2024, CleanSpark greatly expanded its US operations by establishing facilities in Georgia, Mississippi, Wyoming, and Tennessee. In August 2024, the company also purchased 26,000 Bitmain immersion mining rigs in a $168 million deal.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9837/strategy-posts-14-b-in-bitcoin-gains-pauses-weekly-buys,"BTC|REGULATION|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T05:20:32,"Crypto Traders Shrug Off Dormant Bitcoin Whale Moves, With Profit-Taking on XRP, DOGE, SOL","Bitcoin (BTC) posted its highest-ever weekly close at nearly $110,000 on Sunday, defying a week marked by potential headwinds, including dormant whale wallets moving $8 billion in BTC, renewed tariff drama, and thin holiday liquidity. By Tuesday, the asset was holding steady just under $108,000 after a brief sell-off on Monday night. Major crypto assets saw a bout of profit-taking. Solana (SOL) lost 2.3% to $149, while dogecoin (DOGE) fell 4.1% to lead slides. Ether (ETH) hovered near $2,530, and XRP held steady around $2.26. In broader markets, Asian equities wobbled but avoided a selloff after President Donald Trump signaled openness to resume trade talks, postponing fresh tariffs until at least Aug. 1. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index traded flat despite Korea and Japan facing new levies. Risk appetite crept back as the yen softened and the won rallied, while the euro gained on reports of a potential EU deal. “Markets are hovering around record highs again,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. “Earnings season kicks off this week, and sentiment is being driven by the hope that CEOs guide positively, especially after being blindsided last quarter by sudden tariff headlines,” Fan said. Crypto continues to track equities tightly, with BTC-SPX correlation near local highs. Fan noted that unless volatility picks up, we’re likely in for “a hot but quiet summer,” albeit one where breakouts can still come from thin air. Meanwhile, at least one trader eyed a break of bitcoin’s $112,000 record highs in the coming weeks. “Bitcoin is well-positioned to break its previous high in July, with upside potential toward $120,000 by month-end. Institutional demand and consistent ETF inflows continue to reinforce bullish momentum,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said in a message to CoinDesk. “Ethereum is also gaining strength, supported by sustained whale accumulation and renewed optimism under a crypto-friendly U.S. administration. ETH could test $3,000 by the end of July, though market volatility remains a factor,” Lee said, adding that the anticipated Fed rate cut in September may serve as a further catalyst.

2025-07-08T05:10:08,"Bitcoin Struggles to Surpass $110,000: But Why? Experts Weigh In on the Latest Developments","Despite topping $111,000 in May, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain higher levels in recent weeks. The slowdown could be due to long-term investors taking profits, according to Tom Lee, director of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “We have clients who bought Bitcoin at $100. Even if Bitcoin goes to $1 million, they’ll probably sell at $100,000,” Lee said on CNBC’s “ETF Edge.” While the Bitcoin price is stuck at psychological resistance levels, other areas of the cryptocurrency market continue to rise. While digital asset infrastructure providers stand out in this process, Coinbase shares in particular experienced their best month since November 2023, rising 40% in June. Coinbase also became the only stock to double its value in the S&P 500 index in the second quarter of 2025, closing its first three-month rise since 2023. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market Factors that contributed to this rise include the Genius Act passed by the US Senate, Circle’s successful IPO, and the growing optimism towards stablecoins. For crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana, which have seen limited price increases throughout the year, investors are turning to alternative methods such as “staking” to make a profit. According to independent ETF expert Dave Nadig, thanks to staking, investors can make significant returns not only from price increases but also by contributing to blockchain networks. “These returns can often be several percentage points higher than classic fixed-income instruments,” he said. Financial giants like BlackRock believe in the growth potential of staking. Speaking to CNBC, Johann Kerbrat, head of Robinhood’s crypto division, said the proliferation of Ethereum and Solana staking services is a significant step towards “mass adoption.” Another notable trend is the preference for ETFs that provide the same exposure, rather than buying crypto assets directly. Nadig comments on this situation as follows: “Let's be realistic, it's much easier and cheaper to buy ETFs.” Nadig added: “Bitcoin has moved from one wallet to another; this new wallet is now ETFs.” *This is not investment advice.

The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $662 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $665 level. A clear move above the $665 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $672. A close above the $672 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $662 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $655 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high.

The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from its BTC sales and acquired over 100,000 ETH, becoming the latest corporate Ethereum treasury firm. “Following a $172 million public equity raise and conversion of its balance sheet from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Bit Digital has accumulated over 100K ETH to become one of the largest corporate treasury companies in the world,” the firm stated on July 7. Ethereum Treasury Firms Growing Prior to the offering, the publicly traded digital asset platform held 24,434 ETH as of March 31. Following the additional ETH acquisitions funded by the net proceeds of the public offerings and the sale of its BTC, the firm has accumulated approximately 100,603 ETH worth around $254 million at current market prices. 0/ Another public-company treasury just went full-ETH. Bit Digital (NASDAQ $BTBT ) sold its entire BTC stack, raised $172mn, and now holds ≈100,603 ETH, vaulting into the top tier of corporate ETH treasuries. — Eric Conner (@econoar) July 7, 2025 “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system,” said Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar, who added: “Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.” He said the firm was aligning itself with Ethereum’s “long-term potential” while positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” Bit Digital has joined the ranks of Joe Lubin’s gaming firm SharpLink and Tom Lee’s Bitmine , which launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury last week. “Tom Lee lit the fuse, Lubin showed the playbook, and Bit Digital just proved scale. ETH-forward treasury strategies are graduating from thesis to trend,” commented former Ethereum developer Eric Conner. ETH Price Reaction As usual, Ethereum prices have not reacted and have gone in the opposite direction again, in line with the wider market retreat today. ETH has declined 2% on the day in a fall to $2,528 at the time of writing. The asset failed to break resistance at $2,600 late last week and has followed the rest of the market into the red this week as US President Donald Trump started dishing out his trade tariff letters.

Strategy currently owns a total of 597,325 BTC — worth over $64 billion — bought at an average price of $70,982 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $42.4 billion. That’s the equivalent of over 2.8% of the flagship crypto’s total supply. Strategy Reports Unrealized Profit Of $14 Billion On BTC In Q2 According to a recent 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Strategy added nearly $7 billion of Bitcoin during Q2. The company reported an unrealized gain of $14.05 billion on its Bitcoin holdings as the price of BTC jumped from around $82,000 to $108,000 during the three months ended June 30. As a result, it also incurred a deferred tax expense of roughly $4.04 billion. Subsequently, Strategy also announced it has signed a sales agreement allowing it to issue and sell up to $4.2 billion of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (known as STRD), at the price of $0.001 per share under a new at-the-market program.

2025-07-08T04:00:53,"$332M Raised! BlockDAG Locks $0.0016 Price Until GLOBAL LAUNCH Release on August 11","Q3 2025 has kicked off with strong energy across the crypto space. Altcoins are picking up steam, the online buzz is growing fast, and new capital is flowing in. In the middle of all this, one project keeps grabbing attention: BlockDAG (BDAG) . With $332 million already raised and over 23.6 billion BDAG coins sold, it’s turning heads as the best crypto to buy now in July. And with the $0.0016 price still in place, this might be the last chance to get in before it climbs. While others wait for a boost, BlockDAG is already moving. Its testnet is live, the community is growing, mining is running strong, and new partnerships are rolling in. The clock is ticking, with the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11. As interest rises, people are rushing to join while the price stays locked. What Makes BlockDAG Stand Out This Month BlockDAG is not a typical blockchain. It’s built on Layer 1 tech that mixes the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure with Proof-of-Work security. That means faster speeds, better scale, and more power than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. But the real excitement comes from what’s already live: A working testnet where developers can build and launch smart contracts and dApps A no-code dApp builder so anyone can launch without coding The X1 Miner App with over 2 million downloads, letting users earn BDAG through gamified mining More than 18,390 ASIC miners have been sold, expanding the hardware network A developer academy built to train new talent Buyer Battles, a fun in-app contest giving away 150 million BDAG daily All of this shows one thing clearly: BlockDAG isn’t waiting to start. It’s already in motion. And at $0.0016, many see this as a short window before the project goes public and prices rise. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, July could be the moment to act. Sports Deals Push BlockDAG Into the Spotlight In July, BlockDAG grabbed attention in both crypto and sports by teaming up with two big U.S. teams. It’s now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby champions) and the Seattle Orcas (a strong Major League Cricket team). These aren’t just for show. The deals include NFTs, fan tokens, shared social content, and behind-the-scenes videos with players. For BlockDAG, it’s a way to connect with millions of sports fans and bring them into Web3 using real, interactive digital tools. Even bigger news is that a large U.S. sponsorship deal is signed and waiting for regulatory clearance. Details haven’t been shared yet, but this could be one of the most important crypto partnerships to date. With cricket’s 2.5 billion fans and rugby’s global following, the timing couldn’t be better. Countdown to August 11 and What Comes Next Right now, the presale price is fixed at $0.0016 until August 11. That’s the final day for this rate. After that, the offer ends and a new price will be set. Whether you’re new to crypto or have been here for years, this is one of the last windows to join before the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. What’s coming in the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release hasn’t been shared. The team is keeping it quiet for now, likely due to regulation and strategy. But looking at past crypto launches, the community is expecting big shifts in how people can access and use BDAG. BlockDAG’s presale is already one of the largest ever, passing past launches like Filecoin, Tezos, and Polkadot. With over 200,000 holders and fast-growing interest, the excitement is real. Online chatter across Twitter, Telegram, and forums keeps rising, driven by the fixed price and the coming launch date. So far, BlockDAG has raised more than $332 million and is aiming for $600 million. This isn’t just another early-stage project. It could be one of the leading Layer 1 networks of the decade. BlockDAG’s Low $0.0016 Price Entry Ends August 11 When you look at the best crypto to buy now in July , it’s no longer about hype. The focus is on which project is showing real progress. BlockDAG is not only gaining momentum, it’s turning that into users, deals, and working products. The current $0.0016 price, active until August 11, is seen by many as the last chance to join before the next stage begins. With a $600 million target, 2 million+ X1 app users mining daily, over 18,390 ASIC units sold, and two U.S. sports teams signed on, BlockDAG has built a working setup that few others can match. This is not just a coin launch. It’s a full working system, growing fast, and ready for the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release. July might be the final moment to step in before everything shifts.

2025-07-08T04:00:10,"Bitcoin Traders Are Betting Against the Rally, Will It Backfire?","Bitcoin has continued to trade within a tight range just below its previous all-time high, showing recent signs of upward movement but falling short of reclaiming its peak price. The asset recorded a seven-day high of $110,307, but it has since cooled, with current trading levels around $108,311, representing a slight 0.3% drop over the last 24 hours. While the broader market maintains cautious optimism, several indicators suggest that market participants remain split on where Bitcoin is headed next. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So Bitcoin Shorts Increase on Binance Despite Price Climb Despite the price strength seen in recent days, certain signals hint at increasing friction between bullish price action and bearish positioning from traders. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, Bitcoin’s rise is being met with a counterintuitive decline in funding rates on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume. This trend could play a crucial role in shaping short-term market behavior. BorisVest noted that as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000 to $110,000 range, funding rates on Binance have gradually declined. This suggests that a significant number of traders are taking short positions—essentially betting that Bitcoin’s rally will soon reverse. The analyst explained that this behavior indicates skepticism about the sustainability of the recent price gains, particularly among retail and leverage-focused traders. “The declining funding rates show that users on Binance are increasingly shorting Bitcoin,” he explained. “This dynamic often creates forced exits as short positions come under pressure, leading to liquidations or forced margin increases. These events can further propel upward price movement as positions get closed out automatically.” Given Binance’s dominance in trading volume, BorisVest emphasized that its funding rate trend serves as a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. If current positioning continues, the market may see a short squeeze, which could accelerate Bitcoin’s momentum toward new highs. On-Chain Metric Flags Caution as NVT Golden Cross Edges Higher While futures market dynamics are drawing attention, on-chain data is also showing signs worth monitoring. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlighted the movement of Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross metric, a tool used to assess market value in relation to on-chain transaction volume. This metric has historically signaled local tops when it moves above specific thresholds. In his analysis, Kesmeci pointed out that the NVT Golden Cross successfully identified three prior short-term peaks in 2025, each followed by corrections ranging from 9% to over 20%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High? The metric currently sits at 1.98, below the 2.2 threshold that has often indicated overheated market conditions, but is trending upward. “While the current level isn’t yet in the danger zone,” Kesmeci wrote, “its upward trajectory could be an early warning that price momentum is beginning to overextend.” However, the analyst cautioned against interpreting the signal as immediately bearish. In previous cases, the NVT Golden Cross remained elevated for several days before a correction followed. This behavior may instead point to continued strength among bulls, at least in the medium term, even if a near-term pullback remains possible.
