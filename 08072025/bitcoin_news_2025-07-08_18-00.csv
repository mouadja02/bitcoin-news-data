2025-07-08T15:49:56,"CRO rallied by over 18% on the news of ETF inclusion","The price of Cronos (CRO) went vertical after the asset was mentioned in the new ETF filing portfolio. Truth Social, Trump’s media company, filed for a new blue chip ETF, combining BTC, ETH, XRP, and CRO. CRO rallied by over 18% on the news of its inclusion in the upcoming ETF by Truth Social. It turned into the top trending token during the relatively slow summer market. CRO became the hottest token for the day, rallying to a one-week high with over 18% in daily gains. | Source: Coingecko The Trump media company announced a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a new Blue Chip ETF. The filing arrives just days after Truth Social announced it started the process for its first ETF, combining BTC and ETH. The actual launch of the ETF depends on regulatory approval, and we are still awaiting a 19b-4 filing with the SEC. The ETF will eventually start trading on NYSE Arca, sponsored by Yorkville America Digital. CRO rises on news of custody service for the ETF The CRO token, native to the Crypto.com platform, rallied by over 15% within hours to trade at $0.094, a one-week peak. CRO rallied after months of sideways trading based on its inclusion in the ETF. The asset has relatively niche markets, lacking a Binance listing. Instead, CRO relies on Upbit and Bitget for the bulk of its trading volumes. CRO will have a 5% weight in the ETF, where BTC will carry 70% of the value, with 15% for ETH, 8$ for SOL, and only 2% for XRP. Despite this, the Crypto.com ecosystem will be key for the new blue-chip fund. SOL and XRP did not react to the news, as their markets were much more liquid. The CRO market is also an anomaly, as the token relies on the Korean won for over 47% of its trading activity. Over 25% of CRO trading is against the US dollar, with another 22% against USDT. In addition to using CRO as part of the ETF basket, Crypto.com would serve as a custodian for all crypto assets. With this move, Truth Social breaks the usual format of ETF custody, which often relies on the Coinbase infrastructure of cold wallets. The platform, which offers a mix of services, including a wallet, payment cards, Web3 services, trading, and even stock investments, will be part of the ETF strategy. The platform will be the prime execution agent for crypto trades, as well as a staking and liquidity provider. Truth Social partnered with Cronos back in March Trump Media Group announced its partnership with Cronos and the Crypto.com ecosystem back in March. The social media company mentioned plans for launching an ETF, though the role of Crypto.com has only become clearer. The choice of CRO as an ETF asset follows the moves of World Liberty Fi to partner with relatively old crypto projects. Cronos and Crypto.com raised doubts after deciding to re-issue 70% of the supply, despite the previous claims that the tokens would be burned forever. Trump’s crypto company, World Liberty Fi, does not own any CRO in its portfolio, as it focuses mostly on the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the token’s rapid market reaction raised skepticism and doubts about potential insider trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-08T15:49:02,"Is $1 Still Possible for Dogecoin (DOGE)? Experts Tip a Newcomer With Real-World Utility to Outperform","The post Is $1 Still Possible for Dogecoin (DOGE)? Experts Tip a Newcomer With Real-World Utility to Outperform appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) blasted from $0.166 to $0.173 on July 6, its best hourly jump in weeks. As fans cheer a possible march back to the one-dollar line, analysts are also whispering about Remittix (RTX) , a little-known payments token now racing toward a key funding goal. Both coins offer upside, but the ways they plan to get there could not be more different. Whale Wave Pushes DOGE Toward Breakout Source: tradingview Fresh on-chain data shows that giant wallets holding one to one-hundred million DOGE scooped up millions of coins during the spike, while smaller traders trimmed positions. This transfer of supply tightens the float and often leads to stronger price swings later. Technically, DOGE is coiling inside a falling-wedge pattern, a setup that can explode when volume returns. A clean daily close above $0.175 would open a sprint to $0.25, the first checkpoint on any trip to a dollar. Drop under $0.16, however, and the bullish script unravels fast. Federal Reserve Hopes Lift Sentiment Dogecoin’s pop isn’t happening in a vacuum. U.S. officials just added three extra weeks to tariff talks, cooling global trade worries. Traders also expect next week’s consumer-price report to show softer inflation. If that happens, the Federal Reserve could hint at rate cuts, giving risk assets like crypto more room to run. Bitcoin already hovers near $110,000; a breakout there usually drags DOGE along for the ride. A hotter inflation print, though, could send all boats lower, trapping meme-coin bulls mid-wedge. Remittix: Turning Crypto Into Cash in Seconds While DOGE leans on macro news and whale wallets, Remittix focuses on something far more practical: moving money. Its coming PayFi wallet, slated for release later this year, will let anyone swap Bitcoin, Ether or XRP into local bank deposits in about ten seconds. There are no weekend delays, no hidden exchange spreads and transfer fees are just fractions of a cent. Every single swap permanently burns a slice of RTX, shrinking supply as the network grows. That built-in scarcity is attracting serious notice: over $16 million has already been raised at $0.0811 per token and the team is sprinting toward an $18 million soft-cap finish. During this final push, new supporters can still claim a 50 percent bonus allocation, making today’s effective entry roughly five cents. Beyond the numbers, two global payout corridors one aimed at Southeast Asia, another at Latin America are lined up for launch right after the wallet goes live. If even a sliver of the $190-trillion global payments market flows through Remittix, daily burns will tighten circulation quickly, giving long-term holders an automatic boost without hype tweets or mascot memes. Conclusion: Two Very Different Moonshots Dogecoin’s path to $1 depends on continued whale buying and a string of friendly macro headlines. If those pieces stay in place, the meme king could rediscover its magic. Remittix, on the other hand, offers a real-world service that slashes costs and time for everyday payments and rewards token holders every time someone clicks “Send.” For investors weighing hype against hard utility, RTX may prove the quieter but smarter play for 2025 and beyond.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake’s Latest Track—Details According to trading data, its price shot from under $10 to a whopping $80 within hours, pushing its fully diluted valuation to nearly $75 billion. But by July 2025, TRUMP had tumbled back to $8.60, a 90% drop from its peak. Its circulating market cap now sits around $1.70 billion, with a fully diluted value of about $8.60 billion. Cross Chain Push Into Tron Based on reports from the project’s official X account, TRUMP plans its first expansion beyond Solana by launching on the Tron blockchain. This move is designed to tap Tron’s large user base and faster transaction speeds. Tron boasts over 100 million accounts and sub‑second confirmations, which the TRUMP team believes could fuel a fresh wave of buyers and traders. $TRUMP on #TRON is coming. Stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/S5WfV8APvU — TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) July 7, 2025 Volatile Price Swings Define TRUMP TRUMP’s rollercoaster debut underlines extreme volatility. After the initial frenzy in January, the coin’s price plummeted by 88% from $80 to $8.60. That slide erased roughly $65 billion in valuation. Today’s price reflects speculative trading rather than any long‑term adoption. Investors who rode the peak saw massive gains briefly, then steep losses just as quickly. Justin Sun’s Big Stake On May 20, 2025, Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he is TRUMP’s largest holder. He reportedly owns nearly $19 million worth of tokens after a $75 million investment in Trump’s World Liberty Financial platform. Sun’s position comes with perks. He won a “private dinner” alongside the top 220 token holders, securing a seat at US President Donald Trump’s Virginia golf club. Critics say that kind of setup blurs the line between crypto hype and pay‑to‑play politics. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Central Control Raises Warnings Two Trump‑affiliated companies, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, control 80% of TRUMP’s token supply. Those tokens are locked under a three‑year vesting schedule. Analysts warn that when insiders hold such large shares, they can sway prices at will. That level of centralization runs counter to crypto’s promise of open and fair systems. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley have called for new rules to curb how politicians and their allies can launch or endorse digital coins. They argue that projects like TRUMP could be used for personal gain or campaign boosts, creating a need for clearer boundaries. Traders And Regulators Brace For Tron Launch As TRUMP eyes a Tron debut, traders and regulators alike will watch closely. The move could spark a fresh surge in trading volume. Yet the same factors that drove its initial spike—viral hype, insider perks, and a heavy token concentration—could just as easily lead to another steep plunge.

2025-07-08T15:28:31,"Pakistan Creates Digital Assets Regulator PVARA to Oversee Crypto Industry","Pakistan formally established the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) to oversee the country’s rapidly growing digital assets ecosystem, marking a significant shift in policy from its previous stance against cryptocurrencies . According to a report from Dawn , the federal cabinet has approved the creation of PVARA as an independent regulator for licensing, monitoring, and supervising virtual asset service providers, in alignment with the Financial Action Task Force guidelines. Notably, the regulatory framework emerged after Pakistan’s ambitious digital transformation agenda gained momentum throughout 2025. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chairs the Pakistan Crypto Council, which enlisted former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor as strategic advisors to shape the country’s regulatory outlook. Regulatory body formed to oversee digital assets in Pakistan https://t.co/BXSQsx244v — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 8, 2025 Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers while announcing its first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also elevated Bilal Bin Saqib to the position of Special Assistant for Blockchain and Crypto , granting him ministerial status to oversee the development of the sector. The regulatory shift comes as Pakistan emerges as one of the most promising frontier markets for digital assets, with over 40 million crypto users and an estimated $300 billion in annual trading volume.

The Pakistan Crypto Council consists of key institutional stakeholders, including the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, the State Bank governor, and federal secretaries from the Law and Information Technology divisions, ensuring a whole-of-government approach to digital asset regulation. IMF Resistance Challenges Power Allocation Plans Recently, the International Monetary Fund rejected Pakistan’s proposal to offer subsidized electricity tariffs for crypto mining operations , warning the plan could strain the power sector. The Pakistan government is still engaged with international institutions to refine its proposal to offer subsidised electricity tariffs for crypto mining, after IMF rejected its proposal. #IMF #Pakistan #BitcoinMining https://t.co/DOIm2pNGV7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan confirmed that the IMF has expressed concerns about market distortions and the effects on resource distribution. The Fund questioned the legality of cryptocurrency mining in Pakistan and the additional strain it would put on the already burdened power grid. The IMF noted Pakistan failed to consult the agency ahead of the 2,000MW allocation announcement, seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. Pakistan faces chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, with the IMF warning about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs. Officials involved in negotiations expressed concerns about “ further tough talks ” as the economic team faces tough questions over the initiative. Despite IMF resistance, Pakistan continues to pursue its crypto ambitions through diplomatic channels. U.S. President Trump expressed keen interest in cryptocurrency during a White House lunch with Pakistan Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, discussing economic development and emerging technologies. PVARA will oversee public protection mechanisms, anti-money laundering protocols, and cyber risk mitigation across all virtual asset transactions.

2025-07-08T15:17:27,"Tether’s Crystal Intelligence stake adds teeth to stablecoin surveillance push","With law enforcement lagging and users losing billions of dollars to crypto-related scams every year, Tether’s new investment raises a provocative question: are stablecoin firms now the first line of defense? On July 8, USDT issuer Tether announced a strategic investment in Crystal Intelligence, a blockchain forensics firm specializing in fraud detection, risk mapping and regulatory compliance. The deal, undisclosed in size, cements a growing partnership between two firms already collaborating on scam-alert infrastructure and global investigations into illicit crypto flows. For Tether ( USDT ), it amplifies ongoing efforts to combat illicit stablecoin activity, reinforcing tools already used by law enforcement to track and freeze suspicious transactions. By deepening its ties to Crystal, Tether signals a broader shift: Stablecoin issuers, once passive payment rails, are now actively shaping crypto’s security infrastructure. “With the latest in advanced intelligence tools, like those being developed by Crystal Intelligence, we are enhancing our ability to assist authorities in tracing the movement of funds in real time,” Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether said. “This strategic investment will strengthen our capacity to collaborate more effectively and reinforce a clear message: USD₮ is the digital dollar for the people, bad actors will be stopped.” Read more: Semiconductor giant Sequans ditches cash for Bitcoin in $384m treasury overhaul Why Tether is betting big on blockchain forensics Tether’s aggressive push into blockchain surveillance is more about survival than optics. A January 2025 UN report singled out USDT as the “preferred choice” for money launderers and scammers across Southeast Asia, citing its stability and pseudonymous transactions as ideal for illicit flows. Yet that same report contained an inconvenient truth for crypto critics: Less than 1% of all cryptocurrency transactions fund criminal activity. The contradiction underscores Tether’s dilemma. As the world’s most traded crypto asset, with $61.9 billion in daily volume as of press time, dwarfing even Bitcoin ( BTC ), USDT has become both a pillar of crypto markets and a lightning rod for regulators. When nearly 60% of all crypto trades involve Tether, its integrity isn’t just a compliance issue; it’s the linchpin holding together decentralized finance’s liquidity. Since the UN’s rebuke, Tether has gone on the offensive. Its collaboration with the DOJ in June to seize $225 million from pig-butchering rings demonstrated a tangible counterstrike. Now, by investing in Crystal’s forensic tools, Tether is addressing the surveillance gap that regulators have struggled to fill. The strategy serves dual purposes: It disrupts criminal networks exploiting USDT while preempting regulatory crackdowns that could destabilize the stablecoin’s $158.7 billion ecosystem. When law enforcement lacks resources to track cross-border crypto crime, Tether’s real-time freezing capabilities, which are used in 55 jurisdictions, have effectively made the company a private-sector sheriff. With the latest investment, Tether appears to be doubling down on forensic infrastructure before mandates force its hand. With $2.7 billion already frozen and scams proliferating, the message is clear: USDT’s future hinges on being the cleanest dirty shirt in crypto’s laundry.

Alongside these established players, Ozak AI ($OZ) is emerging as a utility-driven presale contender, drawing attention with its focus on AI-powered blockchain applications and a growing presale valuation. Currently in the fourth stage of its presale, the $OZ token is priced at $0.005 per token. The project has already secured over $1.30 million in contributions by selling more than 21.48 million tokens. The presale began at $0.001 in Phase 1 and moved through $0.002 and $0.003 in Phases 2 and 3, respectively. With the $OZ token price doubling to $0.01 in the upcoming phase and a projected listing price of $0.05, early investors could see a potential return on investment of nearly 20,000% if the token reaches its long-term $1 target. With a capped supply of 10 billion $OZ tokens, the presale is structured to increase token scarcity ahead of exchange listings. This design aligns with current market interest in projects with limited supply and defined utility. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Bitcoin, SEI, and Solana Show Strength Amid Market Optimism Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, continues to solidify its dominance, currently trading near $107,386. This momentum is supported by a surge in institutional adoption, with Bitcoin ETFs witnessing over $3.9 billion in net inflows in the last fortnight alone. This influx underscores growing confidence among major investors and institutional players, contributing to Bitcoin’s sustained price stability and market leadership. Sei (SEI) also stands out as a dynamic altcoin this week, trading close to $0.27. The token’s recent price stability follows significant developments, including its selection for Wyoming’s pioneering dollar stablecoin pilot program, alongside anticipation of an upcoming version 2 airdrop. These factors have reinforced investor confidence and heightened interest in Sei’s potential as a next-generation blockchain platform. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) remains a key player in the altcoin space, with prices hovering around $144. Analysts highlight that Solana is testing critical resistance levels near $146 to $151, bolstered by optimistic market sentiment tied to pending ETF approvals from major asset managers like Invesco and Galaxy Digital. These developments could pave the way for a potential breakout, reaffirming Solana’s position among top smart contract platforms. Utility Framework Supports AI-Based Financial Analytics Ozak AI operates as a blockchain-based solution provider, utilizing AI tools for data analytics and financial predictions. Its core components include the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data flow, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) for on-chain connectivity, and Ozak Data Vaults to ensure secure data handling. Additionally, its proprietary AI Prediction Agents are built to enhance business and trading decision-making processes. The project’s ecosystem is designed to offer real-world use cases, separating it from speculative or meme-based tokens. With predictive AI tools, Ozak AI aims to support financial institutions, crypto traders, and enterprise users in leveraging timely and accurate analytics. This utility-driven approach is reflected in the presale interest and aligns with broader investor sentiment favoring practical blockchain solutions during this month’s market activities. Price Target and Market Visibility Ahead of Exchange Listings Projections from market analysts indicate that Ozak AI could potentially reach a token value of $1 by 2025. At this price point, the fully diluted market capitalization would stand at $10 billion, comparable to several established AI-powered blockchain entities. These estimates are based on the project’s capped supply model, active development roadmap, and strategic presale structure. Its listing on tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has since enhanced its visibility, further adding to the growing investor interest in light of July Altcoin Week. Discussing BTC, SEI, and SOL, Ozak AI represents the members of this cohort and demonstrates the level of interest in implementing AI in decentralized systems. Ozak AI also operates a 1 million dollar giveaway scheme, which is aimed at the first 100 participants who carry out a promotional exercise. The move is set to boost interaction further in the community before its token launch and subsequent listing on a centralized exchange (CEX).

Bitchat would operate over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing nearby devices to form a mesh network that relays messages hop-by-hop, according to the whitepaper published on Sunday . When a message is sent, it would travel across nearby devices acting as temporary nodes until it reaches its recipient, making it resilient in offline or censored environments. Messages are end-to-end encrypted using Curve25519 and AES-GCM, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them. The protocol does not collect metadata, user identities are obfuscated and messages vanish by default after delivery unless explicitly saved by the user. While not making explicit references to Bitcoin, cryptocurrency or blockchain, Dorsey describes Bitchat as a ""decentralized, peer-to-peer messaing application,"" evoking connections to the Bitcoin whitepaper's intro in which it is described as a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash."" Much like Bitcoin eliminates reliance on centralized intermediaries in finance, Bitchat could remove central authorities from digital communication.

2025-07-08T15:00:55,"Truth Social Goes Full Crypto—SEC Considers Trump-Linked ETF Filing","US regulators have kicked off the formal review of a new spot‑crypto fund. Investors won’t know for sure if it clears the hurdles until the US Securities and Exchange Commission makes a final call. But the filing itself signals growing acceptance of directly held crypto products. ETF Application Sparks Interest According to the SEC filing , Trump Media’s Truth Social unit wants an ETF listed on NYSE Arca with 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ether. Yorkville America Digital would sponsor the fund, while Foris DAX Trust Company—Crypto.com’s custody arm—would hold the coins. US President Donald Trump’s team submitted the S‑1 form on June 16, starting what is likely a 45‑day review clock. Custody And Valuation Rules Based on reports, the fund would value Bitcoin each trading day using the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate. Ether would use the CME CF Ether rate, unless the sponsor chooses another source. Private keys for both assets would sit in a cold wallet, kept separate from customer accounts. That setup aims to address long‑standing worries over hacks, theft and tangled custody failures. A Crowd Of Competing Bids Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have filed pure‑Bitcoin ETF applications. Some firms are eyeing Ether‑only funds. Now a dual‑asset product is in the mix. If the SEC finalizes its planned “automated” listing framework, reviews could shrink from many months to a few. That rule would standardize disclosures, custody standards and market‑integrity checks for all spot‑crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s spot‑Solana ETF hit another delay . The SEC pushed back its March 25 application and opened a new public‑comment window—21 days for feedback, 35 days for replies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart called this hold‑up “expected,” noting it shows the agency is still fine‑tuning data and disclosures before any approvals. What Comes Next For Investors Now the ball is in the SEC’s court. Regulators can sign off, send back comments or reject the bid. If leadership keeps up the push for faster, automated reviews, spot‑crypto ETFs might reach market this year. Until then, every move—from amendment requests to public comments—will matter for funds backed by Bitcoin, Ether and beyond. ETF Race Intensifies At stake is more than branding. Fees, trading speed and trust in custody will shape which funds win big money. And sponsors will need muscle to stand out in a growing field of nearly 10 proposals. Investors should keep a close eye on filings and deadlines to know when to act. The race launched with Trump Media’s Truth Social filing, and it may well end—with approval or denial—under its banner. Truth Social’s entry has put a fresh spin on the push for regulated crypto products.

2025-07-08T14:51:16,"Bitcoin ETFs Thrive, Just 1 Outflow in 17 Days: Santiment","Santiment has revealed that the Bitcoin ETF streak is still going strong, with only one day of outflows recorded in the last 17 trading days. This comes as analysts say the steady stream of money into the investment vehicles is helping drive Bitcoin prices higher. Sustained ETF Demand According to data shared by Santiment on X, since June 6, there has only been one day with more money leaving than coming into these products. The market intelligence platform also said that this ongoing trend is a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. As of July 7, information from Farside Investors shows that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net flow of $216.5 million across all issuers. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $164.6 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s (FBTC) with $66 million. ARK Invest’s (ARKB) and Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of $10.1 million and $10.2 million, while other ETFs, including Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, recorded no activity for the day. This follows a major net outflow of approximately $342 million experienced on July 1, which marked the first negative movement since June 6. Before this, there had been a 15-day streak that had brought in nearly $4.7 billion. This period of sustained demand had also pushed cumulative net inflows to about $49 billion and total ETF assets under management (AUM) to above $131 billion. Bullish Price Predictions So far, spot Bitcoin ETFs have brought in over $14.4 billion this year, including $4.5 billion just in July. Fueled by increased institutional demand, Bitcoin’s price outlook for July 2025 has turned increasingly bullish as analysts project fresh highs based on the record ETF inflows. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, has projected a rise in Bitcoin’s price to $116,000. He identified strong capital injection into spot Bitcoin ETFs as the main driver behind the outlook. “These flows are increasingly outpacing price action, signaling institutional demand driven more by macro concerns than short-term momentum,” he said. On June 30, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and head of research Ryan Rasmussen published a report confirming their $200,000 price target for Bitcoin in 2025. They pointed to historical trends, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $112,000 in May, supported by record ETF inflows. The report also highlighted increasing interest from Bitcoin treasury companies and the formation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve as bullish factors. Hougan and Rasmussen showed further confidence in strong ETF inflows continuing into the second half of the year.

Donald Trump’s Truth Social brand firm is expanding its crypto exposure with a new ‘blue chip’ ETF. On Tuesday, July 8, Trump Media and Technology filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 for a multi-asset crypto ETF. Pending U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the fund will include a 70% Bitcoin (BTC) and a 15% Ethereum (ETH) allocation, and will also feature three prominent altcoins. Specifically, it will have an 8% Solana (SOL) allocation, 5% for Cronos (CRO) , and 2% in XRP (XRP) . The Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, B.T., will be structured as a Nevada business trust and issue its shares on the NYSE Arca. Crypto.com, the issuer of Cronos, will act as the digital custodian for the ETF’s assets. It will also serve as the prime execution agent, as well as the staking and liquidity provider.

The fund with the two most popular crypto assets will likely appeal to more risk-averse investors. Crypto.com will also serve as a custodian for this fund. The filings come as the U.S. takes a more friendly approach to crypto regulation. On July 1, reports came out that the SEC is planning to fast-track regulatory approvals for crypto ETFs. In talks with major crypto exchanges, the agency discussed enabling issuers to just file a form S-1 and wait for the required 75 days. If the SEC implements this change, Truth Social’s ETFs may already have done all that is required to get approval. Still, the SEC may require further changes to the filings.

It does this by building a second layer (called Layer-2) on top of Bitcoin using Solana’s powerful technology (SVM). This enables super-fast transactions at a cost of as little as $0.01 while also making it possible to utilize Bitcoin in various applications, including DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and online payments. Crucially, the project supports DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and merchant payments, bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed. Its canonical bridge also allows users to lock BTC and mint HYPER tokens, to facilitate seamless DeFi participation. This crypto presales roadmap includes cross-chain interoperability and a mainnet launch by Q4 2025, positioning it as a top contender for investors eyeing Bitcoin’s evolution. Launched in early 2025, this first Bitcoin layer 2 chain project has already raised over $2 million in its presale, and its token, called $HYPER, is currently priced at $0.012175 per token. For those who want to jump on the bandwagon, it can be bought in exchange for ETH, USDT, or BNB; it can also be bought directly through a debit or credit card. Early investors interested in this crypto can stake their tokens to earn high rewards of over 300% APY. These features convinced many analysts and crypto investors that Bitcoin Hyper might be the next 100x crypto. Take note that Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contracts have been audited, and most of the token supply is being sold during the presale, which adds to its credibility. With big companies like BlackRock now investing in Bitcoin, a project like Bitcoin Hyper, which is focused on improving Bitcoin’s speed and usefulness, could be one of the best crypto presales to invest in this month.

This real utility non-custodial crypto wallet is designed to be secure, easy to use, and supports over 60 blockchains. With this wallet, users can swap tokens, bridge assets between chains, and even use a privacy mode to hide their private keys. The project is focused on privacy, and you don’t need to do any KYC (know your customer checks) to use it. Presently, $BEST is priced at just $0.025295 in its fifth presale stage, and it has already raised over $13.7 million, which makes it among the top crypto presales of the year. $BEST token holders get real benefits, like lower trading fees, staking rewards, early access to new token presales, and a say in the project’s future through voting. A beta version of the app is expected to launch after it lists on major exchanges like MEXC. The team behind Best Wallet has worked at top tech companies, and the project has been audited by CertiK, making it more trustworthy. It’s also certified by WalletConnect, which adds to its credibility. Looking ahead, if Best Wallet delivers its promised features on time, $BEST could be a great long-term investment, especially for mobile users, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy now. Visit Best Wallet TOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a fun, meme-based new crypto project. $T6900 was inspired by the wild success of SPX6900 in 2024, and it was built to make fun of traditional finance and big corporations. This crypto project has no serious roadmap or complicated plan, just community hype, humor, and a strong meme culture. The project has already raised over $207,000 in its presale, with tokens selling for $0.006475. 80% of the total supply is available to the public, and the hard cap is set at $5 million. Unlike utility-driven projects, TOKEN6900 leans into “vibe liquidity,” offering no roadmap but audited contracts and a developer’s 6,900-token “moonbag” which will be locked for five years to build trust. There’s also a staking feature called the “Brain Rot Vault” that offers a high percentage of over 200% APY, and over 20.7 million tokens have already been staked. Investors can purchase $T6900 using ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or directly through credit cards via the Best Wallet platform, with tokens distributed post-presale. While its transparency and staking rewards are strengths, the absence of real-world use cases means success depends on market sentiment and meme coin trends. So, for investors interested in high-risk, high-reward cryptos, TOKEN6900 is certainly a good investment choice to buy in July 2025. Visit TOKEN6900 SUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform SUBBD ($SUBBD) is an AI-powered Web3 platform that helps content creators use AI to make and share content like voice notes, videos, and personal profiles. Over 3,500 creators with a combined audience of 310 million people are already involved and using the platform. The project is built to help creators connect more deeply with their fans and earn rewards for doing so. Its token, $SUBBD, powers the platform and is now available through an ongoing presale at a discounted price of $0.05585 per token. To date, the project has raised over $754,000. Holders of the $SUBBD token get access to special perks like staking rewards (20% APY), early access to new features, and platform discounts. To help keep the token price steady, SUBBD uses anti-dumping measures such as gradual token releases. The project also plans to fully launch in Q3 2025 and is working with well-known creators to grow its reach. The team includes people with experience at top companies like OpenAI and Google, which helps build trust. Overall, SUBBD stands out because it solves a real problem in the creator space and has a huge potential audience. However, building all of its AI tools might take time. If you’re thinking about investing, it’s a good idea to read their whitepaper and follow SUBBD on Telegram and X (Twitter) for updates on recent developments, and visit the official SUBBD page below. Visit SUBBD BTC Bull - Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale BTC Bull provides investors with a token that offers leveraged exposure to Bitcoin's price movements, aiming to amplify gains during bullish trends. Essentially, BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a meme token designed to follow Bitcoin’s price movements, giving investors an excellent way to take advantage of the BTC bullish uptrend. It rewards holders with real Bitcoin airdrops when Bitcoin reaches big milestones like $150K, $200K, and $250K. The token is currently in its final presale stage, having raised over $8.3 million to date. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at $0.002585 per token, and it can be bought in exchange for crypto or through a bank card on the BTC Bull official page. Much like Bitcoin, the total supply is 21 billion tokens, and to keep the token valuable, the team plans to burn 15% of the supply when Bitcoin hits $125K, $175K, and $225K. The token is built on Ethereum (ERC-20), so it works with most wallets and DeFi platforms. You can also earn a passive income of over 50% APY through staking. This crypto presale, whose success heavily depends on Bitcoin’s performance, ends on July 7, 2025, at 2 PM UTC. Also, BTC Bull’s smart contracts have been audited, and its token plan is clear, which helps reduce the risk of scam, making it an excellent crypto to buy right now Visit BTC Bull Snorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot Snorter Token powers a Telegram-native bot for sniping meme coins, with multi-chain support and high staking rewards. This exciting crypto project fuels a Telegram-based trading bot for sniping meme coins on Solana and Ethereum, with plans to expand to BNB, Polygon, and Base. The token is currently priced at $0.0973 in its presale, and the team has already raised over $1.4 million so far. Snorter offers cool features like automated sniping, a tool that detects rug pulls with 85% success (based on beta testing), and low trading fees of just 0.85%. Stakers can earn over 700% APY, and token holders get unlimited snipes plus voting power on future updates. As a result, price expectations for this token are huge, with some analysts predicting a significant increase by the end of the year. With over 5,000 users on Telegram and exchange listings planned after the bot launches in Q3 2025, Snorter aims to become a top tool for meme coin traders, making it one of the best crypto presales to consider in July 2025. Visit Snorter How Can You Buy a Crypto Presale? Here’s a step-by-step procedure on how you can buy a crypto presale; 1. Research: Start by visiting the project’s official website and then proceed to read the whitepaper to understand what the project is about, its goals, token supply, and how it plans to grow. You should also check their social media, like X (Twitter) and Telegram, to see what the community is saying and how active the team is. 2. Set Up a Wallet: You’ll need a crypto wallet that works with the blockchain the project is built on. For example, use MetaMask for Ethereum-based tokens like $BTCBULL, or Phantom for Solana-based tokens like $HYPER. Some projects also support Best Wallet, particularly for presales that utilize multiple payment options. 3. Fund Your Wallet: Buy the cryptocurrency you’ll need to invest using popular cryptos like ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT, or USDC. You can buy crypto on trusted exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, or even use a credit or debit card directly through some presale sites. 4. Connect and Purchase: Connect your wallet to the presale platform and follow the instructions to buy tokens. 5. Confirm and Secure Tokens: After you approve the transaction, you may need to wait for the tokens to be delivered because some projects send them after the presale ends. Furthermore, always keep your wallet’s recovery phrase (seed phrase) safe and never share it with anyone. This is because this phrase gives full access to your wallet, so store it offline in a secure place. What Should You Check Before Investing in a Crypto Presale The following are some of the things you should check before investing in a crypto presale; Whitepaper The whitepaper is like the project’s blueprint. It explains what the project is trying to do, how it works, how the token will be used, and what the future plans are. So, one of the first things you should do before investing in a crypto presale is to read the project’s white paper. Team Credibility Another thing you should check/do before investing in a crypto presale is to verify the team’s experience via LinkedIn or public profiles. For example, SUBBD’s team includes people with backgrounds at OpenAI and Google, which adds trust to the project. On the other hand, if the team is anonymous, be extra cautious and avoid investing. Smart Contract Audits Ensure contracts are audited by firms like CertiK or Hacken, as seen with BTC Bull and Snorter, to reduce rug-pull risks. Community Engagement A strong, active community is a good sign. So, before you invest, look at how many people are following the project on X (Twitter), Telegram, or Discord. Tokenomics and Vesting Tokenomics means how the tokens are created, distributed, and used. Look at how many tokens will exist, who gets them, and how they’re released over time before you invest in any crypto presale. Market Fit and Utility Is the project actually useful, or just hype? Bitcoin Hyper solves Bitcoin’s speed issues, and SUBBD helps content creators use AI. These real-world uses give the project more staying power compared to purely speculative meme coins. Look at the Presale’s Performance Check how much money the project has raised and how much attention it’s getting online. A presale that raises millions and builds buzz on social media often shows strong investor interest. You can also follow updates on sites like CoinMarketCap, ICOBench, or crypto news platforms. Final Word In summary, crypto presales in July 2025 offer a diverse mix of exciting new projects, catering to investors with varying interests. Whether you’re interested in serious utility projects like Bitcoin Hyper and SUBBD or high-risk, high-reward meme tokens like TOKEN6900 and BTC Bull, there’s something for every type of investor. However, it’s essential to remember that presales also come with risks, as prices can fluctuate rapidly, and not all projects will ultimately succeed. That’s why doing your own research is very important. Always read the whitepaper, check if the smart contracts are audited, and look at how active the community is. If you take time to understand the project and only invest what you can afford to lose, presales can be a great way to get in early and see big rewards.

2025-07-08T14:30:58,"$26,501,817,432 in Bitcoin Gobbled Up by Public Companies and Exchange-Traded Funds in Q2 of 2025, According to Analyst","Public companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have acquired Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth tens of billions of dollars in just three months, according to the founder of The Kobeissi Letter, Adam Kobeissi. The macro analyst tells the 938,700 followers of The Kobeissi Letter on the social media platform X that the corporate demand for Bitcoin is “incredibly strong.” According to Kobeissi, public companies and ETFs acquired a combined 242,766 BTC in the quarter that ended on June 30th. “Public companies purchased 131,355 Bitcoins in Q2 2025, growing holdings by +18%, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Furthermore, ETFs acquired 111,411 BTC, posting an +8% rise during the same period. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which companies have bought more Bitcoin than ETFs. Year-to-date, public companies have purchased 237,664 Bitcoin… Now, public companies hold ~855,000 Bitcoin, or ~4% of the total supply. Corporate demand for Bitcoin is incredibly strong.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X As companies and ETFs gobble up Bitcoin at a rapid pace, the pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader, DonAlt, is warning investors that he doesn’t see the accumulation ending well for BTC. But for now, he notes that it might be a good idea to be cautiously bullish on Bitcoin. “To me this is very clear, right? Like this is a clear kind of Ponzi/bubble forming. And it’s really hard to be bullish into that, right? Because you know like, ‘Hey, this is going to implode.’ Like you know how this is going to end. Everyone knows how it’s going to end. That has been around for a little bit. The thing is that in the time that I have been in crypto, whenever a bubble has formed, this is when you actually start having a lot of fun, right? This is when stuff goes up infinitely in a very short amount of time. But then you also have to get out really quickly.” Bitcoin is trading at $108,773 at time of writing.

2025-07-08T14:29:29,"Jack Mallers: How We Started Our Bitcoin Treasury Company","It’s hard to believe Jack Mallers is still only 31. The Bitcoin star has already founded several companies (including Strike and Zap) and had a hand in getting El Salvador to adopt BTC as legal tender , the first country to do so. Now, he’s forming a bitcoin treasury company — Twenty One — to rival the biggest on the market. Speaking to CoinDesk recently for an interview, Mallers explained how his new company came about (through friendship) and what motivates him about bitcoin’s continued advance to the heart of capital markets. Mallers said the idea for Twenty One came out of a Telegram group chat with executives at Tether. Mallers is a long-time friend of Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, which now has its headquarters in El Salvador. “We've overlapped on similar projects, whether it's open source, bitcoin development, El Salvador, just ways that we can push the world in what we believe is the right direction. And so Twenty One is kind of the latest iteration of that,” Mallers said. “We were watching the story [of evolve and we're like, ‘surely there's gonna be, you know, blue chip, credible Bitcoin treasury company, which just means you're capitalized on Bitcoin.’” “At a certain point we kind of started to challenge each other on like, should we do [a Bitcoin treasury company]? … And it came to a point of, you know, if no one is going to build it, you know, why not us?”“Friends should be the change they wanted to see in the world.” Twenty One came together within weeks of Mallers and Ardoino deciding to go ahead. It was joined by SoftBank, which came on as a launch partner. “They wanted to put in a billion bucks and we said, ‘well, we're a bitcoin company, so we're taking your contribution in bitcoin.’ I don't think in dollars, I think in Bitcoin. So at the time, a billion dollars was 10,500 Bitcoins. And so they denominated their contribution in Bitcoin.” It plans to launch with at least 2,000 Bitcoin, making it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury in the world. Mallers originally went down the rabbit hole after his ad, a futures trader, explained how money really worked to him. He described how the debasement of money through government printing and inflation is still what drives him on. Depoliticizing the issuance of money will set us free. “My message [is] Bitcoin before its computer code, before it's an asset, before it's an ETF, to me, it's moral code. Bitcoin is, you shall not censor, you shall not inflate, you shall not confiscate, you shall not counterfeit and you shall not steal,” Mallers said. “Bitcoin not as a bunch of Miami Club hedge fund bros. Think of it as ethical, moral code that we're all working on to create a place in this world where we can safely exist,” he said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/08/jack-mallers-how-we-started-our-bitcoin-treasury-company,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|USDT","Finance|Feature",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T14:29:21,"SharpLink Gaming Jumps 26% as Ether Treasury Tops 200K ETH","Shares of SharpLink Gaming (SBET) surged after the online gaming firm said it snapped up another 7,689 ether (ETH) for its corporate treasury. The move, part of its strategy to make the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap the backbone of its corporate treasury, lifted its total holdings to 205,634 ETH, the company said. The Minneapolis-based online gaming firm spent roughly $19.2 million on the latest purchase, paying an average of $2,501 per coin. ETH is at the time of writing trading at $2,591. The shares climbed as much as 26% to $15.93, the highest since they hit $37.18 on June 12, before dropping back to trade recently around $14.55. SharpLink Gaming also said it raised $64 million last week through an at-the-market share sale, with $37.2 million of that earmarked for buying more ETH in the coming days. All of the company’s ETH holdings are staked or restaked in protocols meant to earn yield, it said. To date, the company has collected 322 ETH, around $2.1 million, in staking rewards since starting the effort on June 2. To help shareholders track how deeply the company’s finances are tied to crypto, SharpLink rolled out a new metric called ETH Concentration. It measures the number of ETH held for every 1,000 diluted shares outstanding. That figure has grown to 2.37 ETH from 2.00 in three weeks, according to the company. Other companies have also seen their shares soar after moving forward with ether treasuries.

2025-07-08T14:28:54,"Trump Media files for third crypto ETF","Trump Media is planning to increase its crypto offerings as the company files for its third crypto-related ETF with the SEC. The new fund will own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Solana, Ether, Cronos, and XRP. The proposed fund – the Crypto Blue Chip ETF, was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. According to the filing, the fund would allocate nearly 75% of its holdings to Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The remaining share would be distributed across the other listed tokens, with direct exposure to each. While ETFs holding Bitcoin and Ether are already available in the US market, the inclusion of Cronos and XRP would make the Trump-backed product one of the first to hold these assets directly. Part of broader strategy The Crypto Blue Chip ETF marks the third ETF filing from Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social and a firm majority-owned by President Donald Trump. Previous filings include a Bitcoin-only ETF and a Bitcoin-Ether hybrid fund. More than ten Bitcoin-focused ETFs currently trade in the US, alongside various other digital asset funds. The Trump Media filings would enter an already crowded field, potentially intensifying competition among issuers seeking to differentiate their offerings. If approved, these ETFs could attract investors looking for diversified exposure to multiple leading cryptocurrencies in a single product. Apart from the crypto offerings, the Trump Organization has also unveiled a $499-priced Trump smartphone and a mobile network. The company said the call centres of Trump Mobile will be entirely in the US. Ethical concerns and policy implications Trump’s deepening involvement in the cryptocurrency space has drawn scrutiny from ethics experts, who have raised concerns about the potential for financial conflicts of interest, given his dual roles as president and a business owner. Critics have pointed to the overlap between policymaking and personal financial interests in sectors such as digital assets. The White House has stated that President Trump is walled off from his businesses, and he has transferred control of his media holdings — including approximately $4 billion in Trump Media shares — to a trust controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr. Despite the controversy, Trump has maintained a pro-crypto stance throughout his second term, pledging support for the industry on the campaign trail and backing related initiatives. Bitcoin surges during Trump’s second term The latest ETF filing comes against the backdrop of a broader bull run in cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin has risen roughly 55% since October and currently trades around $108,900. The surge aligns with Trump’s pro-crypto policies and reflects continued investor appetite for exposure to digital assets. Should the Crypto Blue Chip ETF gain regulatory approval, it would offer investors a new vehicle for diversified exposure to top digital tokens, further cementing Trump Media’s role in shaping the next phase of crypto investment products in the US.

Only Focuses on ADA and These 50 Altcoins!","A new proposal came from Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson, who stands out with his interesting ideas and sharp tongue and is one of the most important names in the cryptocurrency industry. At this point, Hoskinson proposed a treasury built solely on Cardano’s native tokens to support the Cardano ecosystem, breaking away from his previous controversial idea of holding Bitcoin reserves. At this point, Hoskinson laid out a treasury plan for the Cardano ecosystem. Hoskinson’s proposal proposes a treasury reserve by bringing together ADA, Midnight token, and the top 50 native tokens within the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal could lay the groundwork for Cardano’s future in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Hoskinson’s proposed Cardano ecosystem reserve includes native token ADA, privacy-focused Midnight token and leading native tokens such as SNEK, World Mobile Token (WMTYX), Liquid Finance (LQ), Minswap (MIN), and Indigo Protocol (INDY). Hoskinson’s model aims to spread risk across multiple projects, encourage collaboration between token teams, and increase total value locked (TVL) through cross-token incentives and shared liquidity pools. *This is not investment advice.

Fresh Capital to Strengthen Bitcoin Treasury DigitalX, the only cryptocurrency fund manager listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), announced the successful completion of a A$20.7 million (US$13.5 million) strategic placement this week. The raise attracted significant backing from industry players, including Animoca Brands, ParaFi Capital, and UTXO Management. The capital injection will primarily support an expansion of DigitalX’s Bitcoin holdings, with approximately $12.9 million earmarked for treasury allocation. The remainder will be directed towards operational expenses, working capital, and transaction-related costs. Participants in the placement received shares at A$0.074 (US$0.048) per unit, with an additional incentive of one warrant for every two shares purchased. These warrants, exercisable at A$0.15 (US$0.10), carry an 18-month expiry. Key Industry Figures Join Advisory Board Alongside the funding, DigitalX has reinforced its leadership team by establishing a strategic advisory board, naming Animoca Brands Executive Chairman Yat Siu and Web3 investor Hervé Larren as initial appointees. The move reflects the company’s ambition to strengthen its strategic position within the digital asset investment space. Commenting on his involvement, Siu noted his longstanding association with DigitalX and highlighted the company’s unique position within Australia’s regulatory environment. He stated, ""As the only ASX-listed vehicle actively accumulating Bitcoin, DigitalX provides a rare opportunity for investors — including those with retirement portfolios — to gain exposure to Bitcoin via a regulated public market."" Bitcoin as a Strategic Foundation DigitalX’s latest capital raise marks a pivotal shift, underscoring Bitcoin’s continued prominence in its long-term strategy. In its announcement, the company stated, “This capital raise marks a pivotal moment for the company, reflecting a renewed emphasis on Bitcoin as the ongoing foundation of DigitalX's digital asset strategy.” Siu, a vocal advocate for Bitcoin’s role in digital asset portfolios, reiterated that holding Bitcoin serves as both a hedge and an entry point into the broader Web3 economy. He added, “Once you have some Bitcoin, directly or indirectly, you begin expanding into other tokens and on-chain assets.” Bitcoin on Corporate Balance Sheets: A Growing Trend The move by DigitalX follows a rising trend of publicly listed firms incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. The strategy gained widespread attention when MicroStrategy initiated large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions in 2020, financed largely through convertible debt offerings, followed by Japan’s Metaplanet, which has positioned itself as ""Asia's MicroStrategy,"" with Bitcoin purchases funded by both equity and planned debt raises. While the strategy has its skeptics, Siu emphasized that the seriousness of such moves ultimately depends on whether companies are committing to the long term or simply capitalizing on market sentiment.

2025-07-08T14:22:20,"From $0.58 to $12 Cardano Price? Why One Analyst Believes ADA Could Replicate Its 2021 Parabolic Rally","Cardano (ADA) traded relatively flat on Tuesday despite a strong resurgence of over 6% in the past seven days. Generally, ADA has been navigating a challenging recovery following a sharp decline earlier this month, driven by a broader crypto market downturn and substantial whale sell-offs. On February 4, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez underscored the severity of this exodus, noting, “Whales have offloaded over 330 million ADA and haven’t bought the dip yet.” However, there has been a shift in whale activity with Martinez now reporting significant whale accumulation, as over 70 million ADA tokens have been acquired in the past four days. “Whales have moved over 70 million ADA in the past 96 hours,” Martinez tweeted on Thursday, highlighting the renewed interest from large investors. In a separate analysis, Martinez compared ADA’s current trajectory to its 2020-2021 cycle, suggesting history may be repeating itself. “ Looking back at history, ADA seems to be following the same pattern from 2020 to 2021 at a slower pace, which could soon lead to a parabolic rally” he stated. During the previous bull cycle, ADA skyrocketed by approximately 1,400% within nine months, reaching an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021. If Martinez’s prediction proves accurate, ADA could surge to around $12 before year-end. Supporting the pundit’s analysis, on-chain data from crypto analytics firm Santiment indicates that ADA whales and sharks have been consistently accumulating since late November 2023. On Wednesday, the firm highlighted ADA’s surprising price surge despite other crypto assets retracing, pointing to the aforementioned accumulation. “Wallets holding at least 1M ADA have been consistently accumulating since late November of 2023, adding 1.41B more coins and 2.35% of the entire supply during this 15-month stretch.” wrote Santiment . Despite market volatility, the firm also noted that ADA’s price has surged by 107% since this accumulation cycle began. Elsewhere, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also weighed in on the market outlook during a Thursday interview with crypto analyst David Gokhshtein, noting that liquidity could soon begin rotating from meme coins back to ADA and other legacy crypto assets, which could boost prices. “The markets are going back to bluechips, the reliable ‘dinosaur’ coins like Cardano, Ethereum, and XRP. It’s institution-led. Give it another 6 to 12 months. We’ll see a bull market probably when the stablecoin bill passes,” he said. He also emphasized the evolving regulatory landscape, predicting that the U.S. could pass foundational crypto legislation within the next 90 to 120 days, paving the way for a stronger framework for crypto businesses. Additionally, Hoskinson predicted that the U.S. government, which currently holds 212,000 Bitcoin, will first allow it to be stored in a sovereign wealth fund. Following that, he expects Senator Lummis and President Trump to begin acquiring other assets, suggesting ADA could be on the list. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.58, representing a 0.24% drop over the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/from-0-58-to-12-cardano-price-why-one-analyst-believes-ada-could-replicate-its-2021-parabolic-rally/,"ADA|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T14:20:01,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: Analysts Uncover Next Bull Market Peak","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: Analysts Uncover Next Bull Market Peak Are you ready to dive deep into the enigmatic world of Bitcoin ? For many, the recent price action of the world’s leading cryptocurrency has been nothing short of a roller coaster. Yet, amidst the volatility and the whispers of a new bull run, some of the sharpest minds in the crypto analysis space are suggesting something even more profound: Bitcoin might still be trading at a significant discount, poised for an unprecedented surge. This isn’t just about day-to-day fluctuations; it’s about understanding the underlying cycles and metrics that have historically dictated Bitcoin’s most dramatic ascents. Prepare to uncover why the current market might be setting the stage for an truly explosive future for Bitcoin . Unpacking Bitcoin’s Current Price Position In the dynamic realm of digital assets, understanding Bitcoin’s current price position relative to its historical performance is crucial for any investor. Recently, prominent crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted a fascinating metric: the Mayer Multiple . According to Adler, as reported by Cointelegraph, this crucial indicator currently sits at 1.1. What does this seemingly small number signify? It means that Bitcoin’s price is only slightly above its 200-day simple moving average. Historically, during peak bull markets, this multiple has soared much higher, often reaching levels that suggest significant overvaluation. The fact that it’s currently at 1.1 indicates that despite recent gains, Bitcoin is still far from the speculative frenzy seen at the apex of previous cycles. This suggests a foundational strength rather than an overheated market, providing a compelling argument for its continued upward trajectory. It’s a signal that the asset might be more undervalued than overvalued, a rare opportunity in an asset class known for its rapid movements. The Significance of the Mayer Multiple The Mayer Multiple is a simple yet powerful tool, conceived by Trace Mayer, designed to help investors understand when Bitcoin might be overbought or oversold. It’s calculated by dividing the current Bitcoin price by its 200-day moving average. A low Mayer Multiple suggests undervaluation, while a high one suggests overvaluation. Here’s why the current 1.1 reading is so significant for the crypto market : Historical Context: In past bull market peaks, the Mayer Multiple has often exceeded 2.4, sometimes even reaching above 4.0. For instance, during the 2013 peak, it hit over 4.0, and in 2017, it touched approximately 2.8. Even in the 2021 bull run, it reached around 2.4. A value of 1.1 is remarkably low by comparison, especially considering Bitcoin has already seen significant recovery from its bear market lows. Discounted Price: Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis emphasizes that this level suggests Bitcoin is trading at a “discount” relative to previous bull market peaks. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it’s a historical pattern indicating that the asset has substantial room to grow before reaching levels traditionally associated with market tops. Investor Sentiment: A lower Mayer Multiple often correlates with less euphoric, more rational investor behavior. It implies that the market isn’t yet driven by irrational exuberance, which is often a precursor to a market correction. Instead, the current state suggests a more measured accumulation phase. This metric serves as a crucial sanity check for investors, urging them to look beyond the daily noise and consider Bitcoin’s long-term potential based on its historical cycles and fundamental valuation. Navigating the Bitcoin Halving Cycle One of the most anticipated and impactful events in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the Halving Cycle . This pre-programmed event, occurring approximately every four years, reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half, effectively cutting the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. Historically, each halving has been followed by a significant bull run, driven by the principles of supply and demand. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, and analysts are now closely watching how this cycle will unfold. Renowned analyst Rekt Capital recently shared insights on X, noting that if Bitcoin follows its historical halving cycle patterns, the current bull market could reach its apex as soon as September or October 2025. This prediction is not just a random guess; it’s based on meticulous observation of previous cycles: Halving Year Post-Halving Bull Run Duration (Approx.) Peak Year (Approx.) 2012 ~12 months 2013 2016 ~18 months 2017 2020 ~18 months 2021 2024 ~17-18 months (projected) 2025 (Sept/Oct projected) The “diminishing returns” theory suggests that while each cycle sees a new all-time high, the percentage gain from the previous peak might decrease. However, the absolute price increase can still be substantial. The halving creates a supply shock, making new Bitcoin scarcer, and when combined with growing demand, it typically ignites a powerful upward trend. Understanding this cycle is paramount for anyone looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s future movements. What Are the Broader Crypto Market Trends Saying? Beyond specific metrics and cycles, it’s essential to consider the broader crypto market trends that could fuel Bitcoin’s next leg up. The landscape has evolved significantly since previous bull runs. Institutional adoption, for instance, has never been stronger. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States marked a watershed moment, opening doors for traditional finance investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of institutional capital provides a new demand vector that was largely absent in earlier cycles. Furthermore, the regulatory environment, while still evolving, is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions, which adds a layer of legitimacy and stability to the market. Technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, such as the growth of the Lightning Network and the emergence of Ordinals, are also expanding its utility and appeal. These factors, combined with a potential easing of global monetary policies, could create a perfect storm for a sustained rally. The sentiment across the broader crypto market appears cautiously optimistic, with many altcoins also showing signs of life, often following Bitcoin’s lead. This interconnectedness means that a strong Bitcoin performance often acts as a rising tide, lifting other digital assets. Preparing for the Bull Market Peak: Opportunities and Challenges If analysts like Rekt Capital are correct and the next bull market peak for Bitcoin is indeed projected for September or October 2025, what does this mean for investors? This timeframe, just two to three months away from the traditional halving cycle peak, suggests that the most explosive phase of the bull run might be closer than many realize. This period could present unparalleled opportunities for wealth creation, but it also comes with its own set of challenges and risks. Key Opportunities: Significant Price Appreciation: Based on historical patterns and the current Mayer Multiple, there’s a strong probability of substantial price appreciation for Bitcoin. Altcoin Season: A strong Bitcoin bull run often precedes an “altcoin season,” where other cryptocurrencies see even larger percentage gains. Increased Mainstream Adoption: A new all-time high for Bitcoin could draw in more retail and institutional investors, further solidifying its position in the global financial landscape. Potential Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: Bull markets are characterized by extreme volatility. Sharp corrections can occur even during an uptrend. “Buy the Rumor, Sell the News”: Markets can sometimes front-run events. The predicted peak could be influenced by external factors or shift due to unforeseen circumstances. Regulatory Headwinds: While regulation is improving, sudden policy changes in major economies could impact market sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic slowdowns, inflation, or interest rate hikes could dampen investor enthusiasm. Investors should approach this period with a well-defined strategy, including risk management, profit-taking targets, and continuous market monitoring. The goal isn’t just to ride the wave but to navigate it intelligently to maximize gains while minimizing potential losses. Understanding the projected bull market peak allows for proactive planning rather than reactive decision-making. Conclusion: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future Potential The insights from analysts like Axel Adler Jr. and Rekt Capital paint a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s future. The current Mayer Multiple of 1.1 strongly suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to its historical bull market peaks, indicating significant room for growth. Coupled with the predictive power of the Halving Cycle , which points to a potential bull market peak in late 2025, the stage appears set for a remarkable period of appreciation. While the crypto market always carries inherent risks, the confluence of these on-chain metrics and historical patterns, alongside increasing institutional interest, presents a powerful narrative. For those willing to understand the underlying dynamics and navigate the volatility, Bitcoin continues to offer an exciting, potentially transformative investment opportunity. The journey to its next all-time high might be closer and more profound than many anticipate, truly unlocking its unseen potential.

2025-07-08T14:10:57,"XRP Futures: Unveiling the Bullish Surge as Open Interest Hits Five-Month High","BitcoinWorld XRP Futures: Unveiling the Bullish Surge as Open Interest Hits Five-Month High The world of cryptocurrency trading is always buzzing with activity, and recently, all eyes have been on Ripple’s native token, XRP. A significant development has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike: XRP futures open interest has reached a remarkable five-month high. This surge is not just a mere number; it’s a powerful indicator, predominantly driven by an influx of long traders, suggesting a growing wave of optimism for the asset’s future. What exactly does this mean for the XRP price and the broader crypto market ? Let’s dive deep into the data and uncover the implications of this exciting trend. Understanding the Explosive Rise in Open Interest On July 7, the total value of outstanding XRP futures contracts, known as open interest, climbed to an impressive $800 million. This figure marks the highest level recorded since January 19, according to reports from Cointelegraph, citing Velo data. But what is open interest, and why is this particular milestone so significant? What is Open Interest? Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. Unlike trading volume, which measures the number of contracts traded over a period, open interest indicates the total amount of money flowing into a market. A Barometer of Market Sentiment: A rising open interest, especially when accompanied by an increasing price, typically signals that new money is entering the market. It suggests growing conviction among traders and can often precede significant price movements. The current $800 million figure for XRP futures points to substantial capital commitment. Comparing the Current Surge: Reaching a five-month high indicates that the market’s interest in XRP derivatives is at a level not seen since early in the year. This suggests a renewed enthusiasm and potentially a shift in market dynamics for the digital asset. The Dominance of Long Traders: A Bullish Signal Further reinforcing the bullish narrative is the overwhelming presence of long traders in the market. Data tracked by Coinglass for the Binance-listed XRP/USDT market reveals that the ‘top trader long/short ratio’ stands at 1.90. This metric is crucial for understanding the prevailing sentiment among institutional and high-volume traders. What the Ratio Means: A ratio of 1.90 signifies that for every short position opened by top traders, there are 1.9 long positions. In simpler terms, nearly twice as many top traders are betting on an increase in XRP’s price compared to those expecting a decline. This heavy skew towards long positions hints at a strong buying dominance. Implications for XRP Price Action: Such a lopsided ratio can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy in the short term. As more traders open long positions, the buying pressure intensifies, potentially driving the XRP price upwards. This collective conviction among influential traders can create significant momentum. Confidence in Future Performance: The dominance of long positions suggests that these sophisticated traders believe XRP has considerable upside potential, perhaps anticipating positive developments related to Ripple’s ongoing legal battles or broader adoption of its technology. Aggressive Call Option Buying: Unlocking Potential Upside Beyond futures, the Deribit-listed options market has also provided compelling evidence of bullish sentiment. Last week, traders were observed aggressively buying higher strike XRP calls. This activity offers another layer of insight into market expectations. Understanding Call Options: A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. Traders buy call options when they anticipate a significant increase in the underlying asset’s price. Why ‘Higher Strike’ Matters: Aggressively buying higher strike calls means traders are willing to bet on XRP reaching prices significantly above its current trading level. This indicates a strong belief in substantial future price appreciation, not just minor fluctuations. A Strategic Bet: This strategy is often employed by traders looking to leverage potential large price movements. It signifies a high-conviction play, where the potential rewards outweigh the premium paid for the options. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Context The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP is not isolated; it reflects a nuanced interplay with the broader crypto market . While Bitcoin and Ethereum often lead market trends, strong individual asset performance, especially from major altcoins like XRP, can contribute to overall market confidence. Altcoin Season Potential: A surge in specific altcoin derivatives, particularly one with a large market capitalization like XRP, could signal the beginning or continuation of an ‘altcoin season,’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies. Risk and Reward in the Current Climate: While optimism abounds, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Traders must consider the broader macroeconomic factors and regulatory landscape that continue to influence digital asset prices. The high concentration of long positions, while bullish, could also lead to significant liquidations if an unexpected downturn occurs, known as a ‘long squeeze.’ Actionable Insights for Traders: For those looking to participate, monitoring funding rates in the futures market is crucial. High positive funding rates often accompany strong long sentiment but can also indicate an overheated market. Furthermore, a diversified portfolio and robust risk management strategies are always advisable. What’s Next for XRP? The recent surge in XRP futures open interest, coupled with the dominance of long traders and aggressive call option buying, paints a compelling picture of growing confidence in XRP’s future. While no market movement is guaranteed, these indicators collectively suggest that a significant portion of the market anticipates an upward trajectory for the XRP price . As the crypto market continues to evolve, all eyes will be on how these bullish bets play out and whether XRP can sustain its momentum. This period could prove to be a pivotal moment for Ripple’s token, potentially setting the stage for its next major move.

The proposed ""Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF"" would hold a portfolio of five tokens: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and cronos (CRO), according to a filing with the SEC . Eighty-five percent of the fund’s holdings would be split between bitcoin and ether. Solana would make up 8%, cronos 5% and XRP 2%. The ETF is being launched in partnership with Yorkville America Digital, the same asset manager backing Trump Media’s earlier filings for a combined Bitcoin and Ether ETF, as well as a standalone bitcoin fund. The SEC acknowledged the dual BTC-ETH ETF application on Monday, a step that initiates its review. Crypto.com’s custody arm, Foris DAX Trust Company, will serve as the fund’s custodian, responsible for safekeeping the underlying crypto assets. The S-1 registration filed with the SEC is one of two key documents required for an ETF to move forward. The next step lies with the exchange seeking to list the product, which must file a 19b-4 with the SEC. That submission would legally bind the regulator to a review timeline. This would mark at least the third crypto ETF attempt tied to Trump Media or related entities, signaling an intent to establish a broad crypto investment franchise.

2025-07-08T14:03:34,"CME Beats Binance in BTC Futures While Hyperliquid Hits $5B in Volume: CoinGlass H1 Report","CME has overtaken Binance as the world’s largest Bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while decentralized platform Hyperliquid achieved record-breaking $5 billion daily trading volumes, according to CoinGlass’s comprehensive H1 2025 derivatives report . CME’s Bitcoin futures open interest reached 158,300 BTC ( $16.5 billion ) by June 1, surpassing Binance’s 118,700 BTC ( $12.3 billion ) for the first time in the history of crypto derivatives. Source: CoinGlass The milestone comes as BTC derivatives open interest climbed from $60 billion to over $70 billion during the first half of 2025, driven by massive ETF inflows and institutional demand . Total cryptocurrency derivatives trading volume maintained moderate upward momentum throughout H1 2025, with Binance continuing to dominate the overall derivatives volume, reaching nearly $200 billion on peak days. Source: CoinGlass However, the market structure consolidated around leading exchanges including OKX, Bybit, Bitget, and Gate, with top platforms capturing the majority of market share through the Matthew effect. Hyperliquid emerged as the standout performer in decentralized derivatives, processing an average daily volume of over $3 billion with peaks exceeding $17 billion . The platform now commands over 80% of the DeFi perpetual contracts market share while capturing 10.54% of Binance’s market share, up from 9.76% in April. Institutional Adoption Drives Regulated Exchange Growth The rise of regulated exchanges marks a significant shift in the trading patterns associated with cryptocurrency derivatives. CME’s dominance in Bitcoin futures open interest stems from increasing institutional participation through compliant channels, with ETFs serving as major sources of incremental demand alongside traditional institutional allocators. Bitcoin’s market dominance strengthened throughout H1 2025, reaching 65% by the end of Q2, the highest level since 2021. Spot ETF assets under management exceeded $140 billion, creating sustained demand for hedging instruments on regulated platforms. Ethereum and altcoins experienced pronounced weakness during the period. ETH dropped over 60% from its $3,700 early-year high to below $1,400 in April, with the ETH/BTC ratio declining from 0.036 to 0.017, representing a 50% collapse. Major altcoins, including Solana , also fell by over 60% from their peaks, despite brief early-year rallies. The CoinGlass Derivatives Risk Index (CDRI) remained at moderate levels throughout H1, reaching 58 by June 1, indicating “moderate risk/volatility neutral” conditions. Multiple liquidation events helped flush excessive leverage, with February 3 recording $2.23 billion in forced liquidations during a single 24-hour period. Funding rates remained predominantly positive throughout the period, staying above the baseline level of 0.01% and indicating persistent bullish sentiment. However, three notable negative funding rate episodes coincided with sharp market corrections in February, April, and June, serving as reliable sentiment inflection point indicators. Hyperliquid Dominates Decentralized Derivatives Revolution Hyperliquid’s explosive growth positioned the platform as the leading force in decentralized derivatives trading. The average daily volume consistently exceeded $3 billion, with month-over-month growth rates outpacing the entire DEX sector. The platform achieved sub-second finality and support for over 100,000 orders per second through its proprietary native-chain matching engine. The decentralized exchange ranks sixth among all DEXs by daily volume at over $420 million while capturing 6.84% of global perpetual flows. Annual trading volume reached $1.571 trillion, representing an 843% increase from $26.3 billion recorded twelve months ago. Revenue generation exceeded $56 million per month, resulting in cumulative revenue of over $310 million. The platform reinvests 97% of protocol fees into HYPE token buybacks, resulting in $910 million in buybacks over a six-month period. Total value locked reached $1.75 billion, ranking eighth among all blockchains. Notably, institutional adoption accelerated with Nasdaq-listed Lion Group announcing plans to hold $600 million reserves with HYPE as its primary treasury asset. The token reached a new peak at $44.86, surpassing its previous December high of $35.51, while positioning itself for a potential all-time high of $50. Moreover, market depth analysis revealed Binance’s continued dominance in Bitcoin spot trading, with a single-sided depth of $8 million and a 32% market share. However, the derivatives space is increasingly fragmenting between regulated institutional venues, such as the CME, and leading decentralized platforms, like Hyperliquid, both of which serve distinct investor segments.

2025-07-08T14:03:34,"Mike Novogratz Predicts the U.S. Will Purchase Bitcoin Within the Next Six Months","Renowned investor and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has predicted that the United States government will start adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet around Q2-Q3 2025. Speaking at a recent Ondo Summit, Novogratz expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s growing role in the financial system, particularly under the new presidential administration. Notably, the billionaire investor highlighted a shift in regulatory sentiment that could lead to a surge in institutional adoption of Bitcoin . With a new leadership direction at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Novogratz foresees an increase in cryptocurrency-related public listings on major U.S. exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. Galaxy Digital itself is among the firms planning to go public in the near future. Novogratz further shared insights from a high-profile event he attended, which included Vice President J.D. Vance, tech mogul Mark Zuckerberg, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and executives from various cryptocurrency companies. He noted a positive outlook on digital assets within influential circles, reinforcing his belief that Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a strategic financial asset. “I think Bitcoin will be on the government’s balance sheet within six months ,” Novogratz stated. He emphasized that Bitcoin has solidified its position as a reliable store of value and could soon play a key role in national financial strategies. “ Bitcoin has a store of value it’s carved out a lane it is becoming Global so I don’t think bitcoin’s going away,” he added. Meanwhile, while Novoratz acknowledged the potential for short-term volatility in Bitcoin’s price, he dismissed concerns, calling it a “buying opportunity” rather than a setback. He also emphasized that price fluctuations do not diminish Bitcoin’s value in the long run, as institutional demand is expected to drive sustained growth. This outlook aligns with a Wednesday tweet from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who predicted that individual U.S. states might soon begin acquiring Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. According to the pundit, the passage of Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (SBR) bills at the state level could create demand for over 240,000 BTC worth approximately $23.5 billion. He also suggested that pension funds and other institutional investors could follow suit, further accelerating Bitcoin’s adoption. That said, the idea of Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset has continued to gain momentum in both political and financial circles, particularly with President Donald Trump proposing a digital asset task force to explore integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system in last year’s campaigns. Major crypto advocacy groups and companies such as Satoshi Fund are actively lobbying for Bitcoin reserves at both the state and federal levels. Recently, MARA CEO Fred Thiel also reinforced this effort, stating, “We are now focused on bringing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to all 50 states and the federal government.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/mike-novogratz-predicts-the-u-s-will-purchase-bitcoin-within-the-next-six-months/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Mike Novogratz",cryptocompare

Based on research by Coinglass, over 80% of the trading volume and price discovery came from the derivative market, with a shrinking share of spot deals. BTC open interest expanded on all crypto-native exchanges, but CME activity surpassed even Binance. | Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro Open interest on derivative exchanges kept expanding in H1, rising from around $60B in January to over $70B six months later. BTC open interest inched up in July, reaching $34B on crypto-native exchanges. Long and short positions were more balanced, avoiding a short squeeze. Institutions decreased BTC volatility For the whole of H1, institutions moved in with more active derivative trading. This boosted the share of CME futures, expanding beyond the activity on Binance. As a result, BTC volatility continued to slow down, gradually sliding to a six-month low of 1.27% . CME carried over $16.5B open interest, surpassing the $11.3B in open interest on Binance. Institutions on CME joined ETF buyers , expanding the effect of institutions on the Bitcoin market. The increased liquidity inflows helped lower the BTC volatility, as the leading crypto asset consolidated at a higher level. Binance remained the biggest crypto-native exchange by open interest, though its share was diluted. For the first half of 2025, the biggest liquidation events happened during the corrections in February and March-April. Outside those two episodes, traders were more cautious in allocating liquidity to BTC positions. As a result, BTC went through relatively smaller liquidation episodes, with more rational allocation and smaller daily liquidations. Crypto derivatives index recovered in Q2 The Coinglass Crypto Derivatives index staged a recovery in the second quarter of 2025. The index tracks the performance of derivative markets for BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP, applying value-based weighting on their open interest. As of July 2025, the index is at $2,231.02, up from the $1,600 range during the yearly lows in April. The index’s drop in the first half of the year was mostly due to the weak performance of Ethereum (ETH). The Coinglass derivative index recovered in Q2, but was mostly driven by the growth of BTC, with outflows from ETH, SOL, and XRP showing lower demand for altcoins. | Source: Coinglass Capital inflows in the first half of 2025 were still heavily concentrated on BTC, boosting the index despite the slowdown of other assets. However, the fall of ETH, SOL and XRP reflected the general weakness of altcoins, pulling the index lower despite the strength of BTC. According to the Coinglass analysis, the index had a boost driven by ETF demand and the usage of Bitcoin as a safe haven, while profit-taking and uncertainty put pressure on secondary assets and the broader altcoin market. The altcoin market expected in the first quarter of 2025 never materialized, instead pushing smaller assets even lower. The altcoin season index recovered to 28 points in July, still reflecting the overall BTC dominance. By the first half of 2025, the divergence of BTC and altcoins was at near-record levels. Based on market signals, altcoins are seen as extremely undervalued. Despite the low levels, traders have become more skeptical that older altcoins would make a return.

2025-07-08T13:58:24,"Dow Jones stalls as China warns against fresh trade tensions","U.S. stocks opened flat on Tuesday as traders looked for gains following President Donald Trump’s delay of sweeping reciprocal tariffs and as China warned against a rekindling of trade tensions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was largely flat as the blue-chip index shed 40 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% amid a slowdown from the benchmark’s record highs. A lull in early trading also saw the Nasdaq Composite fluctuate around the flatline, down 0.2%. Stocks shed gains on Monday amid Trump’s fresh threats of tariffs against major trading partners, with the Dow falling more than 400 points and the S&P 500 closing 0.79% down. Nasdaq ended the day 0.92% lower. Although futures tied to the major gauges cut these losses as traders took note of the new August 1, 2025 tariffs deadline, the potential flare up in trade tensions is tempering the overall market mood. In other market sectors, cryptocurrencies were also largely flat as Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovered near $108k. Meanwhile, oil prices steadied around $67. You might also like: Dow Jones falls 100 points, S&P 500 and Nasdaq open lower amid Trump tariffs threats China to “hit back” on tariffs Trump’s move to issue fresh threats of duties against top partners, including Japan and South Korea, with possible 25% tariffs, had investors on edge. Other countries, Thailand, Malaysia, and South Africa, also face proposed tariffs of between 25% and 40% by August 1, according to the White House. The U.S. and China appear to be back on a collision course over trade policy, despite the optimism that followed their June agreement. Following Monday’s warnings to multiple countries, China has now cautioned against pushing new tariff rates. Beijing stated that further tariffs will only escalate trade tensions, and signaled readiness to retaliate against nations that enter deals with the U.S. under the exclusionary framework. The warning follows Trump’s threat against countries that align with BRICS at the expense of the U.S. in trade matters. Outside the tariff landscape, investors will turn their focus to key economic data reports, the Federal Reserve’s minutes from its June meeting, and upcoming corporate earnings.

2025-07-08T13:53:50,"Core Scientific Cut to Neutral as CoreWeave Deal Adds Complexity: H.C. Wainwright","Shares of bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) were downgraded to neutral from buy by broker H.C. Wainwright, which cited heightened risk exposure following the company's r ecently announced deal with AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV). The brokerage removed its price target on the stock, noting that Core Scientific’s performance is now more tightly linked to CoreWeave’s trajectory. Core Scientific shares were 1.3% higher at publication time, trading around $15. The stock fell 18% yesterday following news of the deal. CoreWeave was 2.6% lower. AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave said Monday it agreed to buy Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valuing the bitcoin miner at about $20.40 per share, based on recent closing prices. While the broker continues to view its own Core Scientific sales estimates as conservative, particularly as it hasn’t factored in next year’s planned HPC (high-performance computing) buildout, it flagged several unresolved variables, including outstanding infrastructure procurement. Still, the firm's analysts expect shareholder approval for the transaction, with no indication of delays in the closing timeline. H.C. Wainwright characterized Core Scientific as carrying “the inherent high-risk levels of cryptocurrency companies,” citing network hashrate volatility and crypto market fluctuations. While Core’s diversified operations help offset some of that risk compared with smaller peers, the company now also takes on exposure to CoreWeave’s AI adoption risks, customer concentration and leverage, the report said. Additional headwinds include potential dilution, mining equipment shortages, increasing regulatory scrutiny and operational hurdles. On a more positive note, the expected contribution of HPC revenues in future quarters could help reduce the company’s sensitivity to bitcoin price cycles and stabilize results, the report added.

2025-07-08T07:00:15,"Ethereum's next move could be a plunge or an explosive short squeeze","<p>What is the Commitment of Traders (COT) Report?</p><p>The COT report is a weekly snapshot released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It shows how different types of traders are positioned in futures markets—meaning whether they're betting prices will rise or fall.</p><p>Why does it matter?</p><p>Understanding trader positioning can help predict possible price moves. For example, if many traders expect prices to fall, it may signal caution.</p><p>How does it work, step-by-step?</p><ol><li><p>Traders open futures positions:
Imagine large traders think Ethereum's price will fall soon. They open ""short"" positions, betting prices will drop. Others, expecting prices to rise, open ""long"" positions.</p></li><li><p>Reporting by traders:
Every Tuesday, firms that manage futures positions report their holdings to the CFTC.</p></li><li><p>CFTC receives and verifies data:
On Wednesday, the CFTC gathers these reports and checks for accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Weekly release:
By Friday afternoon, the CFTC publishes this information in the weekly COT report.</p></li></ol><p>Trader categories explained simply:</p><ul><li><p>Leveraged Funds (Speculators): Traders looking for quick profits.
Example: A hedge fund betting ETH prices will fall by heavily shorting contracts.</p></li><li><p>Dealer Intermediaries (Market Makers): Banks and brokers providing liquidity, usually hedging risk.
Example: A bank buying futures contracts to offset risk from customer transactions.</p></li><li><p>Asset Managers/Institutions: Long-term investors who manage retirement funds or mutual funds.
Example: A pension fund holding long futures positions to invest for the long-term growth of Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Other Reportables: Large traders who don’t fit neatly into other categories.</p></li><li><p>Nonreportable (Small traders): Smaller investors whose holdings are too small to be individually reported.</p></li></ul><p>Simple Example:</p><p>Let's say last week’s report showed leveraged funds holding 1,000 contracts betting ETH prices will go down (""short"") and only 100 contracts betting they'll rise (""long""). This means speculative traders expect ETH's price to fall soon.</p><p>Why it might help your trading:</p><ul><li><p>If most traders are very bearish (expect prices to fall), it might indicate prices could continue dropping.</p></li><li><p>Conversely, extreme bearishness might also mean that if prices start rising unexpectedly, these bearish traders must quickly buy to close their losing positions, rapidly driving prices higher (a “short squeeze”).</p></li></ul><p>This report helps you understand the ""big picture,"" allowing you to make informed trading decisions based on what major players in the market are doing.</p><p>ETH related positions from the COT Report</p><p>As of July 1, 2025, leveraged funds hold a substantial short position on Ethereum futures: they have 12,574 short contracts (51.7% of total open interest) compared to only 1,275 long contracts (5.2%). This clearly shows their expectation that Ethereum's price will decline. In contrast, Dealer Intermediaries are primarily long (66.5%), likely reflecting their role in hedging or providing liquidity. Asset Managers and Institutions also lean toward the bullish side, with 12.4% of total open interest long compared to just 2.2% short.</p><p>Putting it Together - The Guestimate:</p><p>Given the current setup, here's my guestimate for Ethereum's next move:</p><ul><li><p>Immediate Term (next few days to a week or two): Increased Downward Pressure and Volatility. The substantial short position from leveraged funds is likely to exert strong downward pressure on Ethereum's price in the very short term. We could see a move lower as these funds try to capitalize on their short bets. This might manifest as quick dips or a sustained downtrend, potentially testing significant support levels.</p></li><li><p>Medium Term (next few weeks to a month): Potential for Reversal or Consolidation Around Support. If the price does decline, the bullish leanings of Asset Managers and Institutions could act as a floor. They might start accumulating at lower prices, which could lead to a bounce or a period of consolidation. The market will be watching to see if new long positions emerge from non-leveraged players to counter the speculative shorts.</p></li><li><p>Key Indicator to Watch: How far leveraged funds are willing to press their shorts. If they continue to add significantly, the downtrend could be more severe. Conversely, if they start covering their shorts (buying back contracts to close their positions), it could signal a reversal and lead to a sharp upward move (a ""short squeeze"").</p></li></ul><p>For individual crypto traders, closely monitoring Ethereum price movements and weekly changes in leveraged fund positioning is crucial, along with price action at potential supports! Extreme bearish sentiment could either suggest the need for caution or signal an opportunity if market sentiment shifts quickly and unexpectedly.</p><p>Trade ETH and crypto at your own risk only.
