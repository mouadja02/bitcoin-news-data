In a statement on Monday, a Qantas spokesperson said that the firm is in close communication with authorities but wouldn’t confirm whether the hackers are demanding payment in exchange for the stolen customer data, reports The Guardian. “A potential cyber-criminal has made contact and we are currently working to validate this. As this is a criminal matter, we have engaged the Australian federal police and won’t be commenting any further on the detail of the contact.” Qantas announced on Wednesday that a cybercriminal targeted a call center and gained access to a third-party customer-servicing platform that stored service records for 6 million customers. The airline says the impacted system is now contained but notes that stolen customer data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and frequent flier numbers. Qantas says no personal financial information or passport details were stolen. Qantas Group chief executive Vanessa Hudson apologized on social media last week for the breach and promised regular updates. “We’re finalizing a process that will enable us to provide affected customers with more information about their personal information that was potentially compromised.

The Bull Market May Not Be Over for XRP Despite explosive gains so far this cycle, Glassnode data suggests XRP has yet to reach a local top with market participants not yet in profit-taking territory, keeping the door open for further upside. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Z-Score, a key valuation metric, peaked near 6.5 during XRP’s early 2025 run to $3. Today, it hovers around 2.0—well below the 3.0 threshold that typically signals overvaluation and the previous overextended levels that created high volatility. XRP MVRV Z-Score shows stable valuation. Source: Glassnode. A low score means the asset isn’t overextended relative to historical investor entry points, suggesting accumulation and HODLing rather than short-term speculation or weak hands. This is reinforced by the HODL Wave chart, which shows over 40% of the circulating supply hasn’t moved in more than a year, underscoring strong holder conviction for further gains.

Long-term cohort bands also remain stable despite recent volatility and macro FUD, creating a solid foundation for growth with resilient underlying support. XRP Price Analysis: Can $3 Be Topped This Cycle? The XRP price could be gearing up for its next leg higher as it teeters on a breakout from a symmetrical triangle that has capped its upside since late February. Momentum indicators align with the long-term bullish on-chain metrics. The RSI has reclaimed the neutral line at 52, signaling renewed buyer strength and a return to bullish territory. More so, the MACD has formed a golden cross, surpassing the single line for the first time since May. On the 3-day chart, this suggests a potential mid-term uptrend is taking shape. XRP has already surpassed the immediate resistance to a breakout at the 0.618 Fibonnaci level at $2.267. The next hurdle sits at $2.44, which will determine whether this is a true breakout or a false move. Should the bullish case play out, the pattern sets up a likely technical target at the 2.618 Fibonacci extension around $4.365—representing a 90% gain from current levels. For this breakout to fully materialize, a market-warming catalyst such as the October 17 U.S. spot XRP ETF decision could prove decisive, opening the door to fresh TradFi inflows. Bitcoin Could Soon Steal the Spotlight – With Some Help Those who jumped to altcoins like XRP over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks – until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin.

2025-07-08T16:40:55,"Bitcoin Futures: CME Dominance Signals Monumental Institutional Shift","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures: CME Dominance Signals Monumental Institutional Shift Are you ready to witness a monumental shift in the cryptocurrency landscape? The latest data reveals a compelling story about who is truly driving the Bitcoin market now. For years, retail traders dominated the narrative, but a significant change is underway, signaling a maturing market where big players are taking the lead. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has now firmly positioned itself at the forefront of Bitcoin futures open interest, a clear indicator of burgeoning institutional demand. Understanding the Rise of Bitcoin Futures and Open Interest Before we dive into the specifics of CME’s ascent, let’s clarify what Bitcoin futures and open interest mean. Bitcoin futures are financial contracts that obligate the buyer or seller to transact Bitcoin at a predetermined future date and price. They allow investors to speculate on Bitcoin’s price movements without actually owning the underlying asset. Open interest, on the other hand, represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. It’s a crucial metric because it reflects the total amount of money flowing into the futures market, indicating liquidity and market depth. A rising open interest suggests new money entering the market, while a falling open interest indicates money leaving. The significance of open interest, particularly in the context of Bitcoin, lies in its ability to gauge market sentiment and participation. High open interest often correlates with strong market conviction and can precede significant price movements. When institutional players engage, their capital infusion adds substantial depth and stability, fundamentally altering the market’s dynamics. CME Open Interest Takes the Lead: A Detailed Look According to the CoinGlass H1 2025 report, as of June 1, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has officially surpassed all other platforms in Bitcoin futures open interest. This isn’t just a marginal lead; it’s a decisive statement from the traditional finance world. Wu Blockchain on X highlighted that CME recorded a staggering 158,300 BTC in open interest, significantly outpacing Binance, which stood at 118,700 BTC. Key Takeaways from the Data: CME’s Dominance: The 158,300 BTC figure for CME represents a robust vote of confidence from institutional investors who prefer regulated, traditional venues for their crypto exposure. Binance’s Market Share Decline: While still a major player, Binance’s second position indicates a shift in the landscape, with its market share in Bitcoin futures open interest diminishing relative to CME. This could be attributed to increased regulatory scrutiny on offshore exchanges and institutions favoring regulated alternatives. Widening Gap: The report also points to a widening gap between Binance and other prominent exchanges like OKX and Bybit. This suggests a consolidation of institutional activity on platforms like CME, while the broader market for retail and some institutional players remains distributed but with a clear leader emerging. This shift isn’t merely about numbers; it reflects a deeper trend in the crypto market . Institutions, with their massive capital, are increasingly comfortable entering the digital asset space, but they demand the infrastructure and regulatory clarity that traditional exchanges like CME provide. This preference is reshaping how Bitcoin is traded and perceived globally. What Drives This Surging Institutional Demand ? The rise of institutional demand for Bitcoin futures on CME is not accidental. Several factors contribute to this significant trend: 1. Regulatory Clarity and Compliance: CME is a regulated derivatives exchange based in the United States. For large financial institutions, regulatory compliance is paramount. Trading on a regulated platform minimizes legal and operational risks, providing a sense of security that is often lacking on less regulated crypto-native exchanges. This clarity is a major draw for hedge funds, asset managers, and corporate treasuries. 2. Familiarity and Infrastructure: Traditional finance players are accustomed to the trading mechanisms and infrastructure offered by exchanges like CME. The systems, settlement processes, and risk management tools are familiar, making the transition into Bitcoin futures smoother than navigating the often-complex and varied interfaces of pure crypto exchanges. 3. Liquidity and Depth: As more institutions enter, they bring significant capital, enhancing liquidity on CME. High liquidity ensures that large orders can be executed with minimal price impact, a critical factor for institutional-sized trades. This creates a virtuous cycle: more liquidity attracts more institutions, further deepening the market. 4. Macroeconomic Factors and Diversification: In an environment of economic uncertainty and inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge or a store of value. Institutions are diversifying their portfolios to include digital assets, and futures contracts offer a convenient, non-custodial way to gain exposure without directly holding Bitcoin, which can have its own set of operational challenges. Implications for the Broader Digital Assets Ecosystem CME’s dominance in Bitcoin futures open interest has profound implications for the entire digital assets ecosystem: Market Maturation: The increased participation of institutional investors signals a maturing market. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its speculative, retail-driven origins and is becoming a recognized asset class within traditional finance. This legitimacy can attract even more mainstream adoption. Price Discovery and Stability: Institutional capital tends to bring more stability and efficiency to price discovery. Their long-term investment horizons and sophisticated trading strategies can reduce volatility compared to purely retail-driven markets. While volatility will always be a characteristic of crypto, institutional involvement can temper extreme swings. Future Product Development: The success of Bitcoin futures on CME could pave the way for more sophisticated institutional products, such as Bitcoin spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), options, and other structured products. This expansion of investment vehicles will further integrate crypto into traditional financial markets. Competitive Landscape Shift: Crypto-native exchanges will need to adapt. While they may continue to cater to retail and certain institutional segments, the trend towards regulated venues for large-scale derivatives trading is undeniable. This could spur more crypto exchanges to seek regulatory licenses and enhance their compliance frameworks. Challenges and Considerations While the rise of institutional demand is largely positive, it’s essential to consider potential challenges: Centralization Concerns: As more volume flows through regulated, centralized entities like CME, some in the crypto community might raise concerns about the decentralization ethos of Bitcoin. Increased Correlation with Traditional Markets: Greater institutional involvement could lead to Bitcoin’s price movements becoming more correlated with traditional financial assets, potentially reducing its appeal as an uncorrelated hedge. Regulatory Scrutiny: With increased institutional adoption comes increased regulatory attention. While beneficial for legitimacy, it could also lead to more stringent rules and oversight for the entire crypto industry. Actionable Insights for Investors For both retail and institutional investors, this shift offers several actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Flows: Keep an eye on open interest data from CME and other regulated exchanges. Rising open interest can be a bullish signal, indicating strong institutional conviction. Understand Market Structure: Recognize that the market is evolving. While retail still plays a role, institutional capital is increasingly influential in price discovery and overall market sentiment. Consider Regulated Products: If you are an institutional investor or a high-net-worth individual, explore the benefits of regulated Bitcoin futures and other upcoming products for compliant exposure. Diversify Wisely: As the digital assets space matures, continue to diversify your portfolio, understanding the different risk profiles of various cryptocurrencies and investment vehicles. The Future is Institutional: A Compelling Outlook The data from CoinGlass and the analysis from Wu Blockchain paint a clear picture: the institutionalization of Bitcoin is not just a concept; it’s a rapidly unfolding reality. CME’s lead in Bitcoin futures open interest is a powerful testament to this trend, underscoring the growing confidence of traditional finance in digital assets. This monumental shift promises a more mature, stable, and integrated crypto market, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future.

2025-07-08T16:30:55,"Falcon Finance Soars: Unveiling 116% Overcollateralization and Brilliant Yield Strategies","BitcoinWorld Falcon Finance Soars: Unveiling 116% Overcollateralization and Brilliant Yield Strategies In the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi), finding protocols that offer both stability and impressive returns can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, recent insights from Andrei Grachev, co-founder of crypto market maker DWF Labs, shed a bright light on Falcon Finance , positioning it as a standout contender. Grachev’s update on X highlighted Falcon Finance’s remarkable 116% overcollateralization and its innovative approach to generating yield, making it a compelling subject for anyone interested in the future of digital asset investments. Understanding Falcon Finance’s Robust Overcollateralization One of the most critical indicators of a DeFi protocol’s health and reliability is its collateralization ratio. For Falcon Finance , this figure stands at an impressive 116%, signifying a strong buffer against market volatility. What makes this even more compelling is the composition of this collateral: Dominant Stablecoins and Bitcoin: Approximately 89% of Falcon Finance’s collateral is backed by stablecoins and Bitcoin. This strategic allocation provides a bedrock of stability, as stablecoins are designed to maintain a pegged value (usually to the USD), and Bitcoin, despite its volatility, is widely considered a foundational digital asset. Strategic Altcoin Exposure: The remaining 11% comprises various altcoins. While altcoins can introduce higher volatility, their inclusion, when managed effectively, can offer diversification and potential for higher growth. The relatively small percentage ensures that the protocol’s overall stability is not unduly compromised. This substantial overcollateralization means that for every dollar of value issued by Falcon Finance, there is 1.16 dollars of underlying assets securing it. This provides a significant safety net for users, mitigating risks associated with market downturns and ensuring the protocol’s solvency even under adverse conditions. It’s a testament to a cautious and risk-aware approach in a space often criticized for its speculative nature. Unpacking Falcon Finance’s Dynamic Yield Strategies Beyond its robust collateral, Falcon Finance distinguishes itself through its sophisticated and diversified yield strategies . Unlike many protocols that rely on single, often high-risk, methods, Falcon employs a multi-pronged approach to generate returns for its users. These strategies are meticulously designed to be market-neutral, a concept we’ll explore further. The primary sources of yield for Falcon Finance are: Basis Trading (44%): This strategy involves simultaneously buying and selling an asset in different markets to profit from small price discrepancies. In crypto, this often means exploiting the difference between the spot price of a cryptocurrency and its futures contract price. It’s a low-risk, high-volume strategy that thrives on market inefficiencies. Arbitrage (34%): Similar to basis trading, arbitrage involves profiting from price differences of the same asset across different exchanges. For example, buying Bitcoin on Exchange A where it’s slightly cheaper and immediately selling it on Exchange B where it’s slightly more expensive. This requires speed and sophisticated algorithms but carries minimal directional risk. Staking (22%): A more traditional DeFi yield method, staking involves locking up cryptocurrencies to support the operations of a blockchain network, in return for rewards. Falcon Finance leverages staking of its underlying assets to contribute to its overall yield generation, adding a layer of passive income. This diversified portfolio of yield strategies ensures that the protocol isn’t overly reliant on any single market condition or trading opportunity, thereby enhancing its resilience and consistency in generating returns. The Power of Market-Neutral Strategies: A Core Principle One of the most compelling aspects of Falcon Finance , as highlighted by Grachev, is its exclusive reliance on market-neutral strategies. But what exactly does this mean in the context of cryptocurrency, and why is it so significant? A market-neutral strategy is designed to profit regardless of whether the overall market goes up or down. This is achieved by taking offsetting positions that cancel out the directional risk. For example, in basis trading, you might simultaneously long (buy) an asset in the spot market and short (sell) its futures contract. If the market goes down, your spot position loses value, but your short futures position gains, balancing the outcome and allowing you to profit from the ‘basis’ (the price difference) rather than the asset’s price movement. The benefits of a market-neutral approach for a fixed-income protocol are immense: Reduced Volatility Exposure: Investors are shielded from the extreme price swings characteristic of the crypto market. Consistent Returns: By not relying on bullish or bearish trends, the protocol aims for more predictable and stable returns, mimicking traditional fixed-income investments. Enhanced Security: Minimizing directional bets reduces the risk of large capital losses due to sudden market crashes. This commitment to market-neutrality, combined with features like instant unstaking for staked USDf and a trader-driven peg mechanism, positions Falcon Finance as a truly innovative and potentially safer alternative for those seeking stable returns in the volatile crypto landscape. The instant unstaking feature, in particular, offers liquidity that is often lacking in traditional staking models, giving users greater control over their funds. Growth and Resilience: Falcon Finance’s Journey as a Leading Fixed-Income Protocol Andrei Grachev’s public endorsement on X wasn’t just about technical specifications; it was also a nod to Falcon Finance ‘s impressive growth and remarkable resilience. Despite the inherent skepticism and occasional criticism that new DeFi protocols face, Falcon Finance has managed to carve out a significant niche for itself. Grachev’s emphasis on the protocol’s journey underscores its ability to navigate market challenges and continuously deliver on its promise of stable returns. This resilience is a critical factor for any project aiming to be a leading fixed-income protocol in the long term. The fact that it maintains its overcollateralization and diversified yield streams even amidst broader market fluctuations speaks volumes about its operational efficiency and robust risk management. The ‘trader-driven peg mechanism’ is another interesting innovation, empowering market participants to help maintain the stability of the USDf token. This decentralized approach to peg maintenance can be more robust than centralized models, leveraging collective intelligence and market forces to ensure stability. Why Falcon Finance Stands Out in the DeFi Landscape In a crowded DeFi space, what truly makes Falcon Finance noteworthy? Transparency and Trust: Backed by insights from prominent figures like Andrei Grachev and DWF Labs, Falcon Finance is gaining recognition for its transparent operational model. Superior Risk Management: The combination of 116% overcollateralization , a diversified asset base (89% stablecoins/BTC), and strictly market-neutral yield strategies significantly lowers investor risk compared to many other high-yield DeFi platforms. Innovation in Yield Generation: By focusing on basis trading and arbitrage alongside staking, Falcon Finance taps into sophisticated financial engineering to generate consistent returns without relying on speculative asset appreciation. Liquidity and Control: The instant unstaking for staked USDf provides users with unparalleled flexibility, a major advantage in the DeFi space where funds can often be locked up for extended periods. These elements collectively position Falcon Finance not just as another DeFi project, but as a serious contender for investors seeking predictable and secure returns in the volatile crypto market. It represents a mature approach to DeFi, blending innovative technology with sound financial principles. The Future Outlook for Fixed-Income Protocols As the crypto market matures, the demand for reliable fixed-income protocol s will only grow. Institutional investors, in particular, are looking for avenues to deploy capital into digital assets without taking on excessive directional risk. Protocols like Falcon Finance , with their emphasis on market-neutral strategies and robust collateralization, are perfectly poised to meet this evolving demand. The ongoing development and refinement of such protocols will be crucial for the broader adoption of DeFi. They bridge the gap between traditional finance’s need for stability and the crypto world’s promise of higher returns, paving the way for a more integrated and accessible financial future. Conclusion: Falcon Finance – A Beacon of Stability and Growth Falcon Finance , as highlighted by DWF Labs’ Andrei Grachev, stands as a compelling example of innovation in decentralized finance. Its impressive 116% overcollateralization , primarily backed by stablecoins and Bitcoin, alongside its sophisticated and diversified yield strategies rooted in market-neutral principles, sets it apart. By prioritizing stability, transparency, and consistent returns, Falcon Finance is not just weathering the storm of market volatility but thriving, solidifying its position as a truly remarkable and potentially leading fixed-income protocol . For those seeking a blend of security and lucrative opportunities in the digital asset space, Falcon Finance presents a powerful and exciting proposition.

2025-07-08T16:29:36,"UK small-cap firms are adopting MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury model","Several UK-listed small-cap companies are now copying a controversial American playbook that turned a tech firm into a full-on Bitcoin proxy. The plan is simple but aggressive: issue new shares, raise cash, and buy Bitcoin. Executives hope this move will push their stock prices higher by giving investors indirect exposure to crypto, something that’s still difficult to access in the UK. This development was brought to our attention by Axel Cabrol, Co-Deputy CIO at TOBAM, whose research paper Accounting for the Performance of MicroStrategy shows that British firms are now trying to do what MicroStrategy did in the US between 2020 and 2024, when it massively outperformed Bitcoin itself using a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Axel believes that while this model isn’t without risk, it could be one of the few tools available to revive UK equities. He also made it clear that just because a company adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet doesn’t mean it’ll succeed. “Bitcoin adoption is no magic wand that turns lead into gold,” said Axel, warning that companies must know what they’re doing and whether the strategy fits their business. MicroStrategy outperforms Bitcoin using a three-pronged structure Between 2021 and 2024, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped 7.5x, while Bitcoin rose just 3.2x. According to TOBAM, the outperformance came from three things: turning the stock’s premium into book value and buying more Bitcoin with it, increasing exposure to Bitcoin over time through that same mechanism, and taking advantage of spikes in the premium at which its stock traded compared to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. TOBAM’s study, conducted by Axel along with Yves Choueifaty and Tristan Froidure, says the strategy works best when the company can issue new shares at a premium, then use that money to buy more Bitcoin, generating something they call a “Bitcoin Yield.” When the company sells shares at inflated prices and turns that cash into more Bitcoin, it boosts its exposure and stock performance. In 2021 and 2024, MicroStrategy managed to generate a Bitcoin Yield of around 50%. But of course, the strategy isn’t perfect. In 2023, even though the company added 43% more Bitcoin to its holdings, it had to increase its number of shares by 48%. That meant the Bitcoin Yield turned negative and dragged on the stock’s performance. Bitcoin Price Premium gives investors more than coin performance The paper explains that performance also depends on how far the company’s shares trade above the value of the Bitcoin it holds. This is called the Bitcoin Price Premium, and it fluctuates based on demand. MicroStrategy’s returns were boosted when this premium grew. If the premium had stayed flat in 2021, shareholders would have nearly doubled Bitcoin returns anyway. But because the premium expanded in 2023 and 2024, investors got more—up to three times Bitcoin’s performance in some periods. Exposure also played a role. The company’s realized exposure to Bitcoin (β) was sometimes higher than one. In 2022, during a crypto sell-off, the firm’s stock traded at a discount to its Bitcoin, which pushed its exposure above normal. In 2024, the company started with a relatively low beginning-of-year exposure (β₀ = 0.75), but the massive 61% Bitcoin Yield that year pushed realized exposure to 1.2. Source: Axel Cabrol, Yves Choueifaty, and Tristan Froidure In simple terms, MicroStrategy found ways to give shareholders more upside than Bitcoin itself. This is exactly what UK firms want. But the model only works if the company knows how to manage dilution, time the issuance of shares, and buy Bitcoin strategically. If they screw up the balance, the strategy can collapse fast. Axel said the recent moves by UK small caps to mimic this structure could finally give British retail and wealth investors a practical way into crypto markets. “This will also allow UK wealth and retail investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency where it has previously been more challenging,” he said. With the UK far behind the US in regulated crypto investment options, this indirect route might be the only access some investors have for now. But TOBAM’s research ends on a warning. Axel, Yves, and Tristan made it clear that this model is not a guaranteed fix. Execution is everything. If done wrong, the company ends up with diluted equity and poor returns. If done right, it could be the last card these firms play to stay listed and to finally get some attention from markets that have mostly forgotten them. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

KULR, which has added to its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings since announcing plans to establish a BTC treasury strategy, said in a press release on July 8 that the $20 million credit facility is from Coinbase Credit and will be a multi-draw facility. The company intends to use the facility to purchase additional Bitcoin once Coinbase executes the offer. For a firm that previously committed to allocating up to 90% of its cash surplus toward acquiring Bitcoin as a treasury asset, securing this financing marks a renewed commitment to its BTC-first strategy. In a statement, KULR Technology Group CEO Michael Mo said: “This marks KULR’s first bitcoin-backed credit facility, giving us access to non-dilutive capital at a competitive financing rate. It reflects our commitment to diversifying our funding sources as we continue to execute on long-term growth strategies to drive shareholder value.” You might also like: Metaplanet eyes second stage of BTC strategy, plots acquisition spree Bitcoin treasury companies Since its initial announcement on buying Bitcoin in December 2024, KULR has increased its BTC holdings significantly in 2025. The company held about 430 BTC in early January, but has since boosted that to 920 BTC, its total holdings as of early June. Notably, the company is a member of the Bitcoin for Corporations group led by major Bitcoin treasury company Strategy – formerly MicroStrategy. Michael Saylor’s Strategy tops the list of public Bitcoin treasury companies with 597,325 BTC, while MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, Metaplanet, and Galaxy Digital Holdings round out the top six. According to market data , KULR’s 920 Bitcoin stack puts it position 34, just behind Core Scientific, a company set to be acquired by CoreWeave. There are 60 top public BTC treasury companies, with Rumble, DeFi Technologies and Prenetics among those to join the “MicroStrategy” inspired BTC holders. Many of the companies have taken debt to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. KULR, which picked Coinbase Prime as its partner for custody, stablecoin USDC ( USDC ), and self-custodial wallet services, will secure the Coinbase credit facility using a portion of its BTC holdings.

2025-07-08T16:27:27,"Will XRP price benefit from a short squeeze in July?","The XRP price has formed two distinct chart patterns, signaling a potential short squeeze in July. Ripple ( XRP ) token was trading at $2.30 on Tuesday, June 8, up by over 20% above its lowest level in June. XRP has several fundamentals that may drive its price higher in July. First, its ecosystem is performing well, with tokens like Coreum and Sologenic posting double-digit gains this week. Additionally, the total value locked on the XRP Ledger has risen to $62 million, while the newly launched XRP Ledger EVM has reached $52,000. Second, there are signs that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may finally break above its all-time high this month. Polymarket odds of a strong Bitcoin breakout have continued to rise, as the token has formed both a cup-and-handle and a bullish flag pattern. A breakout in BTC would likely spark gains across the crypto market, including XRP.

It has already surpassed the $485 million mark, and the passage and signing of the GENIUS Act could further accelerate its growth, as Tether ( USDT ) is not compliant. As such, USDT holders in the US will likely be transitioned to other compliant tokens, such as USDC, PYUSD, and RLUSD. The probability that the SEC will approve multiple XRP ETFs later this year remains high at 85%. These funds could become highly successful, as demonstrated by the recent launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Additionally, the XRP price may rebound ahead of Brad Garlinghouse’s scheduled testimony before Congress on July 9. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that an XRP short squeeze could be imminent for two reasons. The token has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a widely followed bullish reversal signal. XRP has also developed a symmetrical triangle, with its trendlines converging near a breakout point. This triangle is part of an eight-month bullish pennant pattern that began following its short squeeze in November of last year. A breakout from this structure could lift XRP toward last year’s high of $3.39, an increase of 48% from current levels. A drop below the support at $1.9130 would invalidate the bullish setup.

Tokenized assets are gradually proving to be a viable alternative to traditional investment instruments. According to a July 8 report by CEX.io, tokenized gold is gaining traction compared to gold ETFs. The asset class has attracted $19 billion in trading volume this year, outpacing several widely held gold ETFs. Trading volume in popular gold ETFs and tokenized gold in the second quarter of 2025 | Source: CEX.io While tokenized gold still trails major ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), it has surpassed many smaller counterparts. The asset class now sees higher trading volume than SGOL, AAAU, IAUM, and OUNZ. Moreover, the growth in tokenized gold trading volume has significantly outpaced all gold ETFs so far this year. In the second quarter of 2025, volume in the asset class rose from $2.4 billion to $19.2 billion—an eightfold increase. This marks part of a broader trend, as tokenized gold has outperformed gold ETFs in trading volume growth for four consecutive quarters.

2025-07-08T16:20:55,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Surge: BTC Breaches $109,000 Mark","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Surge: BTC Breaches $109,000 Mark The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with unprecedented excitement! In a move that has stunned analysts and delighted investors, the Bitcoin price has not just risen, but absolutely exploded, soaring past the psychological and technical barrier of $100,000 to firmly establish itself above $109,000. This monumental achievement, confirmed by leading market monitoring platforms including Bitcoin World, marks a new chapter in the digital asset revolution. What does this incredible milestone mean for the future of finance, and how are investors reacting to this seismic shift? The Unprecedented Rise: BTC Breaches $109,000 According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has risen above $109,000 , trading at this astounding level on the Binance USDT market. This isn’t just a fleeting spike; it represents a significant consolidation of gains, indicating strong buying pressure and robust market confidence. For years, skeptics questioned Bitcoin’s viability, but this latest surge provides undeniable proof of its enduring power and growing mainstream acceptance. The move above $109,000 is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the digital gold narrative gaining immense traction globally. The psychological impact of BTC reaching $109,000 cannot be overstated. For many long-term holders, this is a vindication of their belief in a decentralized future. For new entrants, it’s a compelling invitation to participate in what many believe is the greatest wealth transfer event of our generation. This milestone often triggers a positive feedback loop: rising prices generate more media attention, which attracts more new investors, further fueling demand. The “fear of missing out” (FOMO) becomes a powerful force, drawing in capital from individuals and even smaller institutions who initially hesitated. This collective surge in optimism creates a self-reinforcing cycle, pushing the Bitcoin price to new, unimaginable heights. The narrative shifts from ‘if’ Bitcoin will succeed to ‘how high’ it can go, embedding it deeper into the global financial consciousness. What Propelled This Cryptocurrency Market Triumph? Understanding the catalysts behind such a dramatic ascent is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile yet rewarding cryptocurrency market . Several factors appear to be converging, creating a perfect storm for Bitcoin’s parabolic rise: Institutional Inflow: Major financial institutions, once hesitant, are now aggressively allocating capital into Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, once theoretical, have become a reality, opening floodgates for traditional investors. Global Macroeconomic Factors: Persistent inflation fears and geopolitical uncertainties are driving investors towards hard assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Halving Hype and Scarcity: The inherent scarcity mechanism of Bitcoin, reinforced by its quadrennial halving events, continues to play a pivotal role. Reduced supply issuance combined with soaring demand creates immense upward pressure. Retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): As prices climb, retail investors, who were perhaps on the sidelines, are now rushing back into the market, fearing they will miss out on further gains. This self-fulfilling prophecy often fuels bull runs. The institutional embrace of Bitcoin has been a game-changer. What began as a trickle of interest from venture capitalists and tech-savvy hedge funds has now evolved into a veritable flood of capital from mainstream financial giants. The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets like the United States have democratized access for institutional investors, allowing them to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership or custodial risks. These ETFs provide a regulated, familiar wrapper that fits seamlessly into traditional investment portfolios, attracting pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries seeking diversification and inflation hedges. This unwavering institutional conviction is a foundational pillar supporting the current rally, indicating a deep-pocketed and sophisticated demand side that wasn’t present in earlier bull cycles. The confluence of these elements has transformed the landscape of the cryptocurrency market , demonstrating its resilience and burgeoning maturity. The Echo Effect: Crypto Price Surge Across the Board? When Bitcoin makes such a significant move, the entire ecosystem often follows. This massive crypto price surge in BTC has had a profound ripple effect across the altcoin market. While some altcoins might initially lag as capital flows into Bitcoin, a sustained BTC rally typically leads to an “altcoin season” where profits from Bitcoin are reinvested into other digital assets. We are observing: Altcoin Rally: Many major altcoins, particularly those with strong fundamentals and established ecosystems, are showing significant gains, albeit perhaps not as dramatic as Bitcoin’s. Increased Market Capitalization: The overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space is soaring, reflecting heightened investor confidence across the board. Renewed Developer Activity: A bullish market often stimulates innovation and development within blockchain projects, leading to new features, partnerships, and use cases. This widespread positive sentiment driven by the crypto price surge of Bitcoin is invigorating the entire digital asset landscape, attracting new participants and fostering further innovation. The increased liquidity and visibility brought by Bitcoin’s performance often cascade down to smaller cap assets, allowing them to gain traction and find their own footing within the expanding digital economy. Why the Binance USDT Market is Key to This Breakthrough The fact that BTC is trading at $109,000 on the Binance USDT market is particularly noteworthy. Binance, being the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serves as a bellwether for global crypto activity. The USDT (Tether) pairing is crucial because it represents a direct gateway for stablecoin liquidity into Bitcoin. This indicates: High Liquidity: The depth of the Binance USDT market ensures that large orders can be executed without significant price slippage, reflecting robust demand. Global Accessibility: USDT is a widely used stablecoin, making it accessible to traders worldwide, further solidifying Bitcoin’s global reach. Confidence in Stablecoin Peg: The seamless trading against USDT suggests continued confidence in the stablecoin’s peg to the US dollar, which is vital for maintaining market stability and trust. The strength observed on the Binance USDT market underscores the global nature of this rally and the vast amount of capital flowing into Bitcoin from various sources. Binance’s robust infrastructure and extensive user base provide the necessary platform for such a significant price discovery, allowing millions of traders to participate in real-time. This high trading volume on a leading exchange like Binance further legitimizes the price point, signaling that it’s not merely a localized anomaly but a globally recognized valuation. Historical Precedents and Future Projections: Can the Bitcoin Price Sustain $109,000? Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by extreme volatility, but also by consistent upward trajectories over the long term. Previous bull runs, while impressive, rarely saw such rapid ascension to these heights. The $109,000 mark isn’t just a number; it’s a new frontier. What can we expect next? Consolidation or Further Ascent? After such a parabolic move, some degree of consolidation or a minor pullback is often healthy. However, if the underlying demand remains strong, further upside targets could be in play. New All-Time Highs: With $109,000 now a reality, the focus shifts to potential new all-time highs and the psychological resistance levels beyond. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: As Bitcoin’s market capitalization swells, so too will the attention from regulators worldwide. This could bring both challenges and opportunities for mainstream adoption. While predicting the exact future of the Bitcoin price is impossible, the current momentum suggests a strong foundation for continued growth, albeit with the inherent volatility that defines the crypto space. To put this milestone into perspective, let’s look at Bitcoin’s incredible journey: Milestone Approximate Date Significance $1 February 2011 First parity with USD, marking its initial recognition as a currency. $1,000 November 2013 First major bull run, gaining mainstream media attention and sparking early investor interest. $20,000 December 2017 Peak of the ICO boom, widespread retail frenzy, bringing crypto into household discussions. $69,000 November 2021 Previous all-time high, driven by growing institutional adoption and low interest rates in traditional markets. $109,000 Current Scenario Unprecedented new high, signaling a new era of adoption, maturity, and valuation, moving beyond previous cycles. Navigating the New Frontier: Actionable Insights for Investors For both seasoned investors and newcomers, the current market presents unique opportunities and challenges. Here are some actionable insights to consider in this new era of Bitcoin above $109,000: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrencies you consider. Evaluate whitepapers, use cases, and development teams. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Volatility is inherent, and corrections can be sharp. Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk, spreading your investments over time rather than making a single large purchase. Long-Term Vision: Many seasoned Bitcoin investors advocate for a long-term “HODL” strategy, believing in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value over decades. This approach aims to ride out short-term fluctuations. Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading the charge, explore other promising projects within the cryptocurrency market to diversify your portfolio. This can help spread risk and potentially capture gains from emerging sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or Web3. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources like Bitcoin World, analyze market trends, and understand global economic indicators that might influence crypto prices. Education is your most powerful tool in this dynamic environment. For those considering entering or expanding their position in the Binance USDT market or other exchanges, a strategic approach is vital. Avoid emotional decisions driven by euphoria. Instead, focus on a well-thought-out investment plan. Consider setting clear profit targets and stop-loss levels. Research technical indicators to identify potential entry and exit points, but always remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. Explore different trading strategies, such as swing trading for short-term gains or long-term accumulation. Engage with reputable crypto communities for insights, but always cross-reference information with credible sources. Potential Challenges and What Could Derail the Rally Despite the euphoria, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential headwinds. The journey to and beyond $109,000 won’t be without its bumps: Regulatory Crackdowns: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Onerous regulations could dampen enthusiasm. The rapid ascent of the cryptocurrency market inevitably draws the attention of regulators worldwide. While some jurisdictions have embraced innovation, others remain cautious, citing concerns over consumer protection, illicit activities, and financial stability. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, security breaches on major exchanges, or major FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) campaigns could trigger significant sell-offs. Cybersecurity remains a critical concern for digital assets. Market Corrections: No asset moves up in a straight line forever. Healthy corrections are a natural part of bull markets, and investors should be prepared for them. A 20-30% pullback after such a significant crypto price surge would not be uncommon. Technological Setbacks: While unlikely for Bitcoin itself due to its robust and battle-tested network, issues within the broader blockchain ecosystem or a major vulnerability discovered in a widely used protocol could impact investor confidence across the board. The resilience of the Binance USDT market and other major exchanges will be tested during periods of high volatility, highlighting the importance of robust infrastructure and reliable trading platforms. Investors should always prioritize security, using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and cold storage solutions for significant holdings. Bitcoin’s Utility Beyond Price: The Foundation of Its Value While the price action dominates headlines, it’s essential to remember Bitcoin’s fundamental utility. Beyond being a speculative asset, Bitcoin offers a censorship-resistant, permissionless, and global payment network. It serves as a digital safe haven for individuals in economically unstable regions, a tool for cross-border remittances with lower fees, and a decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems. Its underlying blockchain technology promises transparency and immutability, features that are increasingly valued in a world grappling with trust issues. The rising Bitcoin price simply amplifies the awareness of these intrinsic qualities, encouraging more developers to build on its ecosystem and more users to leverage its capabilities for real-world applications. This underlying utility is what provides long-term value, even amidst market fluctuations. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Gold The ascent of Bitcoin to $109,000 is not merely a statistical anomaly; it’s a profound statement about the shifting paradigms of global finance. It underscores Bitcoin’s growing role as a legitimate, powerful asset class, challenging traditional notions of money and value. This explosive surge, fueled by a confluence of institutional adoption, macroeconomic shifts, and unwavering community belief, signals a new era for digital gold. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, this milestone will undoubtedly be etched into its history as a defining moment. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, the message is clear: Bitcoin is here to stay, and its journey is far from over.

2025-07-08T16:10:55,"Strategy’s Astonishing Bitcoin Holdings: Now 11th Largest US Corporate Treasury","BitcoinWorld Strategy’s Astonishing Bitcoin Holdings: Now 11th Largest US Corporate Treasury Are you tracking the incredible shifts in corporate finance, especially when it comes to digital assets? If so, you’ve likely heard of Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, and their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin. Their latest move solidifies their position as a true titan in the crypto space, with their Strategy Bitcoin holdings reaching unprecedented levels. Decoding Strategy’s Monumental Bitcoin Holdings The recent reports confirming Strategy’s colossal $65 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) holdings have sent ripples through both the cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets. This isn’t just a large sum; it positions the software giant as the eleventh largest corporate treasury holder of BTC in the United States. For a company whose primary business isn’t finance or investment, this level of commitment to a volatile asset like Bitcoin is nothing short of remarkable. It speaks volumes about their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition and its role as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This aggressive accumulation strategy has become a defining characteristic of Strategy’s financial approach, making their every move closely watched by investors and analysts alike. MicroStrategy BTC vs. Tech Giants: A Cash Comparison When we talk about corporate treasuries, it’s common to compare a company’s cash and cash equivalents. Interestingly, Strategy’s impressive MicroStrategy BTC holdings, valued at $65 billion, are now on par with the cash reserves of a tech behemoth like chipmaker NVIDIA, which boasts $66 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This direct comparison highlights a fascinating divergence in corporate treasury management. While NVIDIA maintains liquidity in traditional assets, Strategy has made a strategic decision to allocate a significant portion of its balance sheet to a decentralized, digital asset. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a bold statement about their belief in Bitcoin’s future potential as a primary treasury reserve asset. It challenges the conventional wisdom of what constitutes a ‘safe’ or ‘prudent’ corporate treasury, pushing the boundaries of financial innovation in the corporate world. The Evolving Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Landscape Strategy’s journey is a microcosm of a larger, evolving trend: the increasing adoption of a corporate Bitcoin treasury . What started as a niche strategy by a few pioneering companies is gradually gaining traction, albeit with cautious optimism from many traditional firms. The benefits for companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset are often cited as a hedge against fiat currency depreciation, a potential for significant capital appreciation, and an appeal to a new generation of investors. However, this path is not without its challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin, coupled with an uncertain and evolving regulatory landscape, presents significant risks that corporate treasurers must carefully navigate. Despite these hurdles, Strategy’s continued success and unwavering commitment serve as a powerful case study for other companies considering similar moves, influencing the broader market’s perception of digital assets. Strategy’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Expansion Adding another layer to their already aggressive stance, Strategy recently announced an astonishing $84 billion expansion of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy . This move effectively doubles their previous capital-raising target, signaling an even deeper commitment to accumulating the digital gold. This expansion isn’t just about buying more Bitcoin; it’s about leveraging various financial instruments, often through convertible notes or equity offerings, to fund these massive purchases. This innovative approach allows them to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin acquisitions, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of financial markets and a willingness to utilize every available tool to achieve their ambitious Bitcoin accumulation goals. It’s a strategy that has not only bolstered their balance sheet but also significantly impacted market sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. What This Means for US Corporate BTC Holders and Beyond Strategy’s actions are setting a precedent, not just for US corporate BTC holders but for companies globally. Their consistent accumulation and public advocacy for Bitcoin have undoubtedly influenced other corporations to at least consider, if not outright adopt, similar strategies. This institutional embrace of Bitcoin could lead to increased market stability, greater liquidity, and a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. For investors, Strategy’s moves offer a fascinating insight into a company with a clear, long-term vision for its treasury, distinct from traditional corporate finance. It suggests a future where digital assets play a more central role in corporate balance sheets, potentially accelerating the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Companies watching from the sidelines might find themselves compelled to re-evaluate their own treasury strategies as the digital asset landscape continues to mature. From its initial foray into Bitcoin to becoming one of the largest corporate holders, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has truly redefined what a corporate treasury can look like in the digital age. Their bold moves, substantial holdings, and ambitious acquisition strategy not only highlight their conviction in Bitcoin’s future but also serve as a powerful case study for the evolving financial landscape. As the eleventh largest corporate treasury holder of BTC in the U.S., Strategy continues to be a bellwether for institutional adoption, proving that digital assets are increasingly becoming a cornerstone of modern corporate finance.

The project recently crossed the $800,000 milestone, raising $814,089 so far. Husky Inu (HINU) Readies For Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for its next price increase, which will occur in just over eight hours as its pre-launch phase continues. The latest price increase will see the HINU token rise from its current value of $0.00018632 to $0.00018686. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. The pre-launch picked up where the presale ended, helping empower the fledgling Husky Inu community and allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. Another Milestone In The Bag Husky Inu (HINU) adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise funds more effectively. The pricing strategy allows the project to increase the price of the HINU token every two days, enabling it to raise funds while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering the project’s growing community. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project has raised $814,089 so far, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Bitcoin (BTC), Altcoins Lose Steam The crypto market continued dropping for a second consecutive day, dropping just over 1% to $3.33 trillion. Despite the decline, price action was mixed, with Bitcoin (BTC) registering a marginal decline while Ethereum (ETH) rose over 1%, trading around $2,565. Ripple (XRP) is down over 2%, trading around $2.28, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 1% as it struggles to stay above $150. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 0.50% while Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 1%, trading around $0.581. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Hedera (HBAR) bucked the bearish trend, registering a marginal increase.

2025-07-08T16:02:10,"Data Announced That Indicates a New Turning Point for Bitcoin (BTC)! Is There Still Hope for Ethereum (ETH) and Altcoins?","CoinGlass has released its 2025 first half report. The most important data in the report was that CME’s Bitcoin (BTC) futures open position surpassed Binance and ranked first overall. CME Surpasses Binance in Bitcoin! The open interest size in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has surpassed that of Binance, which is positioned as the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, according to CoinGlass data. The report also stated that Binance's market share has been diluted, and the gap between OKX, Bybit, and Binance has widened. As of June 1, CMEBTC futures open interest reached 158,300 BTC ($16.5 billion), ranking first among all exchanges. With this figure, CME surpassed Binance's 118,700 BTC ($12.3 billion) level for the first time. “This milestone comes as open interest in BTC derivatives surges from $60 billion to over $70 billion in the first half of 2025, driven by large ETF inflows and institutional demand. “Special attention should be paid to the growth in market share of the CME, a traditional exchange, in the futures market.” According to CoinGlass, this shift in these futures is seen as a signal that more institutions are entering the market. Is There Hope for Ethereum and Altcoins? The report also stated that there is a clear divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum and altcoins. It was stated that Bitcoin market dominance strengthened in the first half of 2025 and reached 65% at the end of the second quarter, the highest level since 2021, but altcoins showed significant weakness. Noting that ETH and altcoins have fallen by more than 50%, CoinGlass analysts predicted that in the short term, given the liquidity constraints at the macro level, it is unlikely that the weak momentum in the ETH and altcoin markets will reverse unless there are strong new ecosystem developments or technological breakthroughs. Noting that investor sentiment towards altcoins remains cautious and conservative, analysts added that the addition of staking to ETH spot ETFs could revitalize market risk appetite and improve overall sentiment. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-08T16:01:48,"From Bricks to Bitcoin: Murano’s $500M Treasury Play","Murano Global Investments, a Nasdaq-listed real estate developer and hotel owner, launched a record $500 million Bitcoin treasury program, among the largest non-tech corporate crypto moves to date. The plan: exchange real estate equity for reserves of BTC, taking a cue from MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific in employing digital currencies for balance sheet volatility. How Murano Is Funding Its Bitcoin Treasury Murano purchased a $500 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) with Yorkville Advisors whereby it has the ability to sell stock over time and invest proceeds into Bitcoin. In the first instance, 21 BTC (considerably more than $2.1 million at today's prices) was purchased, with a view to scaling up to the full $500 million depending on market conditions. In order to tap into more capital, Murano is exploring sale-leaseback deals and strategic asset disposals—basically converting illiquid real estate value into liquid high-yielding BTC assets. While this move follows in the steps of MicroStrategy (which used debt and equity to buy over 200,000 BTC) and Semler Scientific, it marks a first for the hospitality and real estate sectors. Strategic Reasoning: Why Bitcoin, Why Now? Murano CEO Elias Sacal explained: ”We consider Bitcoin to be an innovative asset that not only provides long-term growth potential but is also a complement to our balance sheet versus inflation and systemic risk.” By joining the ”Bitcoin for Corporations” alliance (led by BTC Inc and Strategy of Michael Saylor), Murano signals its intent to be among the best industry crypto adoption leaders. The corporation also anticipates starting to accept BTC as payment for accommodations and starting Bitcoin reward schemes to attract crypto-beneficial travelers and diversify its revenue streams. Balance Sheet Impact: Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios Scenario BTC Price Path Potential Impact on Murano’s Treasury Bullish $110,000+ $500M equity could yield 4,500+ BTC Bearish $50,000 $500M equity yields 10,000 BTC, but value drops to $500M Volatile Swings between $50K–$110K Treasury fluctuates with market Murano’s move is designed to hedge against inflation and currency risk, but also exposes the company to Bitcoin’s notorious price swings. The phased approach—gradually converting equity and real estate value—lets the company adapt to market conditions and manage risk. MicroStrategy, Semler, and the New Corporate BTC Wave MicroStrategy was the initial corporate Bitcoin trailblazer to utilize bonds and share issues to accumulate the world's largest corporate BTC holding. As a tech-industry participant, MicroStrategy's highly leveraged accumulation process established the template for public companies interested in utilizing digital assets as a treasury reserve. Their procedure relied on elevated leverage and prominent chief executive officer, so Bitcoin featured centrally in their brand message and investor narrative. Semler Scientific was top story as a medical device company that switched to a Bitcoin treasury model in 2024. Semler's move, in contrast with MicroStrategy's tech roots, meant the move into Bitcoin was spreading beyond software and finance. The company's move to buy a significant portion of its balance sheet in BTC demonstrated that even traditionally fiscally conservative sectors could value digital assets as both a hedge and a growth opportunity. Murano is venturing into new territory as the first big real estate developer to use property equity and sale-leasebacks to fund a BTC war-chest. This strategy is new: rather than tapping pure debt or cash reserves, Murano is literally converting illiquid real estate worth into liquid holdings of Bitcoin. In the process, the company is hedging not just against currency risk and inflation but sending a message that the next leg of corporate adoption of Bitcoin is extending into traditional sectors like real estate and hospitality. Murano's action can set the stage for a broader set of industries to consider digital assets as a strategic balance sheet asset, taking the corporate BTC wave much further than its origins in the tech industry.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9849/from-bricks-to-bitcoin-murano-s-500-m-treasury-play,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T16:00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Bullish Flag Points to $120,000 in July, But This DeFi Altcoin Could Be the Real Bull Run Winner","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to tease a breakout from its bullish flag pattern, with some analysts setting sights on the $120,000 mark in July, many crypto investors are wondering what crypto to buy now for the next leg of the bull run. While BTC dominates the headlines, a lesser-known DeFi altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quietly building momentum, and it might just outpace the giants when the real rally begins. The 5th presale round of Mutuum Finance is already over 60% sold out. Over $11.9 million has been raised and 12,800 investors have been onboarding by the project. With growing whispers of a next crypto to explode, especially in the decentralized finance market, Mutuum Finance could turn out to be the most profitable name of 2025’s crypto comeback. Bitcoin Holds Above $108K as Bull Flag Signals Possible Move to $120K+ Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $108,108, comfortably holding above the $108,000–$110,000 support zone despite a recent pullback. Technical analysts note a classic bullish flag pattern, confirmed by respected traders, which suggests a breakout could propel BTC toward $120,000 by July if it clears key resistance around $109K–$110K. Additionally, strong fundamentals—such as shrinking exchange reserves, continued ETF inflows, and historically bullish seasonality, support the case for further upside. While BTC remains the market leader, some investors are diversifying into early-stage, high-upside projects like Mutuum Finance, currently gaining attention during its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Over 60% Sold Out in Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 is underway and gaining amazing momentum. Already over 12,800 investors have joined the presale and raised $11.9 million, a clear indicator of growing hype. Since Phase 5 already reached 60%, price increases are imminent. Buying now guarantees investors the minimum cost for the maximum ROI. Mutuum Finance Launches $50,000 Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance in its security and transparency emphasis has even introduced its formal Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK with a reward value of 50,000 USDT. The reward is offered in four parts, critical, major, minor and low where there is reward for all types of vulnerability. This is yet another aspect that reflects the proactive approach of Mutuum towards development of trust in terms of strong infrastructure and affirmative security. Moreover, the project is also creating an Ethereum-based full-collateralized stablecoin. The asset will be stable at all times during market downturns compared to algorithmic stablecoins that tend to depeg when there is a volatile market. The Mutuum Finance $100,000 Giveaway The project is already certified by CertiK and is paving the way for massive adoption. To put cherry on top, the platform is running a $100,000 giveaway contest, and 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. While Bitcoin eyes a potential breakout to $120,000 in July, early investors are already positioning themselves in what could be the true bull run winner, Mutuum Finance. With over $11.9 million raised, more than 12,800 investors onboarded, and Phase 5 of the presale already 60% sold out, Mutuum is rapidly gaining momentum. Its fully-audited smart contracts, $50,000 Bug Bounty, and upcoming Ethereum-based stablecoin offer real utility and strong fundamentals in a fast-evolving DeFi landscape. Add to that a $100,000 giveaway, and it’s clear why many are calling Mutuum Finance the next crypto to explode. Secure your MUTM tokens now before the price increases again.

While most altcoins targeted rebounds, Vertex Protocol’s native coin exhibited massive bearishness, driven by the ongoing ecosystem developments. The hybrid decentralized exchange has confirmed that it will shut down its platform on Arbitrum and move to Kraken-backed L2 Ink. Vertex 🏔 @vertex_protocol · Follow A New Chapter – Vertex Joins the Ink Foundation!We’re thrilled to announce that Vertex has entered an agreement to join @inkonchain , bringing our core infrastructure and team to the Ink ecosystem.This marks a major milestone for both Vertex and Ink as we power the next 7:39 pm · 8 Jul 2025 47 Reply Copy link Read 18 replies Meanwhile, this is more than a migration to another blockchain. The protocol is hitting the reset button. That includes retiring native VRTX, sunsetting existing products, and relaunching with an advanced infrastructure. While the overhaul could be a strategic move for long-term growth, native token VRTX saw a massive dip following the announcement. VRTX hovers at $0.006573 after a substantial 41% dip minutes after Vertex Protocol’s announcement. Vertex migrates from Arbitrum to Ink Vertex Protocol launched on Arbitrum in 2023, aiming to be a go-to platform for money markets and perpetual trading. However, the project has failed to gain grounds in the highly competitive DeFi sector. That’s despite massive support from investors during its initial fundraising. Arbitrum has also struggled to keep pace, with 100% of holders of its native ARB experiencing losses at one time . Now, Vertex Protocol is abandoning Arbitrum. It is turning to the new Ink, a new Kraken-incubated L2 network. The decision follows a strategic acquisition, which will see the Ink Foundation taking over Vertex’s technology, including lending systems, core trading functionalities, and an order book engine. Ink Foundation commented: As part of the transition, Vertex will sunset its current EVM deployments. A new version of the DEX will launch exclusively on the Ink Layer-2, purpose-built for speed, capital efficiency, and on-chain composability. This brings Vertex’s synchronous order book engine and perpetual tech directly into Ink’s DeFi stack. However, Ink Foundation will absorb Vertex’s engineering team. The decision to move from Arbitrum aims to bolster the protocol’s growth and survival. Vertex CEO Darius Tabai highlighted that increased competition in the perp sector prompted the migration. He believes Ink’s goal of its layer-2 encompassing a complete vertical integration of multiple applications aligns with Vertex’s growth ambitions. Vertex phases out VRTX token The most striking change in this migration is retiring the native VRTX. Meanwhile, the project will compensate holders with INK airdrop. It will determine eligibility today, July 8, after taking a snapshot. The altcoin has struggled, losing around 98% since its November 2023 debut. Its market cap has plummeted from early 2024 levels of $77 million to press time’s $3.47 million. VRTX trades at 0.006573 after losing 41% on its daily price chart. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its trading volume has increased by nearly 24%, possibly reflecting speculative undertakings as traders capitalize on the prevailing volatility.

Truth Social, Trump’s media company, filed for a new blue chip ETF, combining BTC, ETH, XRP, and CRO. CRO rallied by over 18% on the news of its inclusion in the upcoming ETF by Truth Social. It turned into the top trending token during the relatively slow summer market. CRO became the hottest token for the day, rallying to a one-week high with over 18% in daily gains. | Source: Coingecko The Trump media company announced a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a new Blue Chip ETF. The filing arrives just days after Truth Social announced it started the process for its first ETF, combining BTC and ETH. The actual launch of the ETF depends on regulatory approval, and we are still awaiting a 19b-4 filing with the SEC. The ETF will eventually start trading on NYSE Arca, sponsored by Yorkville America Digital. CRO rises on news of custody service for the ETF The CRO token, native to the Crypto.com platform, rallied by over 15% within hours to trade at $0.094, a one-week peak. CRO rallied after months of sideways trading based on its inclusion in the ETF. The asset has relatively niche markets, lacking a Binance listing. Instead, CRO relies on Upbit and Bitget for the bulk of its trading volumes. CRO will have a 5% weight in the ETF, where BTC will carry 70% of the value, with 15% for ETH, 8$ for SOL, and only 2% for XRP. Despite this, the Crypto.com ecosystem will be key for the new blue-chip fund. SOL and XRP did not react to the news, as their markets were much more liquid. The CRO market is also an anomaly, as the token relies on the Korean won for over 47% of its trading activity. Over 25% of CRO trading is against the US dollar, with another 22% against USDT. In addition to using CRO as part of the ETF basket, Crypto.com would serve as a custodian for all crypto assets. With this move, Truth Social breaks the usual format of ETF custody, which often relies on the Coinbase infrastructure of cold wallets. The platform, which offers a mix of services, including a wallet, payment cards, Web3 services, trading, and even stock investments, will be part of the ETF strategy. The platform will be the prime execution agent for crypto trades, as well as a staking and liquidity provider. Truth Social partnered with Cronos back in March Trump Media Group announced its partnership with Cronos and the Crypto.com ecosystem back in March. The social media company mentioned plans for launching an ETF, though the role of Crypto.com has only become clearer. The choice of CRO as an ETF asset follows the moves of World Liberty Fi to partner with relatively old crypto projects. Cronos and Crypto.com raised doubts after deciding to re-issue 70% of the supply, despite the previous claims that the tokens would be burned forever. Trump’s crypto company, World Liberty Fi, does not own any CRO in its portfolio, as it focuses mostly on the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the token’s rapid market reaction raised skepticism and doubts about potential insider trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-08T15:49:02,"Is $1 Still Possible for Dogecoin (DOGE)? Experts Tip a Newcomer With Real-World Utility to Outperform","The post Is $1 Still Possible for Dogecoin (DOGE)? Experts Tip a Newcomer With Real-World Utility to Outperform appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) blasted from $0.166 to $0.173 on July 6, its best hourly jump in weeks. As fans cheer a possible march back to the one-dollar line, analysts are also whispering about Remittix (RTX) , a little-known payments token now racing toward a key funding goal. Both coins offer upside, but the ways they plan to get there could not be more different. Whale Wave Pushes DOGE Toward Breakout Source: tradingview Fresh on-chain data shows that giant wallets holding one to one-hundred million DOGE scooped up millions of coins during the spike, while smaller traders trimmed positions. This transfer of supply tightens the float and often leads to stronger price swings later. Technically, DOGE is coiling inside a falling-wedge pattern, a setup that can explode when volume returns. A clean daily close above $0.175 would open a sprint to $0.25, the first checkpoint on any trip to a dollar. Drop under $0.16, however, and the bullish script unravels fast. Federal Reserve Hopes Lift Sentiment Dogecoin’s pop isn’t happening in a vacuum. U.S. officials just added three extra weeks to tariff talks, cooling global trade worries. Traders also expect next week’s consumer-price report to show softer inflation. If that happens, the Federal Reserve could hint at rate cuts, giving risk assets like crypto more room to run. Bitcoin already hovers near $110,000; a breakout there usually drags DOGE along for the ride. A hotter inflation print, though, could send all boats lower, trapping meme-coin bulls mid-wedge. Remittix: Turning Crypto Into Cash in Seconds While DOGE leans on macro news and whale wallets, Remittix focuses on something far more practical: moving money. Its coming PayFi wallet, slated for release later this year, will let anyone swap Bitcoin, Ether or XRP into local bank deposits in about ten seconds. There are no weekend delays, no hidden exchange spreads and transfer fees are just fractions of a cent. Every single swap permanently burns a slice of RTX, shrinking supply as the network grows. That built-in scarcity is attracting serious notice: over $16 million has already been raised at $0.0811 per token and the team is sprinting toward an $18 million soft-cap finish. During this final push, new supporters can still claim a 50 percent bonus allocation, making today’s effective entry roughly five cents. Beyond the numbers, two global payout corridors one aimed at Southeast Asia, another at Latin America are lined up for launch right after the wallet goes live. If even a sliver of the $190-trillion global payments market flows through Remittix, daily burns will tighten circulation quickly, giving long-term holders an automatic boost without hype tweets or mascot memes. Conclusion: Two Very Different Moonshots Dogecoin’s path to $1 depends on continued whale buying and a string of friendly macro headlines. If those pieces stay in place, the meme king could rediscover its magic. Remittix, on the other hand, offers a real-world service that slashes costs and time for everyday payments and rewards token holders every time someone clicks “Send.” For investors weighing hype against hard utility, RTX may prove the quieter but smarter play for 2025 and beyond.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake’s Latest Track—Details According to trading data, its price shot from under $10 to a whopping $80 within hours, pushing its fully diluted valuation to nearly $75 billion. But by July 2025, TRUMP had tumbled back to $8.60, a 90% drop from its peak. Its circulating market cap now sits around $1.70 billion, with a fully diluted value of about $8.60 billion. Cross Chain Push Into Tron Based on reports from the project’s official X account, TRUMP plans its first expansion beyond Solana by launching on the Tron blockchain. This move is designed to tap Tron’s large user base and faster transaction speeds. Tron boasts over 100 million accounts and sub‑second confirmations, which the TRUMP team believes could fuel a fresh wave of buyers and traders. $TRUMP on #TRON is coming. Stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/S5WfV8APvU — TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) July 7, 2025 Volatile Price Swings Define TRUMP TRUMP’s rollercoaster debut underlines extreme volatility. After the initial frenzy in January, the coin’s price plummeted by 88% from $80 to $8.60. That slide erased roughly $65 billion in valuation. Today’s price reflects speculative trading rather than any long‑term adoption. Investors who rode the peak saw massive gains briefly, then steep losses just as quickly. Justin Sun’s Big Stake On May 20, 2025, Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he is TRUMP’s largest holder. He reportedly owns nearly $19 million worth of tokens after a $75 million investment in Trump’s World Liberty Financial platform. Sun’s position comes with perks. He won a “private dinner” alongside the top 220 token holders, securing a seat at US President Donald Trump’s Virginia golf club. Critics say that kind of setup blurs the line between crypto hype and pay‑to‑play politics. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Central Control Raises Warnings Two Trump‑affiliated companies, CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, control 80% of TRUMP’s token supply.

That level of centralization runs counter to crypto’s promise of open and fair systems. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley have called for new rules to curb how politicians and their allies can launch or endorse digital coins. They argue that projects like TRUMP could be used for personal gain or campaign boosts, creating a need for clearer boundaries.

The Pakistan government is still engaged with international institutions to refine its proposal to offer subsidised electricity tariffs for crypto mining, after IMF rejected its proposal. #IMF #Pakistan #BitcoinMining https://t.co/DOIm2pNGV7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan confirmed that the IMF has expressed concerns about market distortions and the effects on resource distribution. The Fund questioned the legality of cryptocurrency mining in Pakistan and the additional strain it would put on the already burdened power grid. The IMF noted Pakistan failed to consult the agency ahead of the 2,000MW allocation announcement, seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. Pakistan faces chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, with the IMF warning about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs. Officials involved in negotiations expressed concerns about “ further tough talks ” as the economic team faces tough questions over the initiative. Despite IMF resistance, Pakistan continues to pursue its crypto ambitions through diplomatic channels. U.S. President Trump expressed keen interest in cryptocurrency during a White House lunch with Pakistan Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, discussing economic development and emerging technologies.

2025-07-08T15:17:27,"Tether’s Crystal Intelligence stake adds teeth to stablecoin surveillance push","With law enforcement lagging and users losing billions of dollars to crypto-related scams every year, Tether’s new investment raises a provocative question: are stablecoin firms now the first line of defense? On July 8, USDT issuer Tether announced a strategic investment in Crystal Intelligence, a blockchain forensics firm specializing in fraud detection, risk mapping and regulatory compliance. The deal, undisclosed in size, cements a growing partnership between two firms already collaborating on scam-alert infrastructure and global investigations into illicit crypto flows. For Tether ( USDT ), it amplifies ongoing efforts to combat illicit stablecoin activity, reinforcing tools already used by law enforcement to track and freeze suspicious transactions. By deepening its ties to Crystal, Tether signals a broader shift: Stablecoin issuers, once passive payment rails, are now actively shaping crypto’s security infrastructure. “With the latest in advanced intelligence tools, like those being developed by Crystal Intelligence, we are enhancing our ability to assist authorities in tracing the movement of funds in real time,” Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether said. “This strategic investment will strengthen our capacity to collaborate more effectively and reinforce a clear message: USD₮ is the digital dollar for the people, bad actors will be stopped.” Read more: Semiconductor giant Sequans ditches cash for Bitcoin in $384m treasury overhaul Why Tether is betting big on blockchain forensics Tether’s aggressive push into blockchain surveillance is more about survival than optics. A January 2025 UN report singled out USDT as the “preferred choice” for money launderers and scammers across Southeast Asia, citing its stability and pseudonymous transactions as ideal for illicit flows. Yet that same report contained an inconvenient truth for crypto critics: Less than 1% of all cryptocurrency transactions fund criminal activity. The contradiction underscores Tether’s dilemma. As the world’s most traded crypto asset, with $61.9 billion in daily volume as of press time, dwarfing even Bitcoin ( BTC ), USDT has become both a pillar of crypto markets and a lightning rod for regulators. When nearly 60% of all crypto trades involve Tether, its integrity isn’t just a compliance issue; it’s the linchpin holding together decentralized finance’s liquidity. Since the UN’s rebuke, Tether has gone on the offensive. Its collaboration with the DOJ in June to seize $225 million from pig-butchering rings demonstrated a tangible counterstrike. Now, by investing in Crystal’s forensic tools, Tether is addressing the surveillance gap that regulators have struggled to fill. The strategy serves dual purposes: It disrupts criminal networks exploiting USDT while preempting regulatory crackdowns that could destabilize the stablecoin’s $158.7 billion ecosystem. When law enforcement lacks resources to track cross-border crypto crime, Tether’s real-time freezing capabilities, which are used in 55 jurisdictions, have effectively made the company a private-sector sheriff. With the latest investment, Tether appears to be doubling down on forensic infrastructure before mandates force its hand. With $2.7 billion already frozen and scams proliferating, the message is clear: USDT’s future hinges on being the cleanest dirty shirt in crypto’s laundry.

2025-07-08T15:14:12,"Tether Announces Strategic Partnership To Combat Stablecoin Misuse","According to a press release , the company behind the top stablecoin in the world, Tether, has poured millions of dollars to ink a new partnership. The deal will allow the crypto company to contribute with the overall health of the nascent industry. Tether To Fight Against Crypto Crime Per the document, Tether has partnered with Crystal Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company to provide fraud detection, regulatory intelligence solutions, and risk scams. In that way, the company joins the many efforts of key industry players to combat illicit stablecoin use. The main goal behind the partnership, according to the release, is to create a more secure crypto ecosystem. Data provided by the company claims that over $9.3 billion in digital assets were stolen, or illegally taken from its users in 2024 alone. This number represented a 66% increase from 2023. Thus, the company claims that there has been a steady increase in illicit activities and bad actors in the crypto industry. The partnership with Crystal Intelligence aims to mitigate this threat. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, stated the following regarding the partnership: Tether is firmly committed to supporting law enforcement agencies in a shared effort to combat illicit activity. With the latest in advanced intelligence tools, like those being developed by Crystal Intelligence, we are enhancing our ability to assist authorities in tracing the movement of funds in real time. Tether has already contributed to freezing billions in unlawful funds and has supported investigations across dozens of jurisdictions. This strategic investment will strengthen our capacity to collaborate more effectively and reinforce a clear message: USD₮ is the the digital dollar for the people, bad actors will be stopped. Stablecoin Company Steps Up, Crypto Safety On the Line Tether has been making an extra push for several years to fight against illicit on-chain activity, including aiding international law enforcement agencies to track and freeze funds from bad actors. However, it is also worth noting that Tether has been the subject of some controversy . In particular, the previous US administration launched several investigations against the crypto company, and was close to facing criminal charges for alleged fraud. Navin Gupta, CEO of Crystal Intelligence, added the following regarding the deal: As the crypto industry matures, so must its foundations of trust and intelligence. Tether’s backing is both a validation of the work we’ve done together and a joint commitment to future-proofing the industry through actionable insight, integrity, and innovation. We see too many players waiting for mandates. At Crystal, we believe responsible innovation means getting ahead of threats and not just reacting to them.

2025-07-08T15:13:53,"July Altcoin Week Picks: BTC, SEI, SOL—Ozak AI Aims for $1 as Top Utility-Driven AI Presale","The post July Altcoin Week Picks: BTC, SEI, SOL—Ozak AI Aims for $1 as Top Utility-Driven AI Presale appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News July’s Altcoin Week has seen renewed interest in major digital assets, with Bitcoin (BTC), Sei (SEI), and Solana (SOL) leading the trend. Alongside these established players, Ozak AI ($OZ) is emerging as a utility-driven presale contender, drawing attention with its focus on AI-powered blockchain applications and a growing presale valuation. Currently in the fourth stage of its presale, the $OZ token is priced at $0.005 per token. The project has already secured over $1.30 million in contributions by selling more than 21.48 million tokens. The presale began at $0.001 in Phase 1 and moved through $0.002 and $0.003 in Phases 2 and 3, respectively. With the $OZ token price doubling to $0.01 in the upcoming phase and a projected listing price of $0.05, early investors could see a potential return on investment of nearly 20,000% if the token reaches its long-term $1 target. With a capped supply of 10 billion $OZ tokens, the presale is structured to increase token scarcity ahead of exchange listings. This design aligns with current market interest in projects with limited supply and defined utility. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Bitcoin, SEI, and Solana Show Strength Amid Market Optimism Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, continues to solidify its dominance, currently trading near $107,386. This momentum is supported by a surge in institutional adoption, with Bitcoin ETFs witnessing over $3.9 billion in net inflows in the last fortnight alone. This influx underscores growing confidence among major investors and institutional players, contributing to Bitcoin’s sustained price stability and market leadership. Sei (SEI) also stands out as a dynamic altcoin this week, trading close to $0.27. The token’s recent price stability follows significant developments, including its selection for Wyoming’s pioneering dollar stablecoin pilot program, alongside anticipation of an upcoming version 2 airdrop. These factors have reinforced investor confidence and heightened interest in Sei’s potential as a next-generation blockchain platform. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) remains a key player in the altcoin space, with prices hovering around $144. Analysts highlight that Solana is testing critical resistance levels near $146 to $151, bolstered by optimistic market sentiment tied to pending ETF approvals from major asset managers like Invesco and Galaxy Digital. These developments could pave the way for a potential breakout, reaffirming Solana’s position among top smart contract platforms. Utility Framework Supports AI-Based Financial Analytics Ozak AI operates as a blockchain-based solution provider, utilizing AI tools for data analytics and financial predictions. Its core components include the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data flow, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) for on-chain connectivity, and Ozak Data Vaults to ensure secure data handling. Additionally, its proprietary AI Prediction Agents are built to enhance business and trading decision-making processes. The project’s ecosystem is designed to offer real-world use cases, separating it from speculative or meme-based tokens. With predictive AI tools, Ozak AI aims to support financial institutions, crypto traders, and enterprise users in leveraging timely and accurate analytics. This utility-driven approach is reflected in the presale interest and aligns with broader investor sentiment favoring practical blockchain solutions during this month’s market activities. Price Target and Market Visibility Ahead of Exchange Listings Projections from market analysts indicate that Ozak AI could potentially reach a token value of $1 by 2025. At this price point, the fully diluted market capitalization would stand at $10 billion, comparable to several established AI-powered blockchain entities. These estimates are based on the project’s capped supply model, active development roadmap, and strategic presale structure. Its listing on tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has since enhanced its visibility, further adding to the growing investor interest in light of July Altcoin Week. Discussing BTC, SEI, and SOL, Ozak AI represents the members of this cohort and demonstrates the level of interest in implementing AI in decentralized systems. Ozak AI also operates a 1 million dollar giveaway scheme, which is aimed at the first 100 participants who carry out a promotional exercise. The move is set to boost interaction further in the community before its token launch and subsequent listing on a centralized exchange (CEX).

Bitchat would operate over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing nearby devices to form a mesh network that relays messages hop-by-hop, according to the whitepaper published on Sunday . When a message is sent, it would travel across nearby devices acting as temporary nodes until it reaches its recipient, making it resilient in offline or censored environments. Messages are end-to-end encrypted using Curve25519 and AES-GCM, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them. The protocol does not collect metadata, user identities are obfuscated and messages vanish by default after delivery unless explicitly saved by the user. While not making explicit references to Bitcoin, cryptocurrency or blockchain, Dorsey describes Bitchat as a ""decentralized, peer-to-peer messaing application,"" evoking connections to the Bitcoin whitepaper's intro in which it is described as a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash."" Much like Bitcoin eliminates reliance on centralized intermediaries in finance, Bitchat could remove central authorities from digital communication.

This includes funding future Bitcoin purchases, working capital, and dividend payments to holders of the firm’s Series A Perpetual Strife and Strike Preferred stocks. Strategy holds 597,325 BTC as of July 7. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered during the ongoing session after making a sluggish start to the week. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a substantial drop on Friday, dropping to a low of $107,340. However, it recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,229. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping to a low of $107,562 before settling at $108,283. BTC has remained range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $110,000 in May when it set an all-time high, but has been unable to build on that, with the price pinned below $110,000 in recent sessions. According to Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, some long-term investors may be cashing in, keeping the price in range. Lee stated, “We have clients who have bought bitcoin at $100. They don’t care if bitcoin goes to a million; they are probably sellers at around $100,000.” BTC traded in positive territory the previous weekend, rising 0.14% on Friday and 0.20% on Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1%, crossing $108,000 and settling at $108,350. Despite the positive weekend, BTC was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33% and settled at $105,742. BTC recovered from this level on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Bullish sentiment persisted on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately rising 0.74%. Source: TradingView Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097. It recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,229. Price action turned bearish on Monday as BTC fell 0.87%, falling to an intraday low of $107,562 before settling at $108,283. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $108,500 as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-08T14:51:16,"Bitcoin ETFs Thrive, Just 1 Outflow in 17 Days: Santiment","Santiment has revealed that the Bitcoin ETF streak is still going strong, with only one day of outflows recorded in the last 17 trading days. This comes as analysts say the steady stream of money into the investment vehicles is helping drive Bitcoin prices higher. Sustained ETF Demand According to data shared by Santiment on X, since June 6, there has only been one day with more money leaving than coming into these products. The market intelligence platform also said that this ongoing trend is a positive sign for the future of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. As of July 7, information from Farside Investors shows that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net flow of $216.5 million across all issuers. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $164.6 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s (FBTC) with $66 million. ARK Invest’s (ARKB) and Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of $10.1 million and $10.2 million, while other ETFs, including Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, recorded no activity for the day. This follows a major net outflow of approximately $342 million experienced on July 1, which marked the first negative movement since June 6. Before this, there had been a 15-day streak that had brought in nearly $4.7 billion. This period of sustained demand had also pushed cumulative net inflows to about $49 billion and total ETF assets under management (AUM) to above $131 billion. Bullish Price Predictions So far, spot Bitcoin ETFs have brought in over $14.4 billion this year, including $4.5 billion just in July. Fueled by increased institutional demand, Bitcoin’s price outlook for July 2025 has turned increasingly bullish as analysts project fresh highs based on the record ETF inflows. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, has projected a rise in Bitcoin’s price to $116,000. He identified strong capital injection into spot Bitcoin ETFs as the main driver behind the outlook. “These flows are increasingly outpacing price action, signaling institutional demand driven more by macro concerns than short-term momentum,” he said. On June 30, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and head of research Ryan Rasmussen published a report confirming their $200,000 price target for Bitcoin in 2025. They pointed to historical trends, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $112,000 in May, supported by record ETF inflows. The report also highlighted increasing interest from Bitcoin treasury companies and the formation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve as bullish factors. Hougan and Rasmussen showed further confidence in strong ETF inflows continuing into the second half of the year.

Donald Trump’s Truth Social brand firm is expanding its crypto exposure with a new ‘blue chip’ ETF. On Tuesday, July 8, Trump Media and Technology filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 for a multi-asset crypto ETF. Pending U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the fund will include a 70% Bitcoin (BTC) and a 15% Ethereum (ETH) allocation, and will also feature three prominent altcoins. Specifically, it will have an 8% Solana (SOL) allocation, 5% for Cronos (CRO) , and 2% in XRP (XRP) . The Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, B.T., will be structured as a Nevada business trust and issue its shares on the NYSE Arca. Crypto.com, the issuer of Cronos, will act as the digital custodian for the ETF’s assets. It will also serve as the prime execution agent, as well as the staking and liquidity provider.

For one, Trump Media and Technology also filed for an ETF that included a 75% allocation in Bitcoin and 25% allocation in Ethereum. The fund with the two most popular crypto assets will likely appeal to more risk-averse investors. Crypto.com will also serve as a custodian for this fund. The filings come as the U.S. takes a more friendly approach to crypto regulation. On July 1, reports came out that the SEC is planning to fast-track regulatory approvals for crypto ETFs. In talks with major crypto exchanges, the agency discussed enabling issuers to just file a form S-1 and wait for the required 75 days. If the SEC implements this change, Truth Social’s ETFs may already have done all that is required to get approval. Still, the SEC may require further changes to the filings.

2025-07-08T14:35:46,"6 Best Crypto Presales to Buy in July 2025","The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement, and many savvy investors are considering investing in presales. These presales often offer lower prices and significant growth potential, but they also come with risks, so doing your homework is crucial. With Bitcoin staying strong around $107,000 and big players like BlackRock investing billions into crypto, it’s a great time for new and promising projects to shine. In this guide, we’ve picked six of the best crypto presales to check out this month. These projects stand out due to their strong ideas, growing communities, and real potential to grow fast. From Bitcoin Hyper’s plan to scale Bitcoin, to Snorter’s fun Telegram-based trading bot, these tokens could be the next big thing for investors hoping to multiply their returns. Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now - Top 6 List Here are the top 6 best crypto presales to buy now: Bitcoin Hyper - The First Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain Best Wallet Token - Best Next Gen Wallet Token TOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success SUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform BTC Bull - Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale Snorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot 6 Top Crypto Presales to Buy in July - Full Reviews In this section, you can read our full reviews for each of the best crypto presales to buy in July 2025: Bitcoin Hyper - The First Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain Bitcoin Hyper is a new project that helps make Bitcoin faster and easier to use. It does this by building a second layer (called Layer-2) on top of Bitcoin using Solana’s powerful technology (SVM). This enables super-fast transactions at a cost of as little as $0.01 while also making it possible to utilize Bitcoin in various applications, including DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and online payments. Crucially, the project supports DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and merchant payments, bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed. Its canonical bridge also allows users to lock BTC and mint HYPER tokens, to facilitate seamless DeFi participation. This crypto presales roadmap includes cross-chain interoperability and a mainnet launch by Q4 2025, positioning it as a top contender for investors eyeing Bitcoin’s evolution. Launched in early 2025, this first Bitcoin layer 2 chain project has already raised over $2 million in its presale, and its token, called $HYPER, is currently priced at $0.012175 per token. For those who want to jump on the bandwagon, it can be bought in exchange for ETH, USDT, or BNB; it can also be bought directly through a debit or credit card. Early investors interested in this crypto can stake their tokens to earn high rewards of over 300% APY. These features convinced many analysts and crypto investors that Bitcoin Hyper might be the next 100x crypto. Take note that Bitcoin Hyper’s smart contracts have been audited, and most of the token supply is being sold during the presale, which adds to its credibility. With big companies like BlackRock now investing in Bitcoin, a project like Bitcoin Hyper, which is focused on improving Bitcoin’s speed and usefulness, could be one of the best crypto presales to invest in this month. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Best Wallet Token - Best Next Gen Wallet Token Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the token behind Best Wallet, a non-custodial Web3 wallet that already has millions of users. This real utility non-custodial crypto wallet is designed to be secure, easy to use, and supports over 60 blockchains. With this wallet, users can swap tokens, bridge assets between chains, and even use a privacy mode to hide their private keys. The project is focused on privacy, and you don’t need to do any KYC (know your customer checks) to use it. Presently, $BEST is priced at just $0.025295 in its fifth presale stage, and it has already raised over $13.7 million, which makes it among the top crypto presales of the year. $BEST token holders get real benefits, like lower trading fees, staking rewards, early access to new token presales, and a say in the project’s future through voting. A beta version of the app is expected to launch after it lists on major exchanges like MEXC. The team behind Best Wallet has worked at top tech companies, and the project has been audited by CertiK, making it more trustworthy. It’s also certified by WalletConnect, which adds to its credibility. Looking ahead, if Best Wallet delivers its promised features on time, $BEST could be a great long-term investment, especially for mobile users, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy now. Visit Best Wallet TOKEN6900 - Bold Anti-Corporate Meme Coin Inspired by SPX6900’s Wild Success TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a fun, meme-based new crypto project. $T6900 was inspired by the wild success of SPX6900 in 2024, and it was built to make fun of traditional finance and big corporations. This crypto project has no serious roadmap or complicated plan, just community hype, humor, and a strong meme culture. The project has already raised over $207,000 in its presale, with tokens selling for $0.006475. 80% of the total supply is available to the public, and the hard cap is set at $5 million. Unlike utility-driven projects, TOKEN6900 leans into “vibe liquidity,” offering no roadmap but audited contracts and a developer’s 6,900-token “moonbag” which will be locked for five years to build trust. There’s also a staking feature called the “Brain Rot Vault” that offers a high percentage of over 200% APY, and over 20.7 million tokens have already been staked. Investors can purchase $T6900 using ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or directly through credit cards via the Best Wallet platform, with tokens distributed post-presale. While its transparency and staking rewards are strengths, the absence of real-world use cases means success depends on market sentiment and meme coin trends. So, for investors interested in high-risk, high-reward cryptos, TOKEN6900 is certainly a good investment choice to buy in July 2025. Visit TOKEN6900 SUBBD - The No.1 AI Agent Creator Platform SUBBD ($SUBBD) is an AI-powered Web3 platform that helps content creators use AI to make and share content like voice notes, videos, and personal profiles. Over 3,500 creators with a combined audience of 310 million people are already involved and using the platform. The project is built to help creators connect more deeply with their fans and earn rewards for doing so. Its token, $SUBBD, powers the platform and is now available through an ongoing presale at a discounted price of $0.05585 per token. To date, the project has raised over $754,000. Holders of the $SUBBD token get access to special perks like staking rewards (20% APY), early access to new features, and platform discounts. To help keep the token price steady, SUBBD uses anti-dumping measures such as gradual token releases. The project also plans to fully launch in Q3 2025 and is working with well-known creators to grow its reach. The team includes people with experience at top companies like OpenAI and Google, which helps build trust. Overall, SUBBD stands out because it solves a real problem in the creator space and has a huge potential audience. However, building all of its AI tools might take time. If you’re thinking about investing, it’s a good idea to read their whitepaper and follow SUBBD on Telegram and X (Twitter) for updates on recent developments, and visit the official SUBBD page below. Visit SUBBD BTC Bull - Bitcoin’s Best Crypto Presale BTC Bull provides investors with a token that offers leveraged exposure to Bitcoin's price movements, aiming to amplify gains during bullish trends. Essentially, BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is a meme token designed to follow Bitcoin’s price movements, giving investors an excellent way to take advantage of the BTC bullish uptrend. It rewards holders with real Bitcoin airdrops when Bitcoin reaches big milestones like $150K, $200K, and $250K. The token is currently in its final presale stage, having raised over $8.3 million to date. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at $0.002585 per token, and it can be bought in exchange for crypto or through a bank card on the BTC Bull official page. Much like Bitcoin, the total supply is 21 billion tokens, and to keep the token valuable, the team plans to burn 15% of the supply when Bitcoin hits $125K, $175K, and $225K. The token is built on Ethereum (ERC-20), so it works with most wallets and DeFi platforms. You can also earn a passive income of over 50% APY through staking. This crypto presale, whose success heavily depends on Bitcoin’s performance, ends on July 7, 2025, at 2 PM UTC. Also, BTC Bull’s smart contracts have been audited, and its token plan is clear, which helps reduce the risk of scam, making it an excellent crypto to buy right now Visit BTC Bull Snorter - The Solana Meme Crypto Trading Bot Snorter Token powers a Telegram-native bot for sniping meme coins, with multi-chain support and high staking rewards. This exciting crypto project fuels a Telegram-based trading bot for sniping meme coins on Solana and Ethereum, with plans to expand to BNB, Polygon, and Base. The token is currently priced at $0.0973 in its presale, and the team has already raised over $1.4 million so far. Snorter offers cool features like automated sniping, a tool that detects rug pulls with 85% success (based on beta testing), and low trading fees of just 0.85%. Stakers can earn over 700% APY, and token holders get unlimited snipes plus voting power on future updates. As a result, price expectations for this token are huge, with some analysts predicting a significant increase by the end of the year. With over 5,000 users on Telegram and exchange listings planned after the bot launches in Q3 2025, Snorter aims to become a top tool for meme coin traders, making it one of the best crypto presales to consider in July 2025. Visit Snorter How Can You Buy a Crypto Presale? Here’s a step-by-step procedure on how you can buy a crypto presale; 1. Research: Start by visiting the project’s official website and then proceed to read the whitepaper to understand what the project is about, its goals, token supply, and how it plans to grow. You should also check their social media, like X (Twitter) and Telegram, to see what the community is saying and how active the team is. 2. Set Up a Wallet: You’ll need a crypto wallet that works with the blockchain the project is built on. For example, use MetaMask for Ethereum-based tokens like $BTCBULL, or Phantom for Solana-based tokens like $HYPER. Some projects also support Best Wallet, particularly for presales that utilize multiple payment options. 3. Fund Your Wallet: Buy the cryptocurrency you’ll need to invest using popular cryptos like ETH, BNB, SOL, USDT, or USDC. You can buy crypto on trusted exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, or even use a credit or debit card directly through some presale sites. 4. Connect and Purchase: Connect your wallet to the presale platform and follow the instructions to buy tokens. 5. Confirm and Secure Tokens: After you approve the transaction, you may need to wait for the tokens to be delivered because some projects send them after the presale ends. Furthermore, always keep your wallet’s recovery phrase (seed phrase) safe and never share it with anyone. This is because this phrase gives full access to your wallet, so store it offline in a secure place. What Should You Check Before Investing in a Crypto Presale The following are some of the things you should check before investing in a crypto presale; Whitepaper The whitepaper is like the project’s blueprint. It explains what the project is trying to do, how it works, how the token will be used, and what the future plans are. So, one of the first things you should do before investing in a crypto presale is to read the project’s white paper. Team Credibility Another thing you should check/do before investing in a crypto presale is to verify the team’s experience via LinkedIn or public profiles. For example, SUBBD’s team includes people with backgrounds at OpenAI and Google, which adds trust to the project. On the other hand, if the team is anonymous, be extra cautious and avoid investing. Smart Contract Audits Ensure contracts are audited by firms like CertiK or Hacken, as seen with BTC Bull and Snorter, to reduce rug-pull risks. Community Engagement A strong, active community is a good sign. So, before you invest, look at how many people are following the project on X (Twitter), Telegram, or Discord. Tokenomics and Vesting Tokenomics means how the tokens are created, distributed, and used. Look at how many tokens will exist, who gets them, and how they’re released over time before you invest in any crypto presale. Market Fit and Utility Is the project actually useful, or just hype? Bitcoin Hyper solves Bitcoin’s speed issues, and SUBBD helps content creators use AI. These real-world uses give the project more staying power compared to purely speculative meme coins. Look at the Presale’s Performance Check how much money the project has raised and how much attention it’s getting online. A presale that raises millions and builds buzz on social media often shows strong investor interest. You can also follow updates on sites like CoinMarketCap, ICOBench, or crypto news platforms. Final Word In summary, crypto presales in July 2025 offer a diverse mix of exciting new projects, catering to investors with varying interests. Whether you’re interested in serious utility projects like Bitcoin Hyper and SUBBD or high-risk, high-reward meme tokens like TOKEN6900 and BTC Bull, there’s something for every type of investor. However, it’s essential to remember that presales also come with risks, as prices can fluctuate rapidly, and not all projects will ultimately succeed. That’s why doing your own research is very important. Always read the whitepaper, check if the smart contracts are audited, and look at how active the community is. If you take time to understand the project and only invest what you can afford to lose, presales can be a great way to get in early and see big rewards.

2025-07-08T14:30:58,"$26,501,817,432 in Bitcoin Gobbled Up by Public Companies and Exchange-Traded Funds in Q2 of 2025, According to Analyst","Public companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have acquired Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth tens of billions of dollars in just three months, according to the founder of The Kobeissi Letter, Adam Kobeissi. The macro analyst tells the 938,700 followers of The Kobeissi Letter on the social media platform X that the corporate demand for Bitcoin is “incredibly strong.” According to Kobeissi, public companies and ETFs acquired a combined 242,766 BTC in the quarter that ended on June 30th. “Public companies purchased 131,355 Bitcoins in Q2 2025, growing holdings by +18%, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Furthermore, ETFs acquired 111,411 BTC, posting an +8% rise during the same period. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which companies have bought more Bitcoin than ETFs. Year-to-date, public companies have purchased 237,664 Bitcoin… Now, public companies hold ~855,000 Bitcoin, or ~4% of the total supply. Corporate demand for Bitcoin is incredibly strong.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X As companies and ETFs gobble up Bitcoin at a rapid pace, the pseudonymous crypto analyst and trader, DonAlt, is warning investors that he doesn’t see the accumulation ending well for BTC. But for now, he notes that it might be a good idea to be cautiously bullish on Bitcoin. “To me this is very clear, right? Like this is a clear kind of Ponzi/bubble forming. And it’s really hard to be bullish into that, right? Because you know like, ‘Hey, this is going to implode.’ Like you know how this is going to end. Everyone knows how it’s going to end. That has been around for a little bit. The thing is that in the time that I have been in crypto, whenever a bubble has formed, this is when you actually start having a lot of fun, right? This is when stuff goes up infinitely in a very short amount of time. But then you also have to get out really quickly.” Bitcoin is trading at $108,773 at time of writing.
