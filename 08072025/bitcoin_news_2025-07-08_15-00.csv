2025-07-08T12:55:14,"After BTC & ETH, the Cardano (ADA) Price is Ready for a Breakout—How High Can it Go in 2025?","The post After BTC & ETH, the Cardano (ADA) Price is Ready for a Breakout—How High Can it Go in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano is currently trading within a narrow range, reflecting a period of low volatility and market indecision. The price appears stable for now, with neither bullish nor bearish momentum taking control. This consolidation phase suggests that participants are waiting for clearer cues before committing to a direction. While the broader trend remains uncertain, the current setup may be laying the groundwork for a more decisive move. Until then, the ADA price is believed to remain consolidated below the newly formed threshold. The token has displayed a renewed on-chain strength via whale accumulation and spot demand, with a stable base just below $0.6. Recently, whales have withdrawn nearly $2.33 million worth of ADA from exchanges in the first few days of the month, hinting towards a long-term accumulation by large holders and reduced selling pressure. On the other hand, the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) data indicates growing buy-side dominance in the spot market, which signals that the bullish momentum is strengthening. What’s next? Will ADA Price Reach $1 in July? The ADA price seems to be stuck within a descending parallel channel and is juggling around the average zone. It has risen above the levels and is waiting for the momentum required to rise above the pivotal resistance zone between $0.602 and $0.611. The Bollinger bands have squeezed, hinting towards a massive drop in volatility and low consolidation. This is a signal that the price is heading towards a significant price move, wherein a breakout could be imminent. Interestingly, the RSI also appears to be undergoing a parabolic recovery curve, which suggests the strength of the rally is coiling up. Once the Cardano price breaks out of the consolidation, the Bollinger Band strategy suggests not only a rise above $0.62 but also a test of the upper resistance at $0.71 could be imminent.

After months of aggressive BTC buying, the company says it’s preparing to use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finance acquisitions. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich recently told the Financial Times that the company is in a “Bitcoin gold rush” and wants to use its growing stash to buy real businesses that generate cash. According to him, the firm is following a two-stage plan. First, it will accumulate as much Bitcoin ( BTC ) as possible, and second, use its holdings as collateral to raise funds from lenders, similar to how securities or government bonds are used. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up,” Gerovich said. “Then we have phase two when bitcoin, like securities or government bonds, can be deposited with banks and then they’ll provide very attractive financing against that asset.” Gerovich stated that the generated cash would go toward acquiring “profitable cash-flowing” businesses that align with its current strategy, possibly in digital banking or financial services. You might also like: Metaplanet pumps up Bitcoin holdings with additional 1,234 BTC Metaplanet’s approach mirrors the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the largest corporate holder of BTC. The firm has also issued equity and stock warrants to raise capital, but unlike Strategy, Gerovich said he won’t use convertible debt. “I don’t want to have to pay back the money in three or four years,” he said, adding that the company has no plans to sell its holdings and will continue raising capital to buy more. The CEO’s comments come just a day after Metaplanet announced its biggest Bitcoin purchase to date, buying 2,205 BTC for 34.49 billion yen ( $238 million) and bringing its total to 15,555 BTC. The purchase was funded by stock warrants and bond activity, a structure the firm has used repeatedly this year to raise capital and convert it directly into BTC. Once a hotel management company, Metaplanet adopted its BTC strategy in 2024 and has since grown into the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. The firm has now spent around $1.6 billion on its purchases, with a long-term goal of holding 1% of the total Bitcoin supply, roughly 210,000 BTC by 2027.

2025-07-08T12:50:35,"Bitcoin: Japanese Fashion Giant ANAP Accelerates BTC Holdings, Eyes 1,000+ BTC Target","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Japanese Fashion Giant ANAP Accelerates BTC Holdings, Eyes 1,000+ BTC Target In a bold move signaling growing confidence in digital assets, Japanese fashion brand ANAP Holdings has once again made headlines with its latest Bitcoin acquisition. This strategic decision by a prominent player in the fashion industry underscores a fascinating shift in corporate treasury management and investment strategies across the globe. For those keenly watching the convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy, ANAP’s actions provide compelling insights into the future of institutional engagement with cryptocurrencies. ANAP Holdings’ Growing Bitcoin Portfolio: A Strategic Move? ANAP Holdings, a well-known name in Japan’s fashion landscape, recently announced the purchase of an additional 15.8222 BTC. This significant acquisition, confirmed through a regulatory filing shared by @btcNLNico on X, brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 200.4957 BTC. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the crypto market; the company has been steadily building its digital asset reserves. Their commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury asset became even clearer when they revealed an ambitious plan to acquire over 1,000 BTC by August. Such a target positions ANAP Holdings as a serious long-term holder in the cryptocurrency space. But why is a fashion brand delving so deeply into Bitcoin ? The motivations behind such corporate crypto adoption are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, many companies view Bitcoin as a robust hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a traditional investment portfolio can help diversify risk and potentially enhance returns. Forward-Thinking Treasury Management: Companies like ANAP are embracing innovative treasury strategies, moving beyond traditional cash reserves to explore digital assets with significant growth potential. Brand Positioning: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like blockchain and cryptocurrencies can also enhance a brand’s image as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a younger, tech-savvy demographic. The Broader Trend of Corporate Crypto Adoption: Who Else is Buying? ANAP Holdings is certainly not alone in its pursuit of digital assets. The trend of corporate crypto adoption has been steadily gaining momentum, with companies from various sectors allocating significant portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin . This movement was largely popularized by companies like MicroStrategy, which began accumulating BTC in 2020, paving the way for others to follow suit. Here’s a quick look at how corporate BTC holdings stack up (figures are illustrative and subject to change): Company Industry Approx. BTC Holdings Primary Motivation MicroStrategy Business Intelligence ~226,331 BTC Treasury Reserve Asset Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~17,857 BTC Operational & Treasury Tesla Automotive & Energy ~9,720 BTC Treasury Diversification ANAP Holdings Fashion ~200 BTC (current) Strategic Investment, Treasury The increasing number of public companies engaging in BTC acquisition signifies a maturing market and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This institutional interest provides a layer of stability and credibility to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What Does This BTC Acquisition Mean for the Fashion Brand Crypto Landscape? ANAP’s substantial BTC acquisition sends a strong signal within the fashion industry. While many fashion brands have explored NFTs, metaverse activations, and digital fashion, ANAP is directly investing in the underlying digital currency. This could inspire other traditional companies, particularly those looking to appeal to a digitally native audience, to reconsider their treasury strategies. The implications are far-reaching: New Investment Paradigm: It challenges the conventional wisdom that only tech or financial companies should hold crypto. Increased Mainstream Adoption: As more consumer-facing brands hold Bitcoin, it normalizes cryptocurrency in the public eye, potentially leading to broader retail adoption. Potential for Future Integration: While ANAP’s primary focus seems to be treasury management, this could pave the way for future crypto-related services within their brand, such as accepting Bitcoin for payments or launching loyalty programs on blockchain. The Road Ahead: ANAP’s 1,000+ BTC Target and Beyond ANAP’s goal to accumulate over 1,000 BTC by August is a bold statement of intent. Achieving this target would place them among the most significant corporate holders of Bitcoin globally, especially for a company outside the traditional tech or finance sectors. This commitment suggests a deep belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the evolving global economy. For investors, ANAP’s actions serve as an example of how established companies are adapting to the digital age. It highlights the potential for fashion brand crypto engagement to move beyond marketing gimmicks into fundamental financial strategy. As more companies follow suit, the demand for Bitcoin could see a sustained increase, further solidifying its position as a digital store of value. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors: Evaluate Your Treasury Strategy: Businesses should assess whether digital assets like Bitcoin could play a role in diversifying their treasury reserves. Understand the Risks: While opportunities are significant, volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain. Thorough due diligence is crucial. Stay Informed: The corporate crypto landscape is dynamic. Keeping abreast of major acquisitions and regulatory changes is vital. ANAP Holdings’ continued and expanding investment in Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to a changing corporate mindset. As traditional industries increasingly embrace digital assets, the lines between conventional finance and the crypto world continue to blur. ANAP’s journey towards its 1,000+ BTC goal will be closely watched, potentially inspiring a new wave of corporate crypto adoption and further integrating digital currencies into the global economic fabric.

2025-07-08T12:46:19,"Persistent Selling on Binance Derivatives Meets Stubborn Bitcoin Resilience","For the past 45 days, Binance Derivatives has witnessed relentless sell-side activity from taker users. This is evident in the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD), which remains negative throughout the period. Despite aggressive short positions via market sales, Bitcoin has maintained its range between $100,000 and $110,000 and has effectively absorbed the ongoing sell pressure. Bitcoin Absorbs Aggressive Shorts Binance traders have viewed each bounce or rally as an opportunity to enter shorts, highlighting a consistent bearish sentiment among derivatives traders. Yet, the price structure has remained intact. CryptoQuant explained that this suggests potential for further upside if the current trend persists. The CVD, which aggregates taker and maker activity to track net buy/sell pressure, further confirmed the dominance of sell-side flows, with consistent declines reflecting aggressive selling. However, Bitcoin’s strength amid these flows may indicate absorption by larger institutional players operating quietly in the background. The divergence between the relentless selling on Binance Derivatives and Bitcoin’s stable price action is notable, which could set the stage for a breakout if the absorption of sell pressure persists. As long as the leading crypto asset continues to trade within its current range while absorbing aggressive sell flows, the structure remains bullish. Meanwhile, the funding rates on Binance have declined even as Bitcoin consolidates above $108,000, as traders are betting against a rally. Such a setup could add upward momentum if forced liquidations occur. Altcoins, however, have struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin’s resilience during this period. Altcoins Show Fatigue According to Kaiko, Bitcoin is charting its course in 2025, owing to rising institutional flows, regulatory clarity, and deepening liquidity on US exchanges. Investors are now looking for cues to a potential impending breakout. So far, the data leans bullish. Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have outpaced most altcoins, with its Sharpe ratio surpassing even high-flyers like SOL and XRP. Lower volatility and steady institutional demand are reinforcing this divergence, while altcoins are showing signs of fatigue. Market activity within altcoins is consolidating, with the top ten now making up 63% of altcoin volume, up from 50% months ago, as smaller-cap tokens lose traction.

2025-07-08T12:40:33,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Unleashing Growth with The Blockchain Group’s $3.52M Boost","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Unleashing Growth with The Blockchain Group’s $3.52M Boost In a significant move that underscores the growing confidence in digital assets, The Blockchain Group, a prominent French blockchain company, has successfully secured approximately €3 million ($3.52 million) in funding. This substantial capital injection is earmarked to further expand its already robust Bitcoin treasury strategy , a clear signal of the company’s long-term conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. With an impressive existing holding of 1,904 BTC, this latest funding round positions The Blockchain Group as a notable player in the evolving landscape of corporate digital asset management. Who is The Blockchain Group and Why Does This Funding Matter for Their Bitcoin Treasury Strategy ? The Blockchain Group is not just another tech startup; it’s a publicly listed French company at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Their focus spans various aspects of the blockchain ecosystem, from advisory services to developing practical applications. The decision to aggressively pursue a Bitcoin treasury strategy isn’t merely a speculative bet; it’s a strategic allocation of corporate reserves designed to hedge against inflation, diversify traditional asset holdings, and potentially benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. This fresh infusion of $3.52 million is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence from investors who believe in The Blockchain Group’s vision and its pragmatic approach to integrating Bitcoin into its financial framework. For a company that already holds a substantial amount of BTC, this funding allows them to: Amplify Holdings: Acquire more Bitcoin, increasing their exposure to a potentially appreciating asset. Strengthen Balance Sheet: Enhance the company’s financial resilience by diversifying its treasury assets beyond fiat currencies. Signal Confidence: Send a strong message to the market and other corporations about the viability and wisdom of adopting a Bitcoin-centric treasury. Fund Operations: While primarily for treasury, a strong financial position indirectly supports ongoing research, development, and expansion into new blockchain ventures. Unpacking the Crypto Investment : What Drives Companies to Bitcoin? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy has gained significant traction, especially following the economic uncertainties of recent years. Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional cash reserves, which are often eroded by inflation, towards alternative assets that offer both stability and growth potential. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has emerged as a compelling option for several reasons: Why Bitcoin for Corporate Treasuries? Inflation Hedge: With central banks printing vast amounts of money, the purchasing power of fiat currencies is diminishing. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, is often seen as a digital form of ‘hard money’ that can preserve value over time. Potential for Appreciation: While past performance is not indicative of future results, Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets, offering significant capital appreciation opportunities for long-term holders. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies the asset base, reducing reliance on a single currency or asset class. Accessibility and Liquidity: Bitcoin is a globally accessible and highly liquid asset, making it relatively easy to acquire and, if necessary, liquidate. Technological Alignment: For blockchain companies like The Blockchain Group, holding Bitcoin aligns with their core business and expertise, showcasing their commitment to the digital economy. This latest crypto investment by The Blockchain Group highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to embrace digital assets not just as speculative instruments, but as legitimate components of their long-term financial planning. The Global Surge in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption : Is This the New Norm? The Blockchain Group’s move is part of a larger, global phenomenon of corporate Bitcoin adoption . While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example, having amassed over 200,000 BTC, many other public and private companies are following suit. This trend signals a maturing market and an increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value. Key Players in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Beyond MicroStrategy, companies like Tesla, Square (now Block), and various investment funds have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Each company has its unique rationale, but the underlying theme is a recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties in a volatile global economy. The Blockchain Group’s proactive approach, especially as a European company, sets a precedent for others in the region. This shift isn’t without its challenges. Volatility remains a significant concern, and companies must have a clear risk management strategy in place. Regulatory uncertainty also poses a hurdle in some jurisdictions. However, as the infrastructure around digital assets matures and regulatory clarity improves, the path for more widespread corporate Bitcoin adoption becomes smoother. Beyond BTC: The Future of Digital Asset Strategy for Corporations While Bitcoin is currently the cornerstone of The Blockchain Group’s treasury strategy, this significant funding also opens doors for a broader digital asset strategy . The crypto ecosystem is vast and evolving, encompassing a wide range of assets and opportunities. Could The Blockchain Group explore: Ethereum (ETH) Holdings: As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum offers different utility and growth potential. Stablecoins: For managing operational liquidity with less volatility risk. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols: Engaging with DeFi for yield generation on existing assets, though this comes with higher risk. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens): Exploring the potential of NFTs for branding, community engagement, or intellectual property. The company’s expertise in blockchain technology positions it uniquely to navigate these complex waters. Their decision to double down on Bitcoin suggests a foundational belief in the asset’s long-term value, but it also provides the financial flexibility to explore other facets of the digital asset landscape as it matures. The evolution of corporate treasuries to include digital assets is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It reflects a proactive stance by companies to adapt to new financial paradigms and leverage innovative solutions for long-term stability and growth. The Blockchain Group’s strategic funding is not just a win for them, but a significant milestone for the broader digital asset economy, demonstrating that smart capital is increasingly flowing into this transformative sector. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future The $3.52 million funding secured by The Blockchain Group marks a pivotal moment in its journey to solidify its Bitcoin treasury strategy . With 1,904 BTC already in its coffers, this investment reinforces the company’s commitment to leveraging digital assets for corporate financial strength and innovation. It’s a clear indicator that crypto investment is no longer on the fringes but is becoming an integral part of sophisticated corporate finance. As more companies embrace corporate Bitcoin adoption , driven by the desire for inflation hedges and diversified portfolios, we are witnessing a fundamental shift in how businesses manage their wealth. The Blockchain Group’s move is a compelling example of a proactive digital asset strategy that could inspire many others to follow suit, paving the way for a more decentralized and resilient global economy.

2025-07-08T12:38:02,"Ethereum crypto could be next big treasury asset amid $5B tokenization boom","Ethereum’s growing dominance in RWA tokenization is boosting its narrative as a treasury asset. Ethereum (ETH) is quickly gaining traction as a major platform for tokenized assets. Notably, over $5 billion in RWAs are now managed on Ethereum, including treasuries and other real-world assets. In a commentary shared with crypto.news, NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef explained how this is opening up new avenues for ETH. “From tokenized U.S. treasuries to institutional-grade stablecoin rails, Ethereum is becoming the de facto layer for compliant, on-chain finance. Corporations are catching on to ETH as both a utility network and a strategic store of value in line with its ‘digital oil’ narrative,” Ray Youssef, NoOnes. Ethereum’s “digital oil” narrative stems from its utility as the “gas” powering its expansive decentralized finance ecosystem, which includes layer 2 networks. The network is dominant not only in stablecoin issuance but also in a wide range of decentralized finance applications beyond tokenized assets. You might also like: Ethereum price action confirms bull trap at $2,550: major support level lost Franklin Templeton and BlackRock jump on Ethereum Several other developments are also boosting Ethereum’s attractiveness as a treasury asset. One is the network’s shift in tokenomics, including deflationary fee burns and native staking. This structure combines yield with scarcity, making Ethereum more appealing as a treasury holding. Regulatory clarity around Ethereum is also improving, particularly in relation to ETH-based exchange-traded funds. For this reason, traditional finance firms like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock are already embracing the trend, with Ethereum gaining recognition alongside Bitcoin (BTC) . You might also like: Ethereum price stalls, but ongoing accumulation points to a surge “With the SEC signaling more flexibility around ETH-based ETFs and firms like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock actively investing in building tokenized offerings on Ethereum, the risk premium is diminishing.

2025-07-08T12:30:30,"Eric Trump’s Pivotal Address at BTC Asia: What it Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld Eric Trump’s Pivotal Address at BTC Asia: What it Means for Crypto The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to headlines, but every now and then, an announcement truly captures the industry’s attention. One such moment is fast approaching: Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, is slated to address the prestigious BTC Asia conference in Hong Kong from August 28 to 29. This isn’t just another speaker announcement; it’s a significant intersection of high-profile political lineage and the burgeoning digital asset space, sparking conversations about mainstream adoption, regulatory shifts, and the evolving perception of crypto globally. Eric Trump’s Role in the Crypto Conversation When a figure like Eric Trump steps onto a stage at a major digital asset event, it inevitably raises questions and expectations. While the Trump family’s direct involvement with cryptocurrency has been varied – from skepticism to more recent, albeit cautious, engagement – Eric Trump’s presence at BTC Asia signals a growing comfort and interest from traditional political spheres in the crypto world. His background in business and real estate, coupled with his high public profile, positions him as a unique voice in discussions around innovation, finance, and the future of technology. His appearance could be interpreted in several ways: Mainstream Validation: It lends an air of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space, suggesting that digital assets are moving beyond niche circles and into the mainstream consciousness, even among established political families. Policy Influence: While Eric Trump does not hold a current political office, his insights and discussions could subtly influence broader conversations within conservative circles regarding blockchain technology and digital currencies. Bridging Divides: His participation might serve as a bridge between traditional finance/politics and the decentralized world, fostering dialogue and understanding. The content of his speech remains to be seen, but the very fact of his attendance is a powerful statement about the increasing relevance of crypto in global discourse. BTC Asia: A Premier Stage for Digital Assets The BTC Asia conference is not just any event; it’s a cornerstone gathering for the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency community in the Asian region. Known for attracting a diverse range of participants, from developers and entrepreneurs to investors and policymakers, BTC Asia serves as a critical platform for networking, knowledge exchange, and shaping the industry’s future. Previous editions have featured leading figures in blockchain technology, finance, and regulatory bodies, making it a highly anticipated event on the global crypto calendar. Why is BTC Asia so significant? Regional Hub: It consolidates Asia’s position as a vital hub for cryptocurrency innovation and adoption, bringing together key players from across the continent. Thought Leadership: The conference is a melting pot of ideas, where new projects are unveiled, regulatory frameworks are debated, and the latest technological advancements are showcased. Networking Opportunities: It offers unparalleled opportunities for industry professionals to connect, collaborate, and forge partnerships that drive the ecosystem forward. The inclusion of a speaker of Eric Trump’s caliber elevates the conference’s profile even further, drawing eyes from beyond the immediate crypto community. Hong Kong’s Pivotal Role in the Global Crypto Landscape The choice of Hong Kong as the venue for BTC Asia, and consequently for Eric Trump’s address, is highly symbolic. Historically a global financial powerhouse, Hong Kong has been navigating its path in the digital asset space with a nuanced approach. While facing unique geopolitical considerations, the city has recently shown a renewed commitment to becoming a leading virtual asset hub, implementing clear regulatory frameworks and attracting crypto businesses. Hong Kong’s advantages as a crypto hub include: Strategic Location: Its proximity to mainland China and its role as a gateway to Asia make it an ideal location for international crypto events. Developing Regulations: The Hong Kong government has been proactive in developing a comprehensive regulatory regime for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), aiming to provide clarity and foster responsible growth. Financial Infrastructure: A robust financial infrastructure and a pool of skilled professionals support the growth of the digital asset industry. Eric Trump’s presence in Hong Kong at such a critical juncture underscores the city’s ambition and its increasing importance in the global cryptocurrency narrative. Navigating the Future of Cryptocurrency with High-Profile Engagement The broader implications of such high-profile appearances on the future of cryptocurrency are profound. As digital assets continue to gain traction, the involvement of figures from traditional political and business spheres can significantly influence public perception, investor confidence, and regulatory direction. This kind of engagement helps demystify crypto for a wider audience, moving it from the fringes to the forefront of financial discussions. Benefits of High-Profile Engagement: Increased Awareness: Generates significant media attention, introducing crypto to new demographics. Legitimacy Boost: Helps to shed the perception of crypto as solely speculative or illicit, presenting it as a legitimate financial and technological innovation. Potential for Advocacy: Influential figures can become advocates for sensible regulation and innovation, potentially shaping favorable policy environments. Potential Challenges: Misinformation Risk: High-profile figures might inadvertently spread misinformation or oversimplify complex crypto concepts. Political Polarization: Crypto could become entangled in partisan politics, potentially hindering its bipartisan adoption or regulatory progress. Unrealistic Expectations: Their involvement might create an inflated sense of immediate impact or unrealistic market expectations. Ultimately, the net effect is likely positive, pushing cryptocurrency further into the mainstream conversation and accelerating its integration into the global economy. What to Expect from a High-Stakes Bitcoin Conference Attending or following a Bitcoin conference like BTC Asia, especially with a speaker of Eric Trump’s stature, offers unique insights. Beyond the specific address, these events are barometers for the industry’s health and future direction. Attendees can expect: Keynote Speeches: Insights from industry leaders on market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory outlooks. Panel Discussions: Lively debates on pressing issues such as decentralization, CBDCs, NFTs, and DeFi. Networking Opportunities: Chances to connect with innovators, investors, and fellow enthusiasts. Project Showcases: Discovering new blockchain projects, startups, and technological solutions. For those interested in the evolving landscape of digital assets, Eric Trump’s speech at BTC Asia will be a moment to watch. It underscores the growing importance of crypto in global finance and politics, signaling a future where these two powerful forces are increasingly intertwined. A Lasting Impression Eric Trump’s upcoming address at the BTC Asia conference in Hong Kong is more than just a speaking engagement; it’s a symbolic event marking the continued convergence of traditional power structures and the disruptive force of cryptocurrency.

Adoption started slowly around mid‑2023. It rose further in early 2024. Then by January 2025, the line on the stacked chart shot straight up. That jump comes as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pour in fresh tokens. Faster trades and fewer middlemen are big draws. Trades that once took days can now settle in minutes or seconds. That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money. Ethereum still faces questions about scaling. If gas fees jump again, trading costs could rise sharply.

With $6 billion on‑chain, tokenized assets are past the trial stage. More firms will likely join once rules firm up and scaling solutions roll out. Markets could see new fund types, cross‑border trades and on‑chain yield tools. For now, Ethereum holds the lead.

2025-07-08T12:29:03,"Metaplanet Reveals Phase Two of Bitcoin Strategy, Begins Acquisition Push","The post Metaplanet Reveals Phase Two of Bitcoin Strategy, Begins Acquisition Push appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Japan’s Metaplanet has clearly moved beyond just stacking Bitcoin. Now, it’s ready to put it to work. The Tokyo-listed company, once known for running hotels, has taken a sharp turn in recent years, becoming one of the world’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin holders. And now, it’s entering what CEO Simon Gerovich calls “phase two” of its strategy: using Bitcoin as collateral to finance acquisitions of profitable businesses. From Holding to Building Metaplanet added 2,205 BTC this week, bringing its total to 15,555 BTC, currently worth around $1.7 billion. That makes it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder outside of North America. But Gerovich wants to turn Bitcoin into a financial engine. “Then we have phase two… when bitcoin, like securities or government bonds, can be deposited with banks and then they’ll provide very attractive financing against that asset,” he told the Financial Times. With that financing, Metaplanet plans to buy cash-flowing businesses and grow beyond just being a BTC-heavy balance sheet. The Bigger Target: 210,000 BTC by 2027 Yes, you read that right. Metaplanet has set its sights on 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can… to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up,” Gerovich said. Phase one is all about accumulation. Phase two is about turning that position into real-world power and scale. Bitcoin as Collateral? Still Uncommon, But That’s the Point While crypto-backed lending is common in crypto circles, it’s still rare in traditional finance. But that’s exactly where Metaplanet sees the opportunity. By using BTC like bonds or stocks, the company believes it can unlock capital that others can’t. It has already raised funds through bond sales and stock rights, and now it wants to move faster than the competition while Bitcoin is still available in meaningful volumes. Gerovich expects phase one to last four to six more years, but once availability tightens, it could get harder for others to catch up.

Trump’s Trade Deadline With 50% Tariffs Could Kill Bitcoin Rally Despite robust flows, short-term catalysts could create pressure for BTC. Notably, President Trump’s July 9 trade deadline postponment presents a significant risk factor.

Source: TradingView This area aligns with the 0.65 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels, creating a high-probability demand zone for potential re-entry. The scenario envisions a liquidity grab below local lows, triggering buy-side interest and filling the imbalance before a strong bullish continuation. If this sweep and bounce materialize, projections indicate an aggressive move toward all-time highs, potentially around $110,000–$112,000, where substantial liquidity has been identified. The technical setup favors a short-term dip into key support levels followed by a rally toward higher highs, contingent on a successful reaction from the 0.786 Fibonacci zone.

2025-07-08T12:25:03,"SEC Begins Review of Trump Media’s Bitcoin and Ether ETF","The U.S. SEC has formally accepted Trump Media’s application for a Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), beginning the countdown for a decision on the proposed product. According to the filing, the ETF would offer investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether through shares listed on NYSE Arca, with an allocation of 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether. Foris DAX Trust Company, operating as Crypto.com, will serve as the custodian for the ETF, while Yorkville America Digital will act as the sponsor. The application arrives amid a surge of crypto ETF filings, with the SEC reportedly considering a simplified approval structure to streamline the review process for crypto-based ETFs. The proposed ETF from Trump Media’s Truth Social platform is designed to provide daily valuations of its crypto holdings using the CME CF Bitcoin and Ether reference rates, ensuring transparent pricing aligned with aggregated trade data from multiple crypto exchanges. The filing also outlines strict custody procedures, stating that Bitcoin and Ether holdings will be stored in cold wallets, separated from other customer assets under Crypto.com’s custody. Fidelity’s Solana ETF Faces Further Delay While Trump Media’s ETF application advances, the SEC has once again delayed its decision on Fidelity’s proposed spot Solana ETF . The regulator has opened a new public comment window, seeking responses within 21 days and rebuttals within 35 days, extending the review process for one of the first proposed Solana ETFs in the U.S. Fidelity’s application, initially filed by Cboe BZX Exchange on March 25, has become a closely watched case within the crypto community. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart commented on X that the delay was “expected” and noted that a broader crypto ETP (exchange-traded product) framework from the SEC remains pending. Signs of SEC Progress on Crypto ETFs Despite the delay for Fidelity, industry analysts see encouraging signs of movement from the SEC on crypto-related ETFs . Seyffart highlighted reports that the agency is asking issuers of Solana spot ETFs to amend and refile applications by the end of the month, suggesting ongoing engagement rather than outright rejection. “Any sort of interactions between the SEC and issuers or exchanges should be viewed positively,” Seyffart noted . He added that while these amendments do not signal immediate approvals, they indicate a willingness by the regulator to advance discussions on crypto ETPs.

Investors are hopeful that the token is getting closer to a big breakout, but when? Let’s find out in this XRP price prediction. Table of Contents What is XRP? XRP short-term price prediction XRP coin price prediction: short-term outlook XRP price factors for July 2025 Currently ranked in the 4th position with a market cap of $135.1 billion, XRP ( XRP ) has depreciated around 41% in price since reaching an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. The token has seen a lot of range, and is currently holding the $2-3 range, with long-term investors still hopeful on a big breakout and a move to a new ATH for this token. XRP 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the XRP price prediction by giving you its short-term and long-term price forecasts, and specifically focus on XRP price prediction in July 2025. What is XRP? The cryptocurrency XRP is a native token of the open-source blockchain XRP Ledger. The purpose of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is to facilitate international money transactions and currency exchange. Additionally, investors use it to profit from market changes and store value. On its payment platform, blockchain services provider Ripple also uses XRP and the XRP Ledger to let enterprises, organizations, and financial institutions conduct transactions. The holders of XRP maintain that the token has a lot of upside in the coming years, and due to its large fan base, it is ranked among the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world. Now let’s discuss XRP price prediction in July 2025, both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well. You might also like: XRP price prediction in June 2025 – the constant range is close to a breakout above? XRP short-term price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the XRP token? Let’s analyze this token for a short-term outlook and then discuss XRP price prediction in July 2025. XRP coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s XRP price prediction for the near future, the token is predicted to drop by -0.63% and reach $2.26 by August 7, 2025. Analysts on X believe XRP is on its way to $3, and after breaking that, it can touch $4 as well. #XRP massive buy set up spot One of the most beautiful charts right now Expecting XRP at $4 this year, big moves ahead Called this beast at $0.15, $0,38, $0,50, wont stop! pic.twitter.com/qVqE9NCV6F — Doctor Profit 🇨🇭 (@DrProfitCrypto) June 25, 2025 Other analysts are also looking at buy signals, with some hinting at a ‘strong buy’ for this token. #XRP is doing something again! What is it ?? #Bitcoin #crypto #altcoins pic.twitter.com/cpqRmj6Cok — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) July 8, 2025 XRP price factors for July 2025 As XRP is consolidating under a tightening technical triangle in July 2025 so far, it has stayed range-bound between about $2.20 and $2.60, signals indicating an impending breakout. The Teucrium 2× Long Daily XRP ETF’s exceeding of $158 million in assets under management, which represents consistent weekly inflows since April and a recent $33 million jump, is what spurred this move. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has remained well below its May peak of about $112K, ranging between $108,500 and $109,000. The robust Bitcoin foundation is indicative of the overall robustness of cryptocurrencies driven by growing institutional adoption: A layer of political support has been provided by President Trump’s executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve (including XRP), the U.S. GENIUS Act, and spot BTC ETF inflows exceeding $14 billion in H1 2025. There are still conflicting macroeconomic indicators. Expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year are being factored into market prices, which might spark major cryptocurrency rallies again. However, as evidenced by the July 7 declines in the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Bitcoin, Trump’s trade tariff threats have rattled stocks and could cause some volatility. Given the robust ETF performance, encouraging macrotrends, and advantageous U.S. crypto policy, XRP appears to be well-positioned for a breakout, as evidenced by recent tight consolidation. Either a flood of new ETF inflows or Bitcoin breaking through the ~$110K barrier zone will probably be the major catalyst. The path toward $3.00‑$3.50 could be opened with a strong advance through ~$2.60–$2.70. However, cautious traders are keeping a close eye on XRP because of its past failures, which have been dictated by historical prudence. If macro and on-chain trends combine, July appears to be the likely turning point. You might also like: XRP price nears breakout as top Ripple ETF hits $158m milestone Is XRP a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including XRP, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the XRP token. Will XRP go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the XRP token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for XRP price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low XRP can go. Should I invest in XRP? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any XRP price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the XRP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-07-08T12:17:43,"Dormant Ethereum Wallets Reawaken as Buterin Pushes for Copyleft Licensing","Two Ethereum wallets dating back to the blockchain’s 2015 genesis block reactivated on Monday, transferring a combined 1,140 ETH worth nearly $2.9 million after nearly a decade of dormancy. The rare movement comes as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publishes a new blog post outlining his support for more restrictive “copyleft” software licenses, urging the crypto community to adopt legal tools that ensure public access to derivative works. Dormant Since Genesis: Two Early Ethereum Wallets Reactivate After Nearly a Decade On Monday, blockchain sleuths observed two Ethereum wallets—first activated on July 30, 2015—spring to life after nearly a decade of dormancy. The wallets, labeled “ 0x27 ” and “ 0x7f ,” transferred a combined total of 1,140 Ether (ETH), now valued at close to $2.9 million. 900 ETH moved after nearly a decade of dormancy (Source: Whale Alert ) Both addresses received their ETH allocations during Ethereum’s genesis block, the very beginning of the network’s operational life. Their initial funding is marked “GENESIS” on Etherscan, underscoring their historic roots in the Ethereum “Frontier” era—the experimental phase that kicked off the world’s leading smart contract platform. Ethereum was worth mere cents when these wallets were funded in 2015. According to TradingView data , the price of ETH has risen by an eye-watering 89,450% since then, fueled by the network’s growing dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, and a broad range of Web3 applications. ETH-USD price change over time (Source: TradingView ) The wallets’ silent holdings have since matured into multimillion-dollar assets—highlighting the immense gains long-term holders, or “hodlers,” have seen since Ethereum's inception. Part of a Larger Trend: Dormant Crypto Wallets Reawaken These Ethereum movements are part of a broader pattern that has gained momentum in 2024 and 2025. Last Friday, three dormant Bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era—inactive for 14 years—moved billions of dollars worth of BTC. In total, reactivated wallets from that era transferred around $44 million in assets. Such events typically stir excitement and speculation in the crypto community, especially as the motivations behind these reactivations remain unknown. They raise questions about whether early adopters are simply securing their funds, preparing to sell, or re-engaging with the evolving crypto landscape. The reactivated wallets also serve as a living snapshot of how much Ethereum has changed since 2015. Originally launched as a proof-of-work (PoW) network, Ethereum has since undergone one of the most important transitions in blockchain history. In September 2022, Ethereum completed The Merge, moving from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus to improve energy efficiency and scalability. This transition set the stage for additional upgrades aimed at making Ethereum faster, more secure, and easier to use. Vitalik Buterin Advocates for “Copyleft” Licensing Shift to Protect Open Source in Competitive Crypto Landscape Meanwhile, in a newly published blog post on Monday, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin unveiled a major pivot in his perspective on software publishing. While he has historically supported permissive open-source licenses—which allow anyone to use, modify, and redistribute code freely—Buterin now endorses ”copyleft” licenses, which impose conditions on how modified code can be reused. “If you create and distribute a derivative work by modifying it or combining it with other work, the new work must also be released under the same license,” Buterin wrote, referencing widely used copyleft licenses such as Creative Commons BY-SA (ShareAlike) and the GNU General Public License (GPL). Buterin emphasized that he remains largely skeptical of copyright in principle. However, his evolving stance is driven by a strategic shift: to use copyright as a tool to keep open-source ecosystems alive and robust in the face of growing privatization and commercial control. Buterin’s change in viewpoint doesn’t emerge in a vacuum. He cites several converging factors as influencing this philosophical recalibration, notably the mainstream adoption of open-source code by large corporations and the evolving nature of the crypto sector itself. “The crypto space in particular has become more competitive and mercenary,” Buterin wrote. “We are less able than before to count on people open-sourcing their work purely out of niceness.” This observation reflects a maturing crypto ecosystem where major players—including venture-backed startups and tech giants—are increasingly leveraging open-source infrastructure for proprietary gain. In such an environment, relying on goodwill and voluntary collaboration may no longer be enough, Buterin warns. He argues that copyleft licenses can serve as a kind of ”hard power”, compelling developers who benefit from public codebases to contribute back to the ecosystem. It’s a system of mutual accountability designed to ensure the recursive openness that has historically defined projects like Linux, Wikipedia, and Ethereum itself. From Cypherpunks to Corporations: A Strained Ideal The roots of the cryptocurrency movement are deeply embedded in the cypherpunk ethos, which champions privacy, decentralization, and radical transparency through open-source software. In the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum, many developers chose to license their code under MIT, Apache, or BSD licenses—minimalist legal structures that impose few, if any, restrictions on downstream use. But as billions of dollars have flowed into Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain gaming, the crypto world has witnessed a clash between altruism and opportunism. Some developers still publish their source code freely, while others—particularly in the NFT and Web3 art sectors—seek stronger protections to maintain control over intellectual property. “The argument for open source cannot just rely on ‘please,’” Buterin said. “It must also be accompanied by the hard power of giving access to some code only to those who open up theirs.” The copyleft model, originally championed by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, mandates that any modified or derivative work must be distributed under the same license. While this ensures that improvements to a project remain free and accessible, it can also discourage corporate adoption and create licensing incompatibilities. Critics argue that such restrictions may hinder collaboration or make open-source software less appealing for commercial projects. Permissive licenses, in contrast, are easier for companies to adopt and integrate—at the cost of potentially locking up public code in private repositories. Buterin’s call for a hybrid approach—where some projects use copyleft strategically while others remain permissive—offers a middle ground that may better reflect today’s hybrid crypto ecosystem, where innovation and profit often intersect. Impact on Ethereum and the Broader Ecosystem Buterin did not directly indicate whether Ethereum’s core codebase would adopt new licensing standards, but his public endorsement of copyleft licensing is likely to spark broader debates among Web3 developers, founders, and community stewards. Ethereum itself has always straddled the line between public infrastructure and competitive advantage. While most of its client implementations and tools are open source, the platform is now home to thousands of projects—some openly licensed, others tightly guarded. In the long run, Buterin’s advocacy may influence emerging standards for Layer 2 rollups, smart contract tooling, decentralized applications, and even DAOs, especially those that wish to maintain community alignment and forkability. Buterin’s mention of Creative Commons licenses is especially significant in the context of NFTs and digital art. The NFT sector has been a battleground for competing ideologies: some creators push for strong copyright protections, while others release their work under public domain or ShareAlike terms. The Future of Open Source in Crypto Vitalik Buterin’s latest stance is more than a personal musing—it’s a reflection of the changing pressures and politics of open source in a rapidly evolving digital economy. In many ways, it echoes the concerns of early internet visionaries who feared the commodification of public goods. Whether his words spark a shift in licensing practices across the Ethereum community or remain an intellectual contribution to the debate, one thing is clear: the next chapter of open source in crypto may require a stronger legal backbone to uphold the ideals of transparency, collaboration, and decentralization.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9845/dormant-ethereum-wallets-reawaken-as-buterin-pushes-for-copyleft-licensing,"ETH|ZRX|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T12:17:09,"Semler Scientific Gets Buy Rating From Benchmark, $101 Price Target on Bitcoin Treasury Pivot","Benchmark's Mark Palmer initiated coverage of Semler Scientific (SMLR) with a buy rating and a $101 price target, citing the company’s dramatic pivot from medical diagnostics to bitcoin (BTC) accumulation as a key value driver. Semler, which spent over 15 years focused on chronic disease detection, adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in May last year. The move made it only the second U.S.-listed firm, after Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Since then, the company has acquired roughly 4,636 BTC for $430 million, with an average cost basis of $92,753 per bitcoin, the report said. Palmer noted that the stock rallied 178% in the six and a half months following its Bitcoin Standard announcement, peaking at $81.56 in December 2024. However, the analyst argued that Semler still trades at a steep discount compared to bitcoin treasury peers. Its multiple of net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.25, compared to 4.29 for Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) and 6.45 for France’s Blockchain Group (ALTBG), the analyst noted. Benchmark believes this gap could close. Management recently appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy and outlined bold BTC accumulation targets: 10,000 BTC by end of 2025, 42,000 by end of 2026, and 105,000 by end of 2027. The report notes that resolving legal and regulatory headwinds from Semler’s legacy healthcare business, including a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and Medicare reimbursement uncertainties, could help lift its valuation further. Benchmark’s $101 price target is based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that assumes bitcoin will hit $225,000 by year-end 2026.

2025-07-08T12:14:11,"SOL ETF Approval May Come Early, Solana Activity Soars","TL;DR SSK’s strong debut with $33M volume puts pressure on SEC to approve more Solana ETFs quickly. Network daily active addresses spike to 14.63M, signaling rising user interest and platform usage. Solana ETF Coming Earlier? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is moving faster than expected on spot Solana (SOL) ETF applications. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the SEC asked fund issuers to submit updated S-1 filings before the end of July. These updates must include details on staking and in-kind transactions. Although the Commission has until October 10 to make a final decision, it may act before that date. This shift in pace appears connected to the recent approval of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF (SSK). That fund launched under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allowed it to start trading without a formal approval unless the SEC intervened. SSK Launch Raises Urgency for Other Filings SSK’s launch gives it a key advantage over other proposed ETFs still under review. It became the first Solana staking fund available to U.S. investors. The SEC has previously tried to avoid giving early access to one fund by approving similar products at the same time. This was the case with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. One person familiar with the matter said the existence of an active Solana ETF could increase pressure on the SEC to approve additional filings without delay. The Commission’s request for issuers to update their paperwork suggests the process may now move faster than originally planned. Strong Trading Start for First Solana ETF As CryptoPotato reported , SSK began trading last week and drew $12 million in inflows on its first day. It also recorded $33 million in volume, based on data from Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. These early numbers reflect growing interest in Solana-related investment products. Notably, on-chain data shows a sharp increase in the network’s usage. According to Santiment data, daily active addresses reached 14.63 million on July 7. Just days earlier, activity had remained below 5 million. Source: X Meanwhile, the rise in user activity comes at a time when Solana’s market price has stayed steady. SOL was trading at $150.06 at press time, down 1.48% over the past 24 hours. Over the last week, the price has gained 0.61%. Trading volume sits above $4.28 billion. If activity on the network continues to grow, it may support long-term interest from investors and fund managers.

2025-07-08T12:11:55,"Worldcoin Price Fluctuates as Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Stable Growth Potential and Token Holder Rewards with 0.5 BTC","The post Worldcoin Price Fluctuates as Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers Stable Growth Potential and Token Holder Rewards with 0.5 BTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a year where altcoins continue to defy logic and gravity, Worldcoin has found itself on a rollercoaster of sharp rises and sudden dips. While the biometric identity project keeps grabbing headlines, it’s the volatility that’s raising eyebrows. But what if you could step off the price rollercoaster and onto something a little more… stable, yet way more rewarding? That’s exactly what Bitcoin Solaris is offering: a clear-cut path with less turbulence and more potential upside. The presale is moving fast, user growth is exploding, and unlike the unpredictable swings of Worldcoin, BTC-S is focused on real technological delivery. A Look at Worldcoin: Big Idea, Bumpy Ride Worldcoin’s grand ambition to create a global digital identity system is ambitious and futuristic. It leverages iris scans, biometric hardware, and novel economic models to onboard users across the globe. There’s no doubt the vision is bold, but the execution has come with concerns. • Regulatory pressure is mounting • Price has fluctuated wildly over short periods • Concerns about privacy and decentralization persist Worldcoin might be one of the most talked-about projects, but many investors are now eyeing alternatives that offer both excitement and direction. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris Different? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) was built to do one thing extremely well: deliver true financial empowerment through next-gen tech and community-first design. While Bitcoin proved what decentralized money can do, Solaris expands that vision into real-time performance, green infrastructure, and a fully featured ecosystem. Some standout elements include: • 10,000+ transactions per second • 2-second finality • 99.95% energy efficiency improvement over traditional PoW • Dual-layer consensus with Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work integration • Real smart contracts • Cross-chain compatibility The Path Is Set: What the Roadmap Promises Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t rely on hype alone. Its roadmap is packed with real, scheduled milestones from now through 2028. • Q2–Q4 2025: Core dev, whitepaper updates, presale launch • Q1 2026: Wallet release, testnet, Solana integration, full audits • Q2 2026: Exchange listings, marketing ramp-up • Q3 2026: Mainnet goes live, Solaris Nova App launches • Q4 2026: DApp accelerator, hardware wallet compatibility • 2027: Layer-2 scaling, quantum resistance, institutional solutions • 2028+: Global education, AI-driven network optimization, public sector integration This isn’t just a token. It’s a structured platform with enterprise-grade goals. Mini-Games, Real Bitcoin: Blockchain Gaming with Token Holder Rewards Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just about speed and security. The platform also brings the fun. Token holders get access to Blockchain Gaming features where participants can win up to 0.5 BTC through daily and tiered reward systems. It works like this: • One free daily spin for every user • Higher tiers unlock more spins with larger reward potential • Spend $250+ for a shot at 5% bonus tokens • Spend $500+ or $1000+ to unlock up to 13% • Spend $2500+ to access the grand prize: up to 0.5 BTC This structure brings casual fun into serious crypto holding. And since these are chance-based and limited to verified purchases, they also support a balanced token distribution model. It’s a blend of entertainment and reward built directly into the Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem. Presale Momentum: One of the Fastest Rises in 2025 Right now, Bitcoin Solaris is in Phase 11 of its presale. • Current price: $11 • Launch price: $20 • Potential return: 150% But here’s the twist: for a very short time, the team has announced a rollback event, dropping the price back to $5 temporarily. That’s right. A $20 launch with a $5 entry means a staggering 185% gain for those who move now. With over $6.3 million raised and 13,900+ users already onboard, this presale has become one of the most explosive early-stage offerings of the year. And with less than 4 weeks to go, the window to get in before the launch is shrinking fast. The presale isn’t just fast. It’s user-friendly. And to ensure seamless token delivery, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended to receive your BTC-S on launch day. This simple step makes sure your tokens are secure and ready when the market opens. Final Verdict: Why the Shift from Worldcoin to Bitcoin Solaris Is Growing Investors want vision, but they also want results. Worldcoin might have the flash, but Bitcoin Solaris brings the firepower, plus the roadmap, the speed, the staking, and the rewards to back it up. With a community-driven model, clean tech, and clever rewards baked into its ecosystem, Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a presale. It’s a chance to rebuild wealth with precision. And yes, for the first time ever, a Blockchain Gaming system might just make your wallet heavier in the most entertaining way possible.

The ETH/BTC pair has signaled a market reversal amid the anticipated capitulation of the macro Bitcoin dominance. ETH price has consistently held above a crucial support level around $2,500 in the recent past. Ethereum (ETH) has gradually gained bullish ground over Bitcoin (BTC) in the recent past amid an anticipated crypto constructive breakout. On-chain data analysis shows institutional investors have been increasing their Ether position, with some – led by Bit Digital – ditching Bitcoin to get Ethereum’s exposure.

2025-07-08T12:08:42,"MiCA Approvals Surge Across EU – Is This a New Era for the Best Cryptos to Buy?","The EU just handed out 53 Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) licenses: firm-level approval under one of the toughest crypto frameworks to date. According to new data shared by Circle’s Patrick Hansen , the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has authorized a wave of crypto-native firms, TradFi giants, and fintech platforms to operate seamlessly across all 30 European Economic Area (EEA) countries. The list includes Robinhood, Crypto.com, Societe Generale, Circle, and even decentralized payment processors like Bitpanda and MoonPay. But Binance and Tether didn’t make the cut, raising eyebrows and marking a potential power shift in who dominates the European crypto landscape. Nevertheless, this is the first time we’ve seen such clean regulatory clarity from a major economic zone, and it’s a big deal. Regulated crypto is here. And if MiCA is the green light for adoption, then the next logical question is: Where’s the smart money going? We’ll spotlight this shift in more detail and uncover three projects that align with the direction MiCA is pushing the industry. MiCA Approvals Signal Global Crypto Shift The approved 53 crypto firms under MiCA include 14 stablecoin issuers and 39 Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs), setting a new global benchmark for regulatory clarity. These licenses come with passporting rights, meaning approved companies can legally operate across all 30 EEA countries without reapplying in each one. Names like BBVA, OKX, eToro, Coinbase, and Kraken are now fully licensed, signaling that both TradFi and crypto-native firms are playing ball. The takeaway? Regulation isn’t killing crypto; it’s legitimizing it. And it’s not just about checking compliance boxes anymore. In this new landscape, the projects that thrive won’t be those shouting the loudest but those building with regulation in mind, ready to scale with the system rather than outside it. The Best Cryptos to Buy in This New MiCA Era So, what kind of projects actually stand to benefit in this new regulatory climate? Here are three tokens that align with where crypto’s heading next: 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Finally Gets an Execution Layer Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value is ironclad, but what about its utility? Still stuck in 2015 . Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to change that with a Layer 2 solution that’ll integrate Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM), effectively turning Bitcoin into a fast, programmable, and DeFi-compatible network. With near-instant $BTC transfers, cross-chain swaps, and support for complex Decentralized Apps (dApps), Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring real speed and smart contracts to the most trusted blockchain on earth without giving up its security. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs ensure finality, while the Canonical Bridge handles $BTC deposits and withdrawals seamlessly. $HYPER being the forefront of this innovative plan could see the token reach $0.32 by the end of the year. The $HYPER presale has already raised $2M+, with one token currently costing just $0.012175 — early birds can also stake their tokens (currently sitting at 386% APY). No VC allocations. No insider minting. Just a clean, public launch. In a crypto climate shifting toward real infrastructure and compliance-readiness, Bitcoin Hyper gives Bitcoin what it’s always lacked: a real execution layer. For more information, here’s a full guide on how to buy $HYPER tokens . 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Built for Utility, Ready for What’s Next The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the gateway to one of crypto’s most rapidly growing ecosystems. Holding $BEST unlocks a range of real, usable benefits inside the Best Wallet app, a non-custodial wallet built for the next phase of Web3. That includes up to 100% APY in staking rewards, reduced transaction fees, early access to the hottest crypto presales , and even exclusive perks through its iGaming partnerships. Over $13.75M has already been raised in the presale, with the current price at $0.025295. And soon, Best Card will launch – giving users a way to spend crypto like cash, with cashback perks and fee discounts baked in. It’ll work anywhere Mastercard is accepted. $BEST is the fuel for an expanding ecosystem that’s designed to reward actual usage, not just speculation. We’ve predicted that $BEST could reach between $0.43 and $0.82 by 2030. For more, here’s a full guide on Best Wallet Token – where we discuss in depth what it is, how it works, and more. 3. Chainlink ($LINK) – The Oracle Backbone of Regulated Crypto If the MiCA era is about connecting crypto to the real economy, then Chainlink ($LINK) is the protocol already doing it. With over $9B in market cap, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network provides the critical infrastructure for bringing off-chain data on-chain. From asset prices and weather feeds to bond yields and real-world identity. As the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs) accelerates, Chainlink is quietly becoming the data layer for this $300T market. It’s already working with central banks, TradFi institutions, and infrastructure providers, and its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is powering seamless value transfers across chains and legacy systems like SWIFT. $LINK currently trades at $13.49, still far below its all-time high of $52.88. With Chainlink Staking v0.2 improving oracle security via slashing and the new Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) poised to streamline RWA automation, $LINK is increasingly positioned as a compliant, foundational asset in crypto’s regulated future. A Turning Point MiCA is no longer just a headline. It’s now policy, and it marks a clear turning point: crypto isn’t dying; it’s ramping up. The next phase belongs to projects that combine real infrastructure with forward-looking narratives, whether that’s Bitcoin finally gaining scalable DeFi with projects like Bitcoin Hyper , wallets built for the new Web3 user, or oracle networks linking TradFi rails to on-chain logic.

According to on-chain data , the wallet address 1J3B2ucUpWjWPPpejUCoLN93Gwz3q65CTd originally acquired these Bitcoin holdings on July 25, 2019, when the cryptocurrency was trading at $9,796 per coin. The initial investment totaled $58.77 million, which has now appreciated to $649 million, representing a remarkable 1,004% return over the holding period. Bitcoin wallet address moves 6,000 BTC. Source: BitInfoCharts The entire wallet balance was transferred in a single transaction executed earlier today on July 8. Despite the size of the transaction, Bitcoin’s price has remained stable following the move, suggesting the funds may have been moved to another wallet or through over-the-counter channels rather than on public exchanges. Satoshi-era wallet moves $1 billion of BTC The $600 million transaction comes just days after an even more remarkable on-chain movement tied to Bitcoin’s early history. Specifically, on July, 4 a long-dormant wallet from 2011 transferred Bitcoin valued at approximately $1.09 billion . The wallet originally received these coins on April 3, 2011, when Bitcoin was trading at just $0.78 per coin, representing a total investment of only $7,805 that grew to over $1 billion after 14 years of inactivity. While the identity of the wallet’s owner remains unknown, transactions of this age frequently stir speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto , although blockchain analysts have confirmed that this address is not among those linked to the elusive Bitcoin creator. The whale transactions coincide with a remarkable surge in Bitcoin wealth distribution. Over 26,000 new addresses holding $1 million or more in BTC were added in the first half of 2025 alone, demonstrating how Bitcoin continues to create new millionaires while rewarding early believers with extraordinary returns.

A recent filing showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accepted the application for a Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund. Truth Social first lodged its S-1 form with the SEC for the crypto ETF that holds both Bitcoin and Ethereum on June 16. According to the filing, the ETF is meant to offer investors exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investors will be able to gain exposure through NYSE Arca shares backed by the two crypto assets. The filing proposes that the ETF will have a 75% portion allocated to Bitcoin and 25% linked to Ether. The custodian for the fund will be Crypto.com , also known as Foris DAX Trust Company. Meanwhile, the fund’s sponsor will be asset management firm Yorkville America Digital. You might also like: Trump’s Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product If approved, Trump Media vows to evaluate each portion of its ETF based on CME CF reference rates. This means that the three-quarter portion of Bitcoin will be calculated based on aggregated trade data from multiple major crypto exchanges. The same can be said about the Ether share of the fund. However, Trump Media also notes that this is subject to change, based on the fund sponsor’s judgement which requires “sole discretion.” Earlier today, the SEC reportedly asked asset managers applying for spot Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded funds to re-submit Forms S-1 before the end of July. Analysts such as Bloomberg’s James Seyffart have long doubted the possibility of the SEC approving another SOL ETF. Earlier this year, the SEC gave the green light for the listing and trading of the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF.

Valued at over $80 billion at current prices, the milestone follows its latest purchase of 1,388 BTC as part of its ongoing aggressive accumulation, according to ApolloSats co-founder Thomas Fahrer. IBIT has recorded immense success since launched, amassing $76 billion in assets under management (AUM) and accounting for 96% of net inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs to date. The fund has constantly reinforced its position as a top performer among the investment products that debuted in January 2024, now generating more annual revenue than BlackRock’s long-standing S&P 500 ETF, IVV.

With its portfolio milestone, BlackRock ranks among the largest Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing even top corporate holders like Strategy, Tesla, and Coinbase. Several industry figures have called the milestone remarkable.

2025-07-08T12:05:43,"Analysis: Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands squeeze hints at bullish breakout","Bitcoin is flashing early signs of a potential breakout as volatility tightens, a pattern often followed by significant price movement. At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $108,494, slightly down 0.3% over the past 24 hours. The price has ranged between $105,430 and $110,307 in the past week and remains just 3% below its all-time high of $111,814, set in late May. Technical analyst Axel Adler highlighted a key development on a July 8 post on X. The Bollinger Bands on Bitcoin’s daily chart have contracted sharply, with the distance between the upper and lower bands now just 7.7%. This is among the narrowest ranges seen throughout the current bull cycle. Currently, we are observing a classic Bollinger Bands squeeze: the range between the upper and lower boundaries has fallen to 7.7% one of the lowest values throughout the entire bull cycle. The decrease in volatility indicates energy accumulation in the market the price is ready… pic.twitter.com/anv5GSzVlU — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) July 8, 2025 Historically, such squeezes often indicate energy buildup, with breakouts more likely to occur in the direction of the prevailing trend, which in this case, remains upward. According to Adler’s analysis, there have been six notable Bollinger Band squeezes in this cycle. You might also like: Bitcoin price outlook: $108k CME gap may trigger short-term pullback Price increases immediately followed four of them, while the remaining two experienced short consolidations before starting to rise again. Despite the possibility of a brief pause in momentum , this historical context indicates that the current squeeze may be the beginning of a new leg higher. Another well-known valuation metric, the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple, is currently trading at 1.1x, which is well within its neutral range of 0.8x to 1.5x. This implies that Bitcoin may still be cheap in relation to earlier bull market peaks and is not overbought by historical standards. In essence, the market appears to be well-positioned for further gains, with valuation metrics offering support. Market activity has also picked up. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stands at over $26 billion, up more than 34% from the previous day. In times of tight price consolidation, rising volume is frequently seen as a sign of increased investor interest before a possible move. On the technical side, the daily chart shows BTC trading comfortably above its 20-day simple moving average, with Bollinger Bands beginning to squeeze tightly. Bitcoin may still rise before reaching overbought territory, according to the RSI, which is currently neutral at 55. While momentum has been flat, the recent uptick in volume and historical context of similar patterns suggest a bullish bias. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Bitcoin could test and possibly surpass the all-time high of $111,814 if it breaks convincingly above $110,300. If the 20-day moving average around $106,600 is not maintained, a deeper retracement toward $102,000 may be possible. For now, market structure and tightening volatility favor the bulls.

2025-07-08T12:04:21,"Will Musk’s Fight With Trump Crash Both Tesla Stock and Bitcoin?","The post Will Musk’s Fight With Trump Crash Both Tesla Stock and Bitcoin? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk’s feud with President Trump is no longer just political – it’s hitting the markets. With Tesla’s stock slipping and Bitcoin under pressure, the fallout is raising serious concerns for both traditional investors and the crypto crowd. Where will this feud end up? Tesla Stock Tanks After Political Showdown Since Musk publicly criticized Trump’s $5 trillion spending bill in June and launched his new political group, the America Party , Tesla shares have dropped 14%. On July 7 alone, they fell another 6.8%, wiping out $79 billion in value. The bigger worry is what comes next. With Republicans now holding power across all three branches of the U.S. government, investors fear Tesla could lose its favorable treatment – especially government support for electric vehicles. SpaceX, which relies on $22 billion in federal contracts, could also face serious disruption. Tesla’s Bitcoin Holdings Now a Market Risk Tesla owns 11,509 BTC, originally valued at $1.2 billion. But with Bitcoin down 12%, that stash is now worth around $951 million. If Tesla’s stock keeps falling, Musk may be forced to sell some of the company’s Bitcoin to raise cash. That could trigger a chain reaction in the crypto market. Investor sentiment is already shaky, and a major sell-off by Tesla would only deepen the uncertainty, potentially dragging Bitcoin prices down even further. How Tesla Could Move the Bitcoin Market Thanks to new FASB accounting rules in 2025, Tesla now has to report quarterly valuations of its Bitcoin holdings. Earlier this year, when Bitcoin dropped to $93,000, Tesla took a hit. But back in Q4 2024, when Bitcoin spiked to $106,000, the company saw a $600 million boost in profits. Now, with markets on edge and Tesla’s stock in decline, investors are wondering what Musk will do. Selling could crash prices. But holding firm would send a message of strength and help stabilize the crypto market. What Experts Say Crypto analyst Nic Puckrin said the Musk-Trump feud was predictable, but their media dominance is unsettling markets, and rising tensions could make things worse. Anthony Pompliano said Musk could use Tesla’s Bitcoin to offset Trump’s EV subsidy cuts. He views Musk’s America Party as pro-Bitcoin and expects Tesla to hold or grow its BTC holdings for financial stability amid a feud with Trump.

Many investors feel this is where Musk should be focusing his attention, not on founding a political party. SpaceX’s Mars mission and Musk’s AI venture xAI aren’t exposed to public market swings like Tesla is. But Tesla’s board, though supportive so far, may push for Musk to refocus on business and settle tensions with the Trump administration. Here’s the Bottom Line Musk’s next move matters. If he holds Tesla’s Bitcoin, it could stabilize the crypto market. But if he’s forced to sell, it could spark another wave of volatility. As Tesla’s fate becomes more tied to Musk’s politics, the entire crypto space is watching closely.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-musks-fight-with-trump-crash-both-tesla-stock-and-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-08T12:00:57,"DigitalX Propels Forward with Landmark $13.48M Funding for Bitcoin Investment","BitcoinWorld DigitalX Propels Forward with Landmark $13.48M Funding for Bitcoin Investment In the fast-evolving world of digital assets, a significant development has caught the eye of investors and enthusiasts alike. DigitalX, an Australian-based pioneer in digital asset management, has successfully closed a substantial funding round, raising approximately A$20.7 million, equivalent to a remarkable $13.48 million USD. This strategic injection of capital is earmarked for a clear and impactful purpose: to bolster DigitalX’s Bitcoin purchases. This move not only underscores a strong vote of confidence from prominent investors but also signals a broader trend of increasing institutional engagement within the cryptocurrency space. DigitalX Funding: A Strategic Boost for Digital Asset Management The recent DigitalX funding round is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver designed to significantly enhance the company’s capabilities and market position. Announced via X (formerly Twitter), this capital raise highlights DigitalX’s commitment to expanding its portfolio of digital assets, with a primary focus on Bitcoin. But who are the key players backing this ambitious venture? Animoca Brands: A leading name in blockchain gaming and metaverse development, their participation signals a growing convergence between different facets of the digital economy. UTXO Management: As specialists in the Bitcoin ecosystem, their involvement provides strategic alignment and deep expertise. ParaFi Capital: A prominent blockchain-focused investment firm, their backing further validates DigitalX’s vision and operational strength. And More: The participation of additional unnamed investors suggests a broad-based confidence in DigitalX’s strategy and the long-term prospects of Bitcoin. This diverse group of investors brings not just capital, but also invaluable industry insights and networks, positioning DigitalX for accelerated growth in the competitive digital asset management landscape. Fueling Bitcoin Investment: DigitalX’s Forward-Looking Strategy At the core of this significant funding round lies a clear objective: to fund Bitcoin investment . DigitalX’s decision to allocate a substantial portion of this capital to BTC purchases is a testament to its belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition as a store of value and a foundational digital asset. In a market often characterized by volatility, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated resilience and growth potential, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Why Bitcoin, specifically? DigitalX likely views BTC as a cornerstone asset for several reasons: Scarcity and Demand: Bitcoin’s fixed supply creates inherent scarcity, which, combined with increasing demand, often leads to appreciation. Market Dominance: As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin offers liquidity and established infrastructure. Inflation Hedge: Many investors see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional fiat currency inflation. Institutional Acceptance: With the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity, institutional comfort with BTC as an asset class is growing. This strategic focus on Bitcoin not only aligns with current market sentiment but also positions DigitalX to capitalize on the continued maturation of the cryptocurrency market. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption: A Game Changer? The participation of high-profile investors like Animoca Brands, UTXO Management, and ParaFi Capital in DigitalX’s funding round is a powerful indicator of the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . For years, the cryptocurrency market was primarily driven by retail investors. However, in recent times, we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift, with major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds entering the fray. What’s driving this institutional interest? Maturing Infrastructure: Improved custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and derivative products have made it safer and easier for institutions to engage with crypto. Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions, providing a framework for institutional participation. Performance Potential: The potential for significant returns, even amidst volatility, continues to attract capital seeking diversification and alpha. Technological Advancement: A deeper understanding of blockchain technology’s transformative potential across various industries. This influx of institutional capital not only provides liquidity and stability to the market but also lends credibility, paving the way for broader mainstream acceptance of digital assets. DigitalX’s success is a microcosm of this larger, transformative shift. Navigating Digital Asset Management in a Dynamic Market For a firm like DigitalX, specializing in digital asset management , navigating the dynamic and often unpredictable cryptocurrency market requires expertise, foresight, and robust risk management strategies. The significant capital raise empowers DigitalX to enhance its operational capabilities, expand its team, and potentially explore new investment products beyond direct Bitcoin purchases. Key aspects of effective digital asset management include: Security: Protecting client assets from hacks and cyber threats is paramount. Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions. Market Analysis: Employing sophisticated tools and expertise to identify opportunities and manage risks in a 24/7 market. Product Innovation: Developing new investment vehicles that cater to diverse investor needs, from active trading to long-term holding strategies. DigitalX’s ability to attract such significant funding speaks volumes about its established track record and its strategic approach to managing digital assets in a way that instills confidence among sophisticated investors. Crypto Market Trends: What This Means for Investors The news of DigitalX’s successful funding round and its focus on Bitcoin purchases is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a strong signal reflecting broader crypto market trends . For individual and institutional investors alike, this development offers several actionable insights: Continued Institutional Interest: Expect more traditional financial players and large investment firms to allocate capital to digital assets. This trend is likely to drive further market maturation. Bitcoin as a Core Holding: The emphasis on Bitcoin reinforces its position as a primary digital asset for long-term investment strategies. Innovation in Digital Asset Services: As more capital flows into the space, expect to see increased innovation in products and services offered by digital asset managers. Potential for Market Volatility: While institutional adoption brings stability, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. This development suggests a positive outlook for the crypto market, driven by increasing legitimacy and capital inflow from established players. A Bright Future for Digital Assets DigitalX’s impressive $13.48 million funding round, backed by industry giants like Animoca Brands, UTXO Management, and ParaFi Capital, marks a pivotal moment for the company and the broader digital asset landscape. By strategically channeling this capital into Bitcoin purchases, DigitalX is not only strengthening its own portfolio but also reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a crucial component of modern investment strategies. This event powerfully underscores the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption and the growing sophistication within digital asset management. As crypto market trends continue to evolve, developments like these are instrumental in shaping a more mature, robust, and accessible digital economy for everyone.

2025-07-08T12:00:00,"Cryptocurrency Prices Soar: Bitcoin Solaris Responds with Price Rollback Before LBank Debut","The crypto market is roaring again. Bitcoin is teasing another breakout. Ethereum is climbing on institutional optimism. Altcoins are riding the wave. But in the middle of this frenzy, one project isn’t just joining the hype. It’s flipping the entire playbook. While others ride the price wave, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is pulling a bold move. Instead of inflating, it’s deflating, for a moment. With its highly anticipated LBank debut approaching, the project has just announced a strategic Price Rollback. In a market where FOMO is sky-high, BTC-S is daring enough to offer early adopters a better deal. LBank Listing Meets a Different Kind of Hype LBank, one of the largest crypto exchanges in Asia, is no stranger to token launches. It brings deep liquidity, strong Asian investor traction, and a reputation for boosting exposure. For many new projects, an LBank listing is a milestone. For Bitcoin Solaris , it’s just one of several major gears in motion. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Engine with Real Power Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another L1 with big promises. It’s a fully-fledged wealth ecosystem engineered for scalability, accessibility, and profitability. Built on a dual-consensus model that merges Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake, BTC-S offers both uncompromising security and lightning-fast performance. It runs on a two-layer architecture designed to handle over 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality. For users, this means near-instant, cost-efficient transactions at scale. For developers, it means a future-proof environment for DeFi, enterprise tools, and global apps. More importantly, it’s mobile-first. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones. The app will support: Smart dashboards with live metrics Adaptive, energy-efficient mining algorithms Gamified features like team mining and leaderboards The app is expected to redefine how everyday users participate in the crypto economy, no expensive rigs required. This Rollback Is for You BTC-S Drops to $5 to Thank Early Supporters Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense Forget vague allocations. BTC-S follows a clear, structured model designed for long-term value: 66.66% reserved for mining 20% allocated for the presale 5% for liquidity 2% for community growth 2% for marketing 2% for staking rewards 2% for ecosystem development 0.33% for team and advisors The full model can be explored here , and it’s one of the reasons so many serious investors are treating BTC-S as more than just a trend. The Presale Storm: Now with a Twist The presale is already a breakout event. With over $6.6 million raised and more than 14,150+ users onboard, it’s shaping up to be one of the fastest-growing token offerings of the year. But now, Bitcoin Solaris is adding a plot twist: the Price Rollback. For a short time, the current $11 price is dropping to $5. This rollback isn’t a discount or promotion. It’s a thank-you window. A calculated move to reward early confidence before the price rockets toward its launch value of $20. Only around 3 weeks remain before the launch One of the shortest presales in crypto history Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch For anyone still on the sidelines, this rollback might just be the final nudge they needed. Audits, Influencers, and the Buzz That Won’t Stop Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just making waves among investors. It’s catching fire in the crypto influencer scene. Detailed reviews from top names like Crypto Vlog , Crypto Show , and Token Galaxy have praised the tech, the strategy, and the long-term potential. Security-wise, the project has also completed smart contract audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , adding another layer of confidence for presale participants. And the community is exploding. Telegram discussions are nonstop, and engagement on X continues to rise as more users discover the project’s depth. The Road Ahead Bitcoin Solaris isn’t slowing down. The roadmap includes some of the most ambitious expansions in the space: A mining marketplace Layer-2 scaling Quantum-resistant upgrades Partnerships with major enterprises With the upcoming LBank debut and full mainnet launch in sight, BTC-S is not just a coin. It’s an ecosystem in the making. Final Verdict As prices across the market continue to rise, most investors are chasing after already inflated tokens. Bitcoin Solaris is offering something better: a strategic pause. A rollback. A real opportunity to buy low before the explosion. With top-tier tech, verified audits, exchange momentum, and a rapidly growing user base, BTC-S is positioning itself to lead the next phase of wealth creation in crypto.

As of now, the collective holdings have surged to 1,253,032 BTC , valued at over $136.3 billion , according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. BlackRock’s IBIT Controls Over 55% of Sector Holdings BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the undisputed leader, holding more than 700,000 BTC , currently worth $75.9 billion . In just two trading sessions, IBIT added 1,388 BTC , highlighting strong institutional demand. At the start of 2024, IBIT held 551,917.9 BTC . As of now, its holdings have jumped 26.83% year-to-date , making it the largest ETF in the sector by a significant margin. Top 5 US Bitcoin Spot ETFs by Holdings Here’s a breakdown of BTC holdings in top ETFs: BlackRock’s IBIT : 700,000 BTC Fidelity’s FBTC : 203,508.5 BTC Grayscale’s GBTC : 184,226.9 BTC ARK 21Shares’ ARKB : 48,265 BTC Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust : 44,227.8 BTC These five ETFs dominate the U.S. Bitcoin ETF landscape, capturing the majority of institutional investment in Bitcoin. IBIT Outperforms Traditional ETFs With 82.67% Returns Since its launch in January 2024 , IBIT has delivered 82.67% returns , outperforming even BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF . For comparison: Bitcoin YTD Change (2025) : +16.5% S&P 500 YTD Change : +6.16% This performance reinforces the growing narrative that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset among institutional investors. Bitcoin Demand Surpasses Supply in 2025 Another key trend in 2025 is the Bitcoin supply and demand imbalance . So far this year: US Bitcoin ETFs bought : ~$28.22 billion worth of BTC Bitcoin mined globally : ~$7.85 billion worth This massive buying pressure led by BlackRock and others has significantly outpaced the newly mined supply, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price higher in the long term. ETF Approval Process May Soon Get Simpler Regulatory hurdles have long slowed down ETF approvals in the U.S., but that could soon change. Reports suggest that the SEC is considering streamlining the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval process , potentially requiring just Form S-1 with a 75-day waiting period . Currently, ETF issuers must submit both Form 19b-4 and S-1 , resulting in months of delays and regulatory back-and-forth. A simplified path could open doors for more ETF products shortly. The U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETF market is gaining momentum in 2025, with BlackRock’s IBIT at the center. With demand now far exceeding new supply and the SEC looking to simplify approvals, the sector may be on the verge of another growth wave.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-now-holds-700k-btc/,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 869,100 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin will surge to an all-time high (ATH) price in the next few days. “Feel it in my flippers that we see BTC at ATH this week The market, especially ETH and BTC both have a lot of tailwinds so far (barring anything unexpected)… If we break out, I think we see $118,000-$120,000 pretty quick.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $108,047, an over 1% drop in the past day. Pentoshi is also keeping a close eye on the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), which he thinks is positioned to follow in the footsteps of fellow meme token Bonk ( BONK ). BONK is up about 100% from its June 25th low of $0.0000123. According to Pentoshi, FLOKI’s chart appears to be a carbon copy of BONK’s price action before the memecoin triggered a massive price explosion. “Similar chart to this (almost identical). I think we will see it trade up to TP1 to start, and that will be the spot to watch. If it gets into the previous range, that opens the door to TP2.” Source: Pentoshi/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FLOKI will first hit $0.000121 with the potential to surge to as high as $0.000206. At time of writing, FLOKI is trading at $0.000081. As for BONK, the analyst thinks that the altcoin will cool off before sparking the next leg up. “BONK update: +50% but coming into resistance just above here. A little profit taking and consolidation likely around there before any attempts higher. Would like to see a three-day or one-week close above [$0.000024].” Source: Pentoshi/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that BONK will rally to $0.0000367 if it takes out resistance at $0.0000258. At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.0000227.

As outlined in its filing, the social media company’s ETF will provide investors access to Bitcoin and Ether through NYSE Arca-listed shares. 75% of the fund would be invested in Bitcoin, and the remaining 25% in Ether. The Foris DAX Trust company will serve as the custodian Truth Social first submitted its S-1 form for its Bitcoin and Ether ETF on June 16. If approved, the firm’s fund would compete with industry heavyweights like BlackRock , whose iShares Bitcoin ETF has accumulated over $72.5 billion in assets. The SEC is also deliberating on many other ETF applications while preparing a simplified listing structure for all these funds. The Truth Social ETF will have Foris DAX Trust Company, part of the Crypto.com ecosystem, as the custodian for the fund, while Yorkville America Digital will sponsor it. The company’s ETF also plans to calculate its daily net asset value for Bitcoin using the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate for the Bitcoin portion, which aggregates pricing data from several leading crypto exchanges. The fund will also use the Ether CME CF reference rate for Ether evaluation “unless otherwise determined by the Sponsor at its sole discretion.” The crypto custodian will also store the fund’s Bitcoin and Ether in segregated accounts, separate from other clients, with private keys kept in cold storage. The SEC has delayed its decision on multiple crypto ETF applications The SEC recently held off on its decision on Fidelity’s spot Solana ETF, inviting public comments for 21 days and rebuttals for up to 35 days. The Cboe BZX Exchange initially filed a request on March 25 to list Fidelity’s proposed Solana ETF. James Seyffart, Bloomberg ETF analyst, commented on the delay, saying he expected it. He added that they were still waiting for some movement from the SEC on a generalized digital asset ETP framework. In May, the commission also delayed its decision on Bitwise’s Ether ETF and Grayscale’s XRP ETF, which analysts also anticipated. At the time, the agency pushed its decision on the Bitwise application for another 45 days, claiming it needed to review a rule change and the issues it may bring forth just two days before the expected decision date. On Grayscale’s XRP, the commission also sought public input and initiated proceedings for additional analysis to assess regulatory compliance. Seyffart also commented on the agency’s decision on both delays, saying it usually waits until the end of the review window to respond to a 19b-4 filing. With 50+ crypto ETFs awaiting approval, the SEC is reportedly drafting a universal listing standard to speed up the process. This comes after new guidance clarified rules on NAV, custody, and benchmark selection. Meanwhile, the SEC has been positive on crypto ETPs. In an X post on Monday, Seyffart described the SEC’s requests for SOL spot ETF issuers to revise and resubmit their filings by month’s end as an encouraging sign of regulatory progress on crypto ETPs. “Keep in mind that this would just be more amendments and more back and forth, NOT approvals, as I’ve seen some people hint. Pretty much any sort of interactions between the SEC and issuers/exchanges should be viewed positively,” he added. For the Trump Media and Technology Group, the SEC has so far been favorable. It even approved its registration statement for a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal in June. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-08T11:42:08,"Experienced Analyst Explained: ""Data That Always Brought an Increase in Bitcoin Said 'Bullish Again'!""","Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records in 2025 and reached its last record level on May 22. After this date, it fell below $100,000 for a short time towards the end of June, but generally consolidated above $100,000. Bitcoin has struggled to break above $110,000 several times, but has failed to reach a new ATH. Despite the failed attempts, the expectation of a new ATH continues, and one analyst said that Bitcoin is experiencing a squeeze on the Bollinger Bands, indicating a bullish breakout. On-chain analyst Axel Adler said in his latest analysis on his X account that Bitcoin is experiencing a classic Bollinger Bands squeeze. The analyst noted that this indicates an accumulation of bullish energy in BTC and a bullish breakout. “Bitcoin is currently experiencing a typical Bollinger Bands squeeze. The possibility of a breakout to the upside for Bitcoin is very high.” At this point, the analyst focused specifically on the range between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands, noting that the width of the band has narrowed to 7.7%. According to the analyst, this is one of the narrowest levels observed in the current bull cycle. This could be a sign that the price is accumulating upward pressure and a rally is imminent. “Currently, the range between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands is 7.7%, the lowest level in this bull market. This signals that upward pressure is gradually accumulating in the market, which could soon lead to strong price volatility.” Finally, the analyst, who also cited historical data, noted that four of the six similar squeezes during this cycle led to immediate sharp recoveries, while the remaining two first led to brief corrections and then to an increase. The analyst noted that this pattern suggests that the current squeeze could be a precursor to another upward move, but he also reminded that short-term consolidations or corrections are also possible. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-08T07:00:15,"Ethereum's next move could be a plunge or an explosive short squeeze","<p>What is the Commitment of Traders (COT) Report?</p><p>The COT report is a weekly snapshot released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It shows how different types of traders are positioned in futures markets—meaning whether they're betting prices will rise or fall.</p><p>Why does it matter?</p><p>Understanding trader positioning can help predict possible price moves. For example, if many traders expect prices to fall, it may signal caution.</p><p>How does it work, step-by-step?</p><ol><li><p>Traders open futures positions:
Imagine large traders think Ethereum's price will fall soon. They open ""short"" positions, betting prices will drop. Others, expecting prices to rise, open ""long"" positions.</p></li><li><p>Reporting by traders:
Every Tuesday, firms that manage futures positions report their holdings to the CFTC.</p></li><li><p>CFTC receives and verifies data:
On Wednesday, the CFTC gathers these reports and checks for accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Weekly release:
By Friday afternoon, the CFTC publishes this information in the weekly COT report.</p></li></ol><p>Trader categories explained simply:</p><ul><li><p>Leveraged Funds (Speculators): Traders looking for quick profits.
Example: A hedge fund betting ETH prices will fall by heavily shorting contracts.</p></li><li><p>Dealer Intermediaries (Market Makers): Banks and brokers providing liquidity, usually hedging risk.
Example: A bank buying futures contracts to offset risk from customer transactions.</p></li><li><p>Asset Managers/Institutions: Long-term investors who manage retirement funds or mutual funds.
Example: A pension fund holding long futures positions to invest for the long-term growth of Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Other Reportables: Large traders who don’t fit neatly into other categories.</p></li><li><p>Nonreportable (Small traders): Smaller investors whose holdings are too small to be individually reported.</p></li></ul><p>Simple Example:</p><p>Let's say last week’s report showed leveraged funds holding 1,000 contracts betting ETH prices will go down (""short"") and only 100 contracts betting they'll rise (""long""). This means speculative traders expect ETH's price to fall soon.</p><p>Why it might help your trading:</p><ul><li><p>If most traders are very bearish (expect prices to fall), it might indicate prices could continue dropping.</p></li><li><p>Conversely, extreme bearishness might also mean that if prices start rising unexpectedly, these bearish traders must quickly buy to close their losing positions, rapidly driving prices higher (a “short squeeze”).</p></li></ul><p>This report helps you understand the ""big picture,"" allowing you to make informed trading decisions based on what major players in the market are doing.</p><p>ETH related positions from the COT Report</p><p>As of July 1, 2025, leveraged funds hold a substantial short position on Ethereum futures: they have 12,574 short contracts (51.7% of total open interest) compared to only 1,275 long contracts (5.2%). This clearly shows their expectation that Ethereum's price will decline. In contrast, Dealer Intermediaries are primarily long (66.5%), likely reflecting their role in hedging or providing liquidity. Asset Managers and Institutions also lean toward the bullish side, with 12.4% of total open interest long compared to just 2.2% short.</p><p>Putting it Together - The Guestimate:</p><p>Given the current setup, here's my guestimate for Ethereum's next move:</p><ul><li><p>Immediate Term (next few days to a week or two): Increased Downward Pressure and Volatility. The substantial short position from leveraged funds is likely to exert strong downward pressure on Ethereum's price in the very short term. We could see a move lower as these funds try to capitalize on their short bets. This might manifest as quick dips or a sustained downtrend, potentially testing significant support levels.</p></li><li><p>Medium Term (next few weeks to a month): Potential for Reversal or Consolidation Around Support. If the price does decline, the bullish leanings of Asset Managers and Institutions could act as a floor. They might start accumulating at lower prices, which could lead to a bounce or a period of consolidation. The market will be watching to see if new long positions emerge from non-leveraged players to counter the speculative shorts.</p></li><li><p>Key Indicator to Watch: How far leveraged funds are willing to press their shorts. If they continue to add significantly, the downtrend could be more severe. Conversely, if they start covering their shorts (buying back contracts to close their positions), it could signal a reversal and lead to a sharp upward move (a ""short squeeze"").</p></li></ul><p>For individual crypto traders, closely monitoring Ethereum price movements and weekly changes in leveraged fund positioning is crucial, along with price action at potential supports! Extreme bearish sentiment could either suggest the need for caution or signal an opportunity if market sentiment shifts quickly and unexpectedly.</p><p>Trade ETH and crypto at your own risk only.
