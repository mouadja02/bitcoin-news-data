2025-07-08T10:51:08,"Google Gemini Sets Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 31, 2025","As the cryptocurrency market faces yet another period of uncertainty, Shiba Inu (SHIB), the well-known meme coin, has come into focus. With July drawing to a close, both investors and enthusiasts are eager to see what the future holds. To offer an informed projection, we consulted Google Gemini, a leading AI model, for its prediction of SHIB’s possible price trajectory by July 31, 2025, based on current technical indicators and market dynamics. In a direct statement from its forecast module, Google Gemini noted, “SHIB would climb approximately 10% to $0.00003.” This projection comes at a time when Shiba Inu is showing modest gains on the daily charts but remains under pressure compared to its position a month ago. SHIB’s Recent Performance Highlights At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001178, reflecting a 3.82% increase in the past 24 hours, though it is still down 6.28% over the last month. The forecast by Google Gemini suggests a recovery trend over the coming weeks, implying that investor sentiment and broader market forces may start turning more favorable for the token. Analyst Views on an Impending Altseason This prediction aligns with broader expectations in the crypto sector about a potential resurgence of altcoins in the near term. A recent Times Tabloid article highlighted remarks from seasoned market analyst CryptoBull, who foresees a major altseason developing within the next three months. CryptoBull stated that market dynamics indicate a decisive shift of capital flows from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and other undervalued tokens, could be imminent. According to his analysis, such a phase would lead to altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in market gains, creating opportunities for significant price appreciation across the sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ecosystem Developments and Market Sentiment The anticipated altseason could directly benefit Shiba Inu, which remains one of the most widely traded and followed altcoins. CryptoBull’s forecast that “a decisive transition from Bitcoin to altcoins is likely to unfold within the next three months” lends further support to Google Gemini’s price target for SHIB, suggesting the AI’s projection is not an isolated outlook but rather one that is reinforced by broader market sentiment. Although SHIB has faced challenges in sustaining higher price levels in the past month, recent developments in its ecosystem, including growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and a surge in token burns, may help it capitalize on an incoming altcoin rally. Google Gemini’s forecast is notable for its tempered optimism, reflecting a realistic consideration of market conditions rather than extreme bullishness. Its estimate of about a 10% increase over the current price level suggests confidence in a gradual upward trend, contingent on improving market conditions and investor risk appetite returning to altcoins.

2025-07-08T10:51:04,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC at Risk of Pullback as New ATH Hopes Diminish","Bitcoin has slightly lost its bullish steam upon nearing the $111K all-time high, with strong selling pressure emerging at this key level. The price continues to struggle in reclaiming this threshold, signaling a likely period of consolidation or corrective movement in the days ahead. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s bullish rally toward its all-time high of $111K has shown signs of exhaustion, with the price losing momentum near this key resistance. The inability to reclaim the previous high around $110K suggests the potential formation of a double-top pattern, a classic bearish reversal signal. Currently, BTC is consolidating within a critical price range, bounded by the $111K ATH and a fair value gap between $103K and $104K. Given the visible weakness in bullish momentum, a short-term rejection and further consolidation within this zone are likely. That said, the FVG may act as a significant demand zone, potentially halting any deeper corrections and providing the base for another upward attempt toward the $111K mark. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, BTC failed to print a new higher high above $110K, encountering notable rejection at this resistance. This price action confirms the presence of heightened selling pressure and distribution behavior near the ATH zone, reinforcing $111K as a key barrier. Bitcoin now trades between two prominent liquidity zones: one just below $105K and the other above $110K. These liquidity pools are attractive targets for institutional players and could drive price volatility in the short term. As such, a range-bound movement is expected between these levels until a decisive breakout occurs, likely triggered by a liquidity sweep in either direction. Sentiment Analysis By ShayanMarkets Over the past 45 days, taker users on Binance Derivatives have persistently engaged in sell-side activity. Despite this, Bitcoin has remained range-bound between $100K and $110K, while the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has shown a consistent negative trend throughout the period. The CVD, which measures the net flow of buy and sell volume in real time, highlights a clear dominance of aggressive selling pressure. However, the price’s ability to hold steady, without further decline, points to a potential absorption phase, likely directed by institutional investors or large-scale players quietly accumulating. This ongoing divergence between persistent sell-side flow and stable price action suggests that Bitcoin may be forming a strong base. If the current structure holds, with continued absorption within the range, the likelihood of a bullish breakout increases, potentially setting the stage for a renewed uptrend.

2025-07-08T10:40:48,"Altcoin Season: Decoding the Bitcoin Market’s Dominant Shift","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Decoding the Bitcoin Market’s Dominant Shift The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, marked by cycles of growth, consolidation, and shifting dominance. Currently, all eyes are on the Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric that helps investors gauge the broader market sentiment and the prevailing power dynamics between Bitcoin and the vast universe of altcoins. With the index recently registering a low of 26, it unequivocally signals that the market is firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season. But what does this mean for your digital asset portfolio, and how should you navigate these turbulent waters? What Exactly is Altcoin Season, and Why Does it Matter? Before we delve into the current state, let’s clarify what defines an Altcoin Season . This highly anticipated period is when a significant majority of altcoins — cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin — experience substantial price gains, often outperforming Bitcoin itself. The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a quantifiable measure for this phenomenon. According to CMC’s methodology, for the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Historically, Altcoin Seasons have been characterized by: Explosive Growth: Many altcoins can see parabolic price increases, often far exceeding Bitcoin’s percentage gains. Innovation Spotlight: New projects, technologies, and use cases within the altcoin space gain traction and investment. Risk-On Sentiment: Investors become more comfortable taking on higher risk in pursuit of greater returns. Understanding Altcoin Season is vital because it can dictate investment strategies, highlighting periods where diversification into smaller, more volatile assets might yield significant profits. Conversely, misinterpreting the market can lead to substantial losses. Decoding Bitcoin Season: When the King Reigns Supreme The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 26 means we are experiencing a Bitcoin Season . This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the 90-day period. In essence, Bitcoin reasserts its dominance, often acting as a safe haven or the primary beneficiary of new capital entering the crypto market. Several factors typically contribute to a Bitcoin Season: Flight to Quality: During periods of uncertainty or market corrections, investors often consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, perceiving it as less volatile and more established than altcoins. Institutional Inflows: Large institutional investors often prioritize Bitcoin due to its liquidity, market cap, and perceived regulatory clarity compared to the fragmented altcoin market. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events can drive investors towards Bitcoin as a store of value. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reductions (halvings) often precede significant price rallies, drawing attention and capital away from altcoins. During Bitcoin Season, altcoins may stagnate, experience price declines, or simply fail to keep pace with Bitcoin’s upward momentum. This period tests the conviction of altcoin holders and often leads to a re-evaluation of portfolios. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: A Strategic Approach With the Altcoin Season Index at 26, the message is clear: Bitcoin is currently the dominant force in the market. This isn’t necessarily a negative signal for the entire crypto space; rather, it indicates a specific phase within the broader Crypto Market Trends . For investors, recognizing this shift is paramount to making informed decisions. Here’s a breakdown of what the index implies and how to interpret it: Altcoin Season Index Range Market State Implication for Investors 75 – 100 Strong Altcoin Season High potential for altcoin gains; consider diversifying into promising altcoins. 25 – 74 Bitcoin Season (Mixed/Transitional) Bitcoin shows strength; some altcoins may perform, but overall altcoin market lags. Focus on strong fundamentals. 0 – 24 Strong Bitcoin Season Bitcoin dominance is pronounced; altcoins likely to struggle. Prioritize Bitcoin or stablecoins. The current reading of 26 places us at the very cusp of a strong Bitcoin Season, indicating that the vast majority of altcoins are currently underperforming Bitcoin. This isn’t a call to panic, but rather a prompt for strategic adjustment. The Altcoin Index: Your Compass in Volatile Waters The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Index serves as a valuable compass in the often-volatile cryptocurrency markets. It’s a simple yet powerful tool that distills complex market dynamics into a single, digestible number. The index specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to ensure that its calculation accurately reflects the performance of native altcoin projects against Bitcoin. While the index is a useful indicator, it’s important to understand its nuances and limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on past 90-day performance, meaning it tells you what has happened, not necessarily what will happen tomorrow. It’s a reflection of the current trend, not a predictive tool. Top 100 Focus: It only considers the top 100 coins by market capitalization. This means smaller, emerging altcoins — which can sometimes explode in price independently — are not directly factored into its calculation. Context is Key: The index should always be viewed in conjunction with other market indicators, macroeconomic news, and fundamental analysis of individual assets. Think of the Altcoin Index as a barometer for market sentiment. A low reading signals caution for altcoin-heavy portfolios, while a high reading suggests a more favorable environment for speculative altcoin investments. Maximizing Cryptocurrency Performance: Strategies for Every Season Understanding the current Bitcoin Season is the first step; the next is to adapt your investment strategies to optimize your Cryptocurrency Performance . Here are some actionable insights: During Bitcoin Season (like now): Prioritize Bitcoin: Consider increasing your Bitcoin holdings. If Bitcoin is leading the market, a larger allocation to BTC can help you participate in the primary upward momentum. Accumulate Strategically: Look for opportunities to accumulate strong altcoins that have corrected significantly during Bitcoin’s dominance. Research projects with solid fundamentals, strong development teams, and clear use cases. Stablecoin Stance: Holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins can provide liquidity to buy dips or rotate into promising assets when the market shifts. Focus on Large Caps: Within the altcoin space, larger cap altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, BNB) tend to be more resilient during Bitcoin-led phases than smaller, highly speculative assets. Risk Management: Re-evaluate your risk exposure. During Bitcoin Season, highly speculative altcoins can experience significant drawdowns. Preparing for Altcoin Season (when the index rises): Diversify Wisely: Once the Altcoin Season Index begins to show sustained upward movement (e.g., crossing 50-60), consider rotating some profits from Bitcoin into a diversified basket of altcoins. Research Emerging Narratives: Keep an eye on new trends and sectors within crypto (e.g., AI, DePIN, Gaming, L2s) that could drive the next altcoin rally. Take Profits: Altcoin Season can be exhilarating, but it’s crucial to have a profit-taking strategy. Markets are cyclical, and what goes up often comes down. Stay Informed: Continuous learning and staying updated on market news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are crucial for long-term success. Ultimately, successful navigation of the crypto market depends on a blend of understanding market cycles, conducting thorough research, and maintaining disciplined risk management. The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool in this endeavor, providing a clear snapshot of the current landscape. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 26 firmly places us in a Bitcoin Season. This isn’t a time for reckless altcoin speculation, but rather an opportunity to consolidate, research, and strategically position your portfolio for future market shifts. By understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season, and by utilizing tools like the Altcoin Index, investors can make more informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and ultimately enhance their long-term cryptocurrency performance. Remember, the crypto market is cyclical, and adaptability is key to thriving in its ever-changing environment.

In an official press release , the company’s CEO, Yoshihiko Takahashi, explained that it was initially his own decision to receive his salary in BTC ( BTC ) from the company. He saw the move as a declaration of his loyalty to the company’s Bitcoin strategy as well as aligning himself with shareholders. “My decision to receive my entire compensation in Bitcoin is a clear signal that I am ‘in the same boat’ as our shareholders,” said Yoshihiko. According to the announcement, shareholders had urged Remixpoint’s management to hold company stocks so that the company’s fate is linked with those of its shareholders. However, Remixpoint claimed it could not hold its own stocks due to several regulatory constraints, including concerns regarding insider trading. Therefore, the company offered an alternative solution, which was to pay its President’s salary fully in Bitcoin. “By receiving compensation in Bitcoin, the company’s leadership will share the same economic fate as shareholders, fostering a system that aligns economic value with investors,” wrote the company in its statement.

2025-07-08T10:30:45,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding Crucial Market Sentiment at 65","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding Crucial Market Sentiment at 65 Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? If you’re invested in digital assets, you know that emotions can run high, often dictating price movements. This is precisely where tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index become invaluable. It’s more than just a number; it’s a snapshot of the collective emotional state of the market, helping investors navigate the often-turbid waters of cryptocurrency trading. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter for Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, is a unique barometer designed to gauge the prevailing market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. It aggregates various data points to produce a single, easy-to-understand score ranging from 0 to 100. 0 (Extreme Fear): Indicates that investors are overly worried, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for those brave enough to go against the crowd. 100 (Extreme Greed): Suggests that the market is overheated, with investors exhibiting irrational exuberance, which could precede a correction. As of July 8, the index stands at 65, a slight dip of eight points from the previous day, yet it firmly remains in the “Greed” zone. This isn’t just a random number; it tells us that despite a minor cooling off, the overall sentiment among crypto participants is still leaning towards optimism and eagerness to buy, rather than fear or panic selling. Understanding this index is crucial because emotional trading often leads to poor decisions. By providing an objective measure of market psychology, the index helps you identify when the market might be driven by irrational exuberance or undue panic, allowing for more strategic and less emotional investment choices. It’s a powerful tool to complement your technical and fundamental analysis, offering a holistic view of the crypto market trends . Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does a 65 Mean for Your Crypto Market Trends? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Greed’ zone, particularly at a score of 65, it signifies a market where optimism is high, and investors are feeling confident. But what does this really imply for you and the broader crypto market trends ? A score of 65 suggests that while the market isn’t at peak euphoria (which would be closer to 80-100), there’s a strong buying appetite. People are likely seeing recent gains and are keen to jump in, or perhaps add to their existing positions. This can be a double-edged sword: Positive Momentum: Continued greed can fuel further price increases as more capital flows into the market. Increased Risk: High greed levels can also indicate that assets might be overvalued, making them susceptible to sudden corrections if sentiment shifts or negative news emerges. It’s often said that ‘when everyone is greedy, be fearful.’ For investors, a 65 might suggest a need for caution. While it’s not extreme greed, it’s certainly not a time for complacency. It could be an opportune moment to: Review your portfolio: Consider taking some profits off the table, especially from assets that have seen significant gains. Tighten stop-losses: Protect your investments from potential downturns. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Resist the urge to chase pumps, as these often lead to losses if not timed perfectly. The slight dip from the previous day (from 73 to 65) also hints at a minor cooling of sentiment, perhaps a healthy consolidation rather than an outright reversal. This is where paying attention to daily movements, not just the zone, becomes crucial. The Pillars of Sentiment: Unpacking the Factors Behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The robustness of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on a single metric but combines six key factors, each weighted differently, to paint a comprehensive picture of investor psychology . Here’s a breakdown of what goes into this sophisticated calculation: Factor Weighting Description & Impact Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable periods can reflect confidence. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to average values. High buying volumes in a rising market indicate greed, while low volumes or high selling volumes suggest fear. Social Media 15% Scans various social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for keywords and hashtags related to Bitcoin. A higher rate of positive mentions and engagement can indicate growing greed. Surveys 15% Polls a large group of people on their perception of the market. (Note: Currently paused, so this weighting is temporarily redistributed among other factors or the index is adjusted.) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates fear (investors flocking to ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while falling dominance suggests greed (investors speculating on altcoins). Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin. Rising search volumes for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble” indicate fear, whereas generic searches like “buy Bitcoin” suggest greed. Each of these components offers a unique lens into the market’s collective mindset, making the index a powerful aggregate indicator. The pausing of surveys means the remaining factors temporarily bear a slightly higher implicit weight, emphasizing the importance of real-time market data and social sentiment. Navigating Volatility and Market Momentum: Key Drivers of Investor Psychology Among the six factors contributing to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , volatility and market momentum/volume stand out with the highest weighting at 25% each. This significant allocation underscores their profound impact on investor psychology and the overall market mood. Let’s delve into why these two elements are so critical: Volatility: The Pulse of Market Uncertainty Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset increases or decreases. In the crypto market, volatility is famously high. While some see it as an opportunity for quick gains, extreme volatility can induce significant fear. When Bitcoin’s price swings wildly, especially downwards, it triggers panic selling as investors rush to protect their capital. Conversely, sustained periods of lower volatility, or controlled upward volatility, can foster a sense of security and confidence, pushing the index towards greed. The index specifically looks at Bitcoin’s current volatility compared to its historical averages. A sudden spike in volatility, particularly on the downside, will pull the index towards ‘Fear’. A more stable or gradually ascending market, on the other hand, will contribute to ‘Greed’. It’s a direct reflection of how comfortable or uncomfortable investors are with the current price movements. Market Momentum and Volume: The Strength of Conviction This factor assesses the strength and direction of price movements, coupled with the trading volume. High trading volume during a strong upward price trend (bullish momentum) indicates strong buying interest and conviction among investors. This is a clear sign of greed, as participants are actively accumulating assets, driving prices higher. Conversely, if prices are falling on high volume, it suggests strong selling pressure and widespread fear. Low trading volumes, regardless of price direction, can indicate indecision or a lack of conviction, often preceding a significant move once sentiment solidifies. The combination of price direction and volume provides a powerful gauge of how committed investors are to their current positions, reflecting the true underlying market sentiment . These two factors, individually and combined, offer deep insights into the immediate market dynamics and the collective emotional response of traders and investors. They are often the first indicators to shift, reflecting changes in sentiment before they become widely apparent. Actionable Insights: Using the Index to Inform Your Crypto Trading Strategy The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, but like any indicator, it should not be used in isolation. Its true value comes when integrated into a broader, well-thought-out crypto trading strategy . Here’s how you can leverage its insights: 1. Counter-Cyclical Investing: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful This classic Warren Buffett quote perfectly encapsulates how to use the index. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-20), it often signals a bottom or a significant buying opportunity, as assets are likely undervalued due to widespread panic. Conversely, when the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’ (80-100), it might be time to consider taking profits or reducing exposure, as the market could be overbought and due for a correction. A reading of 65, while in ‘Greed,’ isn’t extreme, but it’s a prompt to exercise caution and perhaps trim positions rather than aggressively buy. 2. Complement with Technical and Fundamental Analysis The index provides a macro-level sentiment view. Combine it with: Technical Analysis (TA): Look at price charts, support/resistance levels, moving averages, and other indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD). If the index shows ‘Greed’ and TA indicates overbought conditions or resistance, it strengthens the case for caution. Fundamental Analysis (FA): Consider the underlying value of the cryptocurrency, project developments, partnerships, regulatory news, and adoption rates. Strong fundamentals can sometimes justify higher ‘Greed’ levels, while weak fundamentals in a greedy market are a red flag. 3. Risk Management and Portfolio Rebalancing Use the index as a trigger for risk management decisions: When in Fear: Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into your preferred assets, buying small amounts regularly to average down your entry price. This strategy minimizes the risk of trying to catch the absolute bottom. When in Greed: Rebalance your portfolio by selling a portion of your most profitable assets, or setting tighter stop-loss orders to protect gains. This helps you de-risk and secure profits before a potential downturn. 4. Understand Its Limitations The index is primarily focused on Bitcoin’s sentiment, as Bitcoin largely dictates the overall crypto market trends . While it provides a good proxy for the broader market, altcoin movements can sometimes diverge. Also, it’s a lagging or concurrent indicator, not a crystal ball. It reflects current sentiment, which can change rapidly based on breaking news or unexpected events. By thoughtfully integrating the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your decision-making process, you can gain a significant edge, moving beyond emotional reactions to more calculated and profitable investment actions. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and its Role in Overall Market Sentiment One of the intriguing factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Bitcoin dominance , weighted at 10%. While seemingly small, its role is pivotal in reflecting broader market sentiment and investor risk appetite. Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter? Historically, Bitcoin has been seen as the ‘safer’ or ‘less volatile’ asset compared to thousands of altcoins. Its established network, larger liquidity, and first-mover advantage often make it a refuge during times of uncertainty. Here’s how its dominance typically correlates with market sentiment: Rising Bitcoin Dominance (Fear): When investors are fearful or uncertain about the market’s future, they tend to sell off their more speculative altcoins and move their capital back into Bitcoin. This flight to quality increases Bitcoin’s market share, pushing the index towards ‘Fear’. It signals a consolidation of capital in the perceived safest asset. Falling Bitcoin Dominance (Greed): Conversely, when market sentiment is bullish and investors feel greedy, they tend to rotate their profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, seeking higher returns from more volatile assets. This ‘altcoin season’ reduces Bitcoin’s dominance and pushes the index towards ‘Greed’, indicating a higher appetite for risk and speculation. Therefore, a high Bitcoin dominance often coincides with ‘Fear’ in the market, while a low dominance (and a thriving altcoin market) typically aligns with ‘Greed’. The index captures this dynamic, adding another layer of insight into the collective risk assessment of investors. It’s a subtle but powerful signal for understanding the underlying shifts in investor psychology . Beyond the Numbers: The Nuances of Crypto Market Trends While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a fantastic quantitative measure of market sentiment , it’s essential to look beyond just the numbers and understand the qualitative nuances driving crypto market trends . The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, influenced by a myriad of factors that extend beyond what a single index can capture. External Economic Factors The broader macroeconomic environment plays an increasingly significant role. Inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, global geopolitical events, and even traditional stock market performance can heavily influence crypto prices and, consequently, sentiment. For instance, rising interest rates often make riskier assets like crypto less attractive, potentially pushing the index towards fear. Regulatory Developments Government regulations, or even the anticipation of them, can cause dramatic shifts in market sentiment. Positive regulatory clarity can spur adoption and investment, leading to greed, while restrictive measures or outright bans can trigger widespread fear and sell-offs. Staying informed about legislative discussions in major economies is vital. Technological Innovations and Adoption Breakthroughs in blockchain technology, the launch of major decentralized applications (dApps), increased institutional adoption, or significant upgrades to existing protocols (like Ethereum’s move to Proof-of-Stake) can inject massive optimism into the market, driving the index towards greed. Conversely, security breaches or project failures can quickly erode confidence. Social and Cultural Shifts The growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, celebrity endorsements, or viral social media movements can also influence sentiment. While the index captures social media mentions, the underlying cultural shift towards digital assets is a long-term trend that reinforces overall market confidence. Understanding these broader currents allows investors to interpret the index’s readings with greater context. A ‘Greed’ reading of 65 might be sustainable if backed by strong fundamentals and positive external factors, but it could be precarious if global economic headwinds are looming. The index is a compass, but you still need a map of the wider world to navigate effectively. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The cryptocurrency market is an exhilarating, yet often unpredictable, environment. Emotions, particularly fear and greed, are powerful forces that can drive prices to irrational highs and devastating lows. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial beacon, offering an objective measure of the collective market sentiment , helping investors to cut through the noise and make more informed decisions. As the index currently sits at 65, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, it signals a prevailing optimism. However, as we’ve explored, this isn’t a signal to throw caution to the wind. Instead, it’s a reminder to exercise prudence, perhaps rebalance portfolios, and avoid succumbing to FOMO. By understanding the intricate factors that contribute to this index – from volatility and market momentum to Bitcoin dominance and social media trends – you gain a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the crypto market trends . Ultimately, the index is a powerful component of a comprehensive crypto trading strategy . It empowers you to think critically about investor psychology , acting as a counter-indicator when emotions run wild, and helping you identify potential opportunities or risks. In a market where emotions can dictate fortunes, having a tool that measures these very emotions is truly invaluable.

2025-07-08T10:27:09,"A Giant Company That Operates Hotels Across Mexico and Is Listed on Nasdaq Announces It Will Invest in Bitcoin! Here Are the Details","Murano Global Investments, a Nasdaq-listed real estate company that operates hotels across Mexico, has announced that it will create a treasury strategy based on Bitcoin (BTC). The company also plans to integrate BTC as a payment method and loyalty rewards system. Murano Builds Bitcoin Treasury with $500 Million Deal The company, which has a market value of about $800 million, saw its stock drop just over 1% following the announcement. Murano stated in its statement that it has signed a stock purchase agreement (SEPA) that could reach up to $500 million and that this capital will be used “primarily” for Bitcoin investment purposes. The company stated that it will continue its current hotel and real estate development activities, but new initiatives such as allowing guests to pay with BTC or earn loyalty rewards in BTC are also being evaluated. “We see Bitcoin not only as an asset with long-term growth potential, but also as a tool to strengthen our balance sheet against inflation and systemic risks,” said Elias Sacal, Chairman and CEO of Murano. Murano’s move comes on the heels of its participation in the industry alliance “Bitcoin for Corporations,” launched by Michael Saylor-led Strategy (MSTR) and BTC Inc. The company also recently announced that it purchased 21 BTC, which is worth over $2.1 million at current prices. Murano’s move is seen as a new example of institutional companies’ growing interest in expanding their digital asset strategies. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-08T10:21:37,"ARK Invest to launch four “buffer ETFs” after losing billions","After bleeding billions from its flagship funds, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is reportedly taking a defensive turn. It is entering into the booming “buffer ETF” arena with a fresh lineup of loss-limiting products. The firm filed proposals last week for four new exchange-traded funds, the ARK Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 Defined Innovation ETFs. These Exchange-traded funds are designed to cushion downside risks while limiting upside returns. Each product will follow a rolling 12-month strategy starting in January, April, July, and October, respectively. This space has turned out to be an investors’ hunt for protection in a slump while already being dominated by BlackRock, Allianz, and Innovator. Ark bets big on buffer ETFs According to the report, the proposed ETFs will aim to shield investors from around 50% of any decline in ARKK while offering full exposure to gains above a 5% threshold. ARKK is Ark’s $6.8 billion flagship innovation fund. It is expected that the buffer ETF market led by BlackRock could hit $650 billion by 2030. It added that assets in defined-outcome ETFs have already hit $69 billion in 2025. In an environment marked by rate volatility, trade tensions, and rising geopolitical risks, downside protection is becoming a hot commodity. Traditional, crypto, and all sorts of markets are already dealing with massive fluctuations led by an indecisive situation created by US President Donald Trump. In the fresh trade threats , Trump has set 14 countries on the list. This includes key US allies Japan and South Korea, on notice to face a 25% to 40% increase from August 1. Source: Bloomberg. ARK’s timing isn’t accidental as it is racking up strong returns in 2025. ARKK is up 50% over the past 12 months, and ARKW, the firm’s internet-focused fund, has gained 80%. The report mentions that the retail enthusiasm seems to be drying up as ARKK is now on pace for its 19th straight month of net outflows. It has shed $2 billion in the past year. ARKK price saw a minor decline in the last trading session. It traded around $70.44. “These are like Diet Ark,” stated Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence. “Investors want the kick, but without the sleepless nights.” Cathie Wood rebalances Ark Invest The buffer ETF push comes as Ark looks to fine-tune its core positions. On July 7, the firm added 659,428 shares of Beam Therapeutics (BEAM), approx. worth over $13 million. Meanwhile, it scaled back on Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), 908 Devices (MASS), and Roblox (RBLX), too. It sold 12,143 shares of IONS (approx. worth $522K) through the ARKG ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a total net inflow of $217 million on July 7. This marks three consecutive days of net inflows, suggesting stable market conditions. However, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) reported an outflow of $10.07 million in the same session. This comes in when ARKB saw a massive inflow of $114.25 million on July 3 (previous trading session). Bitcoin price dropped marginally over the last 24 hours. BTC is trading at an average price of $108,382 at press time. It is still up by 87% over the last year. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume spiked by 19% to hit $47.25 billion.

Key Takeaways: Remixpoint is now paying its CEO entirely in Bitcoin, a first for a Tokyo-listed firm. The company adopted Bitcoin over stock due to insider trading restrictions. This move strengthens its crypto-focused strategy and aligns leadership with shareholders. The move, announced Tuesday , is part of a broader strategy to align executive incentives with shareholder outcomes and reinforce commitment to the company’s financial performance. In its press release, Remixpoint said the initiative aims to ensure the leadership “shares the same economic fate as shareholders,” a response to previous shareholder requests that executives hold company stock. Remixpoint Executives Chose Bitcoin Over Company Stock Due to restrictions related to insider trading laws, however, holding equity was not a viable option for executives. Instead, the firm turned to Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency’s close price correlation with its own stock as a way to mirror the financial ups and downs of its investors. CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi described the decision as a “clear signal” of his commitment to corporate value and shareholder-focused governance. Remixpoint’s Bitcoin compensation policy builds on its crypto-forward strategy launched last year. In September last year, the company began investing in digital assets as a hedge against yen depreciation and to diversify currency exposure. Its crypto portfolio includes over 1,000 BTC, 900 ETH, nearly 14,000 SOL, 1.2 million XRP, and 2.8 million DOGE, according to its website.

Despite the BITPoint sale, Remixpoint has continued to pursue crypto-related business avenues. The firm began its crypto-buying strategy in 2024. Following the announcement, Remixpoint’s stock rose 0.71% on Tuesday. Japanese Firms Double Down on Bitcoin Strategy Japanese firms show no sign of slowing their Bitcoin-buying fervor. The famously Bitcoin-keen Metaplanet has been consistently boosting the size of its own BTC holdings . On Monday, Metaplanet expanded its Bitcoin treasury strategy with the purchase of 2,205 additional BTC . The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a key metric tracking the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share, rose 15.1% between July 1 and July 7, adding 2,017 BTC worth 31.7 billion yen in the quarter-to-date period. BTC Yield highlights the net Bitcoin growth relative to share dilution, which the firm views as a measure of shareholder accretion.

2025-07-08T10:15:10,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 8, 2025","The crypto market is down today again. The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap and all top 10 coins saw their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen 3.8% to $3.42 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $87.3 billion. TLDR: After one day of upward movement, the crypto market turned downwards; BTC and ETH are slightly down but overall largely unchanged, trading at $108,322 and $2,558, respectively; While crypto market saw a mild drop, stocks fell sharply on the tariff news coming from the US, reigniting global trade war fears; US BTC and ETH ETFs have resumed positive flows yesterday; ’Bitcoin is taking its place at the forefront of the conversation’; ’The lines between traditional finance, the DeFi ecosystem, and Bitcoin are blurring faster than ever’; Underlying metrics still reflect mixed investor sentiment. Crypto Winners & Losers In contrast to yesterday, the prices of all the top 10 coins per market cap have dropped today. However, only two fell above 0.5%, meaning that the majority of the coins in this category are practically unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.4%, currently trading at $108,322. This is still largely unchanged over the past five days. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 0.3%, currently changing hands at $2,558. The only two coins with increases above 0.5% are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) , with a drop of 2.5% and 1.3% to the price of $0.1682 and $149, respectively. When it comes to the top 100 coins, about a dozen are up at the time of writing. Bonk (BONK) is the best performer today. It’s up 6.8% to $0.00002347. POL (POL) is up 1.7% to $0.1868, while the rest are up below 1% each. On the other hand, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and SPX6900 (SPX) fell the most in this category. They’re down 7.7% and 6.8% to the prices of $1.08 and $1.24, respectively. Financial markets in general reacted to US President Donald Trump’s letters to several countries, threatening tariffs of 25%-40% and reigniting global trade war fears. Notably, he accused Japan and South Korea of unfair trade practices, and he warned of new 25% duties. The new deadline is 1 August. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each.

Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has argued that the crypto community should turn to “copyleft” licensing . He says that the sector is drifting away from its open-source roots. “The crypto space in particular has become more competitive and mercenary,” Buterin wrote. “We are less able than before to count on people open-sourcing their work purely out of niceness. Copyleft can be viewed as a very broad-based and neutral way of incentivizing more diffusion.” ‘Broader Mix of Market Signals’ James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented that Bitcoin surged to a record June closing at $107,100 and experienced its strongest week above $109,200, but “the ‘neutral’ reading reflects a broader mix of market signals.” “While institutions have been piling in, a lot of money is quite tentative right now as the world appears to be on a knife’s edge both geopolitically and macro-economically.” The index factors include volatility, trading volume, options activity, social‑media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and search‑trend data, Toledano says. “Price momentum may be strong, but muted volume and rising volatility suggest caution.” “Meanwhile, high hedging activity or increased wary sentiment on social media and search trends could also dampen greed. In short, while prices rally, underlying metrics still reflect mixed investor sentiment,” he concluded. Moreover, following EthCC 2025 , Alexei Zamyatin, BOB Co-Founder and BitVM researcher, commented that the conference made “one thing clear: the lines between traditional finance, the DeFi ecosystem, and Bitcoin are blurring faster than ever.” He continued: “From Robinhood’s tokenized equities to modular rollups and decentralised AI, the event showcased the accelerating convergence of these once-distant worlds. The growing interest in Bitcoin DeFi was also unmistakable, a sign that even at Ethereum’s flagship event, Bitcoin is taking its place at the forefront of the conversation.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,322. The price first increased to the intraday high of $109,056 but then swiftly dropped to $107,591. It has slightly recovered to the current price since. Bitcoin Price Chart.

2025-07-08T10:10:15,"CoreWeave Acquisition: A Monumental $9B Deal Transforms AI Data Centers","BitcoinWorld CoreWeave Acquisition: A Monumental $9B Deal Transforms AI Data Centers For many in the cryptocurrency world, the evolution of digital infrastructure is a familiar narrative. Just as Bitcoin mining once demanded vast computational resources, the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence now drives an unprecedented race for data center capacity. The latest seismic shift in this landscape comes with the monumental announcement from CoreWeave: a staggering CoreWeave acquisition of data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at $9 billion. CoreWeave Acquisition: The $9 Billion Bet on AI On Monday, July 7, 2025, CoreWeave, a specialized cloud provider for AI workloads, confirmed its intent to acquire Core Scientific , a prominent data center infrastructure provider. This isn’t just another corporate merger; it’s a strategic move that underscores the intense demand for compute power fueled by generative AI. The $9 billion all-stock transaction immediately grants CoreWeave access to an astonishing more than one gigawatt of data center capacity. To put that into perspective, one gigawatt is enough energy to power over 850,000 homes, now earmarked for the insatiable demands of AI training and inference workloads. This acquisition is a clear signal of CoreWeave’s aggressive expansion strategy, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI compute revolution. The deal significantly bolsters CoreWeave’s ability to provide the specialized GPU-accelerated cloud services essential for cutting-edge AI development. Core Scientific’s Evolution: From Bitcoin Mining to AI Data Centers Interestingly, Core Scientific has a history deeply rooted in the digital asset space, much like CoreWeave itself. Both companies previously offered Bitcoin mining services, a sector known for its substantial energy consumption. However, as the AI boom gained momentum, Core Scientific shrewdly pivoted its focus. Its existing infrastructure, originally designed for energy-intensive cryptocurrency operations, is now being repurposed and optimized to run and train generative AI models. This transition highlights a broader industry trend: the repurposing of high-capacity data centers from crypto mining to AI, leveraging existing power grids and physical infrastructure for new computational frontiers. This pivot by Core Scientific makes it an ideal target for CoreWeave, which specializes in high-performance computing for AI. The synergy allows CoreWeave to rapidly expand its footprint without the lengthy and capital-intensive process of building new facilities from scratch. Unlocking Tremendous Gigawatt Capacity for AI Workloads The immediate benefit of this CoreWeave acquisition is the substantial increase in its operational capacity. Gaining access to over a gigawatt capacity is a game-changer in the fiercely competitive AI landscape. This vast energy potential will be directly applied to facilitating AI training and inference workloads, which are the backbone of developing and deploying advanced AI models. These workloads require immense parallel processing power, typically provided by thousands of GPUs. Key advantages of this expanded capacity include: Accelerated AI Development: More available compute power means AI companies can train larger, more complex models faster, reducing development cycles. Scalability for Demand: CoreWeave can better meet the surging demand from AI startups and enterprises looking for specialized cloud infrastructure. Competitive Edge: This move solidifies CoreWeave’s position as a leading provider in a market where computational resources are the new gold. Operational Efficiency: Leveraging Core Scientific’s existing, optimized data centers allows for quicker deployment and potentially lower operational costs compared to greenfield developments. The Escalating Race for Cloud Infrastructure Dominance The CoreWeave acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a significant marker in the escalating global race among cloud infrastructure providers to expand their data center footprints. The computational demands of AI companies appear seemingly endless, driving an unprecedented demand for specialized hardware and the facilities to house it. Just last week, Bloomberg reported another colossal deal: OpenAI, a key player in the generative AI space, struck an agreement with Oracle to rent an additional 4.5 gigawatts worth of data center capacity. This expansion builds upon their already massive “Stargate” infrastructure deal, illustrating the scale of investment required to power the next generation of AI. This arms race for compute capacity is redefining the technology landscape, pushing companies to acquire, build, and partner at an unprecedented pace to secure the necessary resources for AI innovation. Navigating the Future of AI Compute and Industry Consolidation This CoreWeave acquisition of Core Scientific highlights a critical trend: the forced consolidation within the data industry driven by enterprise AI. As AI models grow in complexity and size, the infrastructure required to support them becomes increasingly specialized and expensive. This naturally leads to larger players acquiring smaller, but strategically valuable, assets. What does this mean for the future of AI compute? We can anticipate: Further Consolidation: Expect more mergers and acquisitions as companies vie for control over limited data center space and energy resources. Increased Specialization: Cloud providers will continue to differentiate themselves by offering highly specialized services tailored for AI, rather than general-purpose computing. Energy Demands: The energy requirements for AI will continue to soar, putting pressure on power grids and accelerating the search for sustainable energy solutions for AI data centers . Innovation in Hardware: The intense demand will spur further innovation in GPU and other AI-specific hardware development. The strategic importance of owning and operating vast data center capacity cannot be overstated in the age of AI. CoreWeave’s move is a bold statement, positioning it as a formidable force in providing the backbone for the AI revolution. A New Era for AI Infrastructure The acquisition of Core Scientific by CoreWeave for $9 billion marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence. By securing over a gigawatt capacity , CoreWeave is not just expanding its footprint; it’s strategically investing in the very foundation of future AI development. This deal, set against the backdrop of an industry-wide race for compute power, underscores the immense value placed on data center resources capable of handling intensive AI workloads. As companies like CoreWeave and Core Scientific adapt and innovate, they are shaping the future of generative AI and the digital economy, proving that in the age of AI, compute power is indeed the ultimate currency.

2025-07-08T10:01:00,"Cardano Founder Claims He Rejected El Salvador Proposal Over Gang Links","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has alleged that he walked away from a potential deal to implement Cardano in El Salvador in 2021, citing concerns over the government’s plan to airdrop cryptocurrency directly to citizens, including members of the notorious MS-13 gang. In a recent interview on the Shawn Ryan Show, Hoskinson detailed a chaotic week of discussions with President Nayib Bukele’s administration, claiming the proposed airdrop risked violating U.S. sanctions and drawing severe backlash from Washington. Chaotic Encounters Hoskinson painted a picture of disarray within the Salvadoran government during a 2021 visit to the country. He described meetings with eccentric officials, including a Minister of Energy who declared, “The power of magma will be the destiny of El Salvador,” as plans for a geothermal-powered Bitcoin mining hub were pitched. According to the blockchain innovator, the implementation strategies for the national adoption of BTC in El Salvador lacked structure, with officials allegedly using WhatsApp and Facebook speeches from President Bukele as informal policy guides. “We asked, what are the compliance guidelines for adopting cryptocurrency here? [They said] ‘We don’t have any,’” Hoskinson reminisced. “Where are you getting your business requirements? They said Facebook.” However, the pivotal issue emerged during U.S. consultations. Hoskinson claimed discussions revealed Bukele’s intent for a universal airdrop, which he argued would funnel cryptocurrency to MS-13, designated a Transnational Criminal Organization by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). “Bukele, for example, wanted to do an airdrop to everybody in El Salvador,” Hoskinson stated. “And we’re like, okay, but MS-13 is on an OFAC list. And so if we give Bitcoin to all these people, we’re facilitating a transfer of value to a terrorist organization. That’s no bueno.” He also added that coordination with U.S. authorities proved impossible, particularly under the Biden administration, which he claimed adopted a “regime change” stance towards Bukele. “We just couldn’t get there. So, we passed on the deal after a week,” he concluded. Despite the withdrawal, El Salvador pressed forward with Bitcoin, making it legal tender and launching the government-backed Chivo wallet. Hoskinson admitted that the move was historic, with the Central American nation currently holding 6,230 BTC worth about $679 million. “It was a very pivotal moment,” He said. “It actually made Bitcoin the official currency and it forced the IMF, and it forced all the transnational bodies to actually start recognizing Bitcoin.” Market Reaction The explosive claims elicited swift skepticism, with Bitcoin advocate Cory Bates questioning the narrative’s accuracy: “I have a feeling this is not quite how the story went.” Pseudonymous analyst The Bitcoin Therapist was more blunt, calling it the “dumbest sh*t I’ve ever heard.” Neither Bukele’s administration nor U.S. officials have publicly verified Hoskinson’s account. Meanwhile, Cardano’s native ADA token is showing modest resilience. At the time of this writing, it was trading at $0.5768, up 2.0% in the last seven days to slightly outperform the broader crypto market. However, it remains down 12.5% over the last month and significantly lags its September 2021 all-time high of $3.09.

2025-07-08T10:00:11,"Russia Cracks Down on Crypto Miners, New Registry Tracks Your Rig","Russia has introduced a national registry for cryptocurrency mining hardware, marking a new step in its effort to formalize and regulate the industry. According to state-run media outlet RIA Novosti, the registry has already been deployed in key regions with high mining activity and is intended to help authorities better monitor energy usage tied to mining operations. This effort, led jointly by the Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service, and the Ministry of Digital Development, signals an expansion of the country’s broader regulatory oversight of the crypto mining sector. Government Tightens Oversight Through Energy-Based Tracking and Taxation The creation of the registry follows previous government moves to curb unregulated mining activity, particularly in areas experiencing strain on power infrastructure. In February, the Ministry of Energy first proposed the registry as a mechanism to track crypto mining operations through their energy consumption footprint. Authorities argue that this step is necessary not only for effective taxation but also for managing regional energy stability, especially given the surge in mining linked to Russia’s low electricity costs and favorable climate for mining hardware. The registry complements several recent policy developments aimed at tightening control over digital asset activities in Russia. Earlier this year, miners were officially given the ability to declare their crypto earnings online through a system implemented by the Federal Tax Service. This followed the formal enactment of a legal tax framework for crypto mining that was approved by President Vladimir Putin and came into force in 2025. The framework enables authorities to tax mining revenues while providing a legal foundation for enforcement actions. Mining Bans, Asset Seizures, and the Push Toward Full Compliance In parallel with these developments, Russian officials have also implemented a multi-year ban on crypto mining in six energy-strained regions. The ban, which will last until March 15, 2031, is meant to alleviate power shortages caused by unregulated energy-intensive mining farms. Officials have not disclosed the names of all affected regions, but previous reports cited Irkutsk and Dagestan among the high-consumption areas drawing government scrutiny. Further legislative measures are under development as well. The Ministry of Digital Development has reportedly proposed a new bill that would enable courts to confiscate digital assets and levy significant fines on individuals or entities violating mining rules. According to Forbes Russia , the maximum fine for corporate entities could reach up to 2 million rubles, or approximately $22,000. While this legislation is still pending, it forms part of a broader attempt to integrate crypto mining into Russia’s official regulatory and economic frameworks. The country has emerged as one of the world’s leading hubs for proof-of-work mining, particularly for Bitcoin. With its vast energy resources and previously lax oversight, Russia’s share of the global hash rate has grown in recent years. However, the latest moves suggest a shift toward centralized management, where only registered and tax-compliant mining operations may continue to operate without legal consequence.

Trump’s Tariff Shock Sparks 4.5% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong start to the week, market sentiment took a sharp turn as traders adopted a more cautious tone. Early excitement around Pump.fun’s PUMP token cooled quickly after Gate.io mysteriously removed its presale announcement, which had briefly teased a $600 million target for July 12. Meanwhile, Bit Digital made waves by selling all its Bitcoin holdings and shifting its entire treasury to Ethereum, now holding over 100,000 ETH worth $254.8 million, making it one of the largest public ETH holders. But the real shock came, as the crypto market plunged 4.5% following President Trump’s unexpected tariff letters to 14 countries. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and especially Dogecoin tumbled, with the fallout spreading to crypto stocks and broader markets, triggering renewed investor anxiety. BREAKING: President Trump sends out more “tariff letters” with the following tariff rates announced today: 1. Cambodia: 36% 2. Thailand: 36% 3. Bangladesh: 35% 4. Serbia: 35% 5. Indonesia: 32% 6.

Countries like South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and South Africa were among the first to receive the notices. Trump justified the tariffs as a response to persistent trade deficits, warning of further hikes if retaliation follows. However, critics like economist Peter Schiff say these measures miss the mark entirely. According to Schiff, the issue lies more with U.S. competitiveness than unfair foreign practices. Trump's letters to Japan and South Korea demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of trade. Tariffs have nothing to do with America's trade deficits with either nation. Japan's tariffs on U.S. goods average less than 2%, and Korea's average less than 1%. Our trade deficits… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 7, 2025 While many agree with Schiff, other crypto users think that countries like South Africa and Malaysia are being targeted for aligning with BRICS and China, while pressure on Japan and South Korea aims to secure loyalty in key supply chains. Tariff 2.0 war is getting more intense. Rate Cut Hopes Fade as Uncertainty Grows Adding to the chaos, hopes for a Fed rate cut are fading. The CME FedWatch Tool shows chances of a cut by September dropping to 61.9%, down from 90% just weeks ago. Yields are rising regardless of trade war news, signaling that deficit spending is now steering the economy. With tariffs set to begin in August and the crypto market already reacting harshly, traders are bracing for more turbulence ahead. Crypto Implications Tariff deadline uncertainty has shaken investor confidence, weakening overall risk appetite, something crypto markets heavily rely on. As a result, price action remains choppy, with most altcoins already struggling to gain momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) took a dip of 1.56% below the $108K mark. After settling at $107K. Ethereum dipped slightly to $2,554, while XRP and Polygon bucked the trend with modest gains. Meanwhile, Dogecoin and Solana saw deeper losses. Looking ahead, investor focus is shifting to the upcoming “Crypto Week” starting July 14, when key U.S. bills like the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act could shape the next regulatory chapter for digital assets. Stocks and Miners Join the Slide It wasn’t just crypto that felt the sting; stocks took a tumble, too.

This ambitious effort seeks to awaken $ADA’s dormant reserves, giving rise to an interesting debate among Cardano users. By incorporating $ADA, the Midnight token, and the top 50 Cardano native tokens, Hoskinson’s concept could establish a foundation for Cardano’s future in decentralized finance (DeFi). Backing $ADA and Native Tokens In a strategic X post, Hoskinson described a digital asset treasury to back Cardano’s ecosystem, departing from his prior contentious idea of maintaining a Bitcoin reserve. That concept had drawn skepticism, with detractors claiming it relied too much on a competing initiative. What do you guys think about a digital asset treasury for ada, the top 50 cardano native assets, and midnight? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 7, 2025 At present, Hoskinson is dedicated to Cardano, working on a treasury reserve that supports $ADA, the privacy-focused Midnight token, as well as prominent native tokens like SNEK, World Mobile Token (WMTYX), Liquid Finance (LQ), Minswap (MIN), and Indigo Protocol (INDY), according to CoinGecko data. Cardano’s Treasury Plan: Top 50 Too Generous? The proposed treasury aims to boost Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and stimulate total value locked (TVL), firming its position in the competitive blockchain space. By enabling synergy among high-ranking native tokens, Hoskinson looks forward to a prosperous, interconnected Cardano network. Yet, the plan has mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some users have hailed the proposal, while others say the top 50 would be too generous. One user pointed out that the treasury should not be holding the native token. A Defining Moment for Cardano Hoskinson’s commitment to activate Cardano’s treasury highlights his devotion to a dynamic, ready-to-use ecosystem.

2025-07-08T09:48:12,"AI Data: Unlocking the Future of Enterprise AI Through Strategic Data Consolidation","BitcoinWorld AI Data: Unlocking the Future of Enterprise AI Through Strategic Data Consolidation In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where blockchain innovations and decentralized finance are constantly reshaping industries, another seismic shift is underway: the profound impact of artificial intelligence on the very foundation of data itself. For anyone tracking the pulse of technological progress, it’s clear that AI is not just a tool; it’s a catalyst forcing a dramatic reshaping of the data industry. This transformation, marked by significant data industry consolidation , is driven by an urgent need to empower the next generation of AI applications. The success of AI hinges entirely on access to high-quality, well-managed AI data , and companies are now racing to acquire the pieces they need to build a robust foundation. The Unstoppable Wave of Data Industry Consolidation The past few months have seen a flurry of high-profile acquisitions signaling a clear trend: the data industry is consolidating at an unprecedented pace. Giants like Databricks and Salesforce are making strategic moves, with Databricks acquiring Neon for $1 billion and Salesforce snapping up Informatica for a staggering $8 billion. These deals, varying in size and focus, share a common goal: to secure the necessary technology to drive enterprise AI adoption. The underlying belief is simple yet profound: AI’s value is directly proportional to the quality of its foundational data. Without superior data, AI applications struggle to deliver meaningful insights or create real value. Enterprise VCs echo this sentiment. A Bitcoin World survey from December 2024 highlighted that data quality is a critical differentiator for AI startups. Gaurav Dhillon, former CEO of Informatica and current chairman and CEO at SnapLogic, emphasized this shift in an interview with Bitcoin World: “There is a complete reset in how data is managed and flows around the enterprise. If people want to seize the AI imperative, they have to redo their data platforms in a very big way. And this is where I believe you’re seeing all these data acquisitions, because this is the foundation to have a sound AI strategy .” This push for consolidation isn’t just about growth; it’s about survival and relevance in an AI-first world. Companies are realizing that their existing data infrastructure, often built over decades, simply isn’t equipped for the demands of modern AI. Why Quality AI Data is the New Gold Standard The success of any artificial intelligence endeavor, from complex machine learning models to advanced AI agents, is intrinsically tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying data. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a practical necessity. Imagine trying to train a sophisticated AI model on incomplete, inconsistent, or poorly structured data – the results would be unreliable, biased, and ultimately, useless. This fundamental truth is driving the current wave of acquisitions. For enterprises aiming to leverage AI for competitive advantage, investing in robust AI data pipelines and management systems is no longer optional. It’s the core differentiator. Companies are recognizing that fragmented data, residing in disparate silos, severely limits AI’s potential. The acquired technologies are seen as the missing puzzle pieces that can unify these data sources, clean them, and prepare them for AI consumption. This ensures that when AI applications are deployed, they are fed with the precise, high-fidelity data they need to perform optimally, delivering accurate insights and automating processes effectively. Navigating the Fragmented Data Management Solutions Landscape For the past decade, the data industry has evolved into a sprawling, often disjointed ecosystem. Over $300 billion was invested into data startups from 2020 to 2024 across more than 24,000 deals, according to PitchBook. This venture capital boom led to a proliferation of specialized startups, many focusing on niche areas or even single features within the broader data stack. While this fostered innovation, it also created a highly fragmented landscape. The problem arises when enterprises attempt to implement comprehensive AI solutions. The current industry standard, which often involves bundling together numerous disparate data management solutions , each with its own specific focus, proves inefficient and ineffective for AI. AI models require seamless access to vast quantities of interconnected data to crawl, analyze, and build applications. A patchwork of incompatible systems simply doesn’t cut it. A prime example illustrating this challenge is Fivetran’s recent acquisition of Census. Fivetran specializes in moving data into cloud databases, while Census facilitates moving data out. Prior to the acquisition, Fivetran customers needed a second company to achieve an end-to-end solution. As George Fraser, co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, explained to Bitcoin World, even though moving data in and out seems similar, the underlying technical challenges are distinct. This scenario highlights how customers are growing frustrated with a multitude of incompatible products, pushing for integrated solutions. Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst, now running SanjMo, his data trend advisory firm, notes: “This consolidation is being driven by customers being fed up with a multitude of products that are incompatible. We live in a very interesting world where there are a lot of different data storage solutions… but the one area where we have failed is metadata. Dozens of these products are capturing some metadata but to do their job, it’s an overlap.” This fragmentation has made the industry ripe for consolidation, with AI serving as the ultimate catalyst. Strategic AI Adoption: Benefits for Startups and Enterprises While the focus is often on the acquiring giants, this wave of consolidation also brings significant benefits to the startups being acquired. In the current venture capital climate, marked by a quiet IPO market and slower funding rounds, an acquisition often represents a highly favorable exit strategy. As Derek Hernandez, a senior emerging tech analyst at PitchBook, told Bitcoin World: “The best solutions are being acquired currently. Even if you have an award-winning solution, I don’t know that the outlook for staying private ultimately wins over going to a larger [acquirer].” For startups struggling to raise capital, being acquired provides much-needed liquidity and, in many cases, allows founding teams to continue building their vision with the resources of a larger entity. This symbiotic relationship benefits both sides: For Startups: It offers a viable exit in a challenging market, validates their technology, and provides access to greater resources, distribution channels, and talent. For Acquirers: It allows them to quickly integrate missing features, fill existing gaps in their data stack, gain a competitive edge, and improve pricing leverage by offering more comprehensive solutions. This accelerated path to enhanced capabilities is crucial for achieving widespread enterprise AI adoption . The Informatica deal, even with a slight haircut from initial discussions, exemplifies this win-win scenario, proving to be the best solution for their board. The Future of AI Strategy: Merging Data and Intelligence Despite the current acquisition spree, a lingering question remains: will this strategy of acquiring companies built in a pre-ChatGPT era truly facilitate rapid enterprise AI adoption in today’s dynamic market? Gaurav Dhillon himself expressed doubts, noting that the current AI landscape is only about three years old. He suggests that larger companies aiming for truly transformative AI innovations, particularly for the ‘agentic enterprise,’ will require substantial retooling. This brings us to a critical juncture for future AI strategy . If the company with the best data ultimately wins the AI race, does it make sense for data management companies and AI development companies to remain separate entities? Derek Hernandez of PitchBook posits a compelling future: “I think a lot of the value is in merging the major AI players with the data management companies. I don’t know that a standalone data management company is particularly incentivized to remain so and, kind of like, play a third party between enterprises and AI solutions.” This suggests a future where the lines between data management and AI development blur, possibly leading to a more integrated approach where AI capabilities are deeply embedded within the data infrastructure itself. The current wave of consolidation might just be the first step towards a more unified ecosystem where data and intelligence are inseparable. Conclusion: Building the Foundation for an AI-Powered Tomorrow The ongoing data industry consolidation is a clear indicator of AI’s transformative power. It underscores the critical importance of high-quality AI data as the bedrock for any successful AI endeavor. While the strategy of acquiring existing data management solutions is a pragmatic response to the immediate need for better data infrastructure, the long-term success of enterprise AI adoption may depend on even deeper integration and retooling. As companies navigate this complex landscape, the focus will remain on building robust, unified data platforms that can truly unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence. The future of AI is not just about algorithms; it’s about the data that fuels them.

2025-07-08T09:38:53,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: $237M Buy and Musk’s Party Signal $110K Breakout","Bitcoin (BTC) is holding near $108,341 today, buoyed by renewed confidence following Elon Musk’s official endorsement of the America Party’s support for Bitcoin adoption. In a statement posted on X, Musk labeled fiat money “hopeless” and positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of the party’s fiscal vision ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. While critics dubbed the move “soundbite,” Musk’s companies, SpaceX and Tesla, already hold nearly 19,800 BTC, worth over $2.1 billion. His endorsement reinforces the asset’s credibility as a long-term hedge against inflation and centralized policy risk. Though the announcement triggered only a modest uptick to $107,838, sentiment in the crypto space turned notably more optimistic. Elon Musk Declares Fiat ‘Hopeless,’ Says America Party Will Embrace Bitcoin ► https://t.co/hxKSXEKXdh https://t.co/hxKSXEKXdh — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) July 7, 2025 The symbolic embrace of Bitcoin by a political party led by one of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs could influence U.S. crypto regulation. It signals a broader shift in how digital assets may be treated in future political and economic strategies. Metaplanet’s $237M Buy Fuels Bullish Narrative Japan’s Metaplanet added 2,204 BTC this week for $237 million, becoming the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 15,555 BTC. This leapfrogs Tesla and CleanSpark, highlighting the continued expansion of Bitcoin treasury strategies among global firms.

These strategic accumulations are cushioning price action during macro volatility and reinforcing long-term bullish expectations. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Support Holds On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is bouncing off the ascending trendline support, with the 50-SMA at $108,146 providing dynamic support. The $108,941 resistance remains the ceiling to break. The recent price structure features small-bodied candles and long wicks, indicating indecision rather than rejection. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI sits neutral at 49.60, and no bearish divergence is present, suggesting momentum is steady but still searching for conviction. A breakout above $108,941 could drive BTC toward $109,727 and $110,561. Losing the trendline and 50-SMA could drag it to $107,323 or even $106,422. Trade Setup: Buy Entry: Above $108,950 on strong bullish candle Target 1: $109,727 Target 2: $110,561 Stop-Loss: Below $108,100 For now, Bitcoin’s technical structure remains intact. As long as the trendline holds and price stays above the 50-SMA, the bulls maintain short-term control. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,061,881 out of a $2,510,240 target.

2025-07-08T09:36:07,"Strategy Holds 11th Largest U.S. Corporate Treasury, Bitcoin Rivals Big Cash Reserves","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this article has shares in Strategy (MSTR). Strategy (MSTR) now holds almost $65 billion in bitcoin (BTC), which makes it the 11th largest corporate treasury holder of bitcoin in the U.S. In its investor presentation for the new STRD at-the-market equity program , Strategy compares itself to companies that hold cash on their balance sheets. Berkshire Hathaway ranks No. 1, holding $410 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA), the world's largest company by market cap, holds $66 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In the presentation, MSTR said it is on track to achieve both its bitcoin percentage yield and bitcoin dollar gain targets for 2025. The target for bitcoin yield is 25%, and so far it has reached 19.7%. The dollar gain target is $15 billion, and that currently stands at $9.6 billion. Strategy also achieved an unrealized gain on digital assets of $14 billion in the second quarter. MSTR’s perpetual preferred stock has outperformed the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF), which the Tysons Corner, Virginia company identified as its benchmark. STRK is up 51% since its Jan. 31 debut, while the PFF has lost 3%. STRF, which started trading March 21, has gained 38% versus a 1% drop in PFF. STRD is 12% higher, outpacing PFF's 2% advance. As part of Strategy’s current $42 billion fundraising plan, it has issued $23.9 billion.

2025-07-08T09:33:28,"XRP against BTC Nears Critical Resistance for the Fifth Time in 30 Days: Will XRP Finally Outpace Bitcoin?","The XRP-to-Bitcoin pair is again testing a major resistance level, and all eyes are on whether this latest push will finally break through. Analyst CrediBULL Crypto highlighted the XRP/BTC pair's price action in his latest post on X. According to his analysis, XRP/BTC is now making its fifth attempt at a breakout at a level that has faced strong rejection multiple times in recent weeks.XRP's Fifth Attempt at 0.00002162 BTCNotably, the resistance zone is around 0.00002162 BTC. It has acted as a ceiling for XRP/BTC since early June. Each time the pair approached this level, it was rejected, resulting in four failed breakout attempts marked on the chart.The current move marks the fifth retest, and market watchers are speculating whether XRP can finally close above this stubborn level. XRP/BTC 4H chart by CrediBULL Rejection or Breakout?CrediBULL’s chart shows a horizontal barrier at the 100% Fibonacci level, which has capped every bullish rally for the past month. He suggested that a successful breakout and daily close above this zone could trigger a bullish continuation.In that scenario, the next major target for XRP is around 0.00002646 BTC, a level not seen since April.However, if history repeats itself, another rejection could pull XRP/BTC back toward the 0.00001938 BTC support level. This has served as the last line of defense for bulls. In particular, XRP has tested this support twice in recent weeks, rebounding shortly after each time.Broader Context: XRP Lagging Behind BTCWhile Bitcoin continues to maintain strong dominance, XRP has struggled to gain relative strength. The coin has found it difficult to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum in recent months. XRP’s price has remained largely around $2 for several weeks, while Bitcoin has been retesting its all-time high.However, the anticipated breakout from the current move could mark a turning point. Should XRP/BTC rally to 0.00002646 BTC, as CrediBULL's chart suggests, it would translate to a unit price of approximately $2.86. This puts XRP on track to challenge the $3 level.Overcoming the 0.00002646 BTC resistance would set XRP up to challenge the next barrier at 0.00003411 BTC, equivalent to around $3.70. This paints a promising path for XRP to potentially break its all-time high.XRP Could Still Reach $20–$30 Against BitcoinWhile these are short-term outlooks, CrediBULL has projected an even more promising future for XRP this cycle. Specifically, he believes XRP could reach new all-time highs against both BTC and ETH.Based on previous ATHs in the XRP/BTC and XRP/ETH pairings, he suggested that with Bitcoin at $100K, XRP could reach $22 or more. Similarly, with Ethereum at $5K, XRP could climb to $18.Interestingly, CrediBULL emphasized that these are conservative end-of-cycle targets, and BTC has already surpassed one of them. In parallel, he sees a $20–$30 XRP as a realistic and even conservative projection if XRP regains its prior strength relative to BTC or ETH.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/08/xrp-against-btc-nears-critical-resistance-for-the-fifth-time-in-30-days-will-xrp-finally-outpace-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-against-btc-nears-critical-resistance-for-the-fifth-time-in-30-days-will-xrp-finally-outpace-bitcoin,"XRP|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T09:31:34,"HYPE Plunges by 5% as BTC Price Slips Back to $108K: Market Watch","Bitcoin’s price ascent to almost $110,000 was short-lived, as most previous attempts, and the asset was pushed south by over two grand from top to bottom. Most altcoins are also in the red on a daily scale, including some larger-cap ones, such as HYPE, DOGE, and LINK. BTC Back to $108K The start of July was rather sluggish, but BTC went downhill on the second day of the month, tumbling from $108,000 to $105,000. However, the bulls stepped up at this point and didn’t allow another price drop. Instead, the cryptocurrency started to recover and quickly returned to $108,000. Moreover, it kept pumping and tapped a multi-week at $110,500 on the next day. These fluctuations, though, seem to be doomed from the start during this calm summer consolidation phase, and BTC went back down to $108,000 almost immediately. It spent the weekend there but started to gain traction once again on Monday morning when it jumped past $109,600. The scenario repeated once again, and bitcoin is now back to $108,000. Its market cap has slipped to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is back to 63% on CoinGecko. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE Heads South While yesterday was a good day for major altcoins, the landscape has changed slightly today, and most are in the red. Ethereum has slipped by around 1% but has remained well above $2,500. Similar minor losses are evident from BNB, SOL, ADA, SUI, and LEO, while DOGE and LINK have dropped slightly more. HYPE has declined the most from the larger-cap alts, having lost almost 5% of value on a 24-hour scale. As a result, the popular altcoin is below $38 now. The biggest loser from the top 100 alts is FARTCOIN (-8%), followed by SPX (-7.7%) and TIA (-7%). In contrast, TKX has surged by 11% to over $15. The total crypto market cap has shed around $20 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.420 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-08T09:30:25,"50% Bitcoin Price Crash On The Horizon? Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target","Despite the Bitcoin price holding up quite nicely above $100,000 and remaining very close to its all-time high levels, there continues to be expectations of a massive crash that would rock the market. Pseudonymous crypto analyst FriendlyRox points to a number of indicators for this, going from volume to momentum, all pointing to a possible price crash. What is the expected result of this? Losing the $100,000 psychological level and then falling to previous peaks. Bitcoin Price At Risk With Dwindling Volume And Momentum In the analysis, FriendlyRox highlighted the decline in major metrics such as momentum and volume as the major driver of the forecasted price crash. This comes amid bullish news dominating the headlines, such as institutions increasing their Bitcoin holdings and supply on exchanges falling toward new lows, meaning investors are choosing to hold for higher prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Explosive Breakout: $5,791 The Minimum Target–Analyst The decline in the volume has been apparent after the Bitcoin price had fallen below $100,000 before bouncing back up in June. So far, in the month of July, the Bitcoin trading volumes have trended lower, with data from Coinglass showing consistent daily volumes below $100 billion. At the same time, there has also been a decline in momentum, with the analyst pointing out a negative divergence in this metric. Furthermore, the Bitcoin price has also flashed a historical trend that has usually predated market tops. This is price reaching the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and then retracing. FriendlyRox revealed that in the past, whenever the price touched the 50 EMA and then extended back, it usually signalled a crash, and the Bitcoin price has done this now, extending even further. Other metrics that have also flashed bearishness include the RSI and the MACD, both of which are now showing a loss of momentum as they moved into the negative. All of these factors happening together at the same time have painted a pretty bleak picture for the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. BTC Bottom Targets With the lineup of bearish developments, the crypto analyst has predicted an approximately 50% from here. As volume continues to decrease and momentum slides into the negative, they expect that the Bitcoin price will be looking to retrace back to the 50 EMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The interesting fact here is that the 50 EMA falls below the previous Bitcoin price peak, putting it at $60,000. A crash of this magnitude would only be rivaled by the COVID crash in 2020 and the FTX-induced market crash back in 2022. But nevertheless, it would mean a wipeout for altcoins across the board. As for the timeframe for when this could happen, there is no definite timeline. Going by the analyst’s chart, it could take a couple of years for this to completely play out, with the analyst closing with: “Let us see how it unfolds.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/50-bitcoin-price-crash-60000/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-08T09:30:00,"SEC Acknowledges Trump Media Bitcoin and Ether ETF","The ETF’s launch would coincide with the growing momentum in the crypto ETF space and speculation about a more streamlined SEC approval process. While Trump Media’s application progressed, the SEC delayed Fidelity’s Solana ETF by reopening public commentary. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to dominate the market, and even recently surpassed 700,000 BTC in holdings. Additionally, it drove 42% of last week’s crypto ETF inflows. Crypto investment products saw $1.04 billion in total weekly inflows, with Ethereum posting its 11th consecutive week of gains. Investor sentiment also still looks optimistic, buoyed by strong institutional demand, record AUM, and Bitcoin’s recovery. SEC Starts Review of Trump Media Crypto ETF The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally acknowledged Trump Media's application to launch a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), triggering the regulatory countdown for the agency to make a decision on the proposal. The ETFwill be listed on NYSE Arca, and give investors direct exposure to the two leading cryptocurrencies. It will allocate 75% of its holdings to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether. According to the filing, Crypto.com’s Foris DAX Trust Company will serve as the custodian, and Yorkville America Digital will sponsor the fund. The ETF’s valuation will rely on the CME CF reference rates , with Bitcoin tracked via the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and Ethereum via the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, unless otherwise decided by the sponsor. To boost security, the fund’s crypto assets will be stored in cold storage and held in separate accounts from other customers. This development happened during a wave of crypto ETF applications and speculation that the SEC may soon streamline its ETF approval process through a simplified listing structure. Under the proposed structure, issuers would only need to file a Form S-1 and wait 75 days, during which the SEC can object. Trump Media initially submitted its S-1 form for the crypto ETF on June 16, and this latest update indicates a step forward in the process. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s proposed Solana ETF was delayed once again by the SEC, which has opened a new public comment period. Interested parties now have 21 days to respond and 35 days to submit rebuttals. The application to list the fund was originally submitted by Cboe BZX Exchange on March 25. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that the delay was anticipated and tied it to the broader lack of clarity around a comprehensive digital asset exchange-traded product framework. Despite the delay, Seyffart still believes that recent SEC interactions, including requests for amendments to SOL ETF filings, should be interpreted as a constructive sign. While not approvals, the back-and-forth between the agency and ETF issuers means that there is ongoing engagement with the crypto ETF landscape. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Tops 700K BTC Another crypto ETF is also turning heads. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF surpassed a major milestone as it now holds over 700,000 BTC , valued at approximately $75.5 billion. This achievement happened after its $164.6 million inflow on Monday, bringing the fund’s total holdings to 700,307 BTC according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) launched in January of 2024, and it saw very rapid growth. In fact, it currently represents over 55% of the total Bitcoin held across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data from BlackRock’s own website shows the fund added 1,388 BTC in just two trading sessions, up from 698,919 BTC last Thursday. Since its inception, IBIT delivered a return of 82.67%. The success of IBIT is not only measured in holdings and performance. Reports suggest BlackRock is now earning more revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. This means that there is a dramatic shift in investor appetite towards digital assets over traditional equities. Demand for Bitcoin by major financial institutions continues to outpace supply. According to Galaxy Research , US Bitcoin ETFs and Michael Saylor’s Strategy together acquired $28.22 billion worth of BTC in 2025. This overshadows the $7.85 billion worth of new Bitcoin that was issued by miners during the same period. The aggressive accumulation outpaced supply every month this year except February, when the combined entities offloaded $842 million in Bitcoin. At the same time, regulators seem to be softening their stance on crypto-related ETFs. This regulatory momentum follows the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF , the first US ETF to offer exposure to a staked crypto asset. The product allows investors to gain exposure to SOL while also benefiting from its staking rewards. BlackRock Drives 42% of Crypto Inflows Cryptocurrency investment products continued to attract strong capital inflows last week, despite the heightened market volatility that affected major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a report from CoinShares , global crypto exchange-traded products recorded $1.04 billion in inflows for the week ending Friday, pushing year-to-date inflows to nearly $19 billion. This is a new historical record. Assets under management in crypto ETPs also reached an all-time high of $188 billion, up from $184.4 billion the previous week. Weekly crypto asset flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin products led the charge after bringing in $790 million, and accounting for 76% of the total inflows. However, inflows into Bitcoin products were still lower than the $1.5 billion weekly average that was seen over the previous three weeks. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill attributed this slowdown to investors adopting a more cautious approach as Bitcoin nears its previous all-time highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum investment products saw their 11th consecutive week of inflows, with $225 million added. Butterfill pointed out that Etheeumr’s weekly inflows averaged 1.6% of assets under management, outpacing Bitcoin’s 0.8%. A big portion of the total crypto inflows was funneled through BlackRock’s crypto funds, which brought in $436 million, or 42% of last week’s total issuer inflows. (Source: CoinShares ) The United States dominated regional inflows once again by bringing in $1 billion despite markets being closed last Friday for the July 4th holiday. Germany and Switzerland followed with inflows of $38.5 million and $33.7 million, respectively. In contrast, Canada and Brazil recorded outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million. Canada’s outflows happened in the same month that local issuer 3iQ launched a spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Despite the volatility, investor sentiment remained bullish, with the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index holding at 66, firmly in “Greed.” Bitcoin’s price dipped as low as $105,400 last Tuesday before rebounding above $110,000 by Thursday.

2025-07-08T09:27:40,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surge on Hold Amid Trump Tariffs Uncertainty?","After Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had announced on Monday that several trade deals would be made over the following 48 hours, President Trump has upped the ante once again by threatening any countries with a 10% tariff if they do deals with the BRICS nations. Japan and South Korea also received notice of potential 25% tariffs. Can Bitcoin still surge to an all-time high in this kind of economic environment? More turmoil in US trade deals On Monday all seemed fairly serene as far as the long-running saga of US trade deals goes. However, US President Donald Trump put the cat back among the pigeons by announcing that any country that sided with the BRICS nations in deals that were “anti American”, would be hit by a 10% additional tariff. Not content with this, the US president also put allies Japan and S. Korea in the crosshairs, threatening a 25% levy on both, to come into force on 1 August. In the face of these impending tariffs, it might have been expected that the Asian stock market would be feeling the pressure. However, the opposite has been true. The Hang Seng Index is up more than 1% in overnight trading. Another fakeout narrowly avoided Source: TradingView In the midst of yet more tariff uncertainty, the 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that another fakeout has been narrowly avoided. The price was able to cling to the upper trendline of the bull flag without a candle body opening below. It seems that the price may just continue to roll along the top of the trendline until such time as the bulls are good and ready to send it skyward. SMAs on the daily are in order ready for upside move Source: TradingView The daily chart is shown with the simple moving averages (SMA). This illustrates that the 50 SMA (blue), 100 SMA (green), and the 200 SMA (red) are now in order. All three of these SMAs should now begin to angle upward, following the price as soon as it starts surging. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicators angled downward. If the price continues to move sideways for a few more days, the indicator lines can drop to the bottom and then tick back up, signalling upside price momentum for $BTC’s next rise. Weekly chart shows $BTC ready for lift-off Source: TradingView The weekly chart reveals that the $BTC price is just about ready to head higher.

2025-07-08T09:15:39,"Alleged Mastermind Behind $30,000,000 Scam That Targeted Elderly Americans Arrested: Report","A 42-year-old man who is accused of running a $30 million scam targeting elderly Americans has reportedly just been arrested in Canada. Gareth West was arrested in Quebec on behalf of American authorities and is now facing extradition to the United States to face fraud charges, reports CBC/Radio-Canada. West is alleged to have posed as a wealthy real estate developer while running a complex “grandparent scam network” that employed more than 20 people and included multiple call centers in the Montreal area. He faces charges in the US of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). West is alleged to have been the mastermind behind grandparent scammers since at least 2021. The scammers would allegedly phone older Americans, pretend they were their grandchildren who had been arrested or hurt, and say they needed cash right away. Scammers would connect the elderly victims to fake lawyers or bail agents and arrange for cash pickups. Some 23 of West’s alleged scammer employees were arrested in March. Police allege that documents they’ve recovered from the suspected scammers show they scammed $30 million during a span of about 67 weeks. West faces up to 40 years in prison if extradited to the US and convicted of the crimes.

2025-07-08T09:15:24,"Two Genesis Ethereum Wallets Reactivate After Nearly a Decade","Two Ethereum wallets that had remained untouched for almost ten years became active on Monday, transferring a combined 1,140 ETH valued at approximately $2.9 million. The wallets, starting with “ 0x27 ” and “ 0x7f ,” were created on July 30, 2015, aligning with the network’s “Frontier” mainnet launch. Records on Etherscan indicate these wallets received their initial Ether through “GENESIS” transactions, confirming they were funded at launch. When Ethereum debuted in 2015, it operated on a proof-of-work model similar to Bitcoin, allowing miners to earn rewards by securing the network. In September 2022, Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake system during The Merge, reducing the network’s energy consumption while maintaining its security and decentralization. Market data suggests that ETH has appreciated nearly 89,450% since these wallets first received their funds, reflecting Ethereum’s significant growth in value and adoption over the past decade. A Wave of Dormant Wallet Activity Across Crypto The activation of these Ethereum wallets is part of a broader trend of long-dormant wallets reawakening . Last Friday, three Bitcoin wallets inactive for 14 years moved billions in funds, and earlier this year, several Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallets transferred coins worth around $44 million, sparking renewed curiosity in the crypto community. These movements often trigger speculation regarding their owners and the reasons behind their sudden activity after years of silence. While some view these reactivations as signs of early adopters securing profits, others see them as potential indicators of shifting strategies among crypto whales as markets mature. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and New Proposals Meanwhile, Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve with recent technological upgrades and governance proposals. On May 7, blockchain developers launched the Pectra upgrade , which introduced smart accounts, improved scalability features, and higher staking limits. Following the upgrade, the price of ETH climbed from $1,812 to $2,540, according to CoinMarketCap. Vitalik Buterin, alongside researcher Toni Wahrstätter, proposed a gas cap for individual transactions at 16.77 million, aiming to improve the network efficiency and security. The proposal argues that this cap will enhance the network’s resilience against potential denial-of-service attacks and improve stability, while providing users with more predictable transaction costs.

2025-07-08T07:00:15,"Ethereum's next move could be a plunge or an explosive short squeeze","<p>What is the Commitment of Traders (COT) Report?</p><p>The COT report is a weekly snapshot released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It shows how different types of traders are positioned in futures markets—meaning whether they're betting prices will rise or fall.</p><p>Why does it matter?</p><p>Understanding trader positioning can help predict possible price moves. For example, if many traders expect prices to fall, it may signal caution.</p><p>How does it work, step-by-step?</p><ol><li><p>Traders open futures positions:
Imagine large traders think Ethereum's price will fall soon. They open ""short"" positions, betting prices will drop. Others, expecting prices to rise, open ""long"" positions.</p></li><li><p>Reporting by traders:
Every Tuesday, firms that manage futures positions report their holdings to the CFTC.</p></li><li><p>CFTC receives and verifies data:
On Wednesday, the CFTC gathers these reports and checks for accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Weekly release:
By Friday afternoon, the CFTC publishes this information in the weekly COT report.</p></li></ol><p>Trader categories explained simply:</p><ul><li><p>Leveraged Funds (Speculators): Traders looking for quick profits.
Example: A hedge fund betting ETH prices will fall by heavily shorting contracts.</p></li><li><p>Dealer Intermediaries (Market Makers): Banks and brokers providing liquidity, usually hedging risk.
Example: A bank buying futures contracts to offset risk from customer transactions.</p></li><li><p>Asset Managers/Institutions: Long-term investors who manage retirement funds or mutual funds.
Example: A pension fund holding long futures positions to invest for the long-term growth of Ethereum.</p></li><li><p>Other Reportables: Large traders who don’t fit neatly into other categories.</p></li><li><p>Nonreportable (Small traders): Smaller investors whose holdings are too small to be individually reported.</p></li></ul><p>Simple Example:</p><p>Let's say last week’s report showed leveraged funds holding 1,000 contracts betting ETH prices will go down (""short"") and only 100 contracts betting they'll rise (""long""). This means speculative traders expect ETH's price to fall soon.</p><p>Why it might help your trading:</p><ul><li><p>If most traders are very bearish (expect prices to fall), it might indicate prices could continue dropping.</p></li><li><p>Conversely, extreme bearishness might also mean that if prices start rising unexpectedly, these bearish traders must quickly buy to close their losing positions, rapidly driving prices higher (a “short squeeze”).</p></li></ul><p>This report helps you understand the ""big picture,"" allowing you to make informed trading decisions based on what major players in the market are doing.</p><p>ETH related positions from the COT Report</p><p>As of July 1, 2025, leveraged funds hold a substantial short position on Ethereum futures: they have 12,574 short contracts (51.7% of total open interest) compared to only 1,275 long contracts (5.2%). This clearly shows their expectation that Ethereum's price will decline. In contrast, Dealer Intermediaries are primarily long (66.5%), likely reflecting their role in hedging or providing liquidity. Asset Managers and Institutions also lean toward the bullish side, with 12.4% of total open interest long compared to just 2.2% short.</p><p>Putting it Together - The Guestimate:</p><p>Given the current setup, here's my guestimate for Ethereum's next move:</p><ul><li><p>Immediate Term (next few days to a week or two): Increased Downward Pressure and Volatility. The substantial short position from leveraged funds is likely to exert strong downward pressure on Ethereum's price in the very short term. We could see a move lower as these funds try to capitalize on their short bets. This might manifest as quick dips or a sustained downtrend, potentially testing significant support levels.</p></li><li><p>Medium Term (next few weeks to a month): Potential for Reversal or Consolidation Around Support. If the price does decline, the bullish leanings of Asset Managers and Institutions could act as a floor. They might start accumulating at lower prices, which could lead to a bounce or a period of consolidation. The market will be watching to see if new long positions emerge from non-leveraged players to counter the speculative shorts.</p></li><li><p>Key Indicator to Watch: How far leveraged funds are willing to press their shorts. If they continue to add significantly, the downtrend could be more severe. Conversely, if they start covering their shorts (buying back contracts to close their positions), it could signal a reversal and lead to a sharp upward move (a ""short squeeze"").</p></li></ul><p>For individual crypto traders, closely monitoring Ethereum price movements and weekly changes in leveraged fund positioning is crucial, along with price action at potential supports! Extreme bearish sentiment could either suggest the need for caution or signal an opportunity if market sentiment shifts quickly and unexpectedly.</p><p>Trade ETH and crypto at your own risk only.
