In a new CNBC interview, Tuorto says the small-cap stocks possess more upside potential amid attractive valuations and the possibility of various catalysts spurring more appreciation. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting to see some signs of life in the small cap market. As you mentioned, it‚Äôs been a good month to date for small versus large. We think that‚Äôs a reflection of a number of things. There are some catalysts in the stocks, but they‚Äôre extraordinarily cheap, and the underlying economic environment is quite good. And I think, as we set our sights on the Fed cutting rates in the back half of the year, you have a couple of tailwinds.‚Äù With consumer activity serving as the leading driver for the uptrend in the stock market, the Goldman Sachs executive names a few sectors that are also likely to get a boost. ‚ÄúI think you have to start to see a hand-off to some other sectors. We‚Äôre pretty encouraged about tech, software, semiconductors would be an area that, I think, could take a nice hand-off. But also aerospace and defense have done quite well. And we expect to see some more [Initial Public Offering] IPO activity in that space, because space is quite active.

The lawsuit marks Mawson‚Äôs second major legal dispute in 2025, both linked to operational asset control. Canaan‚Äôs ongoing expansion at Mawson‚Äôs site continues despite parallel litigation. Bitcoin miner Mawson Infrastructure has fired its CEO and President, Rahul Mewawalla, for cause, accusing him of breaching fiduciary duties and engaging in fraud. According to TheMinerMag , the board placed Mewawalla on administrative leave shortly after notifying him of potential termination on May 30. By July 8, his removal became official. Bitcoin Miner Mawson Sues Ex-CEO Mawson has also filed a lawsuit in Delaware‚Äôs Court of Chancery seeking damages and the return of compensation awarded earlier this year. In February, the board approved a $2.5 million cash bonus, 1.2 million restricted stock units, and a salary increase to $1.2 million for Mewawalla. The company cited ‚Äúhigh-performing‚Äù leadership in that announcement. In a July 17 letter to Mawson‚Äôs board, Mewawalla disputed the accusations, stating he ‚Äúrespectfully and vigorously‚Äù disagreed with the company‚Äôs account. He referred to the board‚Äôs own prior filings, which credited him with 36% revenue growth and improved gross margins during his tenure. The company named General Counsel Kaliste Saloom as interim CEO. Mewawalla‚Äôs board seat has also been revoked. The lawsuit filed against Mewawalla has not yet been made public, and the company has not released further details about the specific misconduct alleged. Mewawalla has not publicly responded beyond his letter to the board.

In March, NYDIG‚Äôs parent company, Stone Ridge, and its mining subsidiary, Consensus Colocation, sued Mawson for allegedly taking control of 20,000 ASIC miners worth $30 million hosted at a facility in Midland, Pennsylvania. Mawson has since signed a new agreement with Canaan to host over 17,000 new units at the same Midland site. The three-year deal includes approximately 64 megawatts of capacity and supports Canaan‚Äôs 4.7 EH/s hashrate expansion in North America. The leadership change comes as the mining firm seeks to stabilize operations and attract partners in a competitive colocation market. Pending legal outcomes may influence future contractual relationships and financing terms. The incident reveals ongoing governance challenges in the crypto mining sector, where executive pay and accountability remain under heightened scrutiny. Boards may face increased pressure to justify incentive structures and enforce oversight mechanisms in such a volatile environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What role does fiduciary duty play in crypto-native firms with hybrid operational models? In companies operating both infrastructure and financial services, fiduciary obligations may cover both traditional shareholders and tokenholders, adding complexity to governance enforcement and dispute resolution. How might this affect Mawson‚Äôs ability to secure future equipment or hosting partnerships? Ongoing legal disputes and leadership changes can raise counterparty risk concerns. Equipment manufacturers and hosting partners may renegotiate terms or delay new agreements pending resolution. Could regulatory agencies get involved? While the current proceedings are civil, if fraud is substantiated, state or federal regulators may initiate separate enforcement action depending on the facts.

Here are the details.","Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, has announced the launch of perpetual futures products for US users. The move comes amid growing clarity regarding crypto regulations in the country. Coinbase Launches CFTC-Regulated Perpetual Futures Trading for US Investors Coinbase announced on Monday that two futures contracts, nano Bitcoin Perpetual Futures (BTI) and nano Ethereum Perpetual Futures (ETI), have begun trading. The company stated: For years, US crypto investors have been content to look at this popular product, which benefits international users, from afar. These transactions were inaccessible in the US due to complex regulatory frameworks. That's now changing. The new perpetual products offer leverage up to 10x and, unlike traditional futures, can be extended to five-year maturities. Coinbase stated that this flexibility will allow users to implement long-term strategies. Trading fees start at 0.02% per contract. This launch comes at a time of critical developments regarding crypto regulations in the US. The recently passed GENIUS Act provides a clear legal framework for stablecoins, while the Clarity Act aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for the overall crypto market by clarifying the mandates of regulatory bodies like the SEC and CFTC. These developments have led to significant price increases in many major crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase shares also reached an all-time high of $437 last Friday, surpassing a market capitalization of $100 billion.

2025-07-22T16:40:19,"Bitcoin Whale Transfer: Unveiling the Mysterious $496 Million Kraken Move","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Transfer: Unveiling the Mysterious $496 Million Kraken Move The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to monumental shifts, but every so often, a transaction occurs that sends ripples across the entire digital ocean. Recently, the crypto community was abuzz with news of a significant Bitcoin whale transfer , specifically, 4,166 BTC moving from the popular exchange Kraken to an undisclosed wallet. This single transaction, valued at approximately $496 million at the time, wasn‚Äôt just a number; it was a powerful signal, sparking intense speculation and prompting a closer look at the mysterious movements of the crypto market‚Äôs biggest players. What Exactly Happened: Unpacking the Mammoth Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The alert came from Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain tracker that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the movement of 4,166 Bitcoins, a sum that instantly grabs attention due to its sheer size. The source was identified as Kraken, one of the oldest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, and the destination was simply labeled an ‚Äúunknown wallet.‚Äù This anonymity is typical in the decentralized world of crypto but adds a layer of intrigue to such a substantial movement. For context, nearly half a billion dollars changing hands in a single transaction is a rare occurrence in any financial market, let alone one as volatile and nascent as cryptocurrency. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer wasn‚Äôt just large; it was a statement, a ripple that could potentially foreshadow larger market trends or strategic plays by influential entities. Who Are These Crypto Whales, and Why Do Their Moves Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, ‚Äúwhales‚Äù are individuals or entities holding enormous amounts of a particular digital asset, significant enough to influence market prices. Think of them as the institutional investors or major players in traditional finance. Their actions, whether buying, selling, or simply moving large sums, can create significant waves. When a Bitcoin whale transfer of this magnitude occurs, it‚Äôs akin to a major institutional investor in traditional stocks making a massive block trade. It raises questions: Are they preparing to sell, potentially driving prices down? Are they moving funds to cold storage for long-term holding, indicating confidence? Is it an internal transfer, perhaps for security reasons or rebalancing portfolios? Understanding the motivations behind these transfers is key to deciphering their potential impact. While not every large transfer signals an imminent market shift, the collective behavior of whales often provides insights into market sentiment and potential future directions. Why Do Whales Move Such Enormous Sums? Exploring the Motivations Behind a Bitcoin Whale Transfer The mystery of an ‚Äúunknown wallet‚Äù often fuels speculation, but there are several common reasons why a whale might execute such a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer : Reason for Transfer Explanation & Potential Impact Cold Storage & Security Many whales move funds from exchanges to secure hardware wallets (cold storage) to mitigate risks of exchange hacks or regulatory changes. This is often a sign of long-term holding and a bullish sentiment, as it takes coins off the active trading market. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals Large transactions are often executed via OTC desks to avoid impacting exchange order books and causing price volatility. The BTC might be moving to an escrow or directly to a buyer‚Äôs wallet as part of a private sale. This is generally neutral to bullish as it signifies demand. Exchange Rebalancing Exchanges themselves often move funds between their hot and cold wallets, or between different internal addresses, for operational efficiency, security, or to manage liquidity. Such transfers are internal and usually have no market impact. Preparation for Sale/Distribution While less common for transfers off an exchange to an unknown wallet (usually they move to an exchange for selling), a whale might move funds to a different wallet to prepare for a distribution to multiple addresses or to an institution. This could signal an impending sale, but not always directly. Market Manipulation In some cases, large transfers can be part of a broader strategy to influence market sentiment, though this is harder to prove. Moving funds might be a tactic to create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Without specific information about the wallet‚Äôs owner or purpose, it‚Äôs challenging to pinpoint the exact reason for this particular Bitcoin whale transfer . However, understanding these common scenarios helps put the transaction into perspective. What‚Äôs the Ripple Effect? Analyzing the Market Impact of a Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer A transaction of this size inevitably raises questions about its potential impact on the broader crypto market. While a single Bitcoin whale transfer doesn‚Äôt always dictate market direction, it can certainly influence sentiment and volatility, especially when coupled with other market factors. Potential Market Dynamics: Increased Volatility: The sheer volume of BTC moved can create a perception of impending market action, leading to increased trading activity and price fluctuations as traders react to the news. Investor Sentiment Shift: If the market perceives the transfer as a precursor to a large sell-off, it can trigger fear and potentially lead to price drops. Conversely, if it‚Äôs seen as a move to cold storage, it might instill confidence. Liquidity Implications: If the BTC is moved off an exchange, it effectively reduces the immediate supply available for trading on that platform, which could theoretically impact liquidity. Media and Social Media Buzz: Large whale movements often become hot topics on crypto news outlets and social media, amplifying their perceived significance and potentially leading to self-fulfilling prophecies in market movements. It‚Äôs crucial for investors to remember that correlation does not equal causation. A large transfer might coincide with a price movement, but it might not be the direct cause. Many factors contribute to crypto price action, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall market sentiment. Can We Track These Whales? The Role of On-Chain Analytics and Kraken‚Äôs Position One of the beauties of blockchain technology is its transparency. While the identity behind an ‚Äúunknown wallet‚Äù remains private, the transactions themselves are publicly recorded on the blockchain. This allows services like Whale Alert and other on-chain analytics platforms to track large movements, providing valuable data for market analysis. On-Chain Analytics: These tools provide insights into wallet balances, transaction volumes, and flow of funds between different entities (exchanges, smart contracts, individual wallets). By analyzing these patterns, researchers can often infer the likely purpose of a Bitcoin whale transfer , even if the owner remains anonymous. For instance, if funds move from an exchange to a wallet that has been dormant for years, it strongly suggests cold storage. If they move to another exchange, it might signal an intent to trade. Kraken‚Äôs Role: As one of the oldest and most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken plays a significant role in the crypto ecosystem. While the transfer originated from Kraken, it does not imply any wrongdoing on the exchange‚Äôs part. Exchanges facilitate transactions for their users. They maintain robust security measures and adhere to regulatory compliance, but they cannot control what users do with their assets once they withdraw them to external wallets. This specific Bitcoin whale transfer highlights the decentralized nature of crypto, where users ultimately control their assets once off an exchange, and the destination can be truly ‚Äúunknown‚Äù in terms of ownership. Beyond the Headlines: Security Implications and Actionable Insights for Investors While a massive Bitcoin whale transfer like this is intriguing, it also subtly reminds us of broader themes in cryptocurrency: security and prudent investing. Security First: Exchange Security: Reputable exchanges like Kraken employ advanced security protocols. However, no system is entirely immune to threats. This reinforces the importance of using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and being wary of phishing attempts. Self-Custody: The transfer to an ‚Äúunknown wallet‚Äù often means the owner has taken self-custody of their assets. This offers greater control and reduces counterparty risk but places the full responsibility of security (seed phrases, hardware wallet protection) on the individual. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, a large Bitcoin whale transfer should not be a cause for panic, but rather an opportunity for informed reflection: Don‚Äôt React Impulsively: Avoid making hasty trading decisions based solely on a single whale alert. Large transfers are complex and often have multiple interpretations. Conduct Your Own Research (DYOR): Dig deeper. Look at broader market trends, technical analysis, and fundamental news. Don‚Äôt rely solely on sensational headlines. Understand Context: Consider the potential reasons for the transfer (cold storage, OTC, internal rebalancing) before drawing conclusions about its market impact. Manage Risk: Always invest only what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and have a clear investment strategy, rather not being swayed by every large transaction. Utilize On-Chain Data (Wisely): While on-chain analytics can be powerful, they require expertise to interpret correctly. Use them as one tool among many, not as a sole predictor of market movements. A Concluding Thought: The Enduring Mystery of the Bitcoin Whale Transfer The recent Bitcoin whale transfer from Kraken, valued at nearly half a billion dollars, serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often enigmatic nature of the cryptocurrency markets. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs price may not be directly traceable to this single event, it underscores the significant influence that large holders, or ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù can exert. It also highlights the inherent transparency of blockchain technology, which allows for such movements to be publicly tracked, even if the identities behind them remain veiled. Ultimately, such events are not just news; they are educational moments. They teach us about market mechanics, the importance of security, and the necessity of a calm, research-driven approach to investing in the volatile world of digital assets. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these colossal movements, while understanding their various implications, will remain a key part of navigating this exciting frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding large Bitcoin transfers and their implications: Q1: What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to influence market prices with their transactions. There‚Äôs no official threshold, but it generally refers to holdings of hundreds or thousands of BTC. Q2: Does every large Bitcoin transfer cause a price crash? No, not every large Bitcoin whale transfer leads to a price crash. Many transfers are for legitimate reasons like moving funds to cold storage for security, executing over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or internal exchange rebalancing. The market reaction depends on the perceived intent behind the transfer. Q3: How can I track Bitcoin whale movements? You can track large Bitcoin movements using blockchain explorers and dedicated on-chain analytics platforms like Whale Alert, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These tools provide real-time data on significant transactions and wallet activities. Q4: Why are some wallets labeled ‚Äúunknown‚Äù? Wallets are labeled ‚Äúunknown‚Äù because the blockchain itself only records addresses, not the real-world identities of their owners. While some addresses can be linked to exchanges or known entities over time, many remain anonymous, especially if they are personal wallets. Q5: Should I be worried if a large amount of Bitcoin leaves an exchange? Not necessarily. While a large outflow from an exchange could signal an intent to sell via OTC or a private deal, it‚Äôs also very common for investors to move their assets off exchanges to personal cold storage for enhanced security. This often indicates a long-term holding strategy, which can be bullish for the asset. Share Your Insights!

The move comes after last week‚Äôs ‚Äúaltcoin season,‚Äù where ATOM and other mid-cap tokens outperformed BTC in a broad rally. ATOM fell from $5.26 to $4.98 between July 21 at 11:00 and July 22 at 10:00 UTC, facing heavy resistance at $5.32 during the 15:00 trading hour. Trading volumes spiked to 1.79 million units by 16:00 as sellers overwhelmed buy orders, leading to a clear technical breakdown. The token briefly stabilized near $4.97 overnight, where renewed buying interest pushed ATOM into a narrow $4.95‚Äì$5.05 consolidation range. A modest bounce saw prices recover 0.4% from $4.97 to $4.99 in the hour ending 10:06 UTC, though traders remain cautious about follow-through momentum. This week‚Äôs price action underscores a shift in market focus back to Bitcoin, which is clawing back gains after altcoins dominated headlines last week. Key Technical Indicators Price Action: ATOM fell 5% from $5.26 to $4.98 in 23 hours. Resistance Zone: Heavy selling at $5.25‚Äì$5.32 capped upside moves. Support Zone: Stabilized briefly at $4.93‚Äì$4.97 before small rebound. Volume Spikes: 1.79M units traded during 16:00 selloff; 1.55M units on support test at $4.97. Consolidation Range: Prices hovering in a tight $4.95‚Äì$5.05 band. Recovery Signs: Higher low formation from $4.93 to $4.98 suggests possible accumulation.

2025-07-22T16:26:19,"JPMorgan Eyes Crypto-Backed Loans Amid Shifting Regulatory Winds","JPMorgan Chase is preparing to introduce crypto-backed loans in 2025, allowing clients to use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral, a move that signals the bank‚Äôs cautious but strategic expansion into digital assets. JPMorgan Prepares Entry into Crypto Lending Banking giant JPMorgan Chase is reportedly considering launching a crypto-backed lending service as early as 2025, allowing clients to leverage their holdings of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The move reflects the bank‚Äôs growing interest in the evolving digital asset landscape, aligning it with other major U.S. financial institutions that are actively expanding their crypto services. The initiative would allow clients to secure loans without liquidating their cryptocurrency assets, offering a capital-efficient solution particularly attractive to institutional investors. This approach comes amid rising demand for liquidity strategies that preserve digital asset exposure. Regulatory Shifts Fuel Bank Strategy The bank‚Äôs decision appears closely tied to a more receptive regulatory environment in Washington. As lawmakers explore frameworks to govern stablecoins and other digital assets, large institutions like JPMorgan are cautiously positioning themselves for a more integrated role in crypto finance. Rival firms such as Bank of America and Citibank are already advancing their own crypto initiatives, particularly in stablecoin development. JPMorgan‚Äôs foray into crypto collateral lending indicates a desire to stay competitive while navigating the complex regulatory terrain. Dimon‚Äôs Measured Approach to Digital Assets Despite this step forward, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon continues to express reservations about cryptocurrencies. While the bank is moving toward offering crypto-backed loans, Dimon has remained firm in his stance against providing custody services for digital assets. Emphasizing the bank‚Äôs limits regarding direct involvement in crypto infrastructure, Dimon recently said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to allow you to buy it, we‚Äôre not going to custody it.‚Äù Dimon has previously voiced concerns over Bitcoin‚Äôs association with leverage and illicit use, signaling that any future expansion would remain tightly controlled. A Strategic Entry, Not a Full Commitment JPMorgan‚Äôs planned lending service reflects a selective, risk-mitigated embrace of the crypto sector. By offering loans without custody, the bank is carefully testing demand while avoiding the legal and operational complexities associated with storing digital assets on behalf of clients. The strategy may set a precedent for other traditional institutions weighing crypto engagement. JPMorgan‚Äôs regulatory compliance track record and substantial asset base could help normalize crypto lending in conventional finance, especially for risk-conscious institutional investors. As clarity around regulation improves and demand for capital-efficient tools grows, crypto-backed lending may become a standard offering among large banks.

2025-07-22T16:18:55,"South Korea to accelerate crypto legislation after US GENIUS Act clears path","South Korea is fast-tracking cryptocurrency regulations in response to the recently passed GENIUS Act in the United States , signalling a renewed push to tighten oversight of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The country‚Äôs ruling party announced plans to speed up crypto-focused legislation, aiming to create a clearer legal framework for virtual assets, exchanges, and stablecoins. Officials say the move is necessary to stay competitive in the global digital finance space and to improve investor safety. The GENIUS Act, passed in the US earlier this month, is seen by South Korean policymakers as a turning point in global crypto regulation. In response, South Korea is advancing its own proposals, including new tax laws, clearer custody rules for crypto exchanges, and support for won-based stablecoins. This marks one of the country‚Äôs most ambitious efforts to date to adapt its financial laws to the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin Archive @BTC_Archive ¬∑ Follow JUST IN: South Korea‚Äôs ruling party to accelerate Bitcoin and crypto legislation following the Genius Act üá∞üá∑ 6:11 PM ¬∑ Jul 22, 2025 1.2K Reply Copy link Read 87 replies Focus areas include crypto taxes, exchange compliance, and stablecoin rules According to recent announcements from South Korea‚Äôs Democratic Party, the government is focusing on three core areas: tightening tax policies for digital asset transactions, clarifying how exchanges manage user funds, and setting up legal structures to prevent crypto-related fraud. These steps are designed to increase transparency while also building a safe environment for both retail and institutional investors. Regulators are reportedly working on policies to better define the responsibilities of crypto exchanges, particularly regarding the segregation of user and platform assets. The revised rules would also introduce licensing conditions and regular audits, aligning with international standards seen in jurisdictions such as Singapore and the US. The GENIUS Act, passed in the US Congress earlier this month, is being cited as a trigger for South Korea‚Äôs shift. Local lawmakers view it as a sign that other major economies are moving swiftly to regulate the digital asset space. They now see regulatory delays as a risk to both economic competitiveness and investor confidence. Korea Investment and Securities develops won-backed stablecoin Alongside regulatory updates, South Korea is also investing in homegrown blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Korea Investment and Securities, one of the country‚Äôs largest financial services firms, is currently developing a stablecoin backed by the Korean won. The digital currency is intended to facilitate real-time payments and financial transactions across consumer and business platforms. It will also offer more stable alternatives to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in day-to-day use. This effort mirrors similar moves in other economies, including Japan‚Äôs regulated yen-backed stablecoin initiatives and the European Union‚Äôs exploration of a digital euro. By supporting a won-linked stablecoin, South Korea aims to provide a compliant digital currency that is fully integrated into the national financial system. Crypto ownership climbs, especially among younger investors The push to update regulations comes amid a growing wave of public interest in crypto assets across South Korea. More than 25% of South Koreans aged 20 to 50 now hold some form of cryptocurrency, according to recent data. Among them, nearly 70% are planning to increase their holdings. Analysts believe this demographic shift is part of a larger global trend, where digital assets are being viewed not just as speculative tools, but as part of long-term investment and retirement strategies. The increased participation also underlines the urgency for effective legal frameworks that can address fraud prevention, asset protection, and fair taxation. By fast-tracking its own regulations, South Korea aims to position itself at the forefront of digital finance in the region, particularly as stablecoin projects and decentralised finance (DeFi) applications grow in prominence.

2025-07-22T16:18:19,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Clears Key Resistance ‚Äì $10 Next Target?","The Dogecoin price has fallen by 2% in the past 24 hours, with the meme token dropping to $0.2667 on a day of correction for major tokens. Despite its slip, DOGE remains up by 39% in the past week and by 70% in the last 30 days, after the market benefitted from the passage of the GENIUS Act and growth in ETF inflows . And what‚Äôs particularly bullish for Dogecoin is that it has very recently cleared a key resistance level on its one-week chart, indicating that it has now entered a growth phase. Given its ongoing popularity as a meme token, and given the overall trajectory of the market right now, this points to a strong Dogecoin price prediction for the rest of the year, and beyond. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Clears Key Resistance ‚Äì $10 Next Target? Looking at DOGE‚Äôs one-week chart, we see that its indicators are beginning to recover from oversold positions. Its relative strength index (yellow) has recently risen over 50, and looks like it could be on its way to 70 or higher, bringing the Dogecoin price with it. Source: TradingView Perhaps even more encouragingly, Dogecoin‚Äôs MACD (orange, blue) is close to turning positive again, after spending several months in a negative position. And as noted above, the Dogecoin price has cleared the descending channel its tops and bottoms had formed since December. This is a strong indication of a breakout, although some perspective is in order, since we have seem similar patterns in the past, without a new top emerging. For instance, its big rally in 2021 saw a peak in the MACD just before July, but subsequent bounces (after July) failed to restore the coin to the ATH it achieved in May. It‚Äôs therefore arguable that something similar could happen this time around, and that despite clearing a resistance level, the Dogecoin price may not return to the $0.466 level it posted in early December. Like if you believe #Dogecoin can hit $1 before August 2025! $DOGE $1 pic.twitter.com/FvrvtNVBUq ‚Äî ElonMusk / Parody (@elonmuskTODAYY) July 20, 2025 Despite this possibility, the Dogecoin community is remaining hopeful that the meme token will rise to new highs as a result of this apparent breakout, with some setting a target of $1 before Q4. This is ambitious, but given that DOGE retains the support of entrepreneur Elon Musk, there‚Äôs always a chance that it could benefit from a big pump sooner or later. Based on this possibility, and based on the assumption that the market will finish 2025 strongly, a more realistic prediction may be $0.4 by Q4, and $0.6 by 2026. Up to 1000x Leveraged Meme Coin Trading with CoinFutures: Best New Trading Platform There are multiple options for investors who want to buy or sell Dogecoin, but one of the newest and more interesting is CoinFutures, a leveraged trading platform . A part of the hugely popular CoinPoker platform and app, CoinFutures invites traders to predict the price action of several leading tokens, including Dogecoin (and BTC, ETH, LTC and TRX). After depositing funds (via fiat or crypto), users are able to choose whether they think a given crypto will go up or down. They can then choose how much to wager on this prediction, while also selecting how much leverage to use, so as to multiply their potential winnings (as well as their potential losses). It‚Äôs as simple as that, with users then able to watch as their selected crypto either rises or falls. They can cash out at any time, while they can also set stop loss orders in order to limit liabilities.

2025-07-22T16:16:48,"Coinbase Rolls Out Perpetual Futures for U.S. Traders Amid Regulatory Breakthrough","Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, has introduced a new product called perpetual futures for American traders. This move marks a significant milestone for the U.S. cryptocurrency market. For years, it has lagged behind global markets in offering advanced trading tools because of regulatory restrictions. With more explicit rules now emerging in the country, the soon-to-be-trillion-dollar company is opening the door to new possibilities. Coinbase Perpetual Futures Now Available in the U.S. For the first time, the U.S.-based crypto traders can now access perpetual futures contracts through Coinbase. On July 21, the exchange rolled out two new products: nano Bitcoin Perpetual Futures and nano Ethereum Perpetual Futures. These contracts are designed to enable traders to place long-term bets on cryptocurrency prices without the fixed end dates typically associated with traditional futures. Furthermore, the new contracts include several key features. Coinbase is now allowing users to trade these contracts with up to 10x leverage. This means traders can increase their exposure without having to put down the full value of the contract. Unlike traditional futures that expire monthly or quarterly, these products are set to expire in five years. This is poised to give users more time to hold their positions. Additionally, trading fees start as low as 0.02% per contract, making it an accessible option for both experienced and novice traders. Coinbase states that its goal is to help traders develop more flexible and long-term strategies. The contracts are ‚Äúnano‚Äù in size, meaning they allow smaller position sizes, which can be less risky and more manageable for individual users. Backed by Regulatory Progress The timing of this launch aligns with significant developments in U.S. crypto regulation. Two newly passed legislative measures have brought clarity and optimism to the market. Recently, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law , which creates clear rules for stablecoins. Also, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Clarity Act. This proposed bill aims to define the regulation of digital assets in the U.S. It outlines the roles of both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These laws aim to reduce uncertainty and make it easier for platforms like Coinbase to introduce new products while staying compliant with federal law. Market Reaction and Coinbase Stock Surge The news has had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. Following the announcement and recent legislation, the prices of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and several other major cryptocurrencies experienced sharp increases. This indicates that investor confidence is on the rise again. Coinbase also saw a strong response in the stock market. The company‚Äôs shares reached a new all-time high above $437 last Friday, shortly after hitting a $100 billion market capitalization earlier in the week. On Monday, Coinbase shares dipped slightly, falling 1.47% to $413.63, according to Google Finance.

This dip represents the most significant drop since June 2022 and suggests a growing investor interest in altcoins. Source: CoinMarketCap Chart The Altcoin Season Index, which tracks the performance of major altcoins against Bitcoin, suggests a strengthening sentiment towards altcoins, having reached a score between 53 and 60. Source: Coinglass Altcoins Leading the Charge Several altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin recently, with Ethereum seeing a 27% increase in July due to strong demand on DeFi platforms. Similarly, Solana and Dogecoin have experienced more than 7% growth, driven by active developer engagement and popularity in meme tokens. XRP has also hit new highs following positive regulatory news. The Role of Strategic Marketing in Crypto Shifts As market dynamics evolve, crypto-focused firms like Outset PR are capitalizing on these changes by enhancing visibility and strategic positioning through data-driven PR campaigns. Outset PR‚Äôs approach includes building campaigns based on market signals, ensuring that their clients can effectively navigate and leverage the shift towards altcoins. Past campaigns managed by Outset PR have demonstrated impressive results, such as the 138% rally for Step App‚Äôs FITFI token and a 40% increase in user base for ChangeNOW. These successes highlight the efficacy of their tailored and analytics-driven strategy. Market Outlook and Strategic Implications While Bitcoin's dominance is shrinking, the altcoin market is displaying strong signs of an upcoming surge, potentially marking the onset of an altcoin season. Should the Altcoin Season Index pass 75, it could confirm a major market transition, providing new opportunities for investors and projects.

2025-07-22T16:11:08,"Bitcoin Promoter Strategy (STR) Market Cap Is Being Miscalculated, According to TD Cowen Analysts! Here's Why","TD Cowen countered criticism that Strategy‚Äôs (STR) market capitalization should be indexed solely to Bitcoin assets, stating that this approach is logically flawed. TD Cowen: Strategy's Premium Value Justified by Bitcoin Capital Cycle Analysts argue that the company's aggressive share issuance increases investors' stake in the stock rather than diluting it. Strategy's market capitalization currently stands at $124.3 billion, with a total Bitcoin holding of approximately $72 billion. This puts the company's trading premium over its net asset value (NAV) at 72.6%. TD Cowen analysts Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete say this premium cannot be explained by the ‚Äúbig fool theory.‚Äù ‚ÄúCritics argue that Strategy's valuation is based solely on another investor in the market buying at a higher price. But this is an incomplete perspective that ignores both its business model and its capital deployment strategy,‚Äù they said. According to TD Cowen, the Strategy increases the amount of Bitcoin per share by channeling low-cost capital into Bitcoin. This strategy provides an advantage that neither individual investors nor competing institutional firms can easily replicate. It emphasizes that the company is able to raise capital through low-interest borrowing at 0.421%, which directly translates into Bitcoin returns. 900,000 BTC Target in 2027 Last week, Strategy raised $739.8 million through the sale of 1.6 million new shares and three preferred stock issuances as part of its $21 billion at-the-market program. With this capital, it purchased 6,220 Bitcoins at an average price of $118,940. According to TD Cowen, this transaction increased the company's BTC per share by 20.8% compared to January 1st. While maintaining its $680 target price for Strategy shares, TD Cowen predicts the company could reach 900,000 BTC by the end of 2027. This amount equates to 4.3% of the all-time Bitcoin supply. The company also opened a new funding stream on Monday with the launch of a fourth series of perpetual preferred stock called Stretch (STRC). With reserves of 607,770 BTC as of July 21, Strategy is currently the world's largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder. *This is not investment advice.

SOL traded at $195.50 per coin, pushing the total valuation to over $105 billion for the first time since January‚ÄØ25. Related Reading: Too Pricey? Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now That jump reflects growing optimism around the token. Short‚Äëterm gains have been strong, but questions remain about how deep the recovery really runs. DeFi TVL Rises With Price Based on reports, Solana‚Äôs total value locked in DeFi hit $14.18 billion. That‚Äôs the highest level in six months, back to where it stood in January when SOL first reached its all‚Äëtime high. A big chunk of that gain comes from the token‚Äôs own price climbing. When SOL moves up, every coin locked in lending pools and vaults gets worth more on paper. Users haven‚Äôt needed to rush in and lock fresh tokens to boost TVL numbers. The overall ecosystem feels larger. Yet true usage growth may be slower than those headline figures suggest. Experts are keeping a close eye on how many new deposits actually show up. After all, token value and real‚Äëworld demand don‚Äôt always rise at the same pace. DEX Trading Activity Shows Uptick Between July‚ÄØ14 and July‚ÄØ20, Solana‚Äôs decentralized exchanges handled over $22 billion in trading volume. That‚Äôs up from close to $19 billion the week before. Raydium led with $8.4 billion, followed by Orca at almost $6 billion and Meteora at $5.3 billion. Based on data, traders are coming back. But weekly volumes still sit far below the $98 billion peak set in mid‚ÄëJanuary. That gap signals a market that‚Äôs warming up but not yet boiling over. Volume gains show renewed interest among active users. It also hints that fresh strategies and new tokens may be finding feet after a slower spell. Staking Dominates Network Security According to on‚Äëchain figures, about 355‚ÄØmillion SOL remain staked with validators. That stake is worth roughly $69 billion, or about 65% of all tokens in circulation. Those coins aren‚Äôt counted in DeFi TVL or in DEX volumes.

The unnamed whale, posting under the alias ‚ÄúGeneric‚ÄØRational,‚Äù claims the project‚Äôs founding engineering company ‚Äúhas not delivered much for years‚Äù and is ‚Äúrequesting obscene amounts of funds to keep the same show of non‚Äëdelivery going.‚Äù Hoskinson Fires Back: ‚ÄòCardano Has Delivered‚Äô Hoskinson called the charge ‚Äúego‚Äëdriven‚Äù and ‚Äúfact‚Äëfree,‚Äù rattling off a catalogue of milestones he says the community now takes for granted: ‚ÄúVoltaire got delivered a year ago; we have Genesis Keys today; we have a constitution; we have a full on‚Äëchain government.‚Äù He cited the maturation of Hydra , the launch of Leios, and Midnight ‚Äôs capacity‚Äëtesting 37‚Äëmillion‚Äëwallet airdrop as evidence that ‚Äúevery single IOG employee delivers something every single day.‚Äù At the centre of the feud is the whale‚Äôs assertion that liquidating $100‚ÄØmillion in ADA to seed a Cardano sovereign‚Äëwealth fund would crater the token‚Äôs market price. Hoskinson countered that daily spot and derivatives turnover has exceeded$2.5‚ÄØbillion and that over‚Äëthe‚Äëcounter desks regularly place ten‚Äëto‚Äëtwenty‚Äëfive‚Äëmillion‚Äëdollar blocks ‚Äúwithout moving the market one bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is factually true,‚Äù he insisted, ‚Äúthat if you divest a hundred million dollars worth of ADA the right way you can do it both quickly and not disrupt the market.‚Äù The confrontation lands just two weeks before Rare‚ÄØEvo, the annual developer‚Äëand‚Äëgovernance summit scheduled for 6‚Äì10‚ÄØAugust in Las‚ÄØVegas where attendees will debate the first long‚Äëterm budget under Cardano‚Äôs new constitutional era and elect a permanent Constitutional Committee. Hoskinson, whose firm currently holds an interim seat, reminded viewers that IOG will relinquish all formal governance authority once the community‚Äëelected committee is seated later this year. ‚ÄúDecentralisation doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no leadership,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt means you can pick them, you can fire them, and you can change direction as a network.‚Äù He urged ADA holders to express disapproval of ‚Äúego and emotion‚Äù by redirecting stake away from disruptive representatives. ‚ÄúGovernance requires consent of the governed,‚Äù he noted, echoing political theory while warning that broad‚Äëbrush obstruction threatens to turn Cardano governance into ‚Äúa Jerry Springer episode.‚Äù Beyond the immediate skirmish, Hoskinson argued that the ecosystem must settle on a forward‚Äëlooking narrative and clear performance metrics. Relying solely on total value locked or transaction counts, he said, leaves Cardano vulnerable to external perceptions that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not looking so good.‚Äù He floated Bitcoin‚Äënative DeFi and zero‚Äëknowledge privacy sidechain Midnight as contenders for a defining theme over the next five years, but stressed that whichever story emerges, it must come with measurable key performance indicators and disciplined funding. ADA changed hands at roughly $0.89 on 22‚ÄØJuly, up nearly 50% since mid‚ÄëJune lows. Whether that momentum survives an intensifying governance quarrel may depend less on Twitter skirmishes than on the deliberations that begin in Las‚ÄØVegas next month‚Äîand on the willingness of delegators to reward, or punish, the behaviour of their chosen representatives. Hoskinson closed with a familiar rallying cry: ‚ÄúWe are now the most decentralised cryptocurrency on the planet.

With Wall Street heavyweights doubling down on forecasts, Bitcoin could rally to an unprecedented $150,000 in 2025. Yet, behind the scenes, a quiet coin is catching analysts‚Äô attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The price of Mutuum Finance is $0.03 during the 5th phase of presale, which is more than 85% sold out. Phase 5 investors will get a 100% return on investment once the token is listed. A total amount of more than $12.8 million has been raised, and there are over 13,800 early stage investors. The token price shall increase in presale Phase 6 to $0.035, and this represents 16.67% returns on investment carried out at Phase 5. As major funds diversify their portfolios and hedge against traditional market volatility, the spotlight is shifting towards Mutuum Finance. Institutional Capital Drives Bitcoin Momentum Ahead of $150K Run Bitcoin is currently trading around $118,257, supported by a surge in institutional investment, spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen record inflows and corporate treasuries from firms like MicroStrategy and GameStop are adding BTC to their balance sheets. Legal clarity from U.S. bills such as the Genius and Clarity Acts, coupled with supportive executive actions like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, are creating a more predictable regulatory environment. Financial analysts and firms like Deutsche Bank and Bitwise suggest these institutional flows, alongside potential Fed dovishness, could propel Bitcoin toward $150,000 or higher by the end of 2025. That said, broader adoption remains in progress, with institutional holdings still forming a small fraction of total ETF assets. Meanwhile, smaller altcoins like MUTM are gaining attention on the sidelines. Strong Investor Demand Drives Mutuum Presale Past $12.8M Mutuum Finance presale has attracted more than 13800 investors and is more than $12.8 million in funds. Investors have bought over 85% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence by the investors in the project‚Äôs near-term success as well as its better future. Mutuum Finance Launches Major Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway , distributed among 10 winners of $10,000 MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded based on its new leaderboard system. The bonus tokens will be given to the users when they level up. Mutuum Finance: A New Approach to DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is innovating DeFi lending with the creation of a platform that renders customers the holder of their own assets. It is a functional double-lending multifunctional platform, combining the synergy of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, smart contracts are used to access lending pools. The platform responds to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes lenders‚Äô returns less volatile and the borrower financially stable. With the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is very convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs presale phase 5 is already 85% sold out, with over $12.8 million raised and 13,800 early investors locking in at $0.03. With a guaranteed 16.67% jump in phase 6 and a projected 2x return on listing, Mutuum is emerging as the stealth contender to outperform even Bitcoin‚Äôs forecasted $150,000 surge. Backed by a $50,000 CertiK security bounty and a $100,000 community giveaway, this DeFi token is quickly becoming a favorite among forward-looking investors. Secure your tokens now before phase 5 closes.
