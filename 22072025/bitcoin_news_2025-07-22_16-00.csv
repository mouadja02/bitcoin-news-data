After the United States passed the new GENIUS Act , the law aims to make clearer and safer rules for digital currencies. South Korea‚Äôs ruling party doesn‚Äôt want to be left behind. They have just announced plans to fast-track fresh laws covering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Why Speeding Up Crypto Laws Matters In a recent tweet post, Bitcoin Archive noted that South Korea‚Äôs ruling party plans to speed up crypto laws after the GENIUS Act in the U.S. The ruling Democratic Party believes faster legislation can protect users better while encouraging new business opportunities. A senior lawmaker said delays aren‚Äôt an option. They want clear rules on how exchanges handle money and stablecoins, and how to stop fraud. Officials say the GENIUS Act proves big economies now take crypto seriously, and South Korea wants to lead, not fall behind.

Won-Based Stablecoin in the Works Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, South Korea is working on something closer to home, its stablecoin tied to the Korean won . Korea Investment and Securities is leading this push, hoping to launch a won-backed digital currency. The idea is to make everyday payments, money transfers, and even complex financial deals faster and more stable. This move shows how the country is stepping up in the digital finance revolution. Many experts say national stablecoins like this could soon reshape how people send money and pay bills. Growing Public Interest in Cryptocurrencies The popularity of cryptocurrencies in South Korea is growing fast. Currently, over 25% of South Koreans aged 20 to 50 own crypto assets, and about 70% of them plan to increase their investments. Many see digital currencies as an important part of their future savings and retirement plans, showing the increasing role crypto plays in everyday financial lives.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/south-koreas-ruling-party-pushes-to-speed-up-bitcoin-laws-after-u-s-genius-act/,"ASIA|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|ETH","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T13:45:53,"The Trump administration's crypto report is due today, but it may not arrive","The crypto industry awaits the White House Digital Asset report after Donald Trump sparked some policy blitz with the ‚ÄúCrypto Week.‚Äù Reports suggest that the report, which is officially due to be released on Tuesday, might be released to the public before the end of the month. The House of Representatives passed three major crypto bills, with one, the GENIUS Act , now headed directly to President Trump‚Äôs desk. The other two are bound for Senate review. This has left the digital assets market hanging in the middle of the bull run. US eyes Bitcoin reserve The US legislation wave positions the United States as the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world.‚Äù The Trump administration‚Äôs first official blueprint for crypto policy reportedly took months, led by the Working Group on Digital Assets, co-led by David Sacks and Bo Hines. While the final contents are still under wraps, reports suggest it will include sweeping proposals, from establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve , a national digital asset stockpile, with tough new national security controls on illicit finance and sanctions evasion. Update on this timeline: The report is officially due tomorrow, but a White House official tells me it will be released to the public before the end of the month. https://t.co/IPPawbVMeR ‚Äî Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 21, 2025 Industry insiders are also eyeing potential reforms around banking access for crypto firms, especially in dealings with the Federal Reserve. The working group‚Äôs original task was to deliver a federal stablecoin framework, but that got handled by Congress last week with the passage of the GENIUS Act. Meanwhile, Capitol Hill remains active, and the Senate Banking Committee is preparing to release its much-anticipated digital asset market structure draft after a delay last week. The report mentioned that Chairman Tim Scott confirmed a markup will likely follow the August recess. Over at Senate Agriculture, Brian Quintenz suddenly disappeared from the CFTC chair nominating vote roster. Critics eye Trump‚Äôs crypto ties All of this policy momentum has triggered a wave of bullish sentiment among investors. The crypto market recently breached the $4 trillion mark. Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $123,000 on July 14 before pulling back slightly, and while retail interest is returning, whales are still making big moves. Data shows that Google searches for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù are rising. According to 10x Research, large-scale holders, those controlling 10,000 BTC or more, snapped up nearly 47,000 Bitcoins just before the ATH. Many of those positions have since been trimmed, which has added to a modest pullback to the $118,000 zone of BTC. However, most of the institutional re-engagement began after Circle‚Äôs blockbuster IPO last month. As the Trump administration pushes harder into crypto, critics are sounding alarms. Some warn that the industry‚Äôs murky structure and lack of transparency could make it a ground for corruption or foreign influence. Token holdings within Trump-affiliated projects have prompted scrutiny. As of now, the GENIUS Act may offer some early consumer safeguards for stablecoins, yet there are many regulatory gaps.

2025-07-22T13:40:18,"Bitcoin Market: Navigating the Crucial Consolidation Phase Towards $115K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Market: Navigating the Crucial Consolidation Phase Towards $115K The cryptocurrency world has been on a rollercoaster ride, with Bitcoin leading the charge to exhilarating new all-time highs. Yet, as the dust settles, the Bitcoin market finds itself in a period of consolidation. This isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness, but rather a healthy recalibration after an intense rally. Understanding this phase is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the volatile yet promising landscape of digital assets. What exactly does this consolidation mean for Bitcoin‚Äôs future, and could a retest of the significant $115,000 level truly be on the horizon? Decoding the Bitcoin Market ‚Äòs Current State: The Glassnode Perspective To truly grasp the dynamics at play in the current Bitcoin market , we turn to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, renowned for its deep insights into blockchain data. Their latest findings paint a clear picture of shifting momentum following Bitcoin‚Äôs monumental surge. One of the key metrics highlighted by Glassnode is the Realized Profit to Loss Ratio (RPLR). This indicator measures the ratio of realized profits to realized losses on the network, offering a window into the profitability of coins spent by investors. Historically, an RPLR above 1 indicates that more profits are being taken than losses, a common occurrence during bull markets. The Shift from 3.9 to 2.6: Glassnode reported a significant drop in the RPLR from a peak of 3.9 to 2.6. What does this mean? A higher RPLR (like 3.9) suggests aggressive profit-taking, often seen near market tops as investors capitalize on gains. The subsequent decline to 2.6 indicates a cooling off in this intense profit-taking behavior. While still above 1 (meaning profits are still being realized), the reduced ratio signals that the frenetic pace of selling for profit has subsided. Signaling Cooling Profitability: This drop doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean losses are accumulating, but rather that the rate at which profits are being locked in has slowed. It suggests that fewer participants are selling their holdings at substantial gains, or that the gains themselves are becoming less extreme. This often precedes or accompanies a period of market consolidation. Investors Adjusting to Range-Bound Conditions: Glassnode explicitly stated that investors are now adjusting to ‚Äòrange-bound conditions.‚Äô This implies that the market is no longer in a strong directional trend (up or down) but is instead trading within a defined price range. In such an environment, the focus shifts from chasing parabolic gains to identifying support and resistance levels, and potentially accumulating at lower prices within the range. This data from Glassnode provides a fundamental understanding of investor sentiment and behavior, suggesting a move from aggressive profit-taking to a more strategic, patient approach within the Bitcoin market . Understanding Range-Bound Conditions in the Bitcoin Market : What Does it Mean for You? When analysts talk about the Bitcoin market being ‚Äòrange-bound,‚Äô it‚Äôs a critical concept for investors to grasp. Unlike the exhilarating surges of a bull run or the sharp declines of a bear market, a range-bound market is characterized by prices trading consistently between a specific high (resistance) and a specific low (support) for an extended period. Think of it like a ping-pong ball bouncing between two walls. The price might fluctuate significantly within that range, but it doesn‚Äôt break out decisively in either direction. For investors, this phase presents both unique challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Frustration for Momentum Traders: Those who thrive on rapid price appreciation may find range-bound conditions frustrating, as large, quick gains become less frequent. Increased Volatility within the Range: While the overall trend is flat, intra-range volatility can still be high, leading to potential ‚Äòshake-outs‚Äô where weak hands are forced to sell. Uncertainty: The lack of a clear directional trend can lead to indecision and analysis paralysis among investors. Opportunities: Accumulation Phases: Smart investors often view consolidation as an ideal time to ‚Äòdollar-cost average‚Äô (DCA) into their positions, buying at various points within the range to lower their average entry price. Strategic Trading: Experienced traders can profit by buying near the support level and selling near the resistance level, though this requires precise execution and risk management. Healthy Market Reset: Consolidation allows the market to digest recent gains, shake out speculative froth, and build a stronger foundation for the next upward move. It prevents markets from becoming overheated and unsustainable. Recognizing and adapting to range-bound conditions is vital for long-term success in the Bitcoin market . It calls for patience, a strategic mindset, and a focus on long-term value rather than short-term fluctuations. The Allure of $115,000: A Key Liquidity Hub for the Bitcoin Market In the world of trading, ‚Äòliquidity‚Äô refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity means there are many buyers and sellers, allowing for smooth transactions. When we talk about a ‚Äòkey liquidity point‚Äô like $115,000 for the Bitcoin market , it signifies a price level where a substantial amount of buy and sell orders are concentrated. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades, whose insights are often shared by Cointelegraph, has highlighted $115,000 as precisely such a critical juncture. His observation that ‚Äòpositions are building in this range‚Äô is highly significant. Here‚Äôs why: Concentration of Orders: A liquidity point like $115,000 suggests that many market participants have placed their buy or sell orders around this price. These could be stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, or new entry orders. Potential Magnet for Price: Price often tends to gravitate towards areas of high liquidity. If there‚Äôs a large cluster of buy orders below the current price, it can act as a strong support level, attracting price downwards before bouncing. Conversely, a large cluster of sell orders above can act as resistance. Fueling the Next Price Move: When price approaches a significant liquidity zone, it can trigger a cascade of orders. For instance, if Bitcoin dips towards $115,000 and hits a large volume of buy orders, it could absorb selling pressure and provide the necessary ‚Äòfuel‚Äô for a powerful rebound. Conversely, if it breaks below with conviction, it could trigger stop-losses and lead to a further decline until the next liquidity zone is found. Psychological Significance: Round numbers and previously important technical levels often gain psychological significance. While $115,000 might not be a round number, it could represent a confluence of technical indicators or a price point where a large number of investors feel comfortable entering or exiting. The accumulation of positions around $115,000 suggests that this level is being closely watched by a significant portion of the Bitcoin market . Its interaction with this price point could indeed dictate the direction and momentum of Bitcoin‚Äôs next major move. Is a $115K Retest Inevitable for the Bitcoin Market ? Examining the Possibility The concept of a ‚Äòretest‚Äô is fundamental in technical analysis, especially in dynamic markets like Bitcoin. A retest occurs when a price level, once broken (either as resistance turning into support, or vice versa), is revisited by the price to confirm its new role. Given the building liquidity at $115,000, the question arises: is a retest of this level for the Bitcoin market inevitable? While ‚Äòinevitable‚Äô is a strong word in financial markets, the possibility of a $115K retest is certainly high, driven by several factors: Support/Resistance Flip: If $115,000 was a significant resistance level that Bitcoin recently broke above, a retest would involve the price dipping back to confirm this level as new support. This is a classic pattern that strengthens the bullish case if the support holds. Liquidity Absorption: As discussed, large liquidity pools act as magnets. A retest allows the market to ‚Äòabsorb‚Äô the resting buy orders at that level. If these orders are strong enough, they can halt the downward momentum and initiate a bounce. Market Psychology and Price Discovery: After a rapid ascent, markets often need to consolidate and find a stable footing. A retest can be part of this price discovery process, allowing investors to establish a new base of confidence before the next leg up. It also provides a second chance for those who missed the initial breakout to enter. Historical Precedent: Bitcoin‚Äôs history is replete with examples of retests after significant price movements or breakouts from consolidation patterns. These retests often serve to validate the strength of a new trend or the importance of a particular price level. However, it‚Äôs important to note that a retest isn‚Äôt guaranteed, nor is its outcome. If the Bitcoin market finds strong buying pressure before reaching $115,000, it might move upwards directly. Conversely, if selling pressure is too strong, a retest could fail, leading to a break below $115,000 and a search for lower support levels. Traders and investors will be closely watching the volume and price action around this critical level to gauge its strength. Navigating Investor Psychology Amidst Bitcoin Market Consolidation Beyond the charts and on-chain data, understanding investor psychology is paramount, especially during periods of consolidation in the Bitcoin market . While a bull run is often fueled by euphoria and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), and a bear market by fear and capitulation, consolidation brings its own unique psychological challenges. During these range-bound phases, patience becomes a virtue, and emotional discipline is tested: Patience vs. Panic: The lack of immediate upward movement can lead to impatience. Some investors might panic and sell, fearing the rally is over. Others might chase small, short-term gains, only to be caught in whipsaws. Long-term holders, however, often view consolidation as an opportunity to accumulate more, understanding that these periods are necessary for sustainable growth. The Role of Long-Term Holders vs. Short-Term Traders: Glassnode‚Äôs data often distinguishes between these groups. During consolidation, long-term holders (HODLers) tend to remain steadfast, even adding to their positions. Short-term traders, on the other hand, might try to scalp profits within the range, but face higher risks. Avoiding Emotional Decisions: The absence of clear direction can lead to indecision and emotional trading. It‚Äôs crucial to stick to a pre-defined investment strategy, whether it‚Äôs dollar-cost averaging, setting clear entry/exit points, or simply holding. Chasing every rumour or reacting to every minor price swing can lead to significant losses. FUD and Noise: Consolidation periods often coincide with increased FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the media, as commentators search for explanations for the stalled price. Discerning legitimate news from speculative noise is vital to avoid making irrational decisions. Ultimately, successful navigation of the Bitcoin market during consolidation requires a calm temperament, a clear understanding of your investment goals, and a commitment to your long-term strategy. It‚Äôs a time for reflection and strategic planning, not impulsive reactions. Beyond the Charts: Other Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Market While on-chain metrics and technical analysis provide invaluable insights, the Bitcoin market is also profoundly influenced by a broader array of macroeconomic, regulatory, and technological factors. Understanding these external forces can provide a more holistic view of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential trajectory. Macroeconomic Trends: Inflation and Interest Rates: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation. If global inflation persists, or if central banks continue aggressive interest rate hikes, it can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Global Economic Stability: Geopolitical events, recessions, or significant shifts in global economic policy can either drive investors towards perceived safe havens like Bitcoin or away from speculative assets. Regulatory Developments: Government Stance: Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) from major economies can significantly impact institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance. Positive regulations (like spot Bitcoin ETFs) can be massive catalysts, while restrictive measures can create headwinds. Compliance: The evolving landscape of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations affects how exchanges and financial institutions interact with crypto, influencing liquidity and accessibility. Institutional Adoption: Corporate Treasuries: The increasing trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets signifies growing confidence and provides a steady demand source for the Bitcoin market . Financial Products: The success and expansion of Bitcoin ETFs, futures, and other regulated financial products provide new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure, increasing market depth and legitimacy. Technological Advancements: Network Upgrades: While less frequent for Bitcoin than for other blockchains, any significant protocol upgrades or scaling solutions (like the Lightning Network) can enhance its utility and appeal. Security: Continuous improvements in network security and wallet technology bolster trust in the asset. Mining Dynamics: Halving Events: The quadrennial Bitcoin halving, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin, has historically been a strong bullish catalyst, though its effects are typically felt over months, not days. Mining Difficulty and Hash Rate: These metrics indicate the health and security of the network. A robust and growing hash rate suggests strong miner participation and confidence. By considering these broader influences alongside on-chain data, investors can develop a more comprehensive and robust strategy for navigating the complexities of the Bitcoin market . Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Bitcoin Market The current consolidation phase in the Bitcoin market , while healthy, presents a unique set of challenges and, crucially, a wealth of opportunities for discerning investors. Understanding both sides of this coin is essential for making informed decisions. Challenges: Extended Sideways Movement: Consolidation can sometimes be prolonged, testing the patience of investors hoping for quick returns. A lengthy sideways trend can lead to ‚Äòcrypto fatigue‚Äô and potentially drive some investors away. Potential for Deeper Corrections: While the market is consolidating, there‚Äôs always a risk that the established support level might break, leading to a sharper correction downwards. This could be triggered by negative news, macroeconomic shocks, or simply a lack of sustained buying pressure. Increased Volatility Within the Range: Even within a defined range, Bitcoin‚Äôs price can experience significant swings. These ‚Äòwhipsaws‚Äô can liquidate over-leveraged positions and create uncertainty, making short-term trading particularly risky. Sentiment Shifts: Prolonged consolidation can lead to a shift in market sentiment from bullish enthusiasm to skepticism or even bearishness, which can further dampen price action. Opportunities: Accumulation Phases: For long-term investors, consolidation periods are prime opportunities to accumulate Bitcoin at potentially more favorable prices. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) becomes a highly effective strategy during these times, allowing investors to build their positions gradually without trying to ‚Äòtime the bottom.‚Äô Identifying Strong Hands: During consolidation, weaker hands (those with low conviction or high leverage) tend to get shaken out. The coins are then transferred to stronger, long-term holders, which strengthens the market‚Äôs foundation for future rallies. Technical Re-evaluation: This period allows traders to refine their technical analysis, identify new support and resistance levels, and prepare for the eventual breakout. It‚Äôs a time for strategy, not impulse. Fundamental Research: With less focus on day-to-day price swings, investors can dedicate more time to researching Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying technology, ecosystem developments, and broader adoption trends, reinforcing their conviction. Reduced FOMO: The absence of parabolic price action reduces the pressure of FOMO, allowing investors to make more rational decisions based on analysis rather than emotion. The current Bitcoin market phase is a test of patience and conviction. While it presents challenges, the opportunities for strategic positioning and long-term growth are substantial for those who understand its dynamics. Actionable Insights for Engaging with the Bitcoin Market Navigating a consolidating Bitcoin market requires a disciplined approach. Here are some actionable insights to help you make informed decisions during this crucial phase: Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, commit to investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy reduces the impact of price volatility and allows you to accumulate more Bitcoin when prices are lower within the range. Prioritize Risk Management: Define Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much you‚Äôre willing to lose and never invest more than you can afford. Set Stop-Losses: If you‚Äôre actively trading, use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price moves against your position. Avoid Excessive Leverage: Highly leveraged positions are extremely risky during volatile consolidation periods and can lead to rapid liquidations. Conduct Thorough Research: Use this calmer period to deepen your understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals, its role in the global financial system, and its long-term value proposition. Follow reputable analysts, read whitepapers, and understand the technology. Monitor Key On-Chain Metrics: Keep an eye on data from Glassnode and other on-chain analytics firms. Metrics like Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), and Exchange Flows can provide early signals of shifts in market sentiment or investor behavior within the Bitcoin market . Identify Key Technical Levels: Pay attention to established support and resistance zones. The $115,000 liquidity point highlighted by Daan Crypto Trades is a prime example. Understanding these levels can help you identify potential entry or exit points. Cultivate Patience: The most powerful tool in a consolidating market is often patience. Avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Markets move in cycles, and consolidation is a natural, healthy part of Bitcoin‚Äôs journey. Diversify (Wisely): While Bitcoin might be your primary focus, consider a well-diversified crypto portfolio if it aligns with your risk profile. However, avoid over-diversification into highly speculative altcoins during uncertain periods. By adopting these actionable insights, you can transform the current consolidation phase from a period of anxiety into an opportunity for strategic growth and enhanced understanding of the Bitcoin market . The current consolidation in the Bitcoin market is a pivotal phase, reflecting a healthy cooldown after an explosive rally. Glassnode‚Äôs data on the Realized Profit to Loss Ratio clearly indicates a shift from aggressive profit-taking to more range-bound conditions, signaling investor adjustment. The highlighted $115,000 level stands out as a crucial liquidity point, with positions building that could indeed fuel Bitcoin‚Äôs next significant move. While the path ahead may involve a retest of this key level, such a reconfirmation could strengthen Bitcoin‚Äôs foundation for future growth. For investors, this period demands patience, strategic accumulation, and a keen eye on both on-chain metrics and broader market factors. Understanding these dynamics is not just about predicting the next price move, but about building resilience and conviction in your investment strategy within the ever-evolving Bitcoin market . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Bitcoin Market Consolidation Q1: What does ‚Äòconsolidation‚Äô mean in the Bitcoin market? A1: Consolidation refers to a period where Bitcoin‚Äôs price trades within a relatively narrow range after a significant price movement (up or down). It signifies a period of market indecision and equilibrium between buyers and sellers, often preceding the next major price trend. Q2: How does Glassnode‚Äôs Realized Profit to Loss Ratio (RPLR) indicate market health? A2: The RPLR measures the ratio of realized profits to realized losses on the network. A high RPLR (like 3.9) suggests aggressive profit-taking, often seen near market tops. A decline (like to 2.6) indicates a cooling of this intensity, signaling that the market is digesting gains and potentially entering a consolidation phase, which can be healthy for long-term growth. Q3: Why is $115,000 considered a key liquidity point for Bitcoin? A3: A key liquidity point like $115,000 means there‚Äôs a significant concentration of buy and sell orders around that price level. Popular traders like Daan Crypto Trades identify these areas because the building of positions there can act as a magnet for price, potentially fueling the next major move as these orders are triggered. Q4: Is a retest of $115K guaranteed for the Bitcoin market? A4: Nothing is guaranteed in financial markets. However, a retest of a significant level like $115K is a common technical pattern after a breakout. It allows the market to confirm the level as new support (if it was resistance before) and absorb liquidity, strengthening the foundation for future upward movement if it holds. Q5: What should investors do during Bitcoin market consolidation? A5: During consolidation, many investors consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to accumulate Bitcoin gradually. It‚Äôs also a crucial time for risk management, thorough research, and cultivating patience, avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations. Q6: How do macroeconomic factors influence the Bitcoin market during consolidation? A6: Macroeconomic factors like inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and global economic stability can significantly influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. During consolidation, these factors can either provide tailwinds for a breakout or headwinds that prolong the sideways movement or even trigger a downside move.

2025-07-22T13:39:36,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $131 Million Outflow After Record Inflows","Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $131.35 million on Monday, ending a 12-day streak that saw $6.6 billion in inflows, as investors paused to lock in gains after Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price rally. According to SoSoValue, ARK Invest‚Äôs ARKB led the outflows, shedding $77.46 million, followed by Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC with $36.75 million and Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC with $12.75 million. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB and VanEck‚Äôs HODL also recorded smaller outflows of $1.91 million and $2.48 million, respectively, while BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF with $86.16 billion in assets under management, reported no inflows or outflows for the day. Profit-Taking After a Strong Rally Despite the pause, cumulative net inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs remain strong at $54.62 billion, with total net assets now standing at $151.60 billion, accounting for 6.52% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total market capitalization. Many experts are suggesting that the withdrawals are part of a routine correction after a strong upward move, as institutions rebalance their positions to manage risk and secure profits following significant inflows earlier in July. On July 10 and 11, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion and $1.03 billion in daily inflows, marking the first time in history that two consecutive days brought in over a billion dollars each into Bitcoin funds. Ether ETFs Continue Strong Inflow Streak While Bitcoin-base investment funds saw a brief pause, spot Ether ETFs extended their inflow streak to 12 consecutive days , recording $296.59 million in net inflows on Monday. This pushed the cumulative net inflow for Ether ETFs to $7.78 billion, highlighting rising institutional interest in Ethereum-based products. Last Wednesday marked a record day for Ether ETFs, which saw $726.74 million in daily inflows, the highest since their launch, followed by $602.02 million on Thursday. The consistent demand for Ether ETFs reflects increasing confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term utility as the network continues to attract activity around tokenization and decentralized applications, positioning Ether products to capture growing institutional allocations alongside Bitcoin funds in the expanding crypto investment landscape.

2025-07-22T13:34:25,"Altcoin Trading Hits ATH: Here Are the Alts That Could Explode in This Rally","With Binance recording a huge $100B in altcoin futures in just one day, another altcoin season might be nearby. Bitcoin dominates the mainstream narrative, but smart money quickly shifts into altcoins. Early investors are rapidly securing their positions before the market surge. Investors Are Betting Big on Altcoins In just 24 hours, the altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures has surged to $100.7B , the highest since Feb 3, 2025. The surge reveals a clear trend, as altcoins now account for 71% of Binance Futures volume, while Bitcoin holds at just 25%. Traders are shifting their focus to altcoins for the next significant move. After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091.61 on July 14, 2025, altcoin activity has surged significantly across the market. For example, Ethereum has increased by 25% over the past seven days, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%. The CMC Altcoin Season Index is at 48 , so there‚Äôs still time for investors who haven‚Äôt jumped on the trend yet. So, which altcoins are poised to benefit the most from the upcoming alt season? Here are three top picks, based on growing investor interest and strong fundamentals. And no, it‚Äôs not Ethereum, XRP, or Bonk. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bringing Speed and Scale to Bitcoin‚Äôs Slow Network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable fast and incredibly inexpensive transactions. When the full version launches, it is expected to support everything from dApps to meme coins and foster a utility ecosystem around Bitcoin. After validation, the corresponding $BTC is returned to the user‚Äôs Bitcoin address on Layer 1, ensuring high security. The best part is, Bitcoin Hyper isn‚Äôt just an idea. It‚Äôs already being built, and the team recently announced the launch of the devnet. It can handle program deployment via Solana CLI, contract calls, transaction flows through the web console, and account state management. The performance remains stable, low latency, and contracts are already being ported over. $HYPER tokens, which fuel the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, are now available for purchase on the official website at fixed prices, with over $4 million raised so far. Early movers can secure annual percentage yields (APYs) over 200% through dynamic staking, right from the presale phase. It is designed to decline as more users join the pool, encouraging early participation. Get $HYPER from the official presale page. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Trading Firepower Built Straight into Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) is another popular altcoin sensation of this week. It operates a Telegram-native bot, best described as a smart trading suite built into chat. What exactly does that mean? Sub-second swaps, real-time copy trades, and token sniping‚Äîall without leaving the messaging app. $SNORT powers the platform and grants access to advanced tools and significant fee discounts. For context, the fees decrease from 1.5% to just 0.85% for those holding enough tokens, making it more affordable than major competitors. Snorter takes security seriously, boasting an 85% success rate in beta rugpull and honeypot detection. Blacklist scanners and mint trap alerts provide extra layers of protection. If the project delivers on its white paper vision, it could offer more depth and access than most existing DeFi platforms. But early investors looking for an upside don‚Äôt have time till then. The $SNORT presale is fast selling out with close to $2M raised, and staking yields are juicy at 183%. Get $SNORT now from the official presale page. 3. Solana ($SOL): Top Altcoin to Watch this Season Now trading for $199, Solana (SOL) has recorded a 25% jump in the last seven days alone and outperformed Bitcoin with flair. Technical indicators show $SOL bulls are in control, flashing strong buy signals across the board. The moving averages, one of the most apparent signs of market strength, indicate 13 out of 14 bullish signals. Does that mean Solana is ready to reclaim its ATH of $294.33? It‚Äôs too early to tell. But in the current climate, it‚Äôs not a long shot. And it won‚Äôt be just Solana that benefits from its growing momentum. Platforms that make use of Solana tech are also at an advantage. A good example is BONK, which has climbed over 20% on the weekly chart. Although still in the presale stages, Snorter Token and Bitcoin Hyper have also witnessed heavy traffic over the last few days. While BONK has a heavy market cap of $3B, these under-the-radar tokens will be available for fixed, discounted rates before the presales sell out. Don‚Äôt Sleep on this Altcoin Window Altcoin seasons can be exciting, but only for those who get in early. It‚Äôs often a mix of regret and FOMO for investors who stay on the sidelines. What‚Äôs the smart way to play it? Start your hunt early, but don‚Äôt hesitate to trust your instincts. All three altcoins discussed above ‚Äì $HYPER , $SNORT , and $SOL ‚Äì‚Äì are ripe for a rally. However, nothing in crypto moves in straight lines. Make sure you have done your research before jumping in.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-this-month-before-bull-run/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T13:33:07,"Surprising Decision from the World's Largest Bank, JPMorgan! ""They're Preparing for a Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Move!""","According to the Financial Times, JPMorgan Chase is preparing for a new cryptocurrency move. JPMorgan is exploring offering loan products backed by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the FT reported, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter. This will reportedly likely launch early next year. The move comes as major US banks like BoA and Citibank have shown interest in issuing stablecoins, and comes at a time when rules surrounding cryptocurrencies in the US are becoming clearer and customer demand is increasing. If JPMorgan's move goes through, it would mark a major shift for CEO Jamie Dimon, who once labeled Bitcoin a scam and predicted its collapse. Jamie Dimon, who has consistently expressed his skepticism towards Bitcoin, recently took a more flexible stance and said, ‚ÄúWe will be interested in stablecoins.‚Äù The CEO also expressed concerns about excessive leverage, illicit use, and money laundering risks at a May shareholder meeting, saying, ‚ÄúI don't like the Bitcoin ecosystem. If our customers want to buy BTC, we'll let them, but we won't store it.‚Äù *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Surprising Decision from the World's Largest Bank, JPMorgan!

2025-07-22T13:30:00,"Missed Bitcoin? Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $1 Could Make You Rich Before Bitcoin 2025 Bull Run","If you missed Bitcoin when it was under $1000, you already know how rare these moments are. Right now, Bitcoin Solaris is offering exactly that kind of opportunity. Its Genesis Event is cutting the price from $13 to just $1. This is not just buying a cheap token. This is securing BTC-S at a rollback price, giving early participants a rare chance to capitalize before the next Bitcoin bull run sends the markets into another frenzy. Bitcoin Still Solid, but Bitcoin Solaris Has the Edge Bitcoin predictions for 2025 and beyond continue to show long-term growth.

2025-07-22T13:29:43,"Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy Eyes 900,000 Bitcoin by 2027","The post Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy Eyes 900,000 Bitcoin by 2027 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy continues to lead the corporate Bitcoin race , now holding the title of the world‚Äôs largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. Despite ongoing debate, its stock trades at a significant premium over its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV), and analysts say it‚Äôs justified. TD Cowen Backs the Premium In a recent interview with The Block , analysts from global investment bank TD Cowen, Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete, supported the view that Strategy‚Äôs premium is rational. They dismissed critics who argue that the stock should track its Bitcoin NAV directly, calling such views ‚Äúlogically flawed.‚Äù As of now: Market cap : $124.3 billion Bitcoin holdings : $72 billion NAV Premium : 72.6% Rather than being overvalued, TD Cowen believes Strategy‚Äôs ability to access low-cost capital sets it apart. Debunking the ‚ÄúGreater Fools‚Äù Theory Skeptics claim Strategy‚Äôs premium is driven by a speculative bubble‚Äîa belief that someone else will buy in at a higher price. However, TD Cowen analysts argue that Strategy‚Äôs financial engineering, particularly its ‚Äú42/42‚Äù plan, creates intrinsic value. The 42/42 plan aims to raise $84 billion in equity and debt by 2027. With a blended borrowing rate of just 0.421%, Strategy can: Increase Bitcoin per share without dilution Create a Bitcoin ‚Äúyield‚Äù effect that ETFs and retail investors cannot replicate Capital Flywheel Effect: A Unique Advantage Strategy‚Äôs flywheel approach fuels continuous Bitcoin accumulation. Recently: Raised $739.8 million via a $21 billion offering Bought 6,220 BTC at $118,940 per coin Added 3,077 BTC in profit‚Äîwithout issuing new shares Since January 1, Bitcoin per MSTR share is up 20.8% , doubling compared to 18 months ago. This efficiency amplifies returns beyond typical NAV-based models. The recent launch of ‚ÄúStretch‚Äù (STRC) preferred stock further supports Strategy‚Äôs capital efficiency, offering more tools to expand its Bitcoin holdings without dilution. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX Just Moved $152 Million in Bitcoin, Are Whales Dumping? , Outlook: 900,000 BTC by 2027?

TD Cowen predicts: 900,000 BTC holdings possible by 2027 Equivalent to 4.3% of all Bitcoin supply They also maintain a $680 price target on MSTR, citing: Regulatory clarity Growing institutional adoption Strategy‚Äôs unique, self-reinforcing capital model Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy isn‚Äôt just stacking Bitcoin‚Äîit‚Äôs reshaping how corporations invest. Backed by low-cost capital, long-term vision, and a capital flywheel, TD Cowen believes this NAV premium is not only sustainable but a blueprint for corporate Bitcoin dominance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-22T13:15:56,"XRP Price Breakout: Ali Martinez Predicts $15 Target Ahead","The post XRP Price Breakout: Ali Martinez Predicts $15 Target Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price breakout in late June to ongoing July that has punched over 80% gains has stirred renewed interest across the crypto space. According to Ali Martinez, by this rally the XRP price has successfully exited a bullish flag formation on the weekly chart, opening the door for a potentially explosive move for $15. While $15 may seem lofty, but the chart structure alongside significant market developments like Proshares Ultra XRP ETF approval backs this projections and makes it less speculative than it may appear. XRP Price Has Taken Support on Historical Highs Zooming into the daily chart, the XRP crypto recently bounced off a significant historical level, which is its previous all-time high zone of $3.40, now acting as support. This level was identified as crucial zone and the recent reaction at this level lends credibility to the thesis that XRP price is in the early stages of another bullish cycle. While the market awaits confirmation, the current consolidation above this historic support suggests bulls are gaining strength. Price discovery may resume if XRP crypto manages to push past the next key resistance at $3.66. Analyst Explains His Wave Theory and the Road Ahead Another critical angle comes from another analysts comparing XRP crypto‚Äôs current cycle to its 2017 performance. Back then, XRP price experienced three distinct growth waves. If the same structure repeats, the experts says we are presently in ‚ÄúWave 1‚Ä≥. This wave has build around the previous ATH near the $3.40‚Äì$3.66 range. In the next ‚ÄúWave 2,‚Äù as described by the analyst, would commence only if XRP price manages to clear the newly formed $3.66 threshold. This next phase is where the real expansion begins, moving the asset well into price discovery territory. If $XRP follows the same pattern as 2017, where it had 3 growth waves, then we are currently in ''wave 1'', entering ''wave 2''. ''Wave 1'' is the one that is around the previous all time high, ''wave 2'' is the one that goes well into price discovery. pic.twitter.com/qlBTK4dw96 ‚Äî Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) July 22, 2025 Given the current setup, this structural pattern appears to be playing out, making the $15 target more of a roadmap than a moonshot. A Bullish Structure Aligns With Market Sentiment What‚Äôs striking about this scenario in XRP price action is the robust convergence of technical patterns and broader market sentiment. Institutional interest in the XRP crypto has been steadily growing, and any additional tailwinds pump it higher. For instance, if Bitcoin rallies to new highs it could provide the momentum XRP needs to complete its breakout. So far, the XRP price remains well-supported, and technical signals are aligning with historical patterns. Traders are keeping a close watch on the $3.66 level. A clean breakout above it could not only confirm the start of ‚ÄúWave 2‚Äù but also lend strong support to the long-term $15 projection. $XRP has broken out of a bullish flag, setting its sights on $15! Zoom out on the weekly chart and you'll spot it. pic.twitter.com/DXVp6G18os ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 22, 2025 As momentum builds, and optimism from analysts like Ali Martinez continues to grow, the XRP price narrative becomes increasingly hard to ignore.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-breakout-ali-martinez-predicts-15-target-ahead/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T13:12:29,"Fragbite becomes first Swedish gaming firm to launch BTC treasury","Swedish gaming and e-sports firm Fragbite Group has become one of the first publicly listed companies in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The company acquired 4.3 Bitcoin for $486,719 (SEK 6.63 million), at an average price of $112,958 per BTC, as part of a newly launched Bitcoin treasury strategy. The announcement marks a notable entry into the digital asset space by a European tech firm amid evolving regulatory clarity across the region. To fund the Bitcoin purchase, Fragbite raised SEK 6 million ($630,000) through an interest-free convertible loan. This loan structure gives the company a long-term, low-cost route to build digital reserves while limiting short-term financial risk. Fragbite Group @FragbiteGroup ¬∑ Follow First purchase complete ‚úÖ4.3 bitcoin at an average price of app. USD 112 958 / bitcoin marks the start of operations under the newly established Bitcoin Treasuryüì¢ fragbitegroup.com/en/press/fragb‚Ä¶ $FRAG 12:33 PM ¬∑ Jul 22, 2025 12 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Convertible loan offers flexible BTC exposure The SEK 6 million loan is interest-free until November 30, 2030. Crucially, it includes a conversion clause that will trigger if Fragbite‚Äôs share price exceeds the conversion price of SEK 13 by 30% for 20 consecutive trading days. Should the share price reach 200% of the conversion price, the company also retains the right to forcibly convert the loan into equity. This mechanism provides a flexible treasury model‚Äîallowing Fragbite to scale its Bitcoin exposure based on share performance, rather than relying solely on internal cash reserves or dilutive funding rounds. It also gives investors a clear framework for understanding how digital asset exposure could evolve over time. Bitcoin integration reflects long-term diversification Fragbite‚Äôs entry into the Bitcoin market appears to be part of a broader strategy to diversify its treasury beyond traditional fiat-based reserves. The company‚Äôs board positioned the move as a long-term step, aligning with broader financial market shifts towards digital assets. The treasury strategy is structured in a way that allows Fragbite to scale its holdings if market conditions are favourable, without needing to raise additional capital or take on interest-bearing debt in the near term. By linking expansion to its equity performance, the company has created a direct feedback loop between shareholder value and its Bitcoin exposure. Fragbite joins early corporate adopters in Europe While global firms like MicroStrategy and Tesla have made headlines for their Bitcoin holdings, adoption in Europe has been slower and more cautious. Fragbite‚Äôs move represents one of the first major corporate treasury announcements from Sweden and places the company among a small but growing group of European firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The company has not disclosed any further targets for Bitcoin accumulation, but the structure of its convertible loan suggests that more purchases could follow if share price and market conditions align. By creating a dedicated funding mechanism early on, Fragbite has laid the groundwork for future allocations without needing to revisit financing arrangements. The 4.3 Bitcoin acquisition may be modest in size, but it reflects a larger shift in how even mid-cap public companies are starting to view digital assets‚Äînot merely as speculative instruments, but as viable long-term treasury assets.

2025-07-22T13:11:22,"Tron (TRX) Sees Whale Exit, Funds Moving to High-Yield Presale With 3000% Target","The post Tron (TRX) Sees Whale Exit, Funds Moving to High-Yield Presale With 3000% Target appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a surprising move, several large holders of Tron (TRX) have begun exiting their positions, signalling a shift of capital away from the once-dominant blockchain. These whale movements have sparked curiosity in the crypto community about where these significant funds will land next. Emerging as a clear favorite among sophisticated investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new decentralized finance platform offering a compelling real-yield lending ecosystem that is quietly gearing up for explosive growth. While Tron (TRX) whales pull back, the smart money is positioning itself in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs presale, eyeing a remarkable 3000% upside potential by 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs Dual Lending Model: Real-Yield Opportunities for Diverse Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to distinguish itself with a unique two-pronged lending system aimed at a broad spectrum of crypto holders. The first path, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), will target stablecoins and bluechip collateral assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA). This avenue is designed to provide lenders with stable, real-yield returns by depositing assets that generate mtTokens‚Äîspecial ERC-20 tokens programmed to accrue interest automatically. For example, lending $5,000 worth of BTC at a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could yield roughly 12% annual passive income through mtTokens. This approach is intended to preserve capital while rewarding holders with steady returns‚Äîsomething rare in today‚Äôs volatile market. On the flip side, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model will open borrowing opportunities using high-risk memecoin collateral such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). These loans are expected to offer flexible repayment terms and slightly higher interest rates, aligning with the risk profile of the assets involved. The system‚Äôs smart contracts will automate risk management, aiming to ensure borrower flexibility while safeguarding lender interests. For instance, a borrower using PEPE as collateral might access a loan with a manageable interest rate over a short term‚Äîenabling liquidity without sacrificing upside exposure. The project is currently deep into Phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced attractively at $0.03. The presale is nearing an 87% sellout, having already raised $12.8 million in funds. The approaching Phase 6 promises a price increase to $0.035, fueling urgent buying pressure among investors eager to secure tokens at a discount before the price escalates. This scarcity combined with rising demand creates a perfect storm of FOMO, making it an ideal moment for new participants to join. Roadmap to Mainstream Adoption and 3000% Upside Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs roadmap is meticulously structured to mitigate risk and build trust as the project progresses. Phase 1 laid the foundation with initial presale launches and audits by CertiK, which awarded impressive security scores‚ÄîToken Scan 95 and Skynet 77.5‚Äîensuring the platform‚Äôs smart contracts are reliable and secure. Phases 2 and 3 will focus on completing smart contract development, user interface design, and extensive internal and external audits. These phases also include developing advanced risk parameters and analytics tools to ensure robust risk management. The project will engage a bug bounty program to encourage community participation in identifying vulnerabilities, further solidifying the platform‚Äôs integrity. Phase 4 will mark the full platform launch, bringing live P2C and P2P lending markets online alongside cross-chain integrations. Institutional partnerships will also be pursued at this stage, expanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs reach into larger liquidity pools and professional investors. This carefully staged approach is designed to build confidence while scaling sustainably. Investors who joined early have already seen substantial returns. For instance, an $8,000 investment made during Phase 1 at $0.01 is now worth $24,000 at the current presale price of $0.03‚Äîreflecting a 200% gain or 3x growth. This illustrates how early presale participants are being handsomely rewarded even before the mainnet goes live. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analysts‚Äîsome of whom accurately predicted Bitcoin‚Äôs 2020 bull run‚Äîare now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top contender. Their forecasts suggest MUTM could reach between $0.50 and $1 by 2026, representing a 16x to 33x return from today‚Äôs price, or up to a 3200% increase for those who entered at the earliest stage. With the strategic tokenomics, dual lending model, and a clear roadmap toward cross-chain adoption and institutional integration, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only building to fill a critical gap in DeFi but is poised to redefine how lending works in this space. The platform‚Äôs innovative approach to real-yield lending‚Äîsupported by mtTokens and overcollateralized borrowing‚Äîensures that users are rewarded with genuine returns rather than speculative gains. As Tron (TRX) whales exit, the funds flowing into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) signal a growing recognition that this $0.03 token could be the next high-yield opportunity with massive growth potential. With 87% of Phase 5 sold and prices set to rise soon, the window to get in early is closing fast. Investors ready to capitalize on this shift will find Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs lending platform offers both the stability of bluechip assets and the dynamic upside of memecoin markets, backed by a robust, audited protocol and an aggressive roadmap toward mainstream DeFi adoption.

2025-07-22T13:10:02,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Factors Point to a BTC Correction Ahead","Bitcoin has entered a sideways corrective phase, with investors taking profits and rotating capital into the altcoin market. As BTC cools off, the stage may be set for a potential altcoin rally in the coming days. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After facing strong resistance at the $123K level, Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase, likely driven by profit-taking and distribution among investors. Historically, when BTC cools down at its all-time high prices, capital often rotates into altcoins, sparking rallies across the broader market. Currently, a pullback toward the key 0.5‚Äì0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, located between $107K and $111K, appears likely before the next major bullish impulse. Until then, a period of consolidation is expected, potentially accompanied by notable strength in altcoins. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin‚Äôs consolidation is forming a descending wedge pattern, a structure that typically signals bullish continuation. The price is now approaching a crucial support zone between $113K and $116K, aligning with the 0.5‚Äì0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. If this zone successfully holds and triggers a breakout above the wedge, a move back toward the $123K resistance becomes likely. However, if support fails, a deeper correction toward the $111K level may unfold. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Bitcoin has seen its largest net inflow to exchanges since July 2024, marking a key shift in on-chain dynamics. Such inflows suggest increased distribution and profit-taking, as more BTC becomes available for trading. Historically, similar exchange inflow spikes have often preceded deeper corrections. This week‚Äôs data hints that major players, potentially funds or institutions, are offloading BTC near all-time highs, managing their risk exposure. However, this capital rotation could also fuel an altcoin rally, with demand flowing into alternative assets. As exchange supply rises, market volatility may increase, especially during demand surges. Traders should keep a close eye on this metric, as it could foreshadow the next major move.

2025-07-22T13:08:30,"Here‚Äôs Solana‚Äôs path to $1,000 price target","After Solana ( SOL ) broke through the key $200 psychological level , a trading expert projects that the cryptocurrency still has momentum, with a potential path toward $1,000. According to Master Ananda‚Äôs outlook, the ongoing rally marks the start of a much larger bullish cycle. He noted that while Solana‚Äôs recovery may feel gradual, the move from the April 7 low to July 21, just 98 days, is relatively quick, as he explained in a TradingView post on July 21. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView With an all-time high of $295, Ananda believes resistance will be cleared with ease, similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) recent breakout, which culminated in a record high above $123,000. The expert now expects Solana to reach $420 in the mid-term, with $620 and $1,000 as potential upside targets in the current bull market. Notably, a rally to $1,000 would mark a 400% gain from current levels. Technically, Solana recently broke out of a long-term bullish consolidation, clearing a triangle pattern that formed between April and June 2025. SOL next price levels to watch SOL is now trading above the 55-day EMA, 144-day EMA, and 200-week MA, confirming a strong trend reversal. Fibonacci extension levels point to upside targets at $252.91, $419.78, $620.35, and $1,021.49. Ananda attributed the aggressive price targets to Solana‚Äôs broader market cycle. In this line, the sharp 60% correction in January 2025 likely marked the bottom, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. To this end, the expert compared Solana‚Äôs structure to Bitcoin‚Äôs, suggesting that after a new high, SOL is more likely to consolidate and continue higher than to crash. At the same time, strong on-chain metrics are also fueling Solana‚Äôs momentum. Notably, the asset reclaimed the $200 level as Open Interest hit a record $11.03 billion on July 21, up from $9.52 billion just days earlier, according to Coinglass . SOL open interest chart.

2025-07-22T13:00:56,"Figma looks to raise $1 billion at $16 billion valuation in IPO filing","The San Francisco-based design software company filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $1 billion and secure a valuation of roughly $16.5 billion on a fully diluted basis. According to the IPO prospectus submitted Monday, Figma and its investors plan to offer nearly 40 million shares priced between $25 and $28 each. If the share price is at the top of that range, the company could raise slightly over $1 billion. Figma disclosed earlier this month that it holds over $69 million in Bitcoin via ETFs, and USDC reserves worth $30 million, all bought in March. IPO filing spells valuation of over $16 billion The prospectus noted that on a fully diluted basis, which accounted for employee stock options and restricted shares, Figma‚Äôs valuation would reach approximately $16.5 billion. Its market capitalization would reach $13.6 billion based solely on outstanding shares The company‚Äôs IPO is expected to be priced by the end of the month, according to a source familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Co., and JPMorgan Chase will lead the offering. Figma plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúFIG.‚Äù According to the IPO filing, Figma generated $228 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2025 and posted a net income of $45 million. Despite reporting a net loss of $732 million in 2024, the company said the shortfall was caused by a one-time tax-related expense tied to an employee stock tender offer. The software company listed new members on its board of directors, including Mike Krieger, Instagram‚Äôs co-founder and Chief Product Officer at AI company Anthropic . He will join the board alongside Luis von Ahn, co-founder and CEO of language-learning platform Duolingo. Founder and CEO Dylan Field is still the largest individual shareholder, holding 56.6 million Class B shares, which grant him 51.1% of the company‚Äôs voting power. In a letter to investors, Field asserted that the IPO is imperative for the company and its user community. ‚Äú It‚Äôs time for Figma to buck the trend of amazing companies staying private indefinitely ,‚Äù Field wrote, citing benefits such as liquidity, corporate transparency, and ownership among the reasons for going public. Away from the IPO details, Figma also authorized the issuance of ‚Äúblockchain common stock‚Äù via blockchain-based tokens. Still, it said there are currently no plans to issue these shares yet. During the second quarter, the company added new clients and expanded its operating margin to between 4% and 5%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year. Tech firms open to public listing Technology institutions, particularly those backed by venture capitalists, are reportedly now more open to joining the public market. Some investors were disconcerted about buying stocks under President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs and protectionist policies, worried they could further delay listings from companies like Klarna and Stripe. The public debut of CoreWeave in March helped change the sentiment around tariffs and their effect on the US economy. The data center operator lowered its valuation to go public but has since seen its stock surge over 200%, hitting a market capitalization of nearly $63 billion. Other tech institutions disputed that public listings could be looking at how Figma‚Äôs offering evolves. If successful, several high-profile startups that have been privately held for years due to market volatility and high interest rates might consider offering shares on public stock exchanges. Meanwhile, Adobe has seen its stock fall 18% year-to-date, dragged down by investor concerns over competition from generative artificial intelligence models.

2025-07-22T13:00:24,"Pioneering Crypto Payments: Skycorp Solar‚Äôs Strategic Leap into Digital Assets and Ethereum Investment","BitcoinWorld Pioneering Crypto Payments: Skycorp Solar‚Äôs Strategic Leap into Digital Assets and Ethereum Investment In a significant move that bridges the gap between traditional industry and the burgeoning digital economy, Skycorp Solar Group, a Nasdaq-listed powerhouse in renewable energy, has announced a groundbreaking shift. Starting August 1st, this innovative company will begin accepting crypto payments for its international transactions, embracing leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, and USDT. This isn‚Äôt just about facilitating transactions; it‚Äôs a strategic declaration of intent, further solidified by their plan to invest a portion of their cash and renewable energy returns directly into Ethereum. This bold step positions Skycorp Solar at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption, signaling a transformative era where sustainable energy meets decentralized finance. The Dawn of Digital Transactions: Why is Skycorp Solar Embracing Crypto Payments ? Skycorp Solar Group (ticker: PN) has made headlines with its decision to accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, and USDT for international transactions. This move, effective August 1st, is more than just a nod to technological trends; it‚Äôs a calculated strategy to enhance efficiency, broaden market reach, and align with the evolving global financial landscape. But what exactly drives a established solar energy company to pivot towards digital currencies? Global Accessibility: Traditional banking systems can be slow and costly for international transfers. Crypto payments offer a faster, often cheaper alternative, enabling Skycorp Solar to serve a wider global clientele with greater ease. Reduced Transaction Costs: For large international transactions, bank fees can accumulate. Cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins like USDC and USDT, can significantly lower these overheads, directly impacting the company‚Äôs bottom line. Enhanced Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies, provides an immutable and transparent ledger for all transactions, potentially reducing fraud and increasing trust in cross-border dealings. Innovation and Market Leadership: By adopting crypto payments , Skycorp Solar positions itself as a forward-thinking leader in both the renewable energy and financial sectors, appealing to a tech-savvy investor and customer base. A Strategic Bet on Ethereum: What Drives Skycorp Solar‚Äôs Investment Vision? Beyond accepting digital currencies for payments, Skycorp Solar has revealed an even bolder strategy: investing a portion of its cash reserves and renewable energy returns directly into Ethereum. This isn‚Äôt a casual dabble; it reflects a long-term belief in Ethereum‚Äôs potential as a foundational technology for the future of finance and decentralized applications. Ethereum, often considered the backbone of Web3, powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and smart contracts. Skycorp Solar‚Äôs investment could be driven by several factors: Diversification of Assets: Investing in a high-growth digital asset like Ethereum can provide a hedge against inflation and diversify the company‚Äôs treasury beyond traditional fiat currencies. Belief in Decentralized Technologies: This move signals Skycorp Solar‚Äôs conviction in the long-term viability and transformative power of blockchain and decentralized networks. Potential for Capital Appreciation: As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, particularly with upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 (now the Merge and subsequent updates), the value of ETH could appreciate significantly, benefiting Skycorp Solar‚Äôs financial health. Synergy with Sustainability: While Bitcoin has faced criticism for its energy consumption, Ethereum‚Äôs shift to Proof-of-Stake has dramatically reduced its energy footprint, aligning more closely with Skycorp Solar‚Äôs core business of renewable energy. This makes it a more palatable and strategically sound investment from an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) perspective. Beyond Convenience: What are the Core Benefits of Crypto Payments for Global Enterprises? Skycorp Solar‚Äôs decision highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies. Embracing crypto payments offers a suite of advantages that can streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and unlock new revenue streams. For businesses operating on a global scale, these benefits are particularly pronounced: Instant Global Reach: Cryptocurrencies transcend geographical boundaries and traditional banking hours. A transaction initiated in New York can be settled almost instantly in Tokyo, removing delays inherent in conventional international transfers. Lower Processing Fees: Compared to credit card processing fees, which can range from 1.5% to 3.5% or more, cryptocurrency transaction fees are often significantly lower, especially for larger sums. This can lead to substantial savings for businesses with high transaction volumes. Irreversible Transactions (Mostly): Once confirmed on the blockchain, cryptocurrency transactions are generally irreversible, reducing the risk of chargebacks and associated losses for merchants. Attracting a New Customer Base: As crypto adoption grows, a demographic of crypto-native consumers emerges. Accepting crypto payments can tap into this market, attracting customers who prefer or exclusively use digital assets. Innovation and Brand Image: Companies that adopt cutting-edge technologies like cryptocurrencies often enhance their brand image as innovative and future-oriented, resonating with modern consumers and investors. Charting Uncharted Waters: What Challenges Might Skycorp Solar Face with Crypto Payments ? While the opportunities are vast, integrating crypto payments and investing in digital assets is not without its complexities. Skycorp Solar, like any pioneering company, will need to navigate several potential challenges: Price Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate wildly. While stablecoins (USDC, USDT) mitigate this for payments, the investment in Ethereum is subject to market swings, which could impact the company‚Äôs treasury. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Skycorp Solar will need to stay abreast of changing laws regarding taxation, compliance, and reporting in all jurisdictions where it operates and accepts payments. Security Risks: Storing and managing cryptocurrencies requires robust cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks, phishing, and other digital threats. Secure wallet management and cold storage solutions will be paramount. Technical Integration: Implementing the necessary infrastructure to accept, process, and account for crypto payments requires technical expertise and careful integration with existing financial systems. Accounting and Taxation: Managing crypto assets and transactions for accounting purposes, including calculating gains and losses, can be complex due to the unique nature of digital currencies and varying tax regulations. The Confluence of Innovation: How Will This Impact Solar Energy and the Future of Crypto Payments ? Skycorp Solar‚Äôs move is more than just a corporate strategy; it‚Äôs a significant indicator of a broader trend: the convergence of established industries with blockchain technology. For the solar energy sector, this could pave the way for new models of financing, energy trading, and even tokenized renewable energy credits. Imagine a future where solar energy producers can directly sell excess energy on a blockchain-based marketplace, or where consumers can invest in solar projects using fractionalized digital tokens. This development also validates the increasing legitimacy and utility of crypto payments on a global scale. When a Nasdaq-listed company like Skycorp Solar embraces digital assets, it sends a powerful message to other traditional enterprises. It demonstrates that cryptocurrencies are maturing beyond speculative investments into practical tools for international commerce and corporate treasury management. This could accelerate mainstream adoption, leading to more widespread acceptance and integration of digital currencies across various industries, from manufacturing to logistics. Conclusion: A Bright Future Powered by Digital Assets Skycorp Solar‚Äôs decision to accept crypto payments and invest in Ethereum marks a pivotal moment for both the renewable energy sector and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It exemplifies a bold vision that recognizes the immense potential of digital assets to revolutionize traditional business operations, enhance global reach, and secure future growth. While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, Skycorp Solar‚Äôs pioneering spirit positions it as a leader in this exciting new frontier, demonstrating how innovation and strategic foresight can drive both sustainable energy and financial evolution. This move is not just about transactions; it‚Äôs about building a more interconnected, efficient, and digitally empowered future.

2025-07-22T13:00:02,"Ethereum Fueling The Fire? Crypto Inflows Hit Over $4 Billion In A Week","The global crypto fund world saw another banner week as investors piled in. According to CoinShares data, net inflows into digital‚Äëasset products jumped to $4.40 billion‚Äîbeating the prior record of $4.27‚ÄØbillion set after the 2024 US elections.

Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now It was the 14th straight week of positive flows, lifting year‚Äëto‚Äëdate inflows to $27 billion and driving total assets under management to a fresh high of $220 billion. Trading also heated up: exchange‚Äëtraded product turnover hit nearly $40 billion in a single week, underscoring a surge in both interest and liquidity. Record Inflows Hit New High Last week‚Äôs $4.40 billion haul wasn‚Äôt just a marginal uptick. It smashed the old record by $120 million. Investors have now pumped capital into these funds every week since early April, showing a clear shift toward digital assets as part of broader portfolios. Last week digital asset products saw all-time high weekly inflows of US$4.39bn, bringing YTD inflows to US$27bn, pushing AuM to a record US$220bn. Ethereum attracted a record US$2.12bn in inflows, while Bitcoin saw inflows of US$2.2bn. https://t.co/y32mEP8Oa2 ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 21, 2025 Total AUM of $220 billion means these products now rival many traditional asset classes in sheer scale. And with $39 billion in weekly turnover, bid‚Äëask spreads are likely tighter‚Äîmaking it easier for big players to move in and out without major price swings. Ethereum Leads The Charge Based on reports, Ethereum was the standout draw. It pulled in a little over $2 billion‚Äînearly double its previous weekly high of $1.2 billion. Over the past week, ether climbed 24.5%, briefly topping $3,800 for the first time in more than seven months. That price pop clearly caught buyers‚Äô eyes. Bitcoin stayed strong too, with $2 billion in inflows, even if that was down from $2.7 billion the week before. Notably, ETPs made up 55% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total exchange volume, signaling that institutions are hunting exposure via these regulated vehicles.

Switzerland contributed $47 million, Australia $17 million, and Hong Kong $14‚ÄØmillion. Meanwhile, Brazil and Germany experienced minor outflows of $28 million and $15 million as domestic investors booked profits or changed strategy. The sheer magnitude of US demand is evidence of both regulatory certainty regarding spot crypto ETFs and increasing comfort on the part of asset managers to apply those products.
