2025-07-21T23:45:19,"Ethereum Shatters Inflow Records, Pulls in $2.12 Billion in a Week","Ethereum led digital asset inflows last week as it recorded a staggering $2.12 billion. The figure was nearly double its previous record. This surge helped push total digital asset investment product inflows to an all-time weekly high of $4.39 billion, surpassing the prior record of $4.27 billion set after the US presidential election in December 2024. Altcoins Join Ethereum’s Rally In the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed that Ethereum has been on a strong run. Inflows from the past 13 weeks now account for 23% of its total assets under management. This year alone, it has pulled in $6.2 billion and has already topped the full-year inflows seen in 2024. This comes as total assets under management hit a record $220 billion, while global weekly trading turnover in ETPs also reached a record $39.2 billion. Bitcoin attracted $2.2 billion in inflows this week, down from last week’s $2.7 billion. ETP trading volumes accounted for 55% of its exchange activity. Meanwhile, Solana led altcoin inflows with $39 million, followed by XRP at $36 million and Sui at $9.3 million. During the same period, Chainlink and Cardano recorded smaller inflows of $0.9 million and $0.3 million. Multi-asset products were the only cohort to have recorded outflows of $16.4 million over the past week. With altcoins pulling notable inflows, the data indicates growing investor appetite for assets beyond Bitcoin. In fact, QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin dominance slipped from 64% to 60% over the past week, while, at the same time, Ethereum’s market share rose from 9.7% to 11.6%. If this trend continues, QCP expects the next phase of altcoin season could already be underway. Regional Crypto Flows Flows were largely driven by the US, which attracted $4.37 billion during the week. Switzerland followed with $47.3 million, while Australia and Hong Kong recorded $17.3 million and $14.1 million, respectively. Canada also saw modest inflows of $3 million. Brazil and Sweden, on the other hand, posted outflows of $28.1 million and $21 million. Germany also saw $15.5 million in weekly outflows.

2025-07-21T23:30:16,"Crypto Enthusiast Asks XRP Holders This Critical Question","With XRP currently trading at $3.55 , discussions around how much of the token one needs to retire are gaining renewed attention across the crypto community. Investors are increasingly revisiting questions about what size of XRP holdings could support long-term financial independence, particularly as speculation continues about the token’s future valuation. The conversation, primarily fueled by retail investors within the XRP Army, centers around the belief that XRP could see exponential growth in the coming years. For many, even a small number of tokens could potentially yield significant wealth if bullish projections are realized. Community Perspectives on Retirement Thresholds A recent discussion led by a known figure in the XRP community, Jeremiah, asked members to share their thoughts on the number of tokens they believe would be sufficient for retirement. The responses highlighted a wide range of perspectives, with opinions varying from conservative estimates to highly ambitious predictions. How much XRP do you think is needed to retire comfortably? I am curious to see what you think. #XRP pic.twitter.com/EF1tu9s37Y — GenXRP (@JeremiahB45) July 20, 2025 Some users suggested that owning 10,000 XRP could provide a path to financial security, implying expectations that the token could rise to values exceeding $100. Others proposed that 60,000 XRP would be a safer benchmark, though Jeremiah challenged this, asserting that a smaller quantity might be sufficient due to future market dynamics. Another user took an even more optimistic position, arguing that as little as 1,000 XRP could eventually be enough to retire. Jeremiah reiterated this sentiment, citing anticipated reductions in available supply over the next five years as a potential driver of significant price increases. High-Value Projections Stir Debate Perhaps the most striking claim came from a community member named Marc, who proposed that just 100 XRP could be sufficient for a comfortable retirement. Jeremiah supported this assertion, reinforcing a highly optimistic outlook. For this scenario to materialize, XRP would need to exceed $10,000 per token, an increase of over 285,000% from its current price. Although these projections are met with skepticism even within the XRP community, some well-known figures have shared similar views. For instance, crypto entrepreneur Jake Claver has suggested that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2027. Nonetheless, such projections are controversial and far from consensus. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors That Influence Value While much of the discussion centers on specific amounts of XRP, some investors have emphasized that the real determining factors lie elsewhere. Adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and technological developments are all seen as critical components in shaping the token’s long-term value. O ne user compared the current situation to the evolution of Bitcoin, noting that what once seemed like a sufficient amount for retirement has changed over time as the asset matured. These perspectives reflect a broader understanding that price predictions must be grounded in market fundamentals, rather than speculation alone. Although there is no clear consensus on the exact amount of XRP needed to achieve financial independence, confidence in the token’s long-term potential remains high among supporters. Community projections range widely, from XRP reaching $100 to as much as $10,000, with some even suggesting that a $500 price point may eventually be considered cheap. In the absence of certainty, investors are making decisions based on their individual risk tolerance and faith in XRP’s future value.

2025-07-21T23:15:13,"Over 90% of ETH holders are in profit after recent surge in value","More than 90% of ETH holders are now in profit after the token’s recent rally saw it hit $3,800 for the first time in over a year. Data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) confirmed this, noting that it is the highest level since December 2024. According to the data , only a few addresses have bought ETH above its current price, which means that on-chain resistance above that price point has been very light, a factor that could push the token to further heights. The sizable amount of holders in profit highlights the turnaround that ETH has experienced over the past few months. Per CoinMarketCap, the ETH value has increased by more than 120% in the last three months, going from around $1,800 to $3,800. The majority of ETH holders are now in profit (Source: Sentora) With the gains, concerns about ETH value, which dominated sentiments in the Ethereum community during the first half of the year, have faded away completely, replaced by bullish sentiments that the asset could hit a new all-time high. However, the token has seen a slight decline today, falling less than 1% in what appears to be a minimal price correction even as it remains primed for further gains. Despite the price correction, the general opinion remains bullish for ETH with analysts from Sentora noting that the first major resistance for ETH is slightly below $4,000, as 2.39 million addresses are holding at a loss in this range. Institutions and retail pile on ETH as interest increases With the ETH price increasing, demand for the token has also been soaring, with institutions and retail investors buying the token. Over the past few months, several public companies have accumulated billions worth of ETH for their treasuries. Interestingly, retail investors are also not holding back. Santiment data noted that social media discussion around ETH is now at levels similar to its price rise in May 2024. Ethereum now has over 152 million non-empty ETH wallets, the highest for any crypto token. First-time ETH buyers are increasing (Source: Glassnode) It appears that first-time buyers are also increasing their interest in the asset. According to Glassnode data, the supply of ETH held by first-time buyers has increased by 16% since early July, showing the return of new market participants and the injection of fresh capital. Altcoin season is entering full swing Meanwhile, ETH’s massive performance over the past three months appears to have kick-started the altcoin season, with several tokens now seeing a surge in their value. In the past 24 hours, major cap altcoins such as Solana and Dogecoin have seen 7.74% and 6.70% gains, respectively. Santiment data highlighted other top performers, noting that PENGU gained 16%, HEX increased by 20%, PLSX 12% while KAS went up by 15%. Analysts note that this is the Bitcoin all-time high profits redistribution in full effect. Interestingly, BTC is showing consolidation signs with the flagship asset declining more than 2% in the past seven days and now trading in the $118,000 range. On-chain indicators also show slower inflows and rising transfer volume. With altcoins, led by Ether, soaring in value, Bitcoin dominance has also declined to 59.67%, its lowest level since March 2025 and far from the 65% less than 30 days ago. By comparison, ETH’s dominance at 11.58% has been at its highest level since January 2025. Despite the gains, the altcoin season is yet to enter full effect. According to CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index, it is currently at 55/100, which means 56% of the top 100 tokens have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Altcoin season signal is when 75% of the top 100 coins outperform BTC. Nevertheless, the signs are already there with altcoin activity soaring. Data from CryptoQuant shows that altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures increased to $100.7 billion in a single day, marking the highest level since February 2025.
