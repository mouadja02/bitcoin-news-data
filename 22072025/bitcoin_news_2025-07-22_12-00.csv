2025-07-22T09:55:23,"EUR/USD Forecast: Crucial Insights into Bearish Momentum","BitcoinWorld EUR/USD Forecast: Crucial Insights into Bearish Momentum In the dynamic world of financial markets, understanding currency movements is as crucial as tracking digital assets. While your primary focus might be on Bitcoin or Ethereum, the traditional Forex Market Analysis , particularly of major pairs like EUR/USD, often provides a foundational understanding of global economic health and investor sentiment. This broader financial landscape can indirectly influence the liquidity and stability of the cryptocurrency space. Recently, ING, a prominent financial institution, highlighted a significant development concerning the EUR/USD pair: it lacks sufficient bullish momentum. What does this mean for the world’s most traded currency pair, and how might it impact your broader financial perspective? Decoding the Latest EUR/USD Forecast from ING ING’s recent assessment paints a cautious picture for the Euro against the US Dollar. The core of their argument revolves around a persistent lack of strong buying interest, suggesting that any upward movements are likely to be temporary and fragile. This outlook is not just a passing observation; it stems from a careful evaluation of various economic and policy indicators that continue to favor the US Dollar over the Euro. Economic Divergence: The US economy has shown remarkable resilience, often outperforming its European counterparts. Stronger labor markets and more robust consumer spending in the US create a more attractive environment for investment, drawing capital towards dollar-denominated assets. Interest Rate Differentials: Central bank policies play a pivotal role. While both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) have grappled with inflation, the Fed’s stance on interest rates has often been perceived as more hawkish or adaptable, leading to higher yields on US bonds compared to Eurozone bonds. This yield differential makes the Dollar more appealing to investors seeking better returns. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe, can weigh heavily on investor confidence in the Eurozone. Uncertainty often drives investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, and the US Dollar frequently benefits from this flight to safety. Forex Market Analysis : What’s Driving the Stagnation? Beyond ING’s specific points, a broader Forex Market Analysis reveals several systemic factors contributing to the EUR/USD’s struggle to find bullish momentum. These elements interact in complex ways, creating a challenging environment for the Euro. Inflation and Central Bank Policies Inflation remains a key determinant of central bank actions. In the Eurozone, while inflation has been a concern, the ECB has often adopted a more cautious approach to rate hikes compared to the Fed. This divergence in monetary policy philosophies directly impacts currency valuations. When a central bank signals a readiness to maintain higher rates for longer, its currency typically strengthens as it offers better returns for holding that currency. Consider the following comparison: Factor US Economy (USD) Eurozone Economy (EUR) Economic Growth Generally resilient, often outpacing Mixed, slower recovery in some areas Interest Rate Policy More aggressive/adaptive hikes More cautious/gradual hikes Inflation Trends Persistent, but showing signs of cooling Varied, but often stubborn in core components Labor Market Strong, low unemployment Varied, higher unemployment in some member states This table highlights the fundamental differences that can influence capital flows and, consequently, currency strength. Understanding the Euro Dollar Outlook : Key Levels and Resistance For traders and investors, understanding the technical landscape is as important as fundamental analysis. The current Euro Dollar Outlook suggests that key resistance levels are proving difficult for the pair to breach, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. These levels act as ceilings, where selling pressure tends to increase, preventing significant upward movement. Resistance Levels: Analysts often identify specific price points where the currency pair has struggled to advance in the past. Repeated failures to break above these levels signal a lack of buying conviction. For EUR/USD, these might be psychological levels like 1.0900 or 1.1000, or specific technical indicators. Support Levels: Conversely, support levels are price points where buying interest tends to emerge, preventing further declines. However, if these support levels are broken, it can signal a continuation of the bearish trend. Potential Scenarios: In a market lacking bullish momentum, common scenarios include consolidation (trading within a narrow range) or a gradual downtrend. Sharp upward moves are often quickly corrected, indicating that traders are quick to sell into strength. Currency Trading Insights : Navigating the Choppy Waters Given the current Euro Dollar Outlook , what are the actionable Currency Trading Insights for those looking to engage with the forex market, or even understand its broader implications for their crypto portfolio? Strategies for a Bearish or Range-Bound Market Embrace Caution: Avoid aggressive long positions on EUR/USD unless there’s a significant fundamental shift or a clear technical breakout. The path of least resistance appears to be downwards or sideways. Consider Short Positions: For experienced traders, shorting the EUR/USD pair on rallies towards resistance levels could be a viable strategy, provided robust risk management is in place. Focus on Relative Strength: Instead of looking for outright strength in the Euro, consider trading other pairs where the Euro might be relatively stronger or weaker against a different currency, if that aligns with your analysis. Monitor Economic Data Closely: Pay close attention to US inflation reports, Fed speeches, ECB policy meetings, and Eurozone GDP figures. Unexpected data releases can trigger sharp, albeit potentially temporary, movements. Risk Management is Paramount: In a volatile and uncertain market, strict stop-loss orders are essential to protect capital. Position sizing should be conservative to account for potential sudden swings. The Influence of Global Economic Factors on EUR/USD The performance of major currency pairs like EUR/USD is rarely isolated. It is deeply intertwined with broader Global Economic Factors that shape investment flows and risk appetite. These macro trends create the backdrop against which central banks make their decisions and investors form their opinions. Energy Prices: Europe is a net importer of energy, making its economy particularly sensitive to fluctuations in global oil and gas prices. High energy costs can fuel inflation and dampen economic growth, weakening the Euro. Supply Chain Dynamics: Ongoing disruptions in global supply chains can impact manufacturing output, trade balances, and inflation across both the US and Eurozone, creating ripple effects on their respective currencies. Trade Balances: A country’s trade balance (exports minus imports) can influence its currency. A persistent trade deficit means more of the local currency is being sold to buy foreign goods, putting downward pressure on its value. Political Stability: Geopolitical events, elections, and political stability within the Eurozone can significantly impact investor confidence. Uncertainty often leads to capital flight and a weaker currency. Understanding these overarching themes provides a more holistic perspective on why the EUR/USD might be struggling. It’s not just about interest rates; it’s about the entire economic ecosystem. Challenges and Opportunities in a Stagnant Market The lack of bullish momentum in EUR/USD presents both challenges and opportunities for traders. The primary challenge is the potential for whipsaw movements or extended periods of range-bound trading, which can frustrate directional traders. Unexpected news can also trigger sharp, short-lived rallies or declines, making it difficult to maintain positions. However, opportunities exist. For those who excel at range trading, the current environment might offer consistent, albeit smaller, gains by buying at support and selling at resistance. Furthermore, the weakness in EUR/USD can serve as a signal for broader trends, such as the continued strength of the US Dollar against other major currencies, which could inform other trading decisions. Conclusion: A Cautious Path Ahead for EUR/USD ING’s assessment that EUR/USD lacks sufficient bullish momentum underscores a prevailing sentiment of caution in the forex market. The confluence of economic divergence, differing central bank policies, and persistent global economic factors continues to favor the US Dollar. For traders, this means maintaining a vigilant approach, prioritizing risk management, and adapting strategies to a market that may continue to show limited upward potential. While the Euro could see temporary bounces, a sustained bullish reversal appears unlikely without significant shifts in fundamental drivers. Stay informed, stay agile, and always base your decisions on comprehensive analysis.

This recent surge has caught the attention of many as the entire cryptocurrency market is trading in red. What’s behind this sudden price jump? Some say it’s because of new developments, while others point to growing interest in the coin. Let’s find it out! Pi Network Sees Developer Boom The recent surge in Pi Network coin is attributed to the recently launched App Studio. This tool has already helped people build over 8000 apps . So far, 2.6 million users joined in, and around 761,000 have finished all the steps to launch their ideas. The staking feature is also adding fuel. More than 37.7 million Pi coins have been staked to support over 1,450 apps, backed by 16,000 users. Meanwhile, popular projects like Healthy Life, BLACKHOLE, and FlapPi Bird show what’s possible. Secret Whale Wallet Draws Attention At the same time, a mystery Pi whale wallet has people talking. This wallet has quietly collected 331 million Pi coins, worth about $148 million , even while prices dropped. Known by the address GAS…ODM, the wallet has moved huge amounts of Pi from exchanges like OKX, MEXC, and Gate.io in the last three months. This has sparked new questions about what might come next for Pi Network. Breaking Free From Bitcoin’s Grip It’s no secret that the whole crypto market has always danced to Bitcoin’s tune. When Bitcoin rises, most other coins rise too. When it drops, they usually fall. But Pi Network is starting to break away from this old pattern. Its recent boost didn’t come because Bitcoin spiked. Instead, Pi’s momentum came from inside, its team, its vision, and its growing community. This marks a big shift. Many other coins have tried to stand on their own, but few have done it with real use cases. Pi is different, it’s not just about hype or price charts. That Leg Up from Dr. Nicolas (a.k.a. Satoshi) Means A Lot Pi Is Starting to Take Its Own Path Let’s be honest — that recent leg up from Dr. Nicolas hit different. Whether it was a quiet behind-the-scenes push or a calculated move by the Core Team, it showed us something… pic.twitter.com/UuXli0Gzzn — Mr Spock 𝛑 (@MrSpockApe) July 22, 2025 Real People, Real Utility One thing that makes Pi stand out is what people are doing with it. Real stores are accepting Pi as payment. Developers are launching apps built just for Pi users. And the new Desktop App Studio makes it easier for everyday people to build tools for Pi’s growing world. These actions prove that Pi isn’t waiting for Bitcoin to lead. It’s building its path, brick by brick. That push from Dr. Nicolas was more than a simple update, it reminded everyone that Pi’s mission is alive and moving forward. It’s about creating a digital currency that everyday people can use in their daily lives, not just hold and hope.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-pi-coin-price-is-up-today/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T09:45:24,"Hyperliquid Whale Makes Audacious $200M Bitcoin Bet","BitcoinWorld Hyperliquid Whale Makes Audacious $200M Bitcoin Bet The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often influenced by the seismic shifts of its largest players. Imagine a colossal ripple effect caused by a single, monumental trade. This is precisely what unfolded recently on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, as a formidable Hyperliquid whale made a breathtaking pivot, signaling a potentially significant shift in market sentiment. This dramatic move, from a substantial Ethereum (ETH) loss to an colossal Bitcoin (BTC) long position, has sent murmurs across the digital asset landscape, leaving many to ponder the implications of such an audacious bet. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s Pivotal Move In the high-stakes world of crypto trading, every move by a ‘whale’ – an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency – is scrutinized. The recent actions of a particular Hyperliquid whale , identified by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain as ‘AguilaTrades,’ have certainly captured the market’s attention. This whale’s journey highlights both the inherent risks and the immense potential rewards within the volatile crypto ecosystem. Initially, AguilaTrades was positioned with a substantial Ethereum long, a bet on ETH’s price appreciation. However, market dynamics proved challenging, leading to a significant setback: Ethereum Long Closure: The whale closed their ETH long position, incurring a loss estimated to be around $3 million. This substantial loss underscores the unpredictable nature of leveraged trading, even for seasoned participants. Strategic Capital Injection: Following the ETH loss, AguilaTrades swiftly deposited an additional 5.28 million USDC (USD Coin) to their Hyperliquid account. This immediate replenishment of capital signals strong conviction and readiness for the next strategic play, demonstrating deep pockets and a willingness to double down. This initial phase reveals a trader who is not deterred by losses but rather recalibrates and repositions with conviction, a hallmark often seen in professional trading circles. The ability to absorb a multi-million dollar loss and immediately inject fresh capital is a testament to the scale of operations this Hyperliquid whale commands. The Audacious Bitcoin Long Position: A Deeper Dive The subsequent action by the Hyperliquid whale was nothing short of monumental. After replenishing their capital, AguilaTrades pivoted sharply, shifting focus from Ethereum to Bitcoin with an aggressive, leveraged bet. This move was not just a change in asset; it was a dramatic increase in exposure and risk. Here’s a breakdown of this colossal Bitcoin trade: Asset Shift: From Ethereum to Bitcoin, signaling a potential belief in Bitcoin’s near-term strength or a hedge against broader market uncertainty. Leverage Applied: A staggering 20x leverage was used. This means that for every dollar of their own capital, the whale borrowed an additional nineteen dollars, amplifying both potential gains and potential losses twentyfold. Position Size: The long position was opened for 1,695 BTC, equivalent to approximately $200.5 million at the time of the trade. This makes it one of the largest single leveraged trades observed on Hyperliquid, showcasing the immense scale of this Hyperliquid whale’s conviction. Such a massive bet by a Hyperliquid whale often sends ripples through the market, influencing sentiment and potentially even triggering follow-on trades from other large players or algorithmic systems. It highlights the concentrated nature of wealth and influence within the crypto space, indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s immediate future. A significant move by a Hyperliquid whale. Decoding Whale Activity: Why It Matters Understanding the movements of a Hyperliquid whale is crucial for any participant in the crypto market, from seasoned traders to casual investors. Whales, by definition, hold enough assets to significantly influence market prices. Their trades, especially large leveraged positions, can act as leading indicators or, at times, self-fulfilling prophecies. Here’s why whale activity is so important: Market Impact: Large buy or sell orders can directly move prices, especially in less liquid assets. Even in highly liquid markets like Bitcoin, a $200 million position can create significant price pressure. Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements can signal underlying sentiment. A massive long position might suggest institutional optimism, while significant selling could indicate a bearish outlook. Liquidation Cascades: Highly leveraged positions, if they go wrong, can trigger cascading liquidations, exacerbating price swings. However, it’s vital to remember that not all whale movements are infallible. Whales can, and do, make mistakes, as evidenced by AguilaTrades’ $3 million ETH loss. Retail traders should observe, but not blindly follow, these massive trades. The financial capacity and risk tolerance of a Hyperliquid whale are vastly different from those of an average investor. Consider the differences between retail trading and whale trading: Feature Retail Trader Crypto Whale (e.g., Hyperliquid Whale) Capital Limited, often personal savings Vast, often institutional or multi-million/billion dollar funds Market Impact Minimal, individual trades don’t move markets Significant, can influence price action and sentiment Risk Tolerance Lower, focus on capital preservation Higher, willing to take large, calculated risks for massive returns Navigating High-Leverage Risks in Crypto The sheer size and leverage of the Hyperliquid whale’s Bitcoin position naturally bring to light the significant challenges and inherent risks associated with high-leverage trading in cryptocurrency markets. While leverage amplifies potential profits, it equally amplifies potential losses, making it a double-edged sword. Here are some critical risks to consider: Liquidation Risk: At 20x leverage, a relatively small adverse price movement can wipe out the entire collateral. If Bitcoin’s price were to drop by just 5% from the entry point, the $200.5 million position would face liquidation, potentially resulting in a complete loss of the capital allocated to that trade. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Sudden price swings, often triggered by news, regulatory changes, or even other large trades, can quickly move against a leveraged position. Funding Rates: On perpetual futures contracts, traders pay or receive funding rates. With such a large long position, the funding rate could become a significant ongoing cost, eating into potential profits. The fact that this Hyperliquid whale previously incurred a $3 million loss on an ETH long underscores that even the most sophisticated traders are not immune to these risks. Their willingness to re-enter with even higher leverage suggests a strong belief in their analysis, but it doesn’t eliminate the inherent dangers of the strategy. Actionable Insights for Prudent Crypto Trading While the actions of a Hyperliquid whale can be fascinating to observe, it’s crucial for individual traders to derive actionable insights without falling into the trap of blindly following. The crypto market rewards informed decisions and disciplined risk management. Here are some actionable insights for navigating the current market and beyond: Prioritize Risk Management: Define Your Stop-Loss: Determine the maximum loss you are willing to accept and set a stop-loss order before entering any trade. Manage Position Sizing: Never allocate more than a small percentage of your total portfolio to a single trade, especially leveraged ones. The Hyperliquid whale has vast capital; most do not. Avoid Excessive Leverage: While 20x leverage might work for a whale, it is generally ill-advised for retail traders. Start with lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) or avoid it altogether until you fully understand its implications. Conduct Thorough Research (DYOR): Understand the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Stay informed about market news, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different assets to mitigate risk. Develop a Trading Plan and Stick to It: Emotional decisions often lead to losses. Have clear entry and exit strategies, and stick to them regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Learn from Whale Movements, Don’t Mimic Them: Use whale activity as a data point for market sentiment, but always cross-reference it with your own analysis and risk parameters. The audacious move by this Hyperliquid whale serves as a powerful reminder of both the incredible opportunities and the significant perils present in the cryptocurrency market. Success in this space hinges not just on identifying potential gains, but crucially, on mastering the art of managing risk. The crypto world is constantly evolving, and staying informed is key. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action. Conclusion: A Bold Bet in a Volatile Market The recent actions of the Hyperliquid whale , AguilaTrades, on Hyperliquid have painted a vivid picture of the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency trading. From closing a multi-million dollar Ethereum long position at a loss to immediately opening an astounding $200.5 million Bitcoin long with 20x leverage, this move underscores the immense conviction and risk appetite of major market participants. While such audacious bets can signal strong underlying sentiment for Bitcoin, they also serve as a stark reminder of the extreme volatility and inherent risks, particularly those associated with high leverage. For the average investor, the key takeaway isn’t to replicate such massive trades, but rather to understand the market forces at play, prioritize robust risk management, and make informed decisions tailored to their own financial capacity. The crypto landscape remains a realm of unparalleled opportunity, but it demands respect for its volatility and a disciplined approach to navigating its powerful currents. The eyes of the crypto community will undoubtedly remain fixed on this Hyperliquid whale’s position, awaiting the next chapter in this unfolding saga of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is AguilaTrades, the Hyperliquid whale mentioned in the article? A1: AguilaTrades is a prominent trader or entity on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, identified as a ‘whale’ due to their significant capital and large-scale trading activities, as reported by Lookonchain. They recently made a notable pivot from an ETH long to a BTC long position. Q2: What does it mean to open a ’20x leveraged Bitcoin long position’? A2: Opening a 20x leveraged Bitcoin long position means the trader is borrowing funds to amplify their exposure to Bitcoin by 20 times. This magnifies both potential profits if Bitcoin’s price rises and potential losses if it falls, making them susceptible to liquidation with a relatively small price drop. Q3: Why did the Hyperliquid whale switch from Ethereum to Bitcoin? A3: While speculative, the switch could indicate a stronger conviction in Bitcoin’s near-term price appreciation, a belief in Bitcoin as a more dominant asset in the current market cycle, or a strategic repositioning based on their unique market analysis. Q4: How does whale activity on platforms like Hyperliquid affect the broader crypto market? A4: Whale activity, especially large, leveraged trades like the one by this Hyperliquid whale , can significantly impact market sentiment and price action. Their massive orders can create direct price movements, and their perceived insights can influence other traders to follow suit, potentially leading to cascading effects or shifts in market narratives. Q5: What are the main risks for retail traders trying to mimic a Hyperliquid whale’s strategy? A5: The main risks include insufficient capital to withstand large losses, higher susceptibility to liquidation due to excessive leverage, and lack of the same market insights or resources as a whale. It’s crucial for retail traders to prioritize robust risk management over mirroring whale moves.

After this ATH, BTC price has retreated and continues to consolidate at the $117,000-$118,000 level. While the pullback in BTC price had a negative impact on spot Bitcoin ETFs, the 13-day entry streak in US spot Bitcoin ETFs was broken, according to data. Accordingly, after a 13-day inflow series, net outflows were seen in spot BTC ETFs yesterday. According to Farside Investors data, a total of $131.4 million outflow occurred yesterday from spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US.

2025-07-22T09:27:19,"Bitcoin ‘could march toward $131k’, says crypto expert","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been hotly debated in the past weeks, as it managed to hit a new all-time high (ATH) above $123,000 and become the fifth-largest asset by market capitalization. Contributing to the discussion, crypto market analyst Ali Martinez, suggested in a July 22 post on X that the coin could be on track to surge even further. According to Martinez, Bitcoin could march toward $131,200, provided it maintains a critical support level at $117,400. Ali Martinez’s BTC chart. Source: X (@ali_charts) Bitcoin performance Bitcoin faces technical resistance in the $118,500–$123,000 range, and a break above this zone could set the stage for a rally toward a price of up to $135,000. The ‘digital gold’ currently trades at $118,050, down 0.76% in the past 24 hours but well above its 30-day simple moving average of $111,700. Still, momentum indicators advise caution.

Source: Finbold However, as per the same data, Bitcoin’s road to $135,000 may hinge on whether exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) flows and corporate adoption can overpower resistance near $123,000. If not, a pullback toward support at $115,000 is also likely. Is Ethereum $10,000 also possible? In another post , Martinez suggested Ethereum ( ETH ) could be poised for a major breakout toward $10,000 if it can decisively breach a critical resistance level around $4,000. Quote : “If Ethereum $ETH can break past $4,000, we could be looking at $10,000 next!” The analyst pointed to a long-standing Parallel Channel pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart.

2025-07-22T09:20:55,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest bought 4.4M Bitmine shares as ETH rallies","Cathie Wood is back at it again, making a strategic move with ARK Invest in its crypto strategy. The fresh disclosure shows that the firm acquired over 4.4 million shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), an Ethereum treasury firm. However, the purchase worth around $175 million was spread across three of ARK’s ETFs. This comes in when Ethereum is running high on bullish waves, gaining more than 25% in the last 7 days. This surge has pushed the largest altcoin to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the past 90 days. ETH went on to reclaim the crucial $3,800 mark long after December 2024. Cathie Wood goes long on Ethereum According to ARK Invest’s July 21 trade disclosure, the firm scooped 2.9 million shares of BMNR through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). It added 927.8K shares via ARKW and 555.7K via ARKF. This can be seen as ARK’s first major move into Bitmine since the company announced it was turning away from Bitcoin and building a massive Ethereum treasury. Bitmine is now holding over $1 billion in ETH after a recent $500 million purchase. It reportedly plans to acquire and stake 5% of the total Ethereum supply. The ETH staking announcement led Bitmine stock to soar more than to an all-time high of $135 before cooling to around $39. It is still up by almost 800% over the past month.

2025-07-22T09:15:29,"Goldman Sachs Spots Ominous Economic Signal Brewing in China, Creating Headwinds for 2025 Growth: Report","The financial giant Goldman Sachs is reportedly issuing a warning after spotting an ominous economic metric in China. A new tracker from Goldman economists indicates wages in China grew by only 3.9% from the second quarter of 2024, the lowest growth in Chinese recorded history, excluding the pandemic years, Bloomberg reports . The Goldman economists also note that the figure is roughly a percentage point less than official Chinese government statistics. “Our wage tracker suggests that sluggish wage growth may impose headwinds to consumption growth in the second half of 2025. We anticipate incremental and targeted easing measures in the second half of the year to alleviate labor market pressures.” Source: Bloomberg Ernan Cui, a China consumer analyst at the investment research firm Gavekal, says in a report reviewed by Bloomberg that Chinese workers are shifting toward self-employment because there are few available formal jobs in the country’s labor force. Cui also reportedly says that the Chinese government’s statistics bureau is counting those self-employed workers, but she notes that they may not be counted in surveys of large companies. “The data indicate that China’s labor market has been consistently weak, despite a broadly stable headline unemployment rate. Until the labor market truly tightens, it seems unlikely that household confidence will rebound.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-22T09:10:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $118K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $118,075 (-0.7%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $119,376 24-hour low $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $118,075 Price Prediction $ 128,009 (10.76%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 1.77% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 106,055 200-Day SMA $ 87,760 14-Day RSI 54.56 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin struggles in holding above $118.5K. Resistance for BTC is at $120,838 Support for BTC/USD is at $115,736 The BTC price analysis for 22 July confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price struggled to hold around $118.6K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation around $118K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces bearish volatility toward $118K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced minor bearish pressure as it failed to hold above $118.5K. Currently, sellers are triggering minor domination, resulting in a drop below immediate Fib levels toward $118K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $2.12 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $118,075, declining by over 0.7% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the overbought region at 64.9, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $118K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.12, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $120,838, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,185. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $115,736, beginning a bearish trend to $107,777. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $118.6K. However, the rejection triggered a downward trend for BTC price. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare

2025-07-22T09:02:37,"Tornado Cash Co-Founder May Seek Mistrial Over Witness Testimony","Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm’s legal team may seek a mistrial , arguing that a government witness’s testimony has no connection to the crypto mixer case. The potential request was raised before Manhattan federal judge Katherine Polk Failla on Monday, questioning the validity of the testimony provided by government witness Hanfeng Lin, Inner City Press reported . If granted, a mistrial would render the current proceedings invalid, either dismissing the case or requiring a retrial with a new judge and jury. Storm was charged in 2023 with money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. He faces up to 45 years in prison. His co-founder, Roman Semenov, charged in the same case, remains in Russia and has not appeared in court. Disputed Testimony Over Crypto Scam Lin testified on Tuesday that she lost $190,000 in a crypto romance scam that began on WhatsApp in 2022. She described how a scammer convinced her to purchase Bitcoin and send it to a fraudulent trading platform that falsely displayed high returns, prompting her to send more funds. Eventually, the scammer disappeared with the funds. Lin said that Payback, a crypto recovery service she hired, informed her that some of her stolen Bitcoin had passed through Tornado Cash. However, Storm’s lawyer, David Patton, stated that their research over the weekend could not find any evidence linking Lin’s funds to Tornado Cash, indicating the defence would consider moving for a mistrial due to this testimony. Crypto Sleuths Challenge Connection to Tornado Cash FBI Special Agent Joseph DeCapua, a government crypto tracing expert, testified regarding the general flow of crypto from hacks into Tornado Cash but confirmed under cross-examination that he had not reviewed Lin’s transactions specifically. The prosecution indicated it would bring in IRS analyst Stephan George to prove Lin’s funds touched Tornado Cash. Meanwhile, independent blockchain researchers have cast doubt on Lin’s claims. MetaMask security researcher Taylor Monahan posted on X that her analysis showed the scammers who stole Lin’s funds did not use Tornado Cash. She explained that the scammers converted Lin’s Bitcoin to Ether, and the transactions were mistakenly flagged by Payback due to bundling errors onchain. Prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT supported Monahan’s findings, criticising Payback’s tracing work, noting that the firm had followed incorrect transaction paths, leading to an inaccurate claim that Lin’s funds interacted with Tornado Cash.

2025-07-22T09:00:25,"These XRP Price Predictions Will Make You Think","The past 24 hours saw the broader cryptocurrency market go through a slight correction, with the total capitalization dropping below $4 trillion. This comes on the back of a decline in Bitcoin’s price, which is down 1.3% during the period. As it’s almost always the case, altcoin performance is directly correlated with that of BTC but typically a lot more pronounced. That’s what we saw today as well. ETH dropped by 4.5%, DOGE – by 4.7%, ADA – by 4.6%, and XRP – by almost 4%. But as the native coin behind the XRPL corrects, analysts are taking the opportunity to present some price predictions. Technical XRP Price Predictions As CryptoPotato reported , prominent and popular analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart, indicating that XRP might be on its way to the $6 mark. To come to this price level, Martinez used Fibonacci levels drawn from the previous move. They indicat $4.17, $4.63, and $5.01 as points where the buyers might meet serious resistance. The final extension of his analysis indicates $6.12 as a target. Another trader, going by the CRYPTOWZRD moniker presented his technical outlook. Yesterday, he wrote: The intraday chart was somewhat volatile today and should remain so tomorrow. Our current position is secure. Moving above the $3.65 intraday resistance target will trigger the next long opportunity. $3.4 is the main intraday support target. We will have to wait for the market to form the next healthy trade setup. In the attached chart, the analyst presents $4.6 as the “next major target.” Source: X Somewhat in line with these was the comment of Cobb, who said that: XRP $5 is coming so fast. You will blink one day and it’s just gonna be $5 per coin.” What is Driving the Current Positive XRP Price Momentum? Regardless of the slight correction, the community is relatively unanimous – sentiment is positive. But what’s behind the recent price movements? Well, for once, the legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs has more or less been resolved. The company has withdrawn its cross appeal and expects that SEC will do the same, effectively marking the end of the lawsuit. On the other hand, Ripple is a native US company and the country has done quite a bit under the presidency of Donald Trump with regards to crypto regulations. For instance, just recently, the administration passed the GENIUS Act, considered to be the first major national regulatory framework creating clearer rules for the growing industry, especially when it comes to stablecoins. Recall that Ripple also launched a USD-pegged coin called RLUSD and even tapped the country’s oldest bank – BNY Mellown to serve as a global partner and custodian. According to CoinGecko, RLUSD currenty has a market cap of around $530 million.

2025-07-22T09:00:00,"Ethereum Rally Makes Eric Trump Look Like a Genius","Trump specifically pointed out a 35% gain since his post and told followers to “embrace volatility.” Despite a steep drop after his endorsement, ETH has recovered and is now up around 12% year-to-date.Overall, Trump family crypto ventures—including $2 billion in BTC holdings by Trump Media and a $220M Bitcoin fund by Eric and Donald Jr.—have reportedly boosted Donald Trump’s fortune by over $620M. Ethereum also drew attention from Andrew Keys of The Ether Machine, who claimed ETH massively outperformed Bitcoin long-term. He also predicted a possible rise to $8,000 by 2026. Eric Trump Claps Back Eric Trump took to social media on Monday to celebrate Ethereum’s strong resurgence above the $3,800 mark. He also responded to critics who mocked his earlier support for the cryptocurrency. His comments were mainly directed at Ted Pillows, a partner at crypto exchange OKX, who ridiculed Trump in April after Ethereum experienced a steep drop in February and March. Quoting Pillows' old post, Eric wrote, “How am I doing now @TedPillows?” and followed up with a confident message to another user , boasting a 35% gain in five months and encouraging them to “embrace volatility.” He also reiterated that smart investors would have bought the dips, just as he advised people to do at the time. Eric Trump’s claim isn’t without merit. ETH was trading around $2,877 on Feb. 4 when Trump publicly backed the asset. On Monday, however, ETH was sitting at $3,732, which is an unrealized gain of approximately 30% for those who followed his lead. On the other hand, it wasn’t a smooth ride. Ethereum plunged by almost 49% in the weeks after his post before recovering. Despite the ups and downs, Ethereum is now up roughly 12% year-to-date. Looking ahead, analyst Gert van Lagen sees more potential for Ethereum. He recently mentioned that ETH’s current market structure closely mirrors that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1980. Based on this comparison, he forecasted a possible climb to $8,000 by early 2026. This could mean that the cryptocurrency may still be in the midst of a long-term bullish trend. The Trump family’s involvement in crypto goes far beyond tweets. Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social platform, recently revealed it holds $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities. Meanwhile, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are listed as founders of American Bitcoin, a company that raised $220 million from institutional investors to buy Bitcoin and mining equipment. TMTG press release All three Trump sons are also co-founders of World Liberty Financial, with President Donald Trump himself serving as co-founder emeritus. Altogether, these crypto-related ventures reportedly boosted Trump’s personal fortune by at least $620 million in just a few months. Ethereum Outshines Bitcoin? Andrew Keys , co-founder and chairman of Ethereum-focused investment firm The Ether Machine, also believes investors would have greatly outperformed Bitcoin holders if they invested in ETH over the past decade. On CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday, Keys initially claimed Ethereum would have made investors 50 times wealthier than Bitcoin but later corrected the figure to 30 times in a follow-up post on X. His firm, The Ether Machine, plans to go public and is set to become the largest institutional Ethereum investment vehicle, launching with more than 400,000 ETH—currently valued at about $1.5 billion. This would surpass the ETH holdings of existing firms like Bitmine and SharpLink. Keys described himself as an “Ethereum guy” and admitted to not owning any Bitcoin. He even compared Bitcoin to a landline and Ethereum to an iPhone, due to his belief in Ethereum's broader utility and innovation. He also argued that Ethereum is the primary beneficiary of the recently passed GENIUS Act, as the majority of stablecoins are deployed on the Ethereum network. He compared Ethereum’s dominance in tokenization to Google’s dominance in web search, as 90% of tokenized assets reside on Ethereum, just as Google handles 90% of internet searches. Despite Keys’ optimism and Ethereum’s impressive returns since its inception, some critics have pointed out that comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin on equal footing overlooks their different launch timelines. Bitcoin began trading in 2010 and gained over 234 million percent from its early days, while Ethereum launched in mid-2015 and has risen by more than 236,000%. Additionally, Ethereum is still down 24% from its all-time high in 2021, while Bitcoin recently hit a new peak in July. ETH’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The Ether Machine is expected to go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Dynamix Corporation. The combined firm will trade on the Nasdaq and plans to provide large-scale institutional exposure to Ethereum. According to BTSE COO Jeff Mei , investors are already rotating heavily into Ethereum, helping to fuel its recent rally.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10080/ethereum-rally-makes-eric-trump-look-like-a-genius,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T08:59:58,"Ether Prints 'Doji' as XRP Teases Double Top at $3.65","This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Ether: Signs of Indecision ETH's Doji candle on Monday signals indecision in the market following a near 90-degree rise from $2,100 to $3,800 in less than four weeks. The pattern has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, establishing Monday's high of $3,859 as the level to beat for the bulls. Note that the $3,800-$4,100 range is where ether topped out in March 2024, May 2024 and December 2024. While prices remain below Monday's high, the focus will be on the bearish shift in intraday indicators and the possibility of a notable price pullback. Price action on the 15-minute candlestick chart indicates a breakdown of the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. The bearish pattern suggests a potential price drop to $3,550. Supporting the interim bear case is the hourly chart, where prices have crossed below the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a bearish shift in momentum. AI's take: Traders should be cautious, watching if ETH can definitively break and hold above this multi-month ceiling ($3,800-$4,100) or if a pullback is imminent from this historically topped-out zone. Resistance: $4,000, $4,109 , $4,382. Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879. XRP: Double top Since Friday, XRP has largely traded within a range, with upside capped above $3.60 and support at around $3.35. The sideways churn resembles a typical temporary bull breather observed after strong rallies. That said, on the hourly chart, it has taken the shape of a double top, a bearish reversal pattern identified by twin peaks separated by a valley (price drop). A move below $3.35 would trigger the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for an extended pullback to $3.00. The Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator has already flipped bearish on the hourly chart, suggesting greater odds of a double top breakdown. On the higher side, a convincing move above $3.65 would signal the continuation of the bull run that has seen prices surge 54% to record highs this month. AI's take: While XRP's broader outlook remains constructive, the current double top and bearish hourly GMMA warrant caution. Resistance: $3.65, $4.00 Support: $3.35, $3.00, $2.65. Bitcoin: Triangular consolidation BTC continues to consolidate in a descending triangle, identified by a downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs since July 14, and another trendline connecting the horizontal support at around $116,000. A move past the upper trendline would signal the end of the bull breather, potentially yielding a rally to record highs above $123,000. Conversely, a downside break would raise the risk of a deeper pullback, with major support seen directly at $111,965, the former record high from May. AI's take: BTC is currently at a high-stakes inflection point, consolidating within a bearish descending triangle, making its immediate future direction highly contingent on a decisive break of key price levels. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000, $115,739, $111,965. Solana: Fades spike above $200 SOL has pulled back to $194 from the five-month high of $204 early today, printing a daily candle with a long upper wick, a sign of sellers looking to reassert themselves. Key momentum indicators, such as the hourly chart MACD, have flipped decisively bearish, suggesting scope for an extended decline toward the former resistance-turned-support level at $185. The broader outlook remains constructive, as prices remain above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and are locked in an ascending channel. AI's take: The pullback from $204 with a long upper wick and bearish hourly MACD signals immediate selling pressure and the potential for a deeper short-term correction towards $185.

It's closely inching toward its nearest resistance level at about 125,000 dollars. Over the past month, Bitcoin has seen a positive climb of over 14%. If this upward trend continues past the first resistance level, it could potentially stretch to the 131,000 dollar mark, which would signify a growth of around 8% from its current top price.
