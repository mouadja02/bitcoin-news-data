2025-07-22T05:55:23,"Crypto-Backed Loans: JPMorgan’s Revolutionary Move Unveiled for Digital Assets","BitcoinWorld Crypto-Backed Loans: JPMorgan’s Revolutionary Move Unveiled for Digital Assets The financial world is abuzz with a groundbreaking development that could reshape how traditional institutions interact with digital assets. Imagine unlocking liquidity from your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings without having to sell them. This exciting prospect is no longer just a distant dream, as one of the world’s largest and most influential banks, JPMorgan Chase, is reportedly considering offering crypto-backed loans to its clients as early as next year. This potential move signifies a monumental shift in mainstream finance’s embrace of cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere curiosity to tangible financial products. What Are Crypto-Backed Loans, and Why Are They a Game-Changer? At its core, a crypto-backed loan allows individuals or institutions to borrow fiat currency (like USD) by using their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral. Unlike selling your crypto, which can trigger capital gains taxes and remove you from potential future price appreciation, a crypto loan enables you to access funds while retaining ownership of your digital assets. This mechanism has been a staple in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for years, but its potential entry into traditional banking through a behemoth like JPMorgan marks a significant maturation of the crypto market. Why is this a game-changer? For years, institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals have grappled with the illiquid nature of their substantial crypto portfolios. While they believe in the long-term value of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, converting them into spendable cash often comes with tax implications and the loss of exposure to market upside. Crypto-backed loans offer an elegant solution, bridging the gap between digital wealth and real-world financial needs. This move by JPMorgan could legitimize crypto as a viable asset class for lending within regulated financial frameworks, attracting even more institutional capital. JPMorgan’s Bold Step: Paving the Way for Institutional Crypto-Backed Loans? According to a report by the Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, JPMorgan Chase is exploring the feasibility of offering loans collateralized by clients’ crypto holdings. This includes major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This consideration is particularly noteworthy given JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s historically skeptical stance on Bitcoin, famously calling it “a fraud” in 2017. However, the bank has steadily evolved its position, recognizing the underlying blockchain technology and the growing institutional demand for digital assets. JPMorgan’s potential foray into crypto-backed loans isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about setting a precedent. As a global financial leader, their involvement could encourage other major banks and financial institutions to follow suit, accelerating the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial services. This institutional validation is crucial for the broader adoption and stability of the crypto market. It signals a move from speculative trading to practical utility, where digital assets can serve as collateral for traditional financial activities, unlocking vast amounts of previously locked-up capital. How Do Crypto-Backed Loans Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics of crypto-backed loans is essential for appreciating their value proposition. While specific terms may vary between providers, the general process involves a few key steps: Collateralization: A borrower pledges their cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) as collateral to secure a loan. This crypto is typically held in a secure, often segregated, account by the lender or a trusted third-party custodian. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: Lenders typically offer loans based on a percentage of the collateral’s value, known as the LTV ratio. For volatile assets like crypto, LTVs are usually lower than traditional loans (e.g., 30-50%) to account for potential price fluctuations. Interest Rates: Borrowers pay interest on the borrowed fiat currency, similar to traditional loans. Rates can vary based on the lender, loan amount, and LTV. Repayment and Collateral Release: Once the loan is repaid, the pledged cryptocurrency is returned to the borrower. Margin Calls and Liquidation: Due to crypto’s volatility, if the value of the collateral drops significantly and the LTV ratio exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the borrower may receive a “margin call,” requiring them to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to do so can lead to the liquidation of the collateral to cover the loan. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Traditional Loan (e.g., Mortgage) Crypto-Backed Loan Collateral Real Estate, Car, etc. Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Asset Ownership Retained (though lien exists) Retained (collateralized) Liquidity Access cash for various needs Access cash without selling crypto Volatility Risk Lower (typically) Higher (significant) Tax Implications Generally none on loan receipt Avoids capital gains from selling crypto Market Impact Less direct impact Directly tied to crypto market fluctuations The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging Crypto-Backed Loans The emergence of crypto-backed loans presents a compelling proposition for crypto holders, but it’s crucial to understand both the advantages and the inherent risks. Benefits: Liquidity Without Selling: This is the primary draw. Holders can access fiat currency for immediate needs (e.g., investments, business expenses, personal liquidity) without liquidating their crypto assets, thus maintaining their long-term exposure to potential price appreciation. Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, borrowing against an asset is not a taxable event, unlike selling it. This can be a significant advantage for those holding highly appreciated crypto assets. Retain Ownership and Upside: Borrowers continue to benefit if the value of their collateralized crypto increases, as they still “own” the underlying assets. Faster Access to Funds: Compared to traditional loans requiring extensive credit checks, crypto loans can often be processed much faster, sometimes within hours or days. Risks: Volatility Risk: This is the most significant risk. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. A sharp drop in the collateral’s value can trigger a margin call, forcing the borrower to add more crypto or face liquidation of their assets to cover the loan. Liquidation Risk: If a borrower cannot meet a margin call, the lender will sell the collateralized crypto to recover the loan amount. This means the borrower loses their crypto at an unfavorable price. Interest Rate Fluctuations: While some loans offer fixed rates, variable rates can increase, making repayment more expensive. Counterparty Risk: When dealing with centralized lenders, there’s a risk associated with the security and solvency of the lending platform or institution holding your collateral. JPMorgan, being a regulated bank, mitigates some of this risk compared to smaller, unregulated platforms. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Widespread Crypto-Backed Loans? While the prospect of major banks offering crypto-backed loans is exciting, several significant hurdles must be overcome before they become truly widespread: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Banks operate under strict regulations, and offering crypto-backed products requires clear guidelines on asset classification, capital requirements, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML)/know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Custody and Security: Safely storing large quantities of diverse cryptocurrencies poses unique challenges. Banks need robust, institutional-grade custody solutions that are secure against hacks and operational errors. Valuation and Volatility Management: Accurately valuing highly volatile assets in real-time and managing the associated risks (e.g., margin call mechanisms, liquidation protocols) requires sophisticated systems and risk management frameworks. Market Education: Both institutional and retail clients need to be educated on the intricacies, benefits, and significant risks associated with crypto-backed loans . Integration with Legacy Systems: Traditional banks operate with complex, often decades-old IT infrastructure. Integrating novel crypto lending solutions seamlessly into these systems is a considerable technical challenge. The Future Landscape: Will Crypto-Backed Loans Become Mainstream? JPMorgan’s exploration into crypto-backed loans signals a pivotal moment for the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. If successful, this move could catalyze a broader trend among traditional financial institutions, leading to increased liquidity in the crypto market and providing sophisticated financial tools for crypto holders. It transforms cryptocurrencies from purely speculative investments into functional assets that can be leveraged within established financial ecosystems. The trajectory suggests that while challenges remain, the demand for such innovative financial products is growing. As regulatory frameworks mature and technological solutions become more robust, it is highly probable that crypto-backed loans will become an increasingly common offering, bridging the gap between the decentralized world of crypto and the established realm of traditional banking. In conclusion, JPMorgan Chase’s reported consideration of offering crypto-backed loans is far more than just a new banking product; it’s a powerful indicator of the growing acceptance and utility of digital assets within the global financial system. This strategic move by a banking giant underscores the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies, transitioning from niche speculative instruments to legitimate, leverageable assets. While the path to widespread adoption involves navigating regulatory complexities and inherent market volatilities, the potential for unlocking significant liquidity and fostering greater institutional participation is immense. This development marks a thrilling chapter in the convergence of traditional finance and the innovative world of crypto, promising a future where digital assets play an even more integral role in our financial lives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto-backed loans?

2025-07-22T05:52:03,"JPMorgan May Start Lending Directly Against BTC, ETH Starting Next Year: Report","JPMorgan Chase is reportedly exploring lending against clients’ Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings starting next year, sources told the Financial Times . However, they cautioned that the plans are subject to change. The move would make JPMorgan one of the largest US banks to endorse crypto into mainstream. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a vocal skeptic of Bitcoin, calling the asset a “fraud.” However, he recently said that stablecoins are “real,” adding that JPMorgan will be involved both in deposit tokens and stablecoins. One source familiar with the matter told the FT that CEO Dimon, who once said he would fire any trader who traded crypto, has isolated some clients who dealt with crypto. Lending against crypto would let users pledge their BTC and ETH holdings to borrow loans. Major US banks’ pivot to crypto-based services follows a bullish crypto regulatory environment under the Trump administration. JPMorgan Already Allows Clients to Borrow Against Crypto ETFs The NYC-headquartered bank said in June that it will allow selected clients to borrow against crypto ETFs , starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. JPMorgan said it has plans to expand access to other funds after the rollout. The change would apply to wealthy clients, marking a shift in how cryptos are factored into credit decisions. However, lending against the actual digital assets would be the next key step. That said, JPMorgan would need to work on resolving the technical aspects of handling crypto seized from customers who failed to repay their loans. CEO Dimon also said that the bank will soon let clients buy Bitcoin , clarifying that it will not custody it. JPMorgan's head, Jamie Dimon, confirmed that the bank will soon let clients buy Bitcoin but not custody it. #JPMorgan #Bitcoin #JamieDimon https://t.co/ZdCOy8Q1ou — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 Big Banks Cheer US GENIUS Act JPMorgan plans to directly lend against cryptos arrive days after the week when crypto won big in America. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law at the White House last Friday, creating a clear stablecoin regulation. “The entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” said Trump, adding that this signing is a massive validation. Large Wall Street banks cheered the signing of the bill, calling the move an easier way for banks to deal with crypto assets. However, JPMorgan has remained cautious, setting realistic predictions on stablecoins. The banking giant forecasted that the stablecoin market will grow to $500 billion by 2028 . The bank doubled down on the trillion-dollar forecasts, calling them “far too optimistic.” “The idea that stablecoins will replace traditional money for everyday use is still far from reality,” the bank noted.

2025-07-22T05:46:18,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs See $131M Net Outflow, Snapping 12-Day Inflow Streak","Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net outflow of $131.35m on July 21, ending a 12-day run of continuous inflows, according to data from SoSoValue . The reversal follows shifting investor sentiment and portfolio rebalancing, while Ethereum spot ETFs logged strong gains, pulling in nearly $297m the same day. The outflow marked a pause in what had been a robust period for Bitcoin funds, which had collectively attracted over $6.6b in net inflows since early July. This sudden shift may reflect profit-taking following Bitcoin’s stabilization in the $98,000 to $117,000 range after recent highs. Institutional investors, particularly those nearing quarter-end rebalancing cycles, could also be moving capital into alternative assets or reducing crypto exposure. Source: SoSoValue Top Bitcoin ETFs See Mixed Flows Despite Strong Trading Volumes Leading Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, posted flat or negative net inflows. IBIT reported zero net inflow despite holding the largest net asset value among peers at $86.16b. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s GBTC recorded notable outflows of $77.46m and $36.75m, respectively. Overall, total net assets across all US Bitcoin spot ETFs now stand at $151.6b, accounting for 6.52% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Trading activity also remained strong, with $4.1b in daily volume on July 21, despite the outflow trend. Ethereum ETFs Extend Inflow Streak, Pulling in Nearly $300M in a Day In contrast, Ethereum spot ETFs continued their upward momentum. For the twelfth straight day, ETH-based funds attracted net inflows, totaling $296.59m. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with $101.98m in new capital, bringing its cumulative inflow to over $8.16b. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $126.93m in daily inflow and a total net asset value of $2.08b. Grayscale’s twin Ethereum funds, ETHE and ETH, posted mixed results, with one recording a modest net outflow while the other gained $54.90m. Other players such as VanEck and Franklin Templeton also contributed to the day’s inflow momentum. Ethereum ETFs now manage a combined $19.6b in net assets, equivalent to 4.32% of Ethereum’s total market cap. Daily trading volumes reached $3.21b across the ETH ETF market. Analysts See Market Rebalancing as Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin in Flows Analysts suggest the contrasting flows highlight diverging investor expectations. Bitcoin’s rally may be losing steam in the near term, while Ethereum is gaining traction after the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts proceed to the final vote . These proposed laws could pave the way for greater integration of Ethereum-based assets in traditional finance. Another factor drawing attention is the inclusion of staked Ether in ETF offerings. These structures allow investors to gain not just price exposure but also yield, making Ethereum products increasingly attractive to institutional portfolios. While Bitcoin’s dip may be temporary, the split in ETF flows shows a broader rebalancing underway in the digital asset space, where Ethereum’s evolving narrative continues to gain momentum.

2025-07-22T05:30:10,"Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profits—But Is the Top Still Far Away?","Bitcoin’s recent price movement reflects a pause in the broader uptrend, with the asset trading at $117,901 following a near 5% weekly decline. While the current downturn may signal a cooling of investor enthusiasm, on-chain indicators suggest the market may still have room to expand before reaching an exhaustion point. Notably, activity among long-term holders and derivatives traders reveals continued interest and potential for price volatility. One of the standout indicators drawing attention is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders (LTH), which has climbed to a new high for 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Climbs, But NVT Indicator Sends a Surprising Signal SOPR Suggests Continued Room for Growth Before Cycle Peaks According to CryptoQuant analyst Gaah, this metric tracks the profitability of coins moved by holders who have kept their Bitcoin for more than 155 days. The latest reading shows that LTHs are beginning to sell at a profit, but the indicator has yet to reach historically critical levels associated with market tops. Gaah emphasized that although LTH SOPR has crossed the mid-range and currently sits slightly above 2.5, it remains well below the 4.0 threshold historically linked with macro tops in previous cycles. This implies that long-term investors are realizing gains, but not to an extent that would suggest market euphoria or widespread distribution. In past bull cycles, SOPR readings above 4.0 marked the onset of significant corrections or cycle tops. The gradual increase in profit-taking could indicate that the market is maturing while maintaining upward potential. Gaah notes that investors should interpret this as part of the natural progression of a bullish phase, though risks of correction still remain. The ongoing accumulation and realization patterns from LTHs provide insight into how confidence and caution can simultaneously exist in market behavior. Derivatives Market Remains Active Amid High Open Interest and Bullish Funding Rates In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain highlighted ongoing activity in the Bitcoin derivatives market as another crucial component of the current market landscape. Open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts, remains elevated near $42 billion. This level, though slightly down from recent peaks, is still near historical highs and reflects strong trader participation. Arab Chain also highlighted the role of funding rates in shaping market sentiment. Currently, rising funding rates suggest dominance by long positions, indicating a bullish market environment. Related Reading: Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High When this sentiment is paired with high open interest, it may point to heightened risk of volatility, especially in an environment where leveraged trades are becoming more frequent.

Despite a slight slowdown in monthly acquisitions compared to previous months, Strategy is still the largest public holder of Bitcoin. Its Bitcoin yield also rose to 20.8% after this latest purchase. Meanwhile, in stark contrast, the UK government is preparing to sell over £5 billion ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to help close a national budget deficit. The crypto was mostly confiscated from a Chinese Ponzi scheme, and is currently the subject of legal disputes involving victims and Chinese authorities. Critics argue the sale is premature and could actually harm the UK’s long-term crypto strategy. Strategy Invests $739 Million in Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy continued its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy by confirming the purchase of 6,220 BTC for $739.8 million last week. The acquisition was disclosed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing , and was made at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This move came as Bitcoin briefly surged past $122,000 on July 14 before pulling back to around $118,000. The purchase increased Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC, acquired at an average price of $71,756, with a total investment now standing at approximately $43.6 billion. As a result of the latest acquisition, Strategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin yield increased to 20.8% , up from 20.2% last week. The company’s Bitcoin yield metric was introduced in August of 2024, and it measures the percentage change in the ratio between its BTC holdings and assumed diluted shares outstanding. The current yield stands just 4.2% short of its 25% target. Strategy’s Bitcoin yield once peaked at 74.3% in 2024. Meanwhile, Strategy’s internal financial activities have also drawn some attention from the crypto community. Senior executive vice president Wei-Ming Shao filed to sell another 10,900 shares of Strategy (MSTR) on July 14, generating roughly $4.9 million. This sale happened after a $25.7 million share offload by the same executive just the previous week. Strategy Bitcoin buys (Source: SaylorTracker ) In terms of accumulation pace, Strategy’s July Bitcoin purchases so far total 10,455 BTC, down from 17,075 in June, 26,695 in May, and 25,370 in April. Despite the slower monthly accumulation rate, the firm is still the largest public holder of Bitcoin. UK Plans to Sell Seized Bitcoin While Strategy is showing no signs of slowing down its Bitcoin accumulation mission, the United Kingdom is reportedly preparing to sell more than £5 billion ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to address its budget deficit, according to The Telegraph . The effort is being coordinated by the Home Office and Treasury Chief Rachel Reeves, in collaboration with law enforcement. While UK police typically handle crypto sales, the Treasury’s involvement is likely due to the scale of the holdings and their potential impact on national finances as Bitcoin’s value recently surged. The government is developing a secure system to store the crypto ahead of the proposed liquidation. Among the seized assets is at least 61,000 Bitcoin—which is currently worth around $7.1 billion—originally confiscated from a Chinese Ponzi scheme in 2018. The stash came to light after Jian Wen , a hospitality worker, tried to launder funds from the scheme by purchasing luxury property. She was later convicted of money laundering and sentenced to over six years in prison in May of 2024. However, the sale of the Bitcoin is legally contested , as Chinese authorities and victims of the scheme demand its return. Susie Violet Ward, CEO of Bitcoin Policy UK, criticized the idea of a sale as premature, especially due to the ongoing legal disputes. The Crown Prosecution Service asked the High Court for permission to retain the assets, which would allow the proceeds to be distributed under the Proceeds of Crime Act—potentially compensating victims and funding police agencies involved in the case. Photo of the property that Wen tried to purchase Freddie New , head of policy at Bitcoin Policy UK, pointed out that victims originally lost yuan rather than Bitcoin, which complicates efforts to return the assets. He explained that any sale would be subject to court-ordered compensation, and the remaining proceeds would potentially go to the Treasury and other recovery bodies. Earlier this year, the UK government also issued a £40 million tender for a crypto asset management framework, but it was later canceled due to inadequate bids. Despite legal and diplomatic complexities, the UK government seems very eager to liquidate its holdings. Critics argue the move is shortsighted. Jordan Walker of the Bitcoin Collective urged the government not to sell the Bitcoin, and warned that it could damage the UK’s long-term economic positioning. Bitcoin Policy UK also appealed to lawmakers in July of 2024 to consider amending laws to allow the country to keep valuable digital assets, though the request was reportedly ignored.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10079/strategy-buys-6220-more-bitcoin-but-july-buys-slow,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Luna accuses Powell of making false statements to Congress on two separate occasions. According to a criminal complaint obtained by Fox News Digital, Florida Rep. Luna accuses Powell of making “false statements” in her sworn testimony. The charges relate to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on June 25, 2025. Luna stated that Powell “hid lavish details” and misrepresented the state of maintenance in his testimony regarding the renovation of the Eccles Building, the Fed's headquarters. He also alleged that Powell attributed the project's cost increase from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion to “minor changes,” a claim Congressional documents have denied. According to the criminal complaint, the project includes luxury features such as a VIP dining room, premium marble finishes, modern elevators, water features, and a rooftop garden. Luna argues that Powell misrepresented the existence of these features.

2025-07-22T05:14:37,"“Sell Ethereum, Buy Bitcoin” Peter Schiff Says","The post “Sell Ethereum, Buy Bitcoin” Peter Schiff Says appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency , has been gaining ground lately, trading close to $3,800, its highest level in months. But well-known gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff believes this is the perfect time for holders to exit. In his latest post on X, Schiff suggested that Ethereum is nearing the top of its trading range and that it might be better to sell it now and use the funds to buy Bitcoin instead. Even though Schiff isn’t a fan of either crypto, he sees Bitcoin as the stronger option for the moment. Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 Ethereum Price Rally Draws Mixed Reactions The rise in Ethereum’s price is partly due to growing demand from institutions and excitement around Ethereum spot ETFs . In recent weeks, several companies, including BitMine and SharpLink, have added substantial amounts of ETH to their reserves, with some also staking it to earn rewards. Meanwhile, ETH received a major boost during the crypto week, and the passage of three major crypto bills created a strong foundation for the ETH rally. It's not as far as I'm concerned. I'm just looking at the charts. But I think based on the way the tokens are hyped, Ether has more acknowledged competition for the narrative of its use case. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 However, Schiff’s warning has stirred debate among analysts and investors. Many are questioning whether Ethereum’s rally has gone too far too fast. Schiff pointed out that ETH has struggled to outperform Bitcoin lately and that the recent gains may not be sustainable. He said the smarter trade right now could be switching to Bitcoin, especially if Ethereum hits resistance again. Market Pushback on Schiff’s View Schiff’s comment sparked reactions across the crypto space. Some argued that Ethereum’s long-term use cases, such as smart contracts and staking, still give it strong upside potential. SharpLink Gaming even responded directly, saying they plan to stake their ETH rather than sell it. Analyst Benjamin Cowen also suggested that the ETH to BTC price ratio had already bottomed before Schiff made his call, meaning the timing might not be ideal. You had 4 years to say that ETH/BTC would bleed and you finally say it after the bleeding is over. pic.twitter.com/DQQ5HJaidu — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) July 21, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Seven Altcoins To Buy Now For Big Gains , People on X even mocked him for giving the same advice for Bitcoin previously.

Cringe pic.twitter.com/NvZb7mYt3V — WIZZ ( beware scammers ) (@CryptoWizardd) July 21, 2025 What investors should watch Right now, Ethereum is showing strong momentum , but Schiff’s warning is a reminder that price swings can come fast. Traders should watch whether ETH continues to push higher or if resistance near current levels sends it lower. If momentum slows, Schiff’s idea of rotating into Bitcoin could gain more support. Either way, the market is clearly at a key turning point, and how Ethereum performs next will likely set the tone for altcoins in the coming weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of July 22, 2025, Ethereum is trading around $3,700 to $3,800, testing resistance in the $3,877 to $3,987 range. It has shown a slight daily decline in some reports but has seen significant weekly gains. Is Ethereum a good investment? As the altcoin season begins, the short-term gains make Ethereum a lucrative buying option. However, the long-term promises of this programmable blockchain make it a viable long-term crypto investment. What should crypto investors watch next for Ethereum? Investors should watch if ETH breaks resistance or pulls back; this will likely set the tone for altcoins in the coming weeks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sell-ethereum-buy-bitcoin-peter-schiff-says/,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

With the bullish crypto regulatory environment under the Trump administration, JPMorgan may launch these crypto‑backed loans as soon as next year, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Traditionally cautious, JPMorgan already allows clients to borrow against crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This next phase would deepen its commitment to digital assets, marking a shift under CEO Jamie Dimon’s leadership — who infamously labeled bitcoin a “fraud” eight years ago Last week, Jamie Dimon said that the bank plans to get more involved in stablecoins, even as he questioned their practical utility compared to traditional payments. CoinDesk was not available to contact JPMorgan for comment.
