2025-07-22T11:58:58,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 22, 2025","With a drop of 4.6% over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dipped below the recently conquered $4 trillion, now standing at $3.99 trillion. Overall, the market is down today, with the large majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization decreasing. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $269 billion, still maintaining similar levels to those seen over the past week. TLDR: Crypto market cap dipped below $4 trillion; Majority of top 100 coins are red; BTC and ETH are down today, trading at $117,854 and $3,692; ETH outperforms BTC in weekly increases: 20% vs 1%; Solana is the only green coin among the top 10 per market cap; Market sentiment remains in the greed zone; US BTC spot ETFs broke a green streak with $131 million in outflows; US ETH spot ETFs continue positive flows with 12 straight days of inflows; We are in the 5th and final wave of the bull market; There seems to be “genuine institutional adoption,” and “not speculative fever”. Crypto Winners & Losers Over the past 24 hours, at the time of writing, only one of the top 10 coins per market cap is green. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.2% in this period to the price of $117,854. While it decreased below $118,000, it’s holding firmly above $117,500. Also, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 2.7%, currently trading at $3,692. The price is still on track towards the $4,000 mark. The highest drop is 3.2% by Dogecoin (DOGE) . It’s now trading at $0.2647. The only green coin on this list is Solana (SOL) . It appreciated 5.1%, currently changing hands at $198.97. In the top 100 coins category, Kaspa (KAS) is the highest gainer. It’s up 9.8% to the price of $0.1153. Jupiter (JUP) follows with an increase of 8.6%, now trading at $0.6531. Most coins, however, recorded price decreases today. Pump.fun (PUMP) saw a double-digit drop of 13.1% to $0.003751. SPX6900 (SPX) follows, with a 6.7% fall to the price of $1.84. The capital flowing out of Bitcoin ETFs, as discussed below, could suggest lowered institutional appetite, though likely a short-term one. This appetite is likely dampened by concerns around global tariffs and trade tensions, particularly as the 1 August deadline approaches when the US may slap massive tariffs on its trade partners, push the deadline, or change its mind again. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase is reportedly looking into l ending against clients’ Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings starting next year. Lending against crypto would let users pledge their BTC and ETH holdings to borrow loans. JPMorgan's head, Jamie Dimon, confirmed that the bank will soon let clients buy Bitcoin but not custody it. #JPMorgan #Bitcoin #JamieDimon https://t.co/ZdCOy8Q1ou — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 ‘Bull Market Will End by 2026 with BTC at $140,000’ John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn , recently commented that price action continued to support the wave count he discussed for the last few years. We are in the 5 th and final wave of the bull market, as the chart below shows. It should complete towards the end of 2025 or early 2026, at a BTC price of some $136,000 to $140,000, he said. “So while people will be worried about where the bear market will take us in 2026, my view is that this is not something to worry about today, as there is still additional upside to BTC prices in this bull market! Stay focused on participating in and enjoying the ride higher until the end of the year.” However, he warns that if BTC trades below $112,000 in the short term, we could see another test of $100,000 before the next move up. “But this is a low probability outcome in my view,” Glover argues. Source: Ledn Moreover, Werner Brönnimann, Investment Manager at crypto bank AMINA , commented that Bitcoin’s recent push to over $123,000 and breaching $4 trillion market cap appears to represent a fundamental shift in market dynamics. This shift is driven primarily by institutional capital, not “the retail-led manias of previous cycles.” Now, there seems to be “genuine institutional adoption,” and “not speculative fever.” Moreover, we’re seeing sustained inflows from pension funds and corporate treasuries, not social media-driven FOMO (fear of missing out), Brönnimann says. Still, “despite Bitcoin’s remarkable performance, the market is not officially in ‘Altcoin Season’ yet,” he adds. That said, the macro environment could still challenge BTC’s trajectory regardless of institutional adoption, says Brönnimann. Regulatory clarity supports institutional inflows, but BTC remains sensitive to monetary policy shifts. “Aggressive [US Federal Reserve] tightening in response to tariff-driven inflation could override even strong institutional demand.” Therefore, “this dynamic underscores Bitcoin’s evolution as institutional money continues to flow into the asset class: it is no longer an alternative asset with its purely idiosyncratic return drivers, but to an extent behaves like a risk-on asset,” Brönnimann concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $117,854. The coin began a decline $119,523, reaching the lowest point today of $116,787. It then resumed a climb to the current level. The price is up 1.1% over the past seven days. Investors are watching for BTC to retake the $118,000 level first, before proceeding to $118,900 and $119,500. However, it may still also drop to $116,000 and into the $115,000 zone after that. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,692. It’s currently slightly above its intraday low of $3,679. Its highest peak over the past day was $3,848. Notably, the coin is up 24.4% over the week. Market participants are waiting to see if the price will move above $3,900, potentially signaling a future surge towards $4,000. Otherwise, it may revisit the low $3,600s, followed by a dip into the $3,590 territory. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment remains within greed territory, but it has dropped slightly over the past three days. The Fear and Greed Index decreased from 71 on Friday to 68 today . This number still signals a positive outlook on the market and incoming developments. There are currently no indications of the market being overbought. That said, a correction is possible. Meanwhile, on 21 July, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded outflows, breaking a 12-day streak. It saw $131.35 million in outflows. The amounts have been declining over the past three days. BlackRock recorded no flows on Monday, there were no inflows, and the larger outflow is Ark&21Shares’ $77.46 million. On the other hand, US ETH ETFs saw positive flows for the twelfth day in a row. It recorded inflows of $296.59 million on Monday. Fidelity is the highest gainer, with $126.93 million in inflows. BlackRock follows with $101.98 million. 21Shares saw outflows of $374,050. Meanwhile, Western Union showed strong interest in utilizing stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations. CEO Devin McGranahan argued that stablecoins could streamline cross-border transfers, improve currency conversion in underserved markets, and provide financial tools for populations dealing with unstable local currencies. “We see stablecoins really as an opportunity, not as a threat,” McGranahan said.

The number of shares and price range are not yet disclosed. Also, the move follows an increase in regulatory clarity and institutional inflows. In South Korea, prosecutors are investigating a possible connection between the former First Lady Kim Keon-Hee and a crypto market maker suspected of manipulating the prices of low-cap altcoins. A special counsel team investigating allegations involving former first lady Kim Keon Hee is set to summon her and former President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning. https://t.co/wF8WuStt3p — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) July 21, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? While the crypto market is mostly down over the past 24 hours, the stock market closed with a mixed performance on Monday. The S&P 500 is up by 0.14%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by 0.0.043%. Market participants are now anticipating further tariff-related developments. Notably, the news will arrive soon on trade deals, as the 1 August deadline approaches when the US said it would impose massive tariffs on its trade partners. Is this dip sustainable? This appears to be a typical pullback. Overall, the rally is expected to continue, with BTC and ETH expected to rise further this year.

2025-07-22T11:56:30,"Bitcoin Dominance Falls—Altseason Takeover or Quiet Before $140K BTC Surge?","Bitcoin’s share in the cryptocurrency market is declining, sparking curiosity and debate. Is a surge in alternative coins on the horizon, signaling a new market leader? Or is this a temporary dip before Bitcoin climbs to an unprecedented $140,000? The shifting dynamics are drawing attention, leaving many eager to see what unfolds next.

Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Coin Reshaping Our Money World Bitcoin, or BTC, is the first of its kind—a digital currency that lets you send money directly to others without a bank. Think of it as electronic cash that works over the internet. It was created by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto to make transactions simple and free from control by any single authority. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin operates on a shared record called the blockchain. This means every transaction is tracked across many computers, keeping it secure and open. People known as miners help verify these transactions by solving puzzles, earning new bitcoins as a reward. There’s a limit of 21 million bitcoins, making each one special. Today, Bitcoin stands out in the financial world. Every four years or so, the rewards for miners are cut in half in an event called a “halving.” This slows down how quickly new bitcoins are made, which can make existing ones more valuable. While new cryptocurrencies pop up all the time, Bitcoin remains the most famous and trusted. Its limited supply and growing use by businesses make it an attractive choice in the current market. With more people and companies embracing it, Bitcoin’s future looks bright in the ever-changing landscape of digital money. Ethereum’s Next Leap: Scaling Up for a Decentralized Future Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has been a game-changer in the blockchain world. As a pioneering Proof-of-Stake blockchain, it introduced smart contracts that power a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). From decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum’s versatility is unmatched. The network’s transition to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant evolution, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for increased scalability. Upcoming innovations like sharding aim to boost transaction speeds and lower costs, while Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon enhance efficiency. Ether (ETH) remains the heartbeat of this ecosystem, essential for transactions and rewarding those who help secure the network. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a standout among cryptocurrencies. Price predictions suggest that ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year, reflecting optimism based on historical trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s robust technology and active development community give it a competitive edge. Market trends indicate a growing interest in platforms that offer scalability and real-world applications, areas where Ethereum excels. Its commitment to decentralization and continuous improvement positions it attractively for those watching the crypto space evolve. Solana’s SOL: The Lightning-Fast Coin Transforming Cryptocurrency Solana is a rising star in the blockchain world that’s turning heads. Unlike some of its competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana focuses on speed and simplicity. It’s a platform where developers can build decentralized apps, known as dapps. What sets Solana apart is its clever design, which allows for super-fast transactions. Developers can use different programming languages, making it flexible and user-friendly. At the heart of Solana is its coin, SOL. This isn’t just any coin—it’s the fuel that powers the entire Solana ecosystem. SOL helps run programs, moves transactions along, and rewards those who support the network. In today’s market, SOL looks attractive because Solana doesn’t rely on splitting up the network or adding extra layers to handle more users. This means it’s ready to host big projects that need to handle lots of activity. With the growing demand for fast and scalable platforms, SOL stands out as a promising option in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ETH, and SOL are strong, but $XYZ unites sports fans in a meme coin with huge growth potential, aiming for 20,000% gains and becoming a cultural icon.

2025-07-22T11:55:19,"Bitcoin’s Phenomenal Rise: What Does $119,000 Mean for the Market?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Phenomenal Rise: What Does $119,000 Mean for the Market? The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, recently achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring past the $119,000 mark. This significant leap in the Bitcoin price has captured global attention, prompting investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike to ponder its implications for the broader market. What exactly does this monumental achievement signify, and what factors are propelling Bitcoin to such unprecedented heights? Understanding the Bitcoin Price Milestone: A Closer Look at $119,000 According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market, BTC has indeed risen above $119,000, specifically trading at $119,020 on the Binance USDT market. This isn’t just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical level for many in the crypto space. While Bitcoin has seen numerous rallies and corrections throughout its history, each new peak or sustained high value ignites fresh discussions about its intrinsic value, adoption rates, and future potential. Such a robust movement in the Bitcoin price often signals strong market confidence and a confluence of bullish factors. It reflects a growing belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and an increasingly accepted digital asset in the global financial landscape. For many, reaching this level is a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and its evolving narrative from a niche digital experiment to a serious contender in the world of finance. What’s Fueling This Bitcoin Price Ascent? Key Drivers Behind the Rally Several intertwined factors contribute to Bitcoin’s impressive upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the dynamics of the current Bitcoin price rally. Institutional Adoption: One of the most significant catalysts is the increasing embrace by institutional investors. Major corporations, investment funds, and even some sovereign entities are now allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets. This institutional validation not only brings substantial capital into the market but also lends an air of legitimacy and stability, attracting more mainstream attention. The launch of new financial products, such as spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, has opened doors for a wider range of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, further boosting demand and influencing the Bitcoin price . Supply Dynamics (Halving Event): Bitcoin’s supply is finite, capped at 21 million coins. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, a process known as the ‘halving.’ This reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation, effectively creating a supply shock if demand remains constant or increases. Historical data often shows a significant Bitcoin price rally in the months following a halving event, as scarcity plays a crucial role. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions also play a vital role. When traditional markets face uncertainty, inflation concerns rise, or fiat currencies experience instability, investors often look for alternative assets to preserve wealth. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and perceived inflation-hedging properties, becomes an attractive option, driving up its demand and consequently the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., Lightning Network) and security, enhances its utility and attractiveness. A growing number of users, transactions, and developers building on the network signal a healthy and expanding ecosystem, which positively reinforces the Bitcoin price . Growing Retail Interest: While institutional money is powerful, the collective buying power and enthusiasm of retail investors remain a significant force. Increased media coverage, social media trends, and word-of-mouth generate broader public interest, leading to more individuals entering the market and contributing to the upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . The Ripple Effect: How the Bitcoin Price Impacts the Wider Crypto Ecosystem When Bitcoin makes significant moves, the entire cryptocurrency market tends to feel the tremors. Bitcoin’s dominance often dictates the overall market sentiment, and its price action frequently serves as a leading indicator for altcoins. Altcoin Performance: A strong Bitcoin price rally often precedes or accompanies a surge in altcoin prices. This phenomenon, sometimes called ‘altcoin season,’ occurs as profits from Bitcoin are rotated into other promising digital assets, or as newfound confidence in the overall crypto market encourages investment across the board. Market Sentiment: Bitcoin’s performance profoundly impacts investor psychology. A rising Bitcoin price fosters optimism, reduces fear, and encourages further investment, creating a positive feedback loop. Conversely, a sharp decline can trigger widespread panic. Increased Visibility and Innovation: A surging Bitcoin price draws mainstream media attention, which in turn brings more users, developers, and entrepreneurs into the crypto space. This influx of talent and capital can accelerate innovation across various blockchain applications, from DeFi (Decentralized Finance) to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and beyond. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Risks Amidst the Bitcoin Price Surge While the recent surge in Bitcoin price is cause for celebration for many, it’s crucial to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Volatility remains a defining characteristic of cryptocurrencies, and significant rallies can often be followed by sharp corrections. Investors must be aware of potential risks such as regulatory uncertainty, which can lead to sudden market shifts. Security concerns, including hacking and phishing attempts, also remain pertinent, emphasizing the need for robust security practices for digital assets. Furthermore, the market is susceptible to large liquidations and ‘whale’ movements that can trigger significant price swings. Emotional investing, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) or panic selling, can lead to poor decisions. Understanding these challenges is key to responsible participation in the crypto market. Strategic Insights for Investors: Capitalizing on the Bitcoin Price Momentum For those looking to engage with the market amidst this exciting period, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Understand the technology, its use cases, and the underlying fundamentals. Risk Management is Key: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider diversifying your portfolio across different assets, not just cryptocurrencies. Implement strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term gains can be tempting, many successful crypto investors adopt a long-term view. Bitcoin’s history shows significant growth over extended periods, despite short-term fluctuations. Stay Informed: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Keep up-to-date with news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World market monitoring can provide valuable insights. Secure Your Assets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings to protect your investments from cyber threats. A Look Back and Forward: Bitcoin’s Journey and Future Bitcoin Price Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey from a niche concept to a global financial phenomenon has been nothing short of extraordinary. Born out of the 2008 financial crisis, it offered a decentralized alternative to traditional finance. Its early days saw it trading for mere pennies, and its path has been marked by extreme volatility, dramatic crashes, and equally dramatic recoveries. Looking ahead, the future Bitcoin price trajectory remains a subject of intense debate. While some foresee continued exponential growth driven by increasing adoption and diminishing supply, others caution about potential regulatory crackdowns or emerging technological rivals. However, the current momentum suggests that Bitcoin is cementing its position as a significant asset class, and its influence on the global financial system is only set to grow. The $119,000 mark is not an endpoint but rather another significant waypoint on Bitcoin’s remarkable journey. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Innovation The recent surge of Bitcoin price above $119,000 is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and the profound impact of both institutional and retail interest. While the journey of Bitcoin is often characterized by its volatility, its resilience and ability to consistently break new ground speak volumes about its potential. As we navigate this exciting era, staying informed, exercising caution, and understanding the underlying drivers will be paramount for anyone participating in this digital revolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitcoin (BTC)? A1: Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Q2: What factors primarily influence Bitcoin’s price? A2: Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a combination of supply and demand dynamics, including institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors (like inflation or interest rates), regulatory news, technological developments within the network, halving events that reduce new supply, and overall market sentiment from both retail and institutional investors. Q3: Is investing in Bitcoin a good idea right now given the recent surge? A3: Investing in Bitcoin, especially after a significant surge, carries both opportunities and risks due to its inherent volatility. While the recent rise shows strong market confidence, potential investors should conduct thorough research, understand their risk tolerance, and consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term speculation.

2025-07-22T11:48:51,"We Asked 4 AIs What Ripple’s (XRP) Peak Price Will Be in This Bull Cycle: the Answers Will Surprise You","TL;DR Ripple’s cross-border token already charted a new all-time high this cycle and stands close below it now. The XRP Army continues to be highly bullish on the asset, with massive double-digit price predictions. As such, we decided to ask the four most popular AI solutions (ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, and Gemini) about their take on its peak this cycle. Peak Goals Building on our ‘We Asked…’ collection of crypto-oriented questions, more on which you can read here and here , this time, we wanted to know what the AIs think about XRP’s potential this cycle. After all, it already did what many thought was impossible and broke its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4 last week by surging past $3.6 to set a new one. The AIs in question provided a few types of answers when it came down to price predictions, ranging from “realistic” to “aggressive/far-fetched.” Perplexity, for example, noted that the majority of crypto analysts on X believe the asset will peak somewhere between $5 and $10. Basing its projections on technical analysis, the chatbot mostly reaffirmed its target, setting it at $6 to $8 or even $10 under more favorable conditions. Gemini’s moderate/conservative estimates envision a top of $6, while the so-called “bullish but achievable targets” are similar to those of Perplexity. “Bullish but Achievable Targets: A common range for a strong bull run is $7-$10. This is often cited by analysts who believe in significant institutional adoption and a favorable regulatory environment. Some predictions suggest XRP could reach $7.5-$8.2 by August 2025, and $9.0-$9.8 by September 2025, potentially hitting $18-$20 by December 2025.” Grok and ChatGPT were less bullish on XRP’s potential this cycle, outlining $5.50 ot $7 as the “moderate” scenarios. When it came down to the aggressive approach, both said the asset could surpass $10 and aim at $15. Factors That Can Drive XRP This High Although their price ranges may vary slightly, the four AI solutions were essentially in agreement about the potential factors that could drive XRP to these heights. For example, they all believe a spot Ripple ETF will help the underlying asset thrive, similar to BTC and ETH as of late. The chances for such a financial product to see the green light by the end of the year are pretty high, with both experts and Polymarket displaying them at roughly 90%. The AIs also noted that massive capital rotation from Bitcoin to alts will help XRP, which is the second-largest altcoin, gain further traction. Additionally, they outlined corporate/central bank settlement pilots using the XRP Ledger as well as the ISO 20022 update, which is believed to help Ripple’s token. Nevertheless, the AIs highlighted the market’s volatile nature and warned that these numbers are merely predictions. “It’s crucial to remember that these are predictions and not guarantees. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can change rapidly. Always conduct your own research and consider the inherent risks before making any investment decisions.” The post We Asked 4 AIs What Ripple’s (XRP) Peak Price Will Be in This Bull Cycle: the Answers Will Surprise You appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-4-ais-what-ripples-xrp-peak-price-will-be-in-this-bull-cycle-the-answers-will-surprise-you/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN","Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price",cryptocompare

Block announced last week that effective July 23rd, the firm will be part of the top index, which tracks the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. The tech billionaire’s firm was previously known as Square and is recognized for payment services like Cash App, and also launched a self-custody BTC wallet called Bitkey. Additionally, Block owns the 12th-largest public corporate Bitcoin treasury in the world, holding 8,584 BTC worth around $1.01 billion at time of writing. The firm is sitting on a 286% unrealized profit on its BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . In April, Block settled with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) amid alleged compliance issues with its Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) program. NYDFS says Block committed lapses with how it operated Cash App, the firm’s peer-to-peer money transmission service that began offering BTC transactions back in 2018. The regulator alleged Block failed to complete adequate customer due diligence and implement controls to prevent anti-money laundering and other illicit activities. NYDFS also claimed the company did not promptly address severe transaction alert backlogs, largely due to rapid growth between 2019 and 2020. The regulator alleged Block’s lax treatment of high-risk Bitcoin transactions enabled anonymous transactions to push through without proper scrutiny.

2025-07-22T11:43:04,"Bitcoin Holdings: Genius Group’s Ambitious Leap Towards 10,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holdings: Genius Group’s Ambitious Leap Towards 10,000 BTC In an era where digital assets are reshaping traditional finance, an exciting trend is emerging: established companies embracing cryptocurrencies. But what if an AI-driven education company not only embraced it but set an incredibly ambitious target? This is precisely what Genius Group, a pioneer in AI-driven education, has done by significantly expanding its Bitcoin holdings , signaling a profound commitment to the future of digital finance and blockchain technology. Understanding Genius Group’s Bold Move in Bitcoin Holdings Imagine a company not just dipping its toes but diving headfirst into the world of cryptocurrency. That’s Genius Group for you. In July, this innovative AI-driven education company made headlines by doubling its Bitcoin holdings to a substantial 200 BTC. This wasn’t just a casual purchase; it was a strategic move, acquiring 20 BTC at a discount, as reported by Cointelegraph. What makes this particularly fascinating is their audacious long-term vision: to accumulate a staggering 10,000 BTC within the next two years. This commitment to increasing their Bitcoin holdings is more than just an investment; it’s a statement. It positions Genius Group as a forward-thinking entity that recognizes the transformative potential of digital assets. For an education company, integrating such a significant financial strategy with their core business is a testament to their belief in the future convergence of technology, finance, and learning. To put their current and target Bitcoin holdings into perspective, consider the following: Metric Current (July 2023) Ambitious Target (Next 2 Years) Bitcoin Holdings (BTC) 200 BTC 10,000 BTC Growth Factor Doubled from previous 50x increase from current Acquisition Strategy Discounted purchases Aggressive accumulation Beyond Accumulation: Genius Group’s Broader Crypto Strategy and Bitcoin Holdings Genius Group’s ambition extends far beyond merely accumulating Bitcoin holdings . Their strategy is multi-faceted, aiming to weave blockchain and cryptocurrency into the very fabric of their educational ecosystem. This holistic approach suggests a long-term commitment to the digital economy, not just as an investor, but as an active participant and innovator. Expanding Blockchain Education Initiatives: As an education company, it’s only natural for Genius Group to lead by example. They are actively developing and expanding educational programs focused on blockchain technology. This means equipping students and professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a decentralized future, understanding everything from crypto fundamentals to advanced blockchain applications. Developing Tokenized Rewards: Imagine being rewarded for your learning achievements with digital tokens! Genius Group is exploring tokenized reward systems, which could revolutionize how students are incentivized and recognized. This innovative approach could foster greater engagement and create a tangible value for educational milestones within their ecosystem. Introducing Stablecoins: The development of stablecoins within their framework suggests an aim to provide a more predictable and less volatile digital currency for transactions within their platform. Stablecoins, pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar, can offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the dramatic price swings often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Pursuing U.S. Licenses under the GENIUS Act: A critical component of their strategy is navigating the regulatory landscape. By actively pursuing U.S. licenses under what they refer to as the ‘GENIUS Act,’ the company demonstrates a commitment to operating within established legal frameworks. This step is crucial for building trust, ensuring compliance, and facilitating broader adoption of their crypto initiatives. Why Are Companies Like Genius Group Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings? The decision by companies to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings isn’t made lightly. It reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties and its potential role in a diversified corporate treasury strategy. So, what are the compelling reasons behind such a bold move? Inflation Hedge: In an environment of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its finite supply makes it a scarce asset, often compared to digital gold. Store of Value: Over its history, Bitcoin has demonstrated its ability to act as a robust store of value, especially over longer time horizons. Companies see it as a way to preserve and potentially grow their capital outside of traditional financial instruments. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin and blockchain technology signals a company’s commitment to innovation. It helps them stay relevant in a rapidly evolving digital landscape and can attract talent interested in cutting-edge technologies. Strategic Alignment: For a company like Genius Group, which operates in AI and education, adopting blockchain and crypto aligns perfectly with their mission to prepare individuals for the future economy. Their Bitcoin holdings become a tangible representation of their forward-looking philosophy. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Traditional corporate treasuries are often heavily weighted in cash or short-term fixed-income instruments. Adding Bitcoin provides a new asset class for diversification, potentially enhancing overall portfolio returns and reducing concentration risk. Navigating the Challenges of Significant Bitcoin Holdings While the opportunities presented by substantial Bitcoin holdings are appealing, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. Companies venturing into this space must be prepared for volatility and complexity. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. While this can present opportunities for growth, it also carries significant risk. A sudden downturn could impact a company’s balance sheet and investor confidence. Genius Group’s strategy of discounted purchases might mitigate some of this risk, but it doesn’t eliminate it entirely. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in legislation, tax laws, or classification of digital assets could impact the viability and profitability of significant Bitcoin holdings . Pursuing U.S. licenses, as Genius Group is doing, is a proactive step to address this, but it remains a dynamic area. Security and Custody: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Secure storage solutions, often involving cold wallets and multi-signature protocols, are essential. Companies must invest in sophisticated cybersecurity infrastructure and expertise. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating cryptocurrency assets into traditional accounting frameworks can be complex. Different jurisdictions have varying rules on how digital assets should be valued, reported, and taxed, adding layers of administrative burden. What Can We Learn from Genius Group’s Bitcoin Holdings Strategy? Genius Group’s bold approach offers valuable insights for both businesses and individuals contemplating their own engagement with the crypto space. Their strategy provides a blueprint for how companies can not only invest in digital assets but also integrate them into their core operations. For Businesses Considering Crypto Adoption: Start with a Clear Vision: Genius Group isn’t just buying Bitcoin; they have a clear goal (10,000 BTC) and a broader strategy involving education, tokenization, and stablecoins. A well-defined strategy is paramount. Understand the Risks: Acknowledge and plan for volatility, regulatory changes, and security challenges. Risk management should be central to any crypto strategy. Explore Integration Beyond Treasury: Consider how blockchain technology and digital assets can enhance your core products or services, as Genius Group is doing with education and rewards. Prioritize Compliance: Actively engage with regulatory bodies and seek necessary licenses to ensure your operations are legal and transparent. For Individuals Interested in the Future of Finance and Education: Educate Yourself: Genius Group’s emphasis on blockchain education highlights the growing importance of understanding this technology. Invest time in learning about cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and their applications. Look for Innovation: Keep an eye on companies that are actively integrating emerging technologies into their business models. These companies are often at the forefront of future trends. Consider Long-Term Potential: While short-term volatility exists, the long-term potential of digital assets and blockchain technology continues to attract significant investment and development. A Genius Move for the Digital Age? Genius Group’s decision to aggressively expand its Bitcoin holdings and integrate blockchain technology into its core educational offerings is a powerful indicator of the growing mainstream acceptance and strategic importance of cryptocurrencies. By aiming for 10,000 BTC and simultaneously building out a comprehensive crypto ecosystem, they are not just investing in a digital asset; they are investing in a future where education, finance, and technology are inextricably linked. This move sets a precedent for other companies, demonstrating that strategic investment in digital assets can go hand-in-hand with innovation in core business areas. While the path to 10,000 BTC will undoubtedly have its challenges, Genius Group’s bold vision positions them as a key player to watch in both the education and crypto sectors. Their journey underscores the dynamic evolution of corporate strategy in the digital age, where visionary leadership can redefine an industry’s boundaries.

More importantly, it aligns with their mission as an AI-driven education company to be at the forefront of future technologies, preparing their students for a world increasingly shaped by blockchain and digital assets. Q5: What are the main risks associated with Genius Group’s large Bitcoin holdings?

ADA Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Cardano price prediction for 2025 is generating significant buzz in the crypto market, particularly as we have entered Q3 2025 with July. The transformative Plomin Hard Fork, implemented in Q1, has played a crucial role in this momentum, especially with the announcement of full decentralized governance. This landmark upgrade has reinforced Cardano’s commitment to community-driven innovation, leading to a strengthening of its internal ecosystem. Even bigger institutions like Grayscale have been applauding the project’s vision and gave 1/5th allocation in its fund. Industry leaders like IOHK and EMURGO are also actively advancing the Cardano ecosystem. EMURGO’s partnership with Ctrl Wallet on July 2, 2025, has enhanced Cardano’s interoperability, enabling connections to over 2,300 blockchains. Moreover, community-driven initiatives focusing on scalability, privacy through the Midnight chain, and integration with Bitcoin DeFi are paving the way for substantial growth. Additionally, Bloomberg analysts have raised odds of potential spot ADA ETF approvals , and strong technical indicators signaling positive trends, investor enthusiasm is at an all-time high. Questions abound: “Will Cardano spearhead the altcoin movement?” and “What heights can ADA reach by 2050?” Explore this Cardano price prediction for 2025 and beyond, filled with expert insights and ambitious forecasts. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) is predicted to reach a potential high of $2.05 in 2025 , driven by hopes of ETF approval, full decentralization after the Plomin Hard Fork, and increasing institutional interest. However, if ADA fails to hold above key support, it may range between $0.85 and $1.25 . Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.87804608 -3.43% Market Cap $ 31,081,507,034.5384 Trading Volume $ 2,558,031,990.7208 Circulating Supply 35,398,491,999.0914 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 After months of stagnation in the first half of 2025, the Cardano price finally snapped out of its downtrend. The turning point came in late June, when geopolitical tensions between Iran, Israel, and the US eased, creating a relief rally across risk-on assets. Cardano seized the moment by breaking out of its long-standing bearish range and staging a stunning 80% rebound from the $0.55 level over the past 30 days. Riding the macro wave, Cardano has found renewed strength. Institutional buzz is growing louder, especially as talks around a potential ADA ETF pick up steam. Adding to the optimism, Bitcoin price recently touched a fresh all-time high of $123,231, which is injecting momentum across the altcoin board. Technically, the setup has shifted in ADA crypto’s favor. The coin has successfully flipped the 200-day EMA into support, and a golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs now appears imminent. At the time of writing, Cardano price is holding steady above its May peak, trading around the $0.85 mark and pushing higher. If bulls maintain pressure and ADA closes convincingly above this zone, a near-term move toward $1.10 could follow. From there, the path to $1.32 by July’s end becomes a realistic possibility. Still, the support levels remain crucial. Should ADA falter and fall back below $0.70, the downside could reopen toward $0.65 or even $0.55, the base that previously fueled its latest rally. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. Another would be a global attraction in the sector with BTC continuing northward moves. Therefore, if ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.

2025-07-22T11:31:39,"Retail Dumps Bitcoin (BTC) on Binance as Whales Quietly Load Up","Bitcoin is currently trading above $118,000, and while it hasn’t yet been able to reclaim last week’s all-time high, the asset is still almost 15% up over the past month. Despite the ongoing bullish sentiment, retail investors are still offloading Bitcoin on Binance as evidenced by a surge in retail inflows that aligns with signs of profit-taking. Retail Selling Into Strength According to the latest figures shared by CryptoQuant, Binance’s 30-day retail inflow has spiked from $12 billion to over $16 billion. This was indicative of an increased selling activity as BTC’s price climbed toward recent highs. A similar pattern emerged in April 2025, when Bitcoin rose from $78,000 to $111,000 by the end of May. During this time, retail traders also offloaded significant portions of their holdings amidst the uptrend and ultimately missed out on the full upside. This recurring behavior points to a tendency among retail investors to sell into strength. Such behaviour is likely driven by fear or short-term profit motives, rather than holding for potential further gains. Further confirming this sell-off pattern, Binance’s Net Taker Volume has turned negative, which reflects a bearish sentiment among market takers. Negative net taker volume indicates that sellers are dominating, either by liquidating long positions or entering new short positions in anticipation of a potential pullback. This sentiment among retail traders suggests that many remain unconvinced of the rally’s sustainability. On the other hand, whales are aggressively accumulating during this period of retail selling. Data from Whales Screener reveals that in the past 24 hours alone, whales have withdrawn over $400 million in Ethereum and nearly $200 million in Bitcoin from centralized exchanges. Such large withdrawals typically indicate a firm belief in a continued market uptrend, as whales use the liquidity from retail sellers to build positions. This behavior is consistent with past trends where retail exits during rallies while whales continue accumulating. Bitcoin’s Path to $140K Amid this divergence between retail selling and whale accumulation, attention is now turning to what analysts expect for Bitcoin’s next major move. Analyst Mr. Wall Street, for one, expects Bitcoin to climb to $140,000 mid-term, but warned that sell-side pressures may cap gains. The crypto asset has held above $117,000 and aims for $120,000-$123,500 short-term before a potential run toward $133,000-$140,000. However, wallets that accumulated BTC during the 2022 lows are now offloading. This pattern was seen before previous cycle peaks.

2025-07-22T11:30:14,"XRP Could Skyrocket 500% Against Bitcoin, Analyst Warns","CryptoInsightUK believes the long-awaited altcoin season has finally begun—and that XRP could be its headline act. In a 13-minute market update posted on July 21, the British analyst argued that last week’s dramatic collapse in Bitcoin dominance “erased 19 weeks of Bitcoin strength in a single candle,” a move he called the first clear signal of a sustained rotation into altcoins. “Volume tells the story,” he said, pointing to the outsized red bar that accompanied the dominance drop. The pattern, he noted, mirrors the December 2020 setup that preceded the last explosive altcoin cycle. If dominance continues to unwind at a comparable speed, it could slip to the 39 percent zone within seven weeks—giving altcoins room to outperform. XRP Could Rally 500% Against Bitcoin That macro backdrop matters because, in the same breath, XRP just printed the highest weekly close in its history. CryptoInsightUK highlighted an “accumulation-then-breakout” structure on the XRP/USD chart that resembles Bitcoin-dominance’s own staircase lower. “It’s continuation, in my opinion,” he said, adding that XRP’s breach of its 2017-2018 all-time-high band could usher in a series of higher highs. Related Reading: XRP Targets $6–$10 If Bitcoin Hits $144,000, Analyst Predicts Liquidity data bolsters the thesis. Heat-maps from TradingDifferent show “significant liquidity to the upside… all the way now up to about $4.26,” the analyst said. He expects XRP to attack that magnet “probably within this week” and believes a run to $4.50 is “imminent” if Bitcoin breaks its nearby resistance shelf. The bolder call, however, is denominated in satoshis. With XRP/BTC perched just below its last meaningful resistance, CryptoInsightUK sees scope for a rally of “at least another 200 percent—potentially up to 500 percent—against Bitcoin” once the pair clears the level. Such a move, he argued, would propel XRP’s market-share to the 14–20 percent range, up from roughly 2 percent today, and would likely coincide with Bitcoin itself pushing toward the $135,000–$150,000 corridor. “Things are going to get exciting pretty quick,” he warned, urging followers to prepare profit-taking plans in advance. Related Reading: The XRP Euphoria Phase: Why August–October 2025 Could Be Explosive Though the video focused on XRP, the analyst revealed he recently took full profits on his sizeable Ethena (ENA) position after a 100 percent gain in two weeks, citing over-exposure and extreme daily RSI readings. The sale, he said, lifted his cash buffer from 2 percent to about 5 percent, giving him “the opportunity to hold my XRP bag for longer”. CryptoInsightUK acknowledged that timing any cycle top is notoriously difficult. “No one nails the cycle,” he conceded, promising to disclose his own exit strategy in real-time once price action justifies it. For traders who do not “live the charts,” he recommended a disciplined take-profit plan rather than aiming for absolute peaks. For now, the spotlight stays on two charts: Bitcoin dominance and XRP/BTC. A decisive breakdown in the former and a clean breakout in the latter would, in the analyst’s words, “ignite altseason” and validate the 500 percent upside scenario. Whether that firework display begins this week or takes a little longer, he insisted, “there’s no reason we couldn’t do something like this”—and sketched a near-vertical path higher. At press time, XRP traded at $3.46.

2025-07-22T11:30:12,"Eric Trump Mocks Critics Amid Ether Price Surge, What’s Next for Crypto?","Eric Trump took to X on Monday to celebrate Ether price climb above $3,800 , taking a jab at critics who mocked him earlier this year for supporting the cryptocurrency. “How am I doing now @TedPillows?” Trump posted, referring to a three-month-old remark from Ted Pillows, a partner at crypto exchange OKX, who had mocked Trump in April following Ether’s decline in February and March. Trump continued his online rebuttals by telling another user, “Up 35% in 5 months, Pal. Embrace volatility,” adding that those who followed his advice to “buy the dips” would now be in profit. Data from CoinGecko shows that Ether was trading at around $2,877 when Trump announced his support for the coin on February 4. At its current level near $3,732, investors would be sitting on roughly 30% in unrealized gains, despite the coin experiencing a steep 49% drop shortly after Trump’s post earlier in the year. Ether Eyes $8,000 as Analysts Track Patterns While Ether has gained 12% so far in 2025, some analysts are seeing a bigger move on the horizon. On Sunday, analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similarity between Ether’s current structure and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1980, predicting that Ether could reach $8,000 by early 2026 as it enters what he believes is the final phase of its long-term bullish cycle. These comments arrive amid a broader crypto market recovery, with Ether leading a steady rally over the past month. Renewed optimism around Ethereum’s network upgrades, increasing institutional interest in tokenization, and reduced selling pressure have all contributed to its recent price gains, strengthening bullish sentiment in the market. Trump Family’s Expanding Crypto Footprint The Trump family’s involvement in crypto ventures extends beyond social media posts. On Monday, Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social platform, announced it holds $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities. The company has raised $2.5 billion to support its Bitcoin strategy, with plans to expand its crypto holdings based on market conditions. Eric Trump, along with his brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Barron Trump, co-founded American Bitcoin, a company that has raised $220 million to acquire Bitcoin for its treasury and to purchase mining equipment.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin’s performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader. Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 The Bitcoin price performance in July 2025 has been truly remarkable. Since the last week of June, Bitcoin has broken out of its consolidation phase, driven by whale accumulation, a surge in spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On July 14th, this breakout propelled Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $123,231. However, the momentum faced a pause as traders took profits and the market sought to recover from exhaustion. However, now the RSI has indicated this cool down is completed by dropping from 75 to 65. The tool suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for another surge that could push it back into price discovery. From a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin price is now eyeing the psychological milestone of $125,000. If the upward momentum continues, this level could be tested before the month wraps up. However, any short-term pullback would make $115,000 a critical support level to watch, closely aligning with the dynamic 20-day EMA support. Should Bitcoin dip below this level, it could retrace to the $110,000 swing low support zone, with the final line of defense resting around the $101,000 mark. As the market evolves, all eyes will be on these key levels to gauge Bitcoin’s next move. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $125,000+ Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-22T11:25:34,"Can XRP Price Hit $100 in 2025?","The post Can XRP Price Hit $100 in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP community is excited again, and for good reason. With a growing list of bullish developments and rising mainstream adoption, many traders are now asking the big question: Can XRP actually reach $100 in 2025? While that might sound like an unrealistic prediction, one analyst took a closer look at what’s fueling this speculation and whether it’s really possible. What’s Driving the Hype? There’s no doubt that XRP has had a rocky journey over the past few years, especially with its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. But now, things are turning around. One of the biggest reasons people are getting bullish on XRP is the possible approval of an XRP ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). If approved, it would allow institutional investors to buy into XRP more easily, just like they do with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. That could bring in billions of dollars in new money—and send prices soaring. In addition to the ETF, Ripple is allegedly planning to go public. Once Ripple becomes a publicly traded company, it could bring even more attention and legitimacy to XRP and its technology. But the biggest long-term catalyst could be bank adoption. If banks around the world start using XRP to move money, that could replace the outdated SWIFT system, which is slow and expensive. XRP transactions are fast, cheap, and energy-efficient. If trillions of dollars begin flowing through XRP every day, demand could skyrocket and so could the price. Search Interest Is Exploding One surprising data point is Google search volume. Interest in XRP is now reaching record highs. Even higher than in 2017 and 2021 bull markets. When this kind of retail interest spikes, it often leads to massive price movements. People are asking everywhere: “Should I buy XRP?” And that rising curiosity can fuel even more buying pressure. Short-Term Price Targets and Buy Zones Right now, XRP is showing a strong bullish trend. The analyst said that watching key levels like $3.30 and $3.16 as possible pullback zones before the next leg up. If Bitcoin pulls back slightly, it might give traders a chance to scoop up XRP before it pushes to $5. What Needs to Happen for $100 to Be Realistic? 100 is a huge number for XRP. For it to get there, a lot would have to happen: Massive global adoption by banks and financial institutions ETF approval and institutional inflows Ripple’s IPO bringing new credibility and exposure A multi-year bull market that drives the entire crypto market higher Trillions in daily volume flowing through XRP as a payment solution",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-xrp-price-hit-100-in-2025/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T11:25:31,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price $ 3.51203990 Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 3.51203990 -0.83% Market cap $ 207,850,212,331.02 Circulating Supply 59,182,189,917.00 Trading Volume $ 10,396,716,952.2709 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a “buy-the-dip” mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July’s events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the XRP price spiked massively, and other one is that the key crypto bills are passed in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. This would boost legal clarity to digital assets like XRP, and the recent ETF Debut has increased hopes for other asset managers’ applications filed for spot XRP ETFs to be approved before year-end. On the chart, the entire rally appears like a breakout from the upper resistance of the falling wedge pattern. The gains that are displayed from June’s third week to when writing is nearly 85%, and from July’s second week, it surged more than 60%. This breakout was catalyzed by Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $123,231, which pulled altcoins like XRP upward. XRP has recently marked an ATH at $3.66 on July 14th and has now taken a halt above $3.40 support, preparing for another leg upwards. Similarly, from a technical indicators perspective, the XRP price golden cross between its 20-day and 50-day EMAs has expanded. The MACD also shows a golden cross between the MACD line and the signal line, with a strong histogram at 0.0731. This indicates strength in bullish momentum, which is evident in AO, too, which is at 0.9462. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has surged to 0.14, up from 0.04 earlier in early July, highlighting growing accumulation and surging money inflow. However, there are warning signals to consider, which alarm short-term caution with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 80, indicating overheated, overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or sideways consolidation is likely to cool off before the next leg upward. On the contrary, if XRP price fails to hold the $3.40 support, a retest of $2.95 is possible. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.95 $3.00 $4.00 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-22T11:20:45,"Why economist Peter Schiff is recommending selling Ethereum to buy Bitcoin","American economist Peter Schiff is urging investors with exposure to cryptocurrencies to consider selling Ethereum ( ETH ) and reallocating funds into Bitcoin ( BTC ). It’s worth noting that Schiff has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, arguing the asset has no intrinsic value and consistently advocating for gold instead. Schiff pointed out that Ethereum is trading near the top of its range, making it, in his view, an ideal time to sell. He believes the recent upswing is more likely a bear market rally than a sustained recovery, he said in an X post on July 21. “Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether,” the economist noted. His comments come at a time when Ethereum’s push toward the $4,000 mark has faltered, with the asset retreating amid profit-taking. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,685, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, though still up 23% in the past week. Bitcoin, by contrast, is consolidating around $119,060. ETH and BTC seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum’s competition While Schiff remains skeptical of both Bitcoin and Ethereum as long-term investments , he views Ethereum as being at a relative disadvantage. According to him, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap faces stronger competition in its use-case narrative, whereas Bitcoin continues to dominate as the leading digital asset. As such, he argued that Ethereum is underperforming compared to Bitcoin, and may continue to do so. https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1947345315046068455 For investors insistent on holding crypto, Schiff sees a better risk-reward trade in rotating out of Ethereum and into Bitcoin, despite his broader reservations about the entire asset class. Beyond the Ethereum-Bitcoin debate, Schiff also renewed his criticism of political support for digital assets. The economist warned that efforts to promote domestic investment in crypto, particularly under President Donald Trump, could inadvertently accelerate the collapse of the U.S. dollar. In such a scenario, Schiff maintained, while Bitcoin holders might expect to benefit, gold would ultimately emerge as the real winner. His remarks come as the U.S. ramps up crypto regulation, including the newly signed Genius Act targeting stablecoins.

2025-07-22T11:17:09,"Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP Lead the Charge as Altcoin Season Heats Up","The post Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP Lead the Charge as Altcoin Season Heats Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is signaling an early trend shift as capital flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. While Bitcoin has long been the dominant player, recent movements suggest that traders are now betting on alternative cryptocurrencies for stronger returns. Bitcoin Dominance Drops as Altcoins Outperform Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé highlighted a notable drop in Bitcoin dominance—from 65% to 60% in just 30 days. This is one of the steepest declines in recent months, signaling a possible rotation toward altcoins. Altcoins have capitalized on this shift: Ethereum surged 26% Dogecoin jumped 40% XRP climbed 22% Cardano rose 23% These consistent gains are not just outperforming Bitcoin—they’re reviving hopes of a new altcoin season. Altcoin Season Index Signals Momentum The Altcoin Season Index has jumped from 35 to 50 over the past month. While the official altseason threshold is 75, this sharp climb reflects increasing momentum in the altcoin market. Investors are growing more confident in altcoins’ upside potential . Supporting this trend, the TOTAL3 market cap, which excludes both Bitcoin and Ethereum, has climbed nearly 33% month-over-month. At the same time, USDT dominance is falling, showing that traders are moving funds out of stablecoins and back into riskier assets. With Bitcoin’s price action stalling, the spotlight is now squarely on altcoins. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash: XRP, ETH and XLM Pullback Despite Trump’s ‘Stamp of Approval’ For Crypto , Altseason Is Close, But Not Confirmed Not everyone is convinced. Investor Mourad Farouni compared the current market setup to the post-2016 election rally, noting that while things look bullish, a full confirmation of altseason hasn’t yet occurred. Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees the recent dip as a healthy correction, not a bearish reversal. He believes that short-term volatility is expected during an early-stage altcoin bull cycle and encourages traders to stay focused on technicals rather than give in to panic. “Selling out of fear isn’t a strategy if your long-term thesis is intact,” he says. All indicators point to a market leaning heavily into altcoins. From price performance to volume shifts, the signals are stacking up. If momentum holds, the coming weeks could confirm the arrival of a full-blown altseason, with huge potential upside for early movers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin dominance has dropped from 65% to 60% in the last 30 days as traders shift capital into altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Cardano, which are currently offering higher returns and better technical setups. Which altcoins are leading the current rally? Ethereum (+26%), Dogecoin (+40%), XRP (+22%), and Cardano (+23%) have all posted strong gains in the past week, consistently outperforming Bitcoin. Has altseason officially started? Not yet. The Altcoin Season Index has risen from 35 to 50, but the official threshold for an “altseason” is 75. However, the sharp increase indicates growing momentum toward one. What does the TOTAL3 market cap indicate? TOTAL3, which tracks the market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, has jumped 33% month-over-month, signaling rising investor interest in smaller-cap altcoins. Why is the drop in USDT dominance important? A decline in USDT dominance shows that investors are pulling money out of stablecoins and re-entering the market with riskier bets on altcoins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-dogecoin-xrp-lead-the-charge-as-altcoin-season-heats-up/,"ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T11:15:00,"Solana Defies Market Drop, Touches $200 as Altcoins Retreat: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The past 24 hours have witnessed a rare dynamic: a major token moving on technology news rather than trading flows and general narratives of institutional adoption. Solana's native sol (SOL) experienced a notable spike in price volatility, rising as high as $200 for the first time since March after Jito Labs, an infrastructure company, announced Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) , designed to counter maximal extractable value strategies, such as front-running and sandwiching. SOL is now tussling with BNB for the No. 5 ranking among the world's largest cryptocurrencies by market value. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, is still trading directionless below $120,000, while ether (ETH) pulled back after printing an indecisive Doji candle on Monday. That left the CoinDesk 20 Index of the biggest tokens 2% lower over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 80 Index , which encompasses the next 80 largest cryptocurrencies, fell 3.5%, most likely reflecting profit-taking in altcoins after their run-up in the past few days. The pullback comes on the heels of consecutive weekly gains that look to have set the stage for a notable bull run. (Check out the TA section ). ""Solana continues to lead altcoin performance, briefly surpassing $200, boosted by the Block Assembly Marketplace announcement, which introduced enhanced transaction speed and improved network efficiency,"" Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. ""The broader market, however, failed to hold its momentum, reflecting increased uncertainty as ETF demand slows."" While charts may point to further declines in the near future, the underlying market remains poised for growth, he said. ""Short-term technicals may pressure prices further, but we remain constructive on the cycle overall,"" he noted, pointing to institutional and corporate demand as long-term bullish catalysts. Speaking of institutional adoption, JPMorgan is reportedly considering offering loans backed by customer-held crypto assets, such as BTC and ETH, possibly starting as early as next year. Mexico-listed real estate firm Grupo Murano is planning to adopt BTC as a core strategic asset, with an initial investment of $1 billion and a five-year goal to build a $10 billion reserve . In traditional markets, investors pulled money out of leveraged Strategy (MSTR) ETFs while bargain-hunting the 2x short ETF, a sign of reassessment of directional bets. The greenback was bid against major currencies, including the euro and the risk-sensitive Australian dollar. The Bank of Japan reportedly said it will provide U.S. dollar-denominated loans to domestic institutions against pooled collateral, a move aimed at addressing dollar funding stress. Stay alert!

The move comes alongside a broader resurgence in NFT markets triggered by a single $10 million sweep of 45 CryptoPunks late Sunday by an unknown buyer, which sent Punk floor prices up 17% and went viral across X. As trader sentiment shifted, Pudgy Penguins’ floor price climbed 13% to 16.57 ETH ($63,150) — its highest in months — feeding directly into demand for its memecoin. Pudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-native NFT collection. It launched PENGU on Solana in December to reach new retail audiences. The strategy has paid off: The token is 310% over 30 days and sits at No. 59 by market cap. The NFT ripple also enveloped Bored Ape Yacht Club, which rose 23% to a 13.5 ETH floor, Prediction markets on Myriad give it a 64% chance of holding above 12.75 ETH by the end of the week. Collections like Moonbirds, Azuki, Cool Cats, Goblintown and CryptoDickbutts also posted double-digit floor price gains, marking the largest 24-hour moves for NFTs since early 2024. Derivatives Positioning Open interest in offshore perpetual BTC futures dropped over 0.5% today, a sign traders aren't chasing the recovery from overnight lows under $116,000. For ETH, OI fell alongside price weakness, signaling profit taking. Perpetual funding rates for major tokens continue to reset to moderately bullish levels near 10% from the 20% and higher seen last week. Bull positioning in PUMP and FART is beginning to look a bit overstretched with annualized funding rates topping 40%. On Deribit, BTC risk reversals out to the August-end expiry have given up the call bias. ETH calls continue to be pricier across all tenors. Block flows over OTC network Paradigm featured call spreads including the December $140K/$200K BTC spread and the August $3.8K/$4.4K ETH spread.

The RSI at 77.57 indicates overbought conditions, however, a bullish continuation could take the price to $200–$209 resistance zone. Otherwise, a pullback toward the $158–$152.5 support zone remains on the table. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $158 $180 $209 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $11.77 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $1.05B–$498M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-22T11:03:32,"SpaceX just moved over $150 million in Bitcoin","After more than three years of inactivity in the crypto market, SpaceX broke the silence with a monster move on July 22. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence , a wallet owned by Elon Musk’s company moved 1,308 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth around $153 million, from Coinbase to a fresh address. The motivation behind the transfer is still unclear, and no further moves have been spotted, although it is clear there was no change in SpaceX’s net holdings. As reported by Arkham , the aerospace giant still holds 6,977 BTC, valued at approximately $815 million. SpaceX BTC moves. Source: Arkham What are Elon Musk’s Bitcoin plans? With the receiving address still inactive, it appears the move could merely indicate a routine wallet reshuffle. However, given Musk’s influence on the market, some speculate the transfer might result in major price movements. The speculations are justified as the transaction makes it clear that SpaceX held a significant Bitcoin position for quite some time, choosing not to liquidate despite market volatility. This, in turn, implies the company might be pursuing a long-term investment strategy, treating BTC as a strategic reserve asset. The timing of the transfer is also significant, as institutional interest in the “digital gold” as a hedge has never been higher, driven by pro-crypto policy shifts. Moreover, Elon Musk recently announced the formation of a new political party, the “America Party,” aiming to disrupt the U.S. two-party system. Musk, who previously maintained a close relationship with President Trump, said in a post on X that the party would support Bitcoin as “fiat is pointless.” Musk’s take on fiat and Bitcoin.

2025-07-22T11:02:23,"Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout Alert: Stay Patient for the Big Surge!","Bitcoin (BTC) has been hovering above and below $118,000 for more than a week now. The price is also traversing inside a triangle, and is coming near to a breakout point. Could there be a surge to $130,000 and beyond, or are we in for a dip, followed by more sideways choppiness? Triangle breakout imminent Source: TradingView The latest series of sideways movement after the last surge up from $112,000 possibly won’t last as long as previous consolidation periods. This is because this continuation pattern is a much smaller triangle. Of course, the $BTC price could exit the triangle and then still keep trending sideways, perhaps printing a different, and bigger chart pattern. That said, it does rather look as though a breakout is about to take place. It’s customary for Bitcoin to hardly ever get to the ends of triangles, and it's much more usual for a breakout to occur not more than around three quarters of the way through the pattern. The price is at this point now, so it just may be a matter of time before the bulls ignite the thrusters and the rocket ship takes off again. The $119,000 resistance is the first target, then a higher high above $119,640, and finally a take out of the $121,000 high before the final ascent to the all-time high at $123,200. If however the bears are able to take control, just under $116,000 would be the last line in the sand before a potential rapid collapse to $112,000. Going below $109,000 would be cause for major concern. Strong support structure below Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that if the price can get above $119,000 we could be back to smooth sailing and another leg higher, perhaps to $130,000. If on the other hand the price does fall back down, decent price structure, formed by the tops of the falling wedge and the bull flag, would probably act as strong support, and a bounce would be likely to occur from there. RSI trend break on 2-week chart Source: TradingView It’s the 2-week chart that holds a big clue as to where the $BTC price is going next. At the bottom of the chart is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which signals overbought and oversold conditions. It can be seen in the chart that the indicator has just popped its head above the downtrend line. There is still the best part of two weeks before this can be confirmed, but a surge up to $130,000 would likely push the indicator line well beyond the downtrend. This would be the first stage in the process of attempting to nullify bearish divergence. There is still a long way to go for the indicator to reach the previous high of 87.6. If the indicator line fails to get there, this strong bearish divergence would likely be the major factor for the commencement of the next bear market.
