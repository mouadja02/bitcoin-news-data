2025-07-22T07:55:23,"Hyperliquid Whale Unleashes Audacious $100M Bitcoin Long: A Risky Bet?","BitcoinWorld Hyperliquid Whale Unleashes Audacious $100M Bitcoin Long: A Risky Bet? In the fast-paced, high-stakes world of cryptocurrency, moments of sheer audacity often capture the market’s attention. One such moment recently unfolded on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, where a single Hyperliquid whale made a move that sent ripples across the crypto community. Imagine placing a bet so massive, so leveraged, that it could either lead to unimaginable wealth or catastrophic loss. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired when a trader known as AguilaTrades opened a staggering $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position with 40x leverage. This bold maneuver at an entry price of $118,056 has become a focal point of discussion, highlighting the exhilarating, yet perilous, nature of high-leverage trading in the digital asset space. The Audacious Move: Unpacking the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bet The crypto market thrives on volatility and the ambitious plays of its largest participants. When an on-chain analyst, @ai_9684xtpa, brought the activities of AguilaTrades to light on X, the details were nothing short of breathtaking. This particular Hyperliquid whale initiated a 40x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, committing a colossal $100 million. At an entry price of $118,056, this translates to a total position size of approximately 840 BTC, which, at the time of reporting, had already swelled in value to around $108 million. Such a move isn’t just about the numbers; it’s a testament to the immense conviction—or perhaps extreme risk appetite—of the individual behind the trade. To put this into perspective, a 40x leverage means that for every dollar the trader put up as collateral, they are effectively controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. While this amplifies potential gains exponentially, it also magnifies losses at an alarming rate. A slight adverse price movement could lead to rapid liquidation, wiping out the entire collateral. This specific Hyperliquid whale trade serves as a stark reminder of the double-edged sword that leverage represents in the crypto derivatives market. What Exactly is a Hyperliquid Whale, and Why Does It Matter? In cryptocurrency parlance, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to influence market prices. A Hyperliquid whale , specifically, is a large holder or trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange. Their actions are closely watched because their trades, due to their sheer size, can impact market sentiment and even price movements. When a whale takes such a substantial position, it often sparks speculation: Are they privy to insider information? Do they see a major market shift coming? Or are they simply making a highly speculative bet? Hyperliquid itself is a relatively new but rapidly growing decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It stands out for its low latency, high throughput, and the ability to handle large orders, making it attractive for professional traders and, indeed, whales. The transparency of on-chain data, as leveraged by analysts like @ai_9684xtpa, allows the broader community to observe these large trades, offering a glimpse into the strategies and risk appetites of the market’s biggest players. Navigating the High Seas of Leverage: What Does 40x Really Mean? Leverage is a powerful tool in trading, allowing participants to amplify their exposure to an asset with a relatively small amount of capital. However, with great power comes great risk. For a Hyperliquid whale to utilize 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in their favor, their profit on the collateral is 40%. Conversely, a 1% move against them results in a 40% loss of their collateral. This extreme amplification means that even minor market fluctuations can have drastic consequences. Consider the liquidation price. With 40x leverage, a long position like AguilaTrades’ would face liquidation if Bitcoin’s price were to drop by just over 2.5% from the entry price. Given Bitcoin’s historical volatility, a 2.5% drop can occur within minutes or hours, making such a position incredibly precarious. This is not a strategy for the faint of heart, nor for those without deep pockets to withstand potential drawdowns or rapid liquidations. To illustrate the inherent risk, here’s a simplified table showing the approximate percentage drop required for liquidation at different leverage levels: Leverage Multiplier Approximate % Price Drop for Liquidation (Long Position) 5x 20% 10x 10% 20x 5% 40x 2.5% 50x 2% 100x 1% The Allure and the Abyss: Potential Rewards and Catastrophic Risks The decision by a Hyperliquid whale to take on such a highly leveraged position is driven by the potential for monumental gains. If Bitcoin were to continue its upward trajectory, even a modest percentage increase could translate into millions of dollars in profit for AguilaTrades. For instance, if Bitcoin were to rise just 10% from the entry price, the 40x leverage could theoretically turn the initial $100 million position into a profit of $40 million on the collateral. This immense profit potential is the primary allure of high leverage. Challenges and Risks: Liquidation Risk: This is the most immediate and significant danger. As illustrated, a small price drop can trigger automatic liquidation, leading to the complete loss of the collateral used for the position. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is notorious for its rapid and unpredictable price swings. These fluctuations can quickly turn a profitable position into a losing one, especially with high leverage. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen market shocks, regulatory crackdowns, or major hacks can cause sudden, sharp price drops, leaving no time for traders to react and leading to widespread liquidations. Slippage: For such large positions, executing trades, especially during volatile periods, can lead to slippage, where the actual execution price differs from the intended price, impacting profitability. Impact on Market Sentiment: While the Hyperliquid whale stands to gain or lose significantly, their actions can also influence the broader market. A massive liquidation of such a large position could trigger a cascade of selling pressure. Lessons from the Deep: Actionable Insights for the Average Trader While the audacious move of a Hyperliquid whale might seem exciting, it’s crucial for the average retail trader to understand that such strategies come with extreme risk. Mimicking these moves without a deep understanding of market dynamics, risk management, and sufficient capital can be financially ruinous. Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Risk Management: Always define your risk tolerance. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Understand Leverage Thoroughly: Before using leverage, fully grasp how it works, including its amplification of both gains and losses, and how liquidation prices are calculated. Start with lower leverage if you must use it. Don’t Blindly Follow Whales: While whale movements can be interesting to observe, they operate with different capital bases, risk appetites, and potentially information advantages. Their strategies are not necessarily suitable for smaller portfolios. Focus on Education: Continuously learn about market cycles, technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic factors that influence crypto prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one highly leveraged basket, spread your investments across different assets to mitigate risk. Consider the Long-Term: For many, a long-term, spot-holding strategy in Bitcoin has proven more consistent and less stressful than highly leveraged short-term trading. The Ripple Effect: How Whale Trades Influence Market Sentiment A trade of this magnitude by a Hyperliquid whale doesn’t just impact the individual’s portfolio; it sends a signal to the market. A large leveraged long position can be interpreted as a strong bullish conviction, potentially encouraging other traders to open long positions, thereby contributing to upward price momentum. Conversely, if the position were to face liquidation, it could trigger a wave of selling, leading to a rapid price decline and potentially cascading liquidations across the market. The transparency of decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid means that these large trades are observable, fueling discussions and speculation across social media and trading forums. This collective attention can create a feedback loop, where the actions of a few large players influence the sentiment and behavior of many smaller ones, amplifying market movements. Conclusion: A Glimpse into High-Stakes Crypto Trading The $100 million, 40x leveraged Bitcoin long opened by a Hyperliquid whale , AguilaTrades, is a fascinating case study in the extreme ends of cryptocurrency trading. It embodies the tantalizing promise of exponential gains that leverage offers, alongside the terrifying specter of rapid, complete loss. While such audacious bets capture headlines and spark immense interest, they also serve as a crucial educational moment for anyone involved in the crypto market. They highlight the importance of understanding the tools at your disposal, the inherent volatility of digital assets, and the paramount need for stringent risk management. The world of crypto derivatives is a wild frontier, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, often by those brave—or perhaps foolhardy—enough to make such a colossal bet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in the cryptocurrency market? A “whale” in the cryptocurrency market refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, significant enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their movements are often tracked by other traders for insights into market sentiment. Q2: What does 40x leverage mean in crypto trading? 40x leverage means that for every dollar of your own capital (collateral) you put into a trade, you are controlling $40 worth of the asset. While it can amplify profits significantly, it also means a small adverse price movement (e.g., just over 2.5% for a long position) can lead to the liquidation of your entire collateral. Q3: What is Hyperliquid, and why is it used for such large trades? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange known for its high performance, low latency, and deep liquidity. Its architecture allows it to handle large orders efficiently, making it an attractive platform for professional traders and whales seeking to execute substantial leveraged positions without significant slippage. Q4: What are the main risks associated with high-leverage trading? The primary risks include rapid liquidation (loss of all collateral) due to small adverse price movements, heightened exposure to market volatility, and the potential for cascading liquidations during sharp market downturns. It also amplifies the impact of unexpected “black swan” events. Q5: Should average traders try to mimic a Hyperliquid whale’s strategy? No, it is generally not advisable for average retail traders to mimic a Hyperliquid whale’s highly leveraged strategies. Whales operate with vastly different capital bases, risk tolerances, and often have sophisticated trading systems or information. For most traders, prioritizing risk management, education, and starting with lower leverage (or none) is a far safer approach. Q6: How do large whale trades impact the overall crypto market? Large whale trades can significantly impact market sentiment. A massive long position might signal bullish conviction, potentially encouraging others to buy. Conversely, a large liquidation or short position can create downward pressure, leading to fear and potentially triggering further selling or liquidations across the market.

2025-07-22T07:54:05,"Will XRP Price Hit Double Digits in 2025? XRP/BTC Rally Is Just the Beginning","The post Will XRP Price Hit Double Digits in 2025? XRP/BTC Rally Is Just the Beginning appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the last 30 days, XRP price has surged an impressive 67.2%, outperforming almost every major cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin (14.4%), Ethereum (62.1%), Solana (45.5%), BNB (19.5%), and Cardano (58.3%). In just the past seven days, XRP jumped another 21%, reaching $3.47. But that’s not all on the XRP/BTC chart; a major technical development has caught the crypto world’s attention. XRP/BTC Nears 8-Year Resistance Breakout Currently, the XRP/BTC pair is trading at 0.00002952 BTC. According to renowned crypto trader Gordon , the pair is on the verge of breaking through a key resistance level that has held firm for eight years. At the start of this month, XRP/BTC was at 0.00002052 BTC, and since then, it has climbed a staggering 43.63%. Between July 6 and July 17, the pair soared by 42.53%, with 11 bullish daily candles and a 14.17% single-day jump on July 17. Gordon calls this moment a “rare, generational wealth opportunity”, hinting at a possible long-term rally for XRP price. XRP Spot ETF Approval Could Be the Next Big Trigger While several XRP ETFs based on futures and leverage—like those from ProShares and Teucrium—are already live in the U.S., the market is still waiting for the SEC to approve a spot XRP ETF . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction As Tokenized RWAs on XRPL Soar 2260% , Following the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit resolution, the approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a powerful catalyst that pushes the XRP price even higher. Interestingly, the current rally is unfolding without this major trigger, indicating strong organic momentum. What’s Next for XRP Price? With the SEC lawsuit settled, institutional interest rising, and Ripple’s cross-border payment adoption expanding, the outlook for XRP price remains bullish. Gordon believes that if momentum continues, XRP could hit $10 or more by 2025 . The XRP/BTC breakout, combined with growing investor confidence and pending spot ETF approvals, could mark the beginning of a powerful rally. If you’re watching the crypto markets, now might be the time to keep a close eye on the XRP price. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Many analysts, including Gordon, believe XRP could reach $10 or more by 2025, especially if it breaks through key resistance levels and gains approval for a spot ETF. What is driving the current XRP/BTC breakout? The XRP/BTC pair is nearing a breakout from an 8-year resistance level, driven by bullish technical indicators, increased trading volume, and growing investor confidence. Has a spot XRP ETF been approved by the SEC? No, a spot XRP ETF has not yet been approved. Several applications are pending, and approval could act as a major catalyst for future price growth. What happens if XRP gets ETF approval? If the SEC approves a spot XRP ETF, institutional money could flow in rapidly, likely accelerating XRP price growth and increasing liquidity. How is the XRP price performing without ETF approval? XRP’s current rally is happening even without the ETF approval, signaling strong organic demand and bullish sentiment among traders.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-xrp-price-hit-double-digits-in-2025-xrp-btc-rally-is-just-the-beginning/,"TRADING|XRP|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-22T07:45:19,"Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Remarkable $139K Target Without Overheating","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Remarkable $139K Target Without Overheating Are you keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency markets? The world of digital assets is constantly buzzing with predictions and analyses, but few capture attention quite like a bold forecast for the future of Bitcoin. Recently, a prominent analyst from CryptoQuant, Axel Adler Jr., shared an intriguing perspective that suggests the Bitcoin price could soar to an impressive $139,000 without entering what he terms an ‘overheated’ phase. This isn’t just a random guess; it’s based on specific on-chain metrics that paint a compelling picture of continued growth potential. For anyone invested in or considering the world’s leading cryptocurrency, understanding this outlook is crucial. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Optimism? The core of Adler Jr.’s analysis lies in CryptoQuant’s unique framework, which identifies specific zones for Bitcoin’s market behavior. Currently, with the Bitcoin price hovering around $117,000, it resides comfortably within what’s called the ‘growth zone.’ This zone is defined by two key levels: the Investor Price Median and the Hype Alert level. The Investor Price Median, currently sitting around $92,000, represents a baseline of strong investor accumulation and conviction. It suggests that a significant portion of the market is holding Bitcoin with a long-term view, providing a robust foundation for upward movement. On the other hand, the Hype Alert level, pegged at $139,000, signifies the point at which the market might start showing signs of excessive optimism or ‘overheating.’ What’s remarkable about Adler Jr.’s current assessment is that the Bitcoin price can reach this $139,000 mark without necessarily triggering the ‘overheated’ status. This implies that even at that elevated level, there would still be underlying buying support and a healthy market structure, rather than a speculative bubble on the verge of popping. This nuanced perspective offers a refreshing take in a market often characterized by rapid, unpredictable swings. Understanding the Bitcoin Price ‘Growth Zone’ To truly grasp the significance of CryptoQuant’s analysis, it’s essential to delve deeper into what these ‘zones’ represent for the Bitcoin price . These aren’t just arbitrary numbers; they are derived from sophisticated on-chain data analysis, tracking the behavior of various market participants, from long-term holders to short-term speculators. The ‘growth zone’ is essentially a sweet spot where fundamental accumulation meets healthy market interest, allowing for sustainable price appreciation. Let’s break down the key levels: Investor Price Median ($92,000): This level acts as a strong support base. It represents the average acquisition cost for a significant segment of long-term investors. When the Bitcoin price stays above this, it indicates that these investors are in profit and less likely to sell, providing a stable floor. It’s a testament to the underlying demand from those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Hype Alert Level ($139,000): This is the upper boundary of the growth zone. While reaching this level is significant, Adler Jr.’s point is that it doesn’t automatically signal a market top or an impending crash. Instead, it’s the point where caution might become necessary, but not necessarily panic. The absence of ‘overheating’ at this level implies that demand is still organic and not solely driven by speculative frenzy. This framework allows analysts to gauge market sentiment and health more accurately than just looking at price charts alone. It provides a window into the collective psychology and conviction of Bitcoin holders, which is a powerful indicator for future Bitcoin price movements. Is This Bitcoin Price Prediction Realistic? A $139,000 Bitcoin price target might sound ambitious to some, especially given the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility. However, several factors lend credibility to such a projection, particularly when viewed through the lens of fundamental analysis and historical cycles. Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC entering the market, have historically preceded significant bull runs. While the most recent halving has passed, its full supply-side impact often unfolds over the subsequent months and years. Furthermore, increasing institutional adoption continues to be a major catalyst. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, bringing in substantial capital. Large corporations and even some sovereign nations are also exploring or implementing Bitcoin into their treasuries or financial systems, further solidifying its position as a legitimate asset class. These factors contribute to a growing demand side that can absorb higher prices without necessarily becoming ‘overheated.’ However, it’s equally important to consider potential challenges. Regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions, unforeseen macroeconomic downturns, or significant shifts in investor sentiment could all impact the trajectory of the Bitcoin price . While Adler Jr.’s analysis focuses on on-chain health, external factors always play a role. A balanced perspective acknowledges both the immense potential and the inherent risks of the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Price Investors So, what does this optimistic outlook mean for you, whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or just starting your journey? The analyst’s perspective suggests that there’s still significant room for growth, implying that current price levels might represent an attractive entry or accumulation point for those with a long-term horizon. However, it’s crucial to approach the market with a well-defined strategy. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While expert analysis provides valuable insights, always cross-reference information and understand the underlying metrics yourself. The more informed you are, the better decisions you can make regarding your Bitcoin price investments. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, which is notoriously difficult, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and can lead to a lower average purchase price over time. Understand Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market, while offering high rewards, also carries high risks. Diversifying your portfolio and setting clear profit targets and stop-losses can help protect your capital. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape evolves rapidly. Keep up with news, regulatory developments, and on-chain analysis from reputable sources to make timely and informed decisions about your Bitcoin price holdings. This period, within the ‘growth zone,’ could be an opportune time for strategic positioning, but always with an awareness of market dynamics and personal financial goals. In conclusion, the latest analysis from CryptoQuant offers a compelling and well-reasoned argument for a significant upside in the Bitcoin price , potentially reaching $139,000 without triggering the typical signs of an overheated market. This perspective, rooted in on-chain data and the concept of a ‘growth zone,’ highlights the underlying strength and sustained buying support for Bitcoin. While the crypto market remains dynamic and unpredictable, such expert insights provide valuable guidance for investors navigating its exciting yet challenging terrain. The journey to $139,000, if it unfolds as predicted, promises to be a remarkable chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story, driven by genuine demand rather than pure speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘overheated’ mean in the context of Bitcoin price? ‘Overheated’ typically refers to a market condition where prices rise rapidly due to excessive speculation and irrational exuberance, often detached from fundamental value. It’s usually a precursor to a significant correction or crash, as demand becomes unsustainable. Who is Axel Adler Jr. and why is his analysis relevant for Bitcoin price? Axel Adler Jr. is an analyst at CryptoQuant, a well-respected on-chain analytics platform. CryptoQuant specializes in providing data-driven insights into cryptocurrency markets by analyzing blockchain data, which can reveal underlying market trends and participant behavior not visible on simple price charts. His analysis is relevant because it’s based on empirical, on-chain metrics rather than just technical analysis. What is the ‘Investor Price Median’ and how does it relate to the Bitcoin price? The Investor Price Median is an on-chain metric that estimates the average acquisition cost for a significant portion of long-term Bitcoin investors. When the current Bitcoin price is above this median, it suggests that these long-term holders are in profit and less likely to sell, providing a strong support level and indicating overall market health. What is the ‘Hype Alert’ level for Bitcoin price? The ‘Hype Alert’ level, currently set at $139,000 in this analysis, is a threshold identified by CryptoQuant beyond which the market might start exhibiting signs of excessive speculative activity. While reaching this level doesn’t guarantee a crash, it signals a point where increased caution might be warranted due to heightened market optimism. Should I invest in Bitcoin based on this prediction? This analysis provides a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price , but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. It’s crucial to conduct your own thorough research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended before making significant investment choices in volatile markets like cryptocurrency.

According to data from crypto analytics platform Arkham , SpaceX transferred 1,308 BTC (worth around $152 million) to an unknown wallet earlier today. SpaceX Moves BTC for First Time Since 2022 The transaction occurred at 13:09 (UTC+8) and is the first since June 2022, when SpaceX sent 3,505 BTC to Coinbase. SpaceX still holds 6,977 BTC, valued at roughly $815 million. The unexpected transfer has sparked curiosity in the community. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) transferred 1,308 $BTC ($153M) to a new wallet after 3 years of dormancy. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/OAwmEKBbOa — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 22, 2025 The BTC hasn’t moved since the transfer, which shows that it might just be an internal shuffle, likely for added security or cold storage reorganization. Arkham had previously reported that Tesla and SpaceX together held around $2 billion in Bitcoin. Both companies bought them at an average price of $32,000 and are now up almost $1.5 billion on Bitcoin. While Tesla’s BTC holdings have been public since 2021, SpaceX’s stash was only recently confirmed through wallet tracking. This shows how major firms may hold crypto quietly and profit big over time. Whales Take Profits as BTC Hits New High Bitcoin whales made waves in the market recently. On July 17, they moved a massive 61,000 BTC to exchanges, marking the biggest single-day inflow in over a year. This triggered a 4% dip, pulling Bitcoin down from its $123K high to around $117K–$118K. Cryptoquant analysts note that over the past few days, BTC inflows to exchanges jumped by nearly $17B, rising from $28B to $45B between July 14–18. The spike in inflows was similar to what was seen at the previous market tops. This suggests that whales may have used Bitcoin’s new all-time high to take profits. However, the daily inflows are now declining, and if the trend continues, it could help ease selling pressure and give the market some breathing room.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/spacex-just-moved-152-million-in-bitcoin-are-whales-dumping/,"BTC|MARKET|ARKM|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T07:30:24,"Ethereum Open Interest: Explosive $57.98 Billion Surge Signals Market Confidence","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Open Interest: Explosive $57.98 Billion Surge Signals Market Confidence The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with a monumental development: Ethereum open interest has shattered all previous records, reaching an astounding $57.98 billion! This unprecedented surge, as reported by CoinGlass data on July 22, marks a staggering increase of over 96% in just one month, with the total value of outstanding derivatives contracts denominated in ETH climbing to 15.69 million ETH. For anyone following the crypto markets, this isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing conviction and potential future movements for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum Open Interest Before diving deeper into what this record-breaking figure means, let’s clarify what ‘open interest’ truly represents. In the realm of derivatives trading, open interest refers to the total number of outstanding contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled or closed. It’s a crucial metric that provides insight into the liquidity and activity of a market. A high Ethereum open interest suggests a large number of participants are actively involved in the market, holding positions, and anticipating future price movements. Unlike trading volume, which measures the number of contracts traded over a specific period, open interest reflects the total amount of money committed to the market. When open interest rises, it indicates new money flowing into the market, either from new participants or existing ones increasing their exposure. Conversely, a decline suggests money is flowing out as contracts are closed. The recent data from CoinGlass paints a clear picture of this incredible growth: Metric Value (July 22) Compared to Previous Month Percentage Change Open Interest (ETH) 15.69 million ETH Approx. 8 million ETH +96% Open Interest (USD) $57.98 billion Approx. $29.5 billion +96% What Drives Such a Massive Ethereum Open Interest Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to this monumental rise in Ethereum open interest . Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the market’s current sentiment and potential future direction: Spot ETH ETF Speculation: The ongoing anticipation and regulatory developments surrounding a potential spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States have undoubtedly fueled significant institutional and retail interest. An approved ETF would open the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset, leading to increased demand across all related financial products, including derivatives. Upcoming Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous development roadmap, including planned upgrades like the Dencun and Pectra updates, promises enhanced scalability, efficiency, and security. These technological advancements make the network more attractive for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and enterprise solutions, boosting long-term confidence in ETH. Broader Crypto Market Recovery: Following periods of consolidation, the wider cryptocurrency market has shown signs of renewed strength. Bitcoin’s resilience and the overall positive sentiment across major digital assets often spill over into Ethereum, encouraging more aggressive positioning in its derivatives market. Increased Institutional Participation: Large financial institutions are increasingly looking at crypto assets as legitimate investment vehicles. As more institutional capital enters the market, their preference for regulated and sophisticated financial instruments like futures and options naturally drives up open interest figures. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the bedrock of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As DeFi protocols innovate and expand, the underlying demand for ETH as collateral, gas, and a base asset in these systems grows, which can indirectly influence derivatives positioning. Navigating the Waves: What Opportunities and Risks Does High Ethereum Open Interest Present? While a surging Ethereum open interest is often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating strong conviction among traders, it’s essential to understand that it also comes with increased volatility and potential risks. The derivatives market is a double-edged sword, offering amplified gains but also magnified losses. Opportunities: Potential for Strong Price Movements: High open interest, especially when coupled with increasing prices, can suggest a strong bullish trend is forming, as more money is betting on price appreciation. Enhanced Liquidity: A larger number of open contracts means a deeper market, making it easier for large traders to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices. Market Confirmation: It acts as a confirmation of market conviction. If traders are willing to commit substantial capital, it indicates a collective belief in Ethereum’s future trajectory. Risks: Increased Volatility: A large number of open positions can lead to significant price swings, especially during liquidation cascades where a rapid drop in price triggers automatic selling of leveraged positions. Potential for Reversals: While high open interest can signal a trend, an extremely high concentration of positions in one direction (e.g., too many long contracts) can make the market vulnerable to a sharp reversal if sentiment shifts or a major liquidation event occurs. Funding Rate Dynamics: High open interest often leads to higher funding rates in perpetual futures markets, making it more expensive to hold long positions over time, which can pressure prices if traders are forced to close positions. Ensuring Informed Decisions in the Wake of Surging Ethereum Open Interest For both seasoned traders and new entrants, the record Ethereum open interest serves as a critical data point. However, it’s crucial to combine this information with other market indicators and a sound risk management strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Funding Rates: Pay attention to funding rates on perpetual futures exchanges. High positive funding rates suggest an overheated long market, which could precede a correction. Analyze Liquidation Levels: Understand where major liquidation clusters lie. These levels can act as magnets for price action during volatile periods. Look at Spot vs. Derivatives Volume: Compare the volume in the spot market with that in the derivatives market. A disconnect could indicate a derivatives-driven rally that might be less sustainable. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Given the potential for increased volatility, using appropriate position sizing, stop-loss orders, and avoiding excessive leverage is paramount. Stay Informed on Fundamentals: Keep abreast of Ethereum’s technological advancements, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. Fundamental strength underpins long-term price appreciation. The unprecedented surge in Ethereum open interest is a testament to the growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its pivotal role in the future of decentralized finance and Web3. It reflects a powerful belief in the asset’s potential, driven by a confluence of technological advancements, institutional interest, and overall market optimism. This record high signals a dynamic and engaged market, brimming with both opportunities for growth and the inherent risks of increased leverage. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, market participants will be watching closely to see if this bullish conviction translates into sustained price action and further innovation. The journey of Ethereum is far from over, and its derivatives market continues to be a vibrant barometer of its evolving story. Whether you’re a long-term holder or an active trader, understanding the nuances of Ethereum open interest is essential for navigating this exciting landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Ethereum open interest? A: Ethereum open interest refers to the total number of outstanding or unsettled derivatives contracts (like futures or options) on Ethereum that have not yet been closed out by an offsetting trade or exercised. It indicates the total amount of capital committed to the Ethereum derivatives market. Q2: How does a high Ethereum open interest affect its price? A: A high Ethereum open interest often suggests strong market conviction and can precede significant price movements. If the majority of open contracts are long positions, it might indicate bullish sentiment and potential for upward price action. However, it also means increased potential for volatility and sharp reversals if sentiment shifts or liquidations occur. Q3: What caused this record surge in Ethereum open interest? A: Several factors likely contributed, including speculation around a spot Ethereum ETF approval, ongoing network upgrades (like Dencun and Pectra), a broader recovery in the crypto market, and increasing participation from institutional investors looking to gain exposure to Ethereum through derivatives. Q4: Is high open interest always a bullish sign for Ethereum? A: Not necessarily. While a rising Ethereum open interest often signals new money entering the market and strong conviction, it can also lead to an overheated market. If too many traders are leveraged long, a small price drop can trigger cascading liquidations, leading to a sharp downward movement. It’s crucial to analyze the ratio of long to short positions and funding rates. Q5: What are the main risks associated with high Ethereum open interest? A: The primary risks include increased market volatility, the potential for rapid liquidation cascades (especially for leveraged positions), and the possibility of sudden price reversals if market sentiment changes quickly. High funding rates can also make holding long positions expensive, potentially forcing closures. Q6: How can traders use Ethereum open interest data in their strategy? A: Traders can use Ethereum open interest as an indicator of market strength and potential trend continuation or reversal. Monitoring changes in open interest alongside price action, funding rates, and liquidation levels can help identify periods of high conviction or potential market vulnerability, aiding in risk management and trade entry/exit decisions.

He asked each driver a simple question: “Do you hold XRP?” The experiment ran through what appears to be Ontario, Canada, and Jakey captured every answer on video posted July 20. Most drivers either had never heard of XRP or told him they don’t own any crypto at all. Only on the 25th ride did he hear a “yes.” Testing XRP Awareness Among Drivers Jakey’s sample was small but clear. He hopped into 25 different rides and got mostly blank looks when he mentioned XRP. A few drivers asked what XRP even is, and some said they’d only ever heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum. None of the first 24 drivers held any of the coin. That pattern held up all day long. Are uber drivers actually rich from XRP? I took 50 uber rides to find out! pic.twitter.com/Dex10kguWc — Jakey (@SolJakey) July 20, 2025 One Driver Bucks The Trend On ride number 25, Jakey finally met someone who said he bought the crypto at $1.67. It’s not clear whether that driver bought when the coin hit 1.67 in mid‑2021 or during the November 2024 rally. What mattered to him was utility. He said he plans to hold XRP for the long haul because of how it moves money across borders. Jakey has been a vocal skeptic. In December 2024, when the crypto asset traded at $2, he opened a short position and funneled his gains into Solana‑based meme coins. XRP then climbed to $3.4 in January 2025, fell back to $2, and settled around $3.5 as of this week. Based on reports from the altcoin community researcher SMQKE, almost 100% of retail investors still don’t know what XRP is, even as it breaks price records. The current state of retail. 99% are oblivious to XRP, even as it breaks all time highs. Retail investors are not rushing to accumulate utility tokens. Institutions are. https://t.co/5CtwmOYXEn — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 20, 2025 Retail Adoption Remains Early SMQKE argues that low awareness shows retail interest hasn’t caught up yet. At the same time, institutions have quietly added the altcoin behind the scenes. On‑chain data hints at large transfers moving into wallets that belong to big players. That kind of accumulation can drive prices without any street‑level buzz. What This Means For The Altcoin The Uber‑ride test shows a big gap between price performance and public recognition. Asking 25 people isn’t a scientific survey, but it does highlight how few everyday users know about XRP by name. For a clearer view of retail adoption, one would need broader polls, exchange‑level user stats, and more on‑chain analysis. Until then, the altcoin’s path into mainstream hands may still be at the starting line.

In the clip shared by Rietveld, Portnoy explained that he sold his holdings at $2.40 after being advised by a third party who expressed concerns about competition from Circle. Following his sale, XRP climbed to a new all-time high of $3.65, leaving Portnoy regretful. “It’s up 60% since I sold it, and I would have made millions. I want to cry, and I don’t own it anymore,” Portnoy said.

He rejected Portnoy’s self-appointed role as the “leader” of XRP supporters, arguing that such a position is incompatible with selling during a crucial period. Prominent XRP advocates have consistently advocated for holding the token , as its value extends beyond speculative trading. However, Portnoy’s decision to sell reveals that he was not invested for the long run as true XRP believers are, but was looking for a way to turn a quick profit. “You’re not the leader of the XRP army if you’re selling at $2.40,” Rietveld stated, highlighting the importance of conviction during a time when multiple bullish catalysts are coming together to boost the asset’s price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Call for Informed Holding Rietveld also noted that Portnoy’s decision was based on listening to individuals “who have no idea what they’re talking about,” rather than focusing on the broader developments around XRP. Rietveld referenced the anticipated influx of trillions in liquidity and other positive factors that have strengthened XRP’s position in the market. Portnoy’s situation highlights a major challenge faced by investors navigating volatile markets. His acknowledgment of missing out on significant gains reflects a common experience for traders reacting to external opinions rather than long-term fundamentals. Portnoy never held any leadership roles within the XRP army. Although he has previously advocated for XRP, even calling it the next Bitcoin , his decision to sell so early has called his so-called conviction into question.

2025-07-22T07:27:07,"What is Expected in the Fed’s Interest Rate Decision to be Announced Next Week? Research Company Reveals","The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on July 30, according to Yardeni Research. According to research data, the probability of a rate cut remains at just 4.7%. While the strong employment data released in June delayed short-term rate cut expectations, a moderate inflation report in September is expected to reinforce signals of a potential rate cut. While markets have been on the rise with better-than-expected earnings figures announced for the second quarter, it is stated that if the Fed gives dovish messages next week, new momentum may be experienced in the stock markets. Meanwhile, although it is claimed that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is under increasing pressure from the White House to lower interest rates, market experts and economists do not expect a dovish move from the central bank in the short term. Related News: BREAKING: MicroStrategy Makes New Announcement to Purchase Bitcoin One of the most significant reasons for this is that Powell cannot make decisions alone on the FOMC, which sets monetary policy. He is only one member of the 12-member board. Furthermore, the Fed has a dual mission: to keep inflation under control while ensuring maximum employment. The current strong labor market does not create an environment that necessitates interest rate cuts. Furthermore, any new tariffs that may be implemented in the coming period could increase inflation. The Federal Reserve has held the federal funds rate target steady between 4.25% and 4.50% since December. The bank, which also left the rate unchanged at its June meeting, based its decision on inflationary rigidity, the impact of trade tariffs, and the need for more data. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-22T07:27:06,"JPMorgan considers loan against cryptocurrency - report","JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE: JPM ) plans to offer loans secured by clients' cryptocurrency holdings, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum, as early as next year, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan ( NYSE: JPM ) aims to let clients use their BTC ( BTC-USD ) and ETH ( ETH-USD ) as collateral to borrow loans, expanding beyond its current service of lending against crypto ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). The sources indicated that these plans are still under consideration and could change. CEO Jamie Dimon—who had earlier indicated that he was not a fan, ruling out getting into custody—now seems to have a softer tone on it. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy bitcoin. Go at it,” he said in May. The report pointed to Dimon’s early remarks about bitcoin, where he said he would fire any trader who traded it, which could have alienated some prospective clients who either had made their money through crypto assets or were long-term believers in their potential. The initiative aligns JPMorgan ( JPM ) with peers like Bank of America ( BAC ) and Citibank ( C ), which are also expanding into digital asset and stablecoin services.

2025-07-22T07:25:23,"Bitcoin Price Surges: What’s Driving the Phenomenal Ascent Past $118,000?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Surges: What’s Driving the Phenomenal Ascent Past $118,000? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again demonstrated its remarkable volatility and upward potential, breaching the significant $118,000 mark. This impressive climb, noted across major exchanges like the Binance USDT market, has sent ripples through the entire digital asset landscape, leaving investors and enthusiasts alike wondering: what’s next for the king of crypto? What Propelled the Bitcoin Price Beyond $118,000? The recent ascent of the Bitcoin price above $118,000 isn’t an isolated event but rather the culmination of several converging factors. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the often-unpredictable crypto markets. While a single definitive cause is rarely identifiable, a combination of macro and microeconomic forces often play a role. Increased Institutional Interest: A growing number of traditional financial institutions are either directly investing in Bitcoin or offering crypto-related products to their clients. This influx of large capital can significantly boost demand and, consequently, the Bitcoin price . Favorable Regulatory Developments: While regulation remains a complex topic, signs of clearer, more supportive regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions can reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Positive news on this front often correlates with price increases. Halving Event Impact (Long-Term): Although not a direct immediate cause for a single day’s surge, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin) contribute to its scarcity and inherent value proposition, laying groundwork for future price appreciation. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic instability, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value often push investors towards assets like Bitcoin, which some view as “digital gold.” Analyzing the Market Movement: Where Does the Bitcoin Price Stand? According to real-time market monitoring, the Bitcoin price indeed pierced the $118,000 threshold, reaching as high as $118,000 on the Binance USDT market at the time of this observation. This level represents a significant psychological and technical resistance point for many traders. To put this into perspective, let’s consider some key metrics: Metric Value (Approx.) Significance Current Bitcoin Price $118,000 Key psychological and resistance level. 24-Hour Trading Volume Billions USD Indicates strong market activity and liquidity. Market Capitalization Trillions USD Reflects Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market. Previous Resistance Level (e.g., $115,000) The level from which the recent breakout occurred. This upward momentum often triggers a domino effect across altcoins, with many seeing gains as Bitcoin leads the charge. However, it’s essential to remember that while a surge is exciting, market volatility means that corrections can occur. What Are the Implications of This Bitcoin Price Milestone for Investors? For both seasoned and novice investors, a significant move in the Bitcoin price like this carries several implications: Benefits: Validation for HODLers: Long-term holders (HODLers) see their conviction rewarded, reinforcing the belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation. Increased Market Confidence: A strong Bitcoin performance often boosts overall confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting new capital. Profit-Taking Opportunities: For short-term traders, this presents opportunities for profit-taking, especially for those who entered positions at lower price points. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Rapid price increases can be followed by sharp corrections, increasing the risk for new entrants or those trading on leverage. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The excitement can lead to impulsive decisions, causing investors to buy at the peak, only to face potential pullbacks. Market Manipulation Concerns: While the market matures, concerns about large whale movements or market manipulation persist, especially during periods of high volatility. Actionable Insights: Navigating these market conditions requires a strategic approach: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the fundamentals before making investment decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly, which can mitigate the impact of volatility. Set Realistic Expectations: Bitcoin’s journey is often characterized by significant swings. Don’t expect continuous parabolic gains without corrections. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is dominant, spreading investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies can reduce risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on global economic news, regulatory updates, and technological advancements within the crypto space. The Road Ahead: What Could Influence the Bitcoin Price Next? Predicting the future movement of the Bitcoin price is notoriously difficult, but several key factors will likely continue to shape its trajectory: Global Economic Health: A weakening global economy could push more investors towards Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Conversely, a strong economy might reduce the urgency for such alternatives. Regulatory Clarity: Clear and supportive regulations, especially from major economies, could unlock significant institutional and retail adoption, driving demand. Technological Advancements: Improvements in Bitcoin’s scalability (e.g., Lightning Network) and security will enhance its utility and appeal. Mainstream Adoption: Increased acceptance by merchants, payment processors, and financial services will integrate Bitcoin further into daily commerce, increasing its utility and perceived value. Market Sentiment: News events, social media trends, and overall investor psychology play a massive role in short-term price movements. The journey of the Bitcoin price is a testament to its resilience and the growing acceptance of digital assets. While the $118,000 mark is a significant achievement, it’s merely another chapter in Bitcoin’s evolving story. In summary, the recent surge of the Bitcoin price past $118,000 underscores the dynamic and exciting nature of the cryptocurrency market. Driven by a confluence of institutional interest, macroeconomic factors, and an ever-evolving regulatory landscape, Bitcoin continues to solidify its position as a leading digital asset. While the opportunities for growth are evident, investors are reminded of the inherent volatility and the importance of informed decision-making. As the digital finance ecosystem matures, Bitcoin’s role is becoming increasingly prominent, promising an interesting future for its value and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding the Bitcoin price and its recent movements: What is the primary reason for the recent surge in Bitcoin price ?

Is $118,000 a new all-time high for Bitcoin price ? No, while $118,000 is a significant milestone, it is not Bitcoin’s all-time high. Bitcoin has previously reached higher valuations. This specific article refers to a particular market monitoring observation. How can I invest in Bitcoin safely?

2025-07-22T07:12:29,"Why SpacePay Is the Altcoin Making Bitcoin Spendable Everywhere","The post Why SpacePay Is the Altcoin Making Bitcoin Spendable Everywhere appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Most Bitcoin owners face the same problem every day. They have digital coins sitting in their wallets but can’t actually spend them anywhere useful. SpacePay is working to change this reality completely. This London-based fintech startup lets merchants accept crypto payments through their existing card machines, supporting over 325 different wallets. Everything gets instantly converted to local currency so businesses don’t worry about price swings. The platform has already raised over $1.2 million in its presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. This Altcoin Solves Real Problems People Have SpacePay isn’t another speculative token promising magical returns. It’s built around solving a genuine issue that millions of crypto holders deal with daily. About 400 million people worldwide own cryptocurrency, but most places still won’t accept it as payment. The problem isn’t that business owners hate digital money. They just can’t justify the risks and complications. Setting up crypto payments usually means buying expensive new equipment, learning complicated systems, and gambling on volatile prices. Most shop owners take one look at that list and decide it’s not worth the trouble. SpacePay takes a completely different approach. SpacePay doesn’t ask businesses to rip out their payment systems and start over. It works with the equipment they’re already using. Those Android card readers sitting on counters everywhere? They can handle crypto payments after a simple software update. No new hardware needed. No weeks of staff training required. When someone pays with crypto, SpacePay instantly converts it to regular money for the merchant. A $50 meal stays exactly $50 in the restaurant’s account, even if Bitcoin crashes an hour later. This removes the biggest fear that keeps businesses away from digital payments. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1944775986718929052 Making Crypto Payments Work for Everyone The beauty of SpacePay’s system is how normal it feels. Customers just grab their phone, scan a code, and walk out. It takes maybe ten seconds – about the same as using Apple Pay. Since the platform works with hundreds of wallet apps, people can keep using whatever they’ve got installed. This flexibility matters more than you might think. Some folks prefer MetaMask while others use Trust Wallet or something completely different. SpacePay doesn’t care which app people choose. The system just works with all of them. The platform handles all the popular cryptocurrencies too. Ethereum, Binance Coin, USDT, and several others work without any problems. Users don’t need to convert their preferred coins before buying something. They can spend whatever they’re already holding. For merchants, the experience feels completely routine. They see a regular payment hitting their account in dollars, euros, or whatever currency they use. Behind the scenes, SpacePay handles all the technical complexity. The business owner never touches actual cryptocurrency. The fees are reasonable too. SpacePay charges just 0.5% per transaction while most traditional payment processors take 2% to 4%. A busy restaurant doing $40,000 monthly could save over $1,000 just by switching payment systems. That’s real money that goes straight to the bottom line. Visit SpacePay Presale The $SPY Token Creates Actual Value SpacePay runs on its native $SPY token, which offers holders several concrete benefits. Token owners get voting rights on platform decisions and new features. They receive monthly loyalty rewards based on their activity. Early access to new features gives them advantages over regular users. The revenue-sharing model stands out as particularly interesting. As more businesses process payments through SpacePay, token holders earn a portion of those transaction fees. This connects token value directly to platform success rather than pure speculation. SpacePay has created exactly 34 billion tokens total. Twenty percent goes to the public presale, while 17% rewards users for staying active. The rest funds development work, business partnerships, and marketing efforts. The founders kept just 5% for themselves, showing they’re focused on building something sustainable. Every three months, the team hosts video calls where token holders can actually talk with the leadership team. The team actually tells people what’s happening – the good stuff, the problems, and what they’re planning next. It’s nice to see a crypto project that doesn’t just post mysterious updates and disappear. Why This Approach Actually Works Most crypto payment solutions fail because they try to be too clever. They build fancy new systems that nobody wants to learn. SpacePay succeeds by keeping things simple and familiar. The timing looks perfect too. More people own crypto than ever before, but they still can’t spend it easily in most places. Meanwhile, businesses are looking for ways to save money on payment processing fees. SpacePay hits both problems at once. The security aspects are solid without being overwhelming. The platform uses proper encryption and monitors transactions in real-time. Everything runs on distributed networks rather than single servers that could fail. It’s the kind of boring, responsible infrastructure that actually matters when handling people’s money. People interested in the $SPY token presale can visit SpacePay’s official website and connect their crypto wallet. The platform accepts ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and regular bank cards for those new to crypto. With tokens currently priced at $0.003181, participants can choose their investment amount and complete the process through simple on-screen instructions.

Atkins appeared on CNBC, confirming that the U.S. government has effectively given crypto and Bitcoin a “stamp of approval.” He praised recent progress, including the signing of the Genius Act , a law focused on stablecoin regulation, and expressed excitement about future innovation in digital assets. He said that stablecoins and digital currencies could help reduce market risks and settlement times. JUST IN: SEC Chair says US Government has given Bitcoin and crypto a ""stamp of approval"" pic.twitter.com/sY3NJw1Z00 — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 21, 2025 Still, the broader crypto market pulled back. After recent highs, Bitcoin is consolidating near $117,900, down from $123,000 earlier. ETH slipped below $3,790, while XRP dipped despite briefly touching $3.62. However, this could be a healthy correction after strong rallies in recent weeks. The pullback also comes as many traders prepare for volatility ahead of expected regulatory developments. The crypto market structure bill, which could reshape how the SEC and CFTC oversee the space, is set to pass in September or October. What’s Next For Bitcoin And Altcoins? Despite the correction, the larger trend remains bullish. Crypto analyst Lark Davis said that the current bull market isn’t just about Bitcoin hitting big price targets like $150K or $200K. Instead, he says the real surprise could be that this bull market is far from over, and might continue for several more years. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Seven Altcoins To Buy Now For Big Gains , According to Davis, this isn’t like the past cycles we saw in 2017 or 2021. With major players like ETFs, institutions, and big companies now entering the crypto space, he thinks it could be in for a slow, steady, and long-lasting uptrend, similar to gold’s long bull run between 2004 and 2011. The stock market usually sees bull runs last over 5 years, and if crypto follows a similar path, it might not see the top until 2027 or 2028. Research firm Bernstein even predicts Bitcoin could reach $200K by early 2026 and says this cycle will likely be “long and exhausting.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The broader crypto market experienced a pullback today, with top altcoins like XRP and Ethereum seeing losses. Bitcoin is consolidating near $117,900 after recent highs, despite positive regulatory signals. Why did the crypto market pull back today despite positive regulatory news? Despite SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins’ positive remarks on crypto and the “stamp of approval” from the U.S. government, the market pulled back due to a healthy correction after recent rallies and anticipation for upcoming regulatory developments. What is the long-term prediction for this crypto bull market? Crypto analyst Lark Davis believes this bull market is far from over and could last several more years, driven by institutional adoption rather than past retail-led cycles, potentially continuing until 2027 or 2028.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-crash-xrp-eth-and-xlm-pullback-despite-trumps-stamp-of-approval-for-crypto/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-22T07:04:58,"Leveraged Bearish Strategy ETF Pulls in Millions at Record Lows","A U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering leveraged bearish exposure to shares in bitcoin (BTC) holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) has recently attracted millions in investor money as its prices hit record lows. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF, listed under the ticker SMST on Nasdaq, has registered a net inflow of over $24 million since July 11, according to data tracked by VettaFi . The net inflow tallied over $10 million on July 16 alone, the biggest single-day total since March 26. The inflow likely represents bargain hunting at cheaper valuations. SMST fell to a high-volume record low of $17.68 last week as bitcoin's bull run gathered pace, with prices hitting highs above $120,000. MSTR's share price hit an eight-month high of $456. The 2x short ETF seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in the MSTR share price. The fund represents a bearish leveraged bet on MSTR. The ETF's price rose 12% on Friday, nearing a log-scaled bearish trendline, which represents the sell-off since inception in August 2024. On Monday, it traded flat at around $20. Long ETF bleeds money The apparent bargain hunting in the short ETF has coincided with outflows from its 2x bullish counterpart, suggesting a potential shift in investor sentiment or a recalibration of directional bets. The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) registered a net outflow of over $118 million since July 11. The fund's price fell 12% on Friday to $42.30 and traded around the same price yesterday.

The latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights shows that Anne Arundel Dermatology (AAD) was hit by a hacking/IT incident, impacting 1,905,000 individuals. In a data breach notice to consumers, AAD says that an unknown entity gained unauthorized access to its systems and siphoned files containing customers’ personal or health information. The HIPAA Journal reports that the hacker may have stolen names, addresses, dates of birth, medical histories, health insurance records and other personal datasets. “Anne Arundel Dermatology recently identified an intrusion on certain of its systems by an unauthorized third party. We took immediate action to review this incident and secure our systems. Our review determined that certain data files were accessible to the unauthorized third party for a period of time. We subsequently performed an assessment of these data files and determined, on May 20th, 2025, that some of the files contained certain personal or health information when the unauthorized third party had access to them. Our review indicates that the unauthorized access may have begun on February 14th, 2025, and ended on May 13th, 2025.” AAD is a Maryland-based practice offering a comprehensive range of skincare solutions, including medical, surgical, cosmetic, pediatric and dermatopathology services. The firm says it is offering impacted Americans free identity protection services that come with 24 months of credit and CyberScan monitoring and a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy. For now, AAD says it has not yet received reports of any instance of fraudulent activity arising from the cybersecurity incident.

Analyst Says ETH Has To Break This Level","An analyst has explained how Ethereum could be eyeing $10,000 next, if it manages to break past the resistance line of this technical analysis pattern. Ethereum Is Nearing A Retest Of This Resistance Line In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how ETH is looking from the perspective of a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset’s price witnesses consolidation between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, but the one of interest in the current discussion is the variant that has its trendlines parallel to the time-axis. This type appears when the cryptocurrency shows consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper level of the Parallel Channel is assumed to be a source of resistance and the lower one that of support. A break out of either of these bounds can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the channel can be a bullish signal, while a fall below it may be a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-week price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, Ethereum retested the lower level of the Parallel Channel earlier in the year and successfully found support at it. Since then, the coin has been marching up and its latest rally has brought it close to the upper level of the pattern, situated around $4,000. ETH has tested this level three times during the last couple of years and all of the instances resulted in it being rejected. In the scenario that the asset can find an escape this time, however, a bullish breakout might follow. “If Ethereum $ETH can break past $4,000, we could be looking at $10,000 next!” notes Martinez. The level is based on the fact that Parallel Channel breakouts can end up being of the same length as the height of the channel. It now remains to be seen if Ethereum will retest the upper level of the pattern in the near future and whether it would be able to find a break.

Whales withdrew over $600M in BTC and ETH from exchanges, signaling strong accumulation. Glassnode data shows strong ETF inflows and institutional demand despite cooling profitability. Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $117,000 after recently tapping a new all-time high, but beneath this calm surface, analyst and trader Amr Taha brought to light a telling shift in leading crypto exchange Binance’s retail behavior. Retail traders selling into strength In the past 30 days, retail inflows to the exchange have surged from $12 billion to over $16 billion, a sign of aggressive selling. Historically, retail traders have exhibited the same tendency during strong uptrends, often exiting early and missing substantial upside.
