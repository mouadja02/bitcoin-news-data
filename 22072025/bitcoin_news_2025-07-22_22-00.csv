2025-07-22T19:55:48,"Trader Says One Dogecoin Competitor Primed for New Leg Up, Predicts New All-Time Highs for Bitcoin","A widely followed crypto analyst says that one Dogecoin ( DOGE ) competitor may be on the verge of an explosive breakout. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 325,400 followers on the social media platform X that the dog-themed meme asset Floki ( FLOKI ) is printing a bullish triangle pattern. Bluntz is a practitioner of Elliott Wave theory, which aims to predict price movements in series of waves that are based on crowd psychology. He says that Floki may have completed an ABCDE triangle, foreshadowing a strong rally once the pattern is complete. ‚ÄúFive days of sideways for Floki here. I reckon next leg up is pretty close now that its had time to chill for a bit.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that Floki may eventually hit a price target of more than $0.0001600. Floki is trading for $0.0001412 at time of writing, down marginally on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may print new all-time highs of more than $125,000 after potentially forming an ABC correction to the $115,000 level. Under Elliott Wave theory, a bullish asset tends to witness new rallies after concluding an ABC pullback. ‚ÄúBTC looking like an early week sweep of $116,000 is on the cards before it can start pushing higher later in the week. Expecting any early week weakness to get bid back up around Tuesday or so.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X Bitcoin is trading for $119,105 at time of writing, up marginally on the day.

2025-07-22T19:55:19,"Ethereum: The Explosive Surge Driven by Institutional Demand","BitcoinWorld Ethereum: The Explosive Surge Driven by Institutional Demand In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, where market tides can turn swiftly, a significant shift is currently capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, it‚Äôs Ethereum that has recently emerged as a standout performer, demonstrating an impressive surge that has left many wondering about its underlying drivers. According to insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, this isn‚Äôt just a fleeting trend; it‚Äôs a profound ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù that is reshaping the crypto landscape and propelling Ethereum to new heights. But what exactly is fueling this remarkable ascent, and what does it mean for the future of digital assets? What‚Äôs Fueling Ethereum‚Äôs Phenomenal Rise? The narrative around Ethereum ‚Äòs recent outperformance is compelling, rooted in a fundamental shift in market dynamics. Matt Hougan, a respected voice in the crypto investment space, points directly to a dramatic increase in institutional and corporate demand as the primary catalyst. This isn‚Äôt merely anecdotal; the numbers speak volumes, painting a clear picture of unprecedented capital inflow into the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unprecedented Inflow: Since mid-May, over $10 billion worth of ETH has been acquired by institutions and corporations. To put this into perspective, this staggering figure is approximately 32 times more than the total amount of new ETH issued during the same period. This imbalance between supply and demand is the very essence of a ‚Äúdemand shock.‚Äù Scarcity and Value: When demand vastly outstrips supply, the natural economic consequence is an upward pressure on price. Unlike traditional markets where production can be ramped up to meet demand, the issuance of new Ethereum is programmatically controlled and deflationary in nature following upgrades like EIP-1559 and the Merge. This inherent scarcity amplifies the impact of the surging institutional interest. Strategic Accumulation: Large entities aren‚Äôt just buying; they‚Äôre accumulating. This suggests a long-term strategic view on Ethereum ‚Äòs potential, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate ETH into broader investment portfolios and corporate strategies. This level of sustained buying indicates deep conviction in its future utility and value proposition. This ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù signifies a maturation of the Ethereum market, moving beyond retail speculation to embrace significant capital from established financial players. Their entry not only injects liquidity but also lends credibility and stability to the asset, attracting further interest from other institutional participants. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: A Shifting Dynamic For years, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king, its price movements often dictating the broader crypto market. However, recent months have seen a noticeable divergence, with Ethereum not only keeping pace but significantly outperforming its larger counterpart. This shift is clearly illustrated in key market metrics, signaling a potential rebalancing of influence within the digital asset ecosystem. According to data highlighted by Crypto Briefing, the performance gap between the two leading cryptocurrencies has widened considerably: ETH‚Äôs Impressive Gains: In just three months, Ethereum has soared by an astonishing 105%. This remarkable growth trajectory underscores its robust momentum and the strong buying pressure it has experienced. Bitcoin‚Äôs Steady Ascent: In contrast, Bitcoin has seen a more modest, albeit respectable, gain of 23% over the same period. While still positive, it pales in comparison to Ethereum ‚Äòs explosive rally. This disparity is further reflected in the evolving relationship between the two assets: Key Performance Indicators: ETH vs. BTC (Past 3 Months) Metric Ethereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Price Gain +105% +23% ETH/BTC Ratio Climbed to 0.031 N/A Market Dominance Increasing Fell to 61% The rising ETH/BTC ratio to 0.031 is a particularly telling indicator. This ratio signifies how many Bitcoins one Ethereum is worth. A climbing ratio means that Ethereum is gaining value faster than Bitcoin, or losing value slower. Simultaneously, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance‚Äîits share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization‚Äîhas slipped to 61%. While still dominant, this decline suggests that capital is flowing into altcoins, particularly Ethereum , at a faster rate, diversifying the market‚Äôs concentration. This trend implies that investors are increasingly recognizing the unique value proposition of Ethereum , moving beyond Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative to embrace the broader utility and innovation offered by the Ethereum network. Beyond the Numbers: Why Institutional Investors are Eyeing Ethereum? The institutional embrace of Ethereum isn‚Äôt solely about its recent price performance; it‚Äôs a deeper acknowledgment of its foundational role in the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem. While Bitcoin is primarily seen as a store of value, Ethereum is the programmable blockchain that underpins a vast array of decentralized applications and innovations. This fundamental difference is a key driver for sophisticated investors looking for more than just a hedge against inflation. What makes Ethereum uniquely attractive to these large players? The Backbone of Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum is the undisputed leader in DeFi, hosting the vast majority of decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and other financial innovations. Institutions are keen to participate in this new financial paradigm, and owning ETH provides direct exposure to its growth. NFTs and Digital Ownership: The explosion of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has largely occurred on the Ethereum blockchain. From digital art to gaming assets, NFTs represent a new frontier of digital ownership, and institutions are recognizing their potential for brand engagement, intellectual property, and new revenue streams. Scalability and Sustainability Roadmaps: With the successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge) and ongoing developments like sharding (Danksharding) and Layer 2 solutions, Ethereum is actively addressing its scalability challenges. This commitment to future-proofing the network makes it a more viable long-term investment for entities concerned with enterprise-grade performance and environmental sustainability. Developer Ecosystem and Network Effect: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This vibrant ecosystem continually builds new applications, tools, and infrastructure, creating a powerful network effect that reinforces Ethereum ‚Äòs position as the leading smart contract platform. Institutions are investing in the platform where innovation is most prolific. Yield Opportunities: With the move to Proof-of-Stake, staking ETH offers attractive yield opportunities for institutional holders, providing a passive income stream that can enhance overall portfolio returns. This makes holding ETH more appealing than simply holding a non-yielding asset. These factors collectively paint a picture of Ethereum as not just a cryptocurrency, but a foundational technology powering the next generation of the internet. Institutional investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on this transformative potential, viewing ETH as a strategic asset rather than a mere speculative gamble. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Ethereum Enthusiasts The recent outperformance of Ethereum , driven by significant institutional demand, offers both exciting opportunities and important considerations for individual investors and market participants. Understanding the broader context and potential implications can help enthusiasts navigate this evolving landscape more effectively. Key Benefits for Ethereum Holders: Validation of Utility: Institutional interest validates Ethereum ‚Äòs fundamental utility beyond speculative trading. It reinforces the idea that ETH is a critical component of the future digital economy. Increased Liquidity and Stability: The entry of large capital often brings greater market depth and stability, potentially reducing extreme volatility over the long term, though short-term fluctuations remain inherent. Positive Price Momentum: Sustained demand from large players creates a strong bullish sentiment, which can translate into continued price appreciation, especially given Ethereum ‚Äòs deflationary mechanisms. Exposure to Web3 Growth: Holding Ethereum provides direct exposure to the growth of DeFi, NFTs, and the broader decentralized internet, areas poised for significant expansion. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: As Ethereum gains prominence, it may attract increased regulatory attention, which could introduce new compliance requirements or market uncertainties. Scalability Hurdles (Ongoing): While progress is significant, Ethereum still faces challenges in achieving truly mass-scale adoption without high transaction fees or network congestion during peak times. Layer 2 solutions are mitigating this, but the core network continues to evolve. Competition: Other smart contract platforms are emerging, aiming to compete with Ethereum . While Ethereum has a strong first-mover advantage and network effect, competition could influence its long-term trajectory. Market Volatility: Despite institutional interest, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Price corrections and sharp swings are always a possibility, requiring a robust risk management strategy. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Understand Ethereum ‚Äòs technology, its roadmap, and its place in the broader crypto ecosystem. Consider Diversification: While Ethereum shows strong potential, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Consider balancing your holdings across different assets. Stay Informed on Developments: Keep abreast of Ethereum ‚Äòs ongoing technical upgrades (e.g., Dencun, future sharding) and the evolving regulatory landscape. These can significantly impact its future. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors typically have a long-term horizon. Adopting a similar perspective can help weather short-term market fluctuations and capitalize on Ethereum ‚Äòs growth potential. The ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù highlighted by Bitwise underscores Ethereum ‚Äòs transition from a promising altcoin to a cornerstone of the decentralized economy. For those interested in participating, understanding these dynamics is crucial. In conclusion, the recent outperformance of Ethereum is far from a mere market anomaly; it‚Äôs a robust indicator of its growing maturity and indispensable role in the digital economy. The insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan vividly illustrate that this surge is powered by a significant ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù from institutional and corporate players, who have poured over $10 billion into ETH since mid-May, dwarfing new issuance by 32 times. This unprecedented inflow has propelled Ethereum to gains of 105% in three months, dramatically outpacing Bitcoin and causing a notable shift in market dominance. As the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and the broader Web3 movement, coupled with its continuous technical advancements and a vibrant developer community, Ethereum is increasingly seen as a strategic, long-term asset rather than just a speculative play. This institutional validation not only reinforces its utility but also sets the stage for its continued evolution and potential to redefine the future of finance and the internet. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding these profound shifts is key to navigating the exciting trajectory of Ethereum . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù mean in the context of Ethereum? A1: A ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù for Ethereum refers to a situation where the demand for ETH significantly and suddenly outstrips its available supply. In this case, it‚Äôs driven by massive institutional and corporate buying (over $10 billion since mid-May), far exceeding the rate at which new ETH is issued, leading to strong upward price pressure. Q2: Why are institutions increasingly interested in Ethereum over Bitcoin? A2: While Bitcoin is valued as ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù institutions are drawn to Ethereum for its utility as a programmable blockchain. It powers Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Its ongoing scalability upgrades and vibrant developer community also make it a strategic long-term investment. Q3: How has Ethereum‚Äôs performance compared to Bitcoin recently? A3: In the past three months, Ethereum has seen an impressive gain of 105%, significantly outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 23% gain. This has led to the ETH/BTC ratio climbing and Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance slightly decreasing, indicating a shift in investor focus towards Ethereum ‚Äòs growth potential. Q4: What are the main benefits of holding Ethereum? A4: Holding Ethereum offers exposure to the rapidly growing Web3 economy (DeFi, NFTs), potential for significant price appreciation due to demand shock and deflationary mechanisms, and the ability to earn yield through staking. Institutional interest also lends credibility and can contribute to market stability. Q5: What are some potential challenges or risks associated with Ethereum? A5: Key challenges include potential increased regulatory scrutiny, ongoing scalability hurdles (though actively being addressed by Layer 2 solutions), competition from other smart contract platforms, and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Investors should always conduct thorough research and manage risks. Did you find this deep dive into Ethereum ‚Äòs ‚Äúdemand shock‚Äù insightful?

2025-07-22T19:44:21,"SharpLink Gaming became the largest public Ether holder again after a $258.9 million Ethereum purchase","SharpLink Gaming reclaimed its spot as the biggest publicly traded Ether holder in the world after its latest purchase. On Tuesday, the company purchased 79,949‚ÄØETH, bringing its total to 360,807‚ÄØEthereum, worth about $1.3‚ÄØbillion at current prices. SharpLink paid about $3,238 per coin, shelling out roughly $258.9‚ÄØmillion for this latest purchase. Only days earlier, last Monday, it had disclosed a $49‚ÄØmillion purchase that also helped lift its balance to the same 360,807‚ÄØETH mark, based on data by CoinGecko. This latest acquisition lets SharpLink reclaim its lead in the fierce contest among public firms building up Ethereum reserves. Just weeks ago, BitMine Immersion Technologies nudged ahead after it announced a private placement worth $250‚ÄØmillion on June 30th. BitMine revealed last Thursday that it held 300,657‚ÄØEthereum, worth $1‚ÄØbillion, tipping it briefly past SharpLink‚Äôs 280,706‚ÄØETH at that time. Investors have been watching the contest closely, drawing parallels to MicroStrategy‚Äôs high‚Äëprofile Bitcoin purchases. Both companies‚Äô stocks have surged as traders compare their strategies. Ark Invest bought 4.4‚ÄØmillion shares of BitMine On Monday, ARK Invest purchased 4.4‚ÄØmillion BitMine shares (BMNR) in a deal worth almost $175‚ÄØmillion. It came after billionaire Peter Thiel picked up 5.09‚ÄØmillion shares of BMNR in the previous week, giving him a stake of 9%. At the same time, BitMine‚Äôs stock exploded, jumping over 700% in July, data from TradingView shows. The shares momentarily climbed above $140 on 3rd July before closing at $39.60 on Monday. SharpLink‚Äôs own stock (SBET) has also risen, though more modestly. It has gained about 130‚ÄØpercent over July, ending Monday around $26 per share. Ethereum ETFs attract $296 million in daily inflows Meanwhile, the broader crypto ETFs have seen a shift of funds. Spot Bitcoin ETFs broke a 12‚Äëday streak of net inflows, posting outflows of $131.35‚ÄØmillion on Monday. Ark & 21Shares‚Äô ARKB led the redemptions with $77.46‚ÄØmillion withdrawn. Major players, including Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and Bitwise, also saw net outflows. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, the biggest BTC ETF by assets, reported no change, alongside six other funds. This was the first day of net outflow for Bitcoin ETFs since July‚ÄØ1, a period that had seen $6.12‚ÄØbillion pour in. In contrast, Ethereum‚Äëbased ETFs continued their inflow streak to 12 consecutive days, drawing $296.6‚ÄØmillion on Monday alone. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH topped the list with $126.93‚ÄØmillion in new money, followed by $102‚ÄØmillion into BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA. Grayscale‚Äôs Mini Ethereum Trust and Bitwise‚Äôs ETHW also registered net inflows. These Ether‚Äëfocused funds have now amassed $3.53‚ÄØbillion over their 12‚Äëday run, marking some of the strongest early demand since their launch on July‚ÄØ24. Analyst Min Jung of Presto Research said the data point to a ‚Äúfamiliar rotation‚Äù from Bitcoin into Ethereum, often a prelude to broader activity in other tokens. ‚ÄúBitcoin has rallied significantly this year,‚Äù Jung noted, ‚Äúand for investors who feel they‚Äôve ‚Äòmissed‚Äô the BTC trade or are looking for the next opportunity, Ethereum is becoming the natural next step.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sharplink-buys-more-ethereum/,"ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH","News|Ethereum|ETH",cryptocompare

However, this is across the board. The last 24 hours have painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with major liquidation volumes in the crypto market.

Bullish headlines give bearish results Maestro, the infrastructure provider for Bitcoin DeFi, has been awarded a grant from the DFINITY Foundation to build an enterprise-grade, native Bitcoin metaprotocol indexer for ICP. The partnership creates a fast ICP canister that can give real-time info on Ordinals and Runes within ICP‚Äôs Bitcoin integration. Maestro Co-Founder and CEO Marvin Bertin said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled to collaborate with the DFINITY Foundation to extend ICP‚Äôs Bitcoin integration with secure Runes and Ordinals indexing necessary for financial apps like Liquidium and Odin.fun. This partnership further strengthens ICP‚Äôs lead in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem and unlocks new functionality for users.‚Äù More than 1,000 developers have worked with Maestro‚Äôs infrastructure, which runs more than 200 apps.

Altcoins pullback, analysts call it a healthy correction The crypto market has calmed down over the last 24 hours. Tuesday, altcoins went down as markets calmed down after last week‚Äôs Trump-led rise, after stablecoin legislation was signed into law.

2025-07-22T19:10:18,"Bitcoin Price Surge: Unprecedented Ascent Beyond $120,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Surge: Unprecedented Ascent Beyond $120,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with electrifying news: Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has shattered yet another significant psychological barrier, soaring past the incredible mark of $120,000! This monumental Bitcoin price surge isn‚Äôt just a number; it‚Äôs a powerful statement, signaling renewed confidence and intense momentum in the market. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, this breakthrough demands attention, raising crucial questions about the drivers behind this astonishing rally and what it portends for the future of finance. The $120,000 Milestone: A Closer Look at the Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market analysts, the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC, has indeed transcended the $120,000 threshold. Specifically, data from the Binance USDT market shows BTC trading at an impressive $120,037.26 at the time of this report. This isn‚Äôt merely a fleeting peak; it represents a robust push beyond a level many considered aspirational just months ago. The significance of this Bitcoin price surge lies not just in the numerical value but in the underlying market dynamics it reveals, suggesting a strong confluence of demand, diminishing supply, and broader acceptance. What‚Äôs Fueling This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge Beyond Expectations? Several powerful catalysts appear to be converging, creating a perfect storm for this remarkable Bitcoin price surge . Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone seeking to comprehend the current market landscape: Institutional Influx and Spot ETFs: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have been a game-changer. These vehicles provide regulated access for large institutional investors, unlocking massive capital inflows and providing a steady stream of demand. The Halving Event‚Äôs Ripple Effect: Bitcoin‚Äôs programmatic scarcity mechanism, the ‚Äúhalving,‚Äù reduces mining rewards by half approximately every four years. Historically, halving events precede significant bull runs, as reduced supply combined with sustained demand creates upward price pressure. Macroeconomic Headwinds and Inflationary Concerns: In an era of global economic uncertainty and persistent inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a viable hedge. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets, drawing investors seeking protection. Growing Retail Investor Confidence (FOMO): As Bitcoin makes headlines with impressive gains, a renewed sense of ‚ÄúFear Of Missing Out‚Äù (FOMO) often sweeps through retail investors. This encourages more individual investors to enter the market, adding to buying pressure and amplifying the Bitcoin price surge . Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Beyond price, the underlying Bitcoin network continues to evolve. Developments in scalability solutions (like the Lightning Network) and increased utility contribute to its long-term viability and appeal. Navigating the Volatility: What Challenges Accompany the Bitcoin Price Surge? While the excitement around the Bitcoin price surge is palpable, it‚Äôs equally important to approach the market with a clear understanding of the inherent challenges and risks. Bitcoin, despite its recent stability at higher levels, remains a volatile asset: Potential for Price Corrections: Rapid price appreciation often leads to periods of correction as investors take profits. A significant surge can be followed by a sharp pullback. Regulatory Scrutiny: As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream attention, they attract increased regulatory scrutiny. Unfavorable regulations in key jurisdictions could impact market sentiment and price. Market Manipulation Concerns: The crypto market can still be susceptible to large-scale buying or selling by ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù which can trigger significant price swings. Global Economic Shocks: While Bitcoin can act as a hedge, it‚Äôs not entirely immune to broader global economic downturns. Extreme risk-off environments could see investors liquidate crypto holdings. Understanding these potential pitfalls is crucial for responsible market participation. Historical Context: Is This Bitcoin Price Surge Truly Different? Bitcoin has a rich history of dramatic rallies and subsequent corrections. The current Bitcoin price surge , however, appears to possess distinct qualities that set it apart. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by retail speculation, this rally is underpinned by substantial institutional participation. The involvement of major financial players through regulated products like ETFs lends a new layer of legitimacy and stability, suggesting a more mature market infrastructure. Furthermore, the narrative around Bitcoin has evolved. It‚Äôs no longer just a niche digital currency but increasingly seen as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a foundational technology for a new financial paradigm. This shift in perception, coupled with growing global awareness, contributes to a more resilient and sustained upward trajectory, potentially making this Bitcoin price surge more enduring than its predecessors. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Navigate the Bitcoin Price Surge? For those looking to engage with the market amidst this impressive Bitcoin price surge , here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals, its technology, and its market dynamics. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy helps mitigate volatility. Risk Management is Key: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Allocate a sensible portion of your portfolio to high-volatility assets like Bitcoin. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is dominant, diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and traditional assets can help spread risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements from reputable sources like Bitcoin World. Long-Term Vision: Many seasoned investors view Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Focus on the long-term potential to weather short-term price fluctuations. The Road Ahead: What Could the Future Hold for This Bitcoin Price Surge? The journey past $120,000 is undoubtedly a landmark, but what‚Äôs next for the Bitcoin price surge ? While certainty is elusive, several factors suggest continued positive momentum: Continued Institutional Adoption: As more financial products and services integrate Bitcoin, its accessibility and legitimacy will grow, attracting further capital. Global Economic Landscape: Persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainties may continue to drive investors towards decentralized, finite assets. Technological Evolution: Ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin network and the broader crypto ecosystem will enhance its utility and appeal. Retail Re-engagement: As the price continues its upward trend, more retail investors are likely to re-enter the market, providing additional demand. Challenges remain, including potential regulatory headwinds and market corrections. However, the fundamental drivers behind Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition appear stronger than ever, suggesting that this monumental Bitcoin price surge may be part of a larger, transformative trend in global finance.

2025-07-22T19:01:24,"Major US Bank Launching Bitcoin and Crypto Wallet ‚ÄòFor Any Coin‚Äô in New Coinbase Partnership","The sixth-largest bank in the US just announced a strategic partnership with Coinbase in a push to massively expand digital asset access for banking clients and institutional investors. PNC says it will allow customers to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin and crypto assets while also providing banking and treasury management services for Coinbase. In a press release, PNC says it will roll out an ‚Äúinitial offering‚Äù to enable the purchase and custody of crypto assets. ‚ÄúThis partnership brings together PNC‚Äôs legacy of client service and innovation with the institutional-grade infrastructure of Coinbase‚Äôs Crypto-as-a-Service (Caas) platform to power secure, scalable crypto access for PNC‚Äôs clients.

2025-07-22T19:00:29,"Polymarket Finds Path Back To US Following Offshore Move","Crypto-based predictions marketplace Polymarket, has secured a deal to return to the US market shortly after federal regulators concluded their investigation into the company. The New York-based platform, known for enabling users to wager on various political and social outcomes such as the past US presidential election, has acquired QCX, a lesser-known derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, which will facilitate its legal re-entry into the US market. Polymarket‚Äôs US Re-Entry This acquisition comes on the heels of Polymarket‚Äôs rising popularity during the 2024 US presidential election, where users placed substantial bets on outcomes, particularly regarding President Donald Trump‚Äôs potential return to office. Earlier this month, both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) informed Polymarket that they had closed their probes into the company. These investigations focused on whether Polymarket had allowed US-based traders to access its platform, despite a settlement with the CFTC in 2022 that required the company to block such access due to its unregistered status. This development reflects a notable shift in US regulatory attitudes towards digital asset firms, particularly as the current administration appears more open to crypto-related initiatives compared to the previous Biden-era restrictions. Shifting Regulatory Landscape Polymarket gained significant public attention during the 2024 presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, with advertising and promotional materials widespread at the Republican National Convention and throughout New York City. Polymarket‚Äôs acquisition of QCX for $112 million aligns with this trend, as the exchange received Commodity Futures Trading Commission licensing approval in July, following its application in 2022. However, as Polymarket prepares to re-establish its presence in the US market, it faces increasing competition from other platforms like Crypto.com and Kalshi, both of which are registered with the CFTC and have begun offering their own betting contracts . Previously, the Biden administration had sought to limit the growth of political and sports-themed betting on derivatives exchanges, but the Trump administration has signaled a more favorable outlook toward these products. Bloomberg asserts that the approval of QCX‚Äôs license by the CFTC raises questions about whether the regulator was aware of Polymarket‚Äôs impending acquisition at the time. Notably, once a license is granted, the CFTC does not have the authority to intervene in subsequent business deals. Polymarket‚Äôs strategic maneuvering comes at a crucial time, as Brian Quintenz, a former Republican CFTC commissioner and head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs digital asset division , has been nominated to lead the agency. Quintenz‚Äôs nomination is set to be voted on by the Senate Agriculture Committee, with the White House advocating for swift confirmation before the August recess.

2025-07-22T19:00:07,"XRP Buyers in Full Control. Here‚Äôs What They‚Äôre Doing","XRP is surging with renewed strength as bullish momentum takes over the market. According to crypto analyst Xaif, buy-side pressure has intensified significantly, with the 90-day Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) turning green, a powerful signal that aggressive buyers are dominating trading activity across major spot exchanges. In his recent post on X, Xaif noted that the current trend reflects a decisive shift in market sentiment, stating, ‚ÄúBuy orders are dominating the market again,‚Äù and warning that the parabolic phase hasn‚Äôt even started yet . This suggests that XRP‚Äôs recent gains may just be the beginning of a much larger move to the upside. Strong Buy Pressure Signals Further Rally The Cumulative Volume Delta is a metric that measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders. A green CVD over 90 days indicates sustained buying pressure, as more traders are executing market buys than sells. This trend often precedes explosive price movements, especially when combined with a breakout above key resistance levels. XRP Buyers in Full Control! The 90-day Spot Taker CVD is green, showing buy orders dominating the market again! signaling more upside ahead. $XRP just hit multi-year highs above $3.66, and charts suggest the parabolic phase hasn‚Äôt even started yet. Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/4EOH9b0Nos ‚Äî ùïèaif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 22, 2025 In XRP‚Äôs case, the breakout has already begun. The asset recently climbed past $3.66, its highest level in several years. This move confirms the strength of the current uptrend and has positioned XRP for what could become a parabolic rally if momentum continues to build. With the Spot Taker CVD showing consistent accumulation by buyers, the outlook remains firmly bullish. Live Price and Technical Landscape As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.52, up 0.34% on the day. While the price is currently consolidating just below its multi-year high of $3.66, the structure remains intact for a further breakout. XRP is holding above key support levels and remains above its 21-period exponential moving average on the 1-hour chart. Technical patterns like the Cup & Handle, forming over the past several sessions, also support a continuation of the uptrend. Although momentum indicators such as the Stochastic RSI are nearing overbought levels, there are no immediate signs of exhaustion on higher timeframes, giving room for continued growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Context XRP‚Äôs rally is unfolding in a favorable macro environment. Bitcoin is currently holding steady above $118,500, while Ethereum trades above $3,700, both contributing to improved sentiment across the crypto space. With institutional inflows rising and regulatory clarity improving in several jurisdictions, XRP is well-positioned to benefit from the broader market‚Äôs strength. Xaif‚Äôs assessment highlights a critical inflection point: while XRP has already delivered impressive gains in 2025, the real explosive move may still lie ahead. The green 90-day Spot Taker CVD is more than just a bullish signal; it‚Äôs a confirmation that buyers are not only active, but in full control. If the parabolic phase is indeed just beginning , as Xaif suggests, XRP could be gearing up for its most significant rally in years.
