2025-05-15T15:00:00.000Z,"The AI revolution won’t be centralized — Superior agents are coming for Big Tech’s crown","Opinion by: Jennifer Dodgson, co-founder of KIP Protocol and Eigenform AIThe puppet show is ending.The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the many, superior agents operate like a new asset class that anyone can use to earn money passively.Not your grandmother’s AIYour grandma’s AI helps with writing emails and generates cute pictures. Self-learning AI writes its own code, develops its own strategies, generates profit, and continually evolves by evaluating itself against ungameable metrics. Benchmarking in accordance with information from the real world — like follower count on X or dollars earned — is how superior agents self-evaluate without manipulation.No coddling by unenlightened humans, no corporate oversight — just pure, unrestricted AI committed to achieving a goal. Consider a superior agent tasked with earning profit by autonomously trading cryptocurrency. Now, imagine that the agent loses money after attempting a “buy the dip” strategy. Capable of self-improvement, the agent pivots its strategy to something safer: holding a stablecoin in its portfolio.The distinction between everyday AI and superior agents becomes even more stark when considering how superior agents approach problem-solving. While predefined benchmarks and human intelligence constrain traditional AI, superior agents are unrestricted in synthesizing experiences, identifying patterns and creating novel approaches unlikely to be conceived by humans. AI agents that self-improve aren’t just a model upgrade — they fundamentally reimagine how AI operates when freed from human-imposed limitations.A market manipulation machineHere’s where it turns genuinely dystopian. Superior agents don’t just react to markets — they actively shape them. Researching trends, analyzing sentiment, executing trades and shilling tokens are possible simultaneously with superior agents. Recent: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in cryptoConsider the implications of AI that can autonomously promote FUD investments to serve its profit-making interests. Superior agents aren’t just trading bots — they’re financial entities that understand the value of controlling the narrative and influencing market psychology to affect the delicate interplay between sentiment and price action. Attention equals capital, and superior agents are engineered to manipulate both.Superior agents aren’t much like traditional market makers who must comply with regulations and may care about how other humans perceive them. These self-learning agents can coordinate across platforms, orchestrate multi-stage market movements, and leverage social sentiment in ways that would make most of Wall Street blush. Superior agents are entirely reshaping cryptocurrency market dynamics — with autonomous crypto trading being the first use case.The battle to decentralize AI The innovation potential associated with superior agents may be radical, but the underlying infrastructure design reveals that superior agents are built to benefit the many. Superior agents operate on a decentralized base layer that disaggregates AI data from AI models and AI application layers. What are the results of implementing this design? Contributions that support superior agents are fairly rewarded, and the benefits of advanced AI are broadly distributed. Anyone can leverage a superior agent to earn money from cryptocurrency trading, even without financial knowledge or trading skills. The decentralized nature of superior agents belies the falsehood of arguments by Big Tech positing that sophisticated AI needs near-unlimited, centralized resources such as massive server farms and corporate oversight. Superior agents prove that highly advanced, self-improving AI can operate efficiently with only modest infrastructure. Centralized and decentralized AI providers are battling for your attention and your data. Superior agents, not just autonomous but potentially unstoppable, are well positioned on the side of decentralization to ensure that your contributions to advanced intelligence are always rewarded. There are no puppet masters here — a core characteristic of superior agents is their widespread accessibility to everyone.The future is upon usThe value of the AI industry is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion by 2030 — assuming that AI stays trapped inside the walled gardens of Big Tech. With superior agents already disrupting cryptocurrency trading and a near-endless diversity of use cases associated with these agents, expect an AI market cap in 2030 that’s higher. Much higher.The AI revolution is upon us, but what does that ultimately mean? Artificial intelligence won’t be centralized. Nor will the battle for your eyeballs and data be safe. You may prefer to keep simping for your friendly neighborhood AI assistant or opt for AI with teeth — the choice is yours. Superior agents are multi-modal, multi-skilled, multi-platform — and always hungry.Opinion by: Jennifer Dodgson, co-founder of KIP Protocol and Eigenform AI.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-15T14:50:00.000Z,"What the 10-year Treasury yield means for crypto yields and stablecoins","Understanding the 10-year Treasury yield: Definition and  importance              The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to default), the 10-year yield is a benchmark for “risk-free” returns in finance.Why does this matter for crypto? Well, crypto yields and stablecoins are part of the broader financial world, and the 10-year yield influences investor behavior, which ripples into the crypto market. Let’s dive into howDid you know? The crypto market has a Fear & Greed Index that gauges investor sentiment. When the 10-year Treasury yield spikes, it often triggers “fear” as investors worry about tighter money and less crypto speculation.                  Impact of the 10-year Treasury yield on global financial markets              The 10-year Treasury yield isn’t just a US thing — it’s a heavyweight in global financial markets, influencing everything from stocks to currencies to emerging economies. Since the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency and Treasurys are a global safe haven, changes in the 10-year yield send shockwaves worldwide. Here’s how:Stock markets: Higher Treasury yields can pull money out of stocks, especially growth stocks like tech companies, because investors can get better returns from bonds. In 2021, when yields spiked, tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq took a hit as investors shifted to safer assets. This shift can set the stage for how investors approach riskier assets like crypto.Borrowing costs globally: The 10-year yield influences interest rates worldwide. When it rises, borrowing costs for companies and governments increase, which can slow economic growth. For example, in 2022, rising yields contributed to tighter financial conditions, impacting everything from corporate loans in Europe to mortgage rates in Asia.Currency markets: A higher 10-year yield strengthens the US dollar, as investors flock to dollar-denominated assets. A stronger dollar can make cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in dollars, more expensive for international investors, potentially dampening demand. It also puts pressure on emerging market currencies, as their debt (often dollar-denominated) becomes costlier to repay.Emerging markets: Countries with weaker economies rely on cheap borrowing. When Treasury yields rise, capital flows out of riskier emerging markets into US bonds, causing volatility in their stock and bond markets. This can spill over into crypto, as investors in these regions may sell crypto assets to cover losses elsewhere.Inflation and monetary policy: The 10-year yield is a barometer for inflation expectations. If yields rise because investors expect higher inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, tightening global liquidity. This can reduce speculative investment in assets like crypto, as seen in 2022 when aggressive rate hikes cooled markets.For crypto investors, this global impact sets the context. A rising 10-year yield might signal a tougher environment for crypto prices and yields, especially if global markets get shaky. Conversely, low yields often fuel risk-taking, boosting speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.                  Rising Treasury yields: Are safer returns stealing crypto’s yield appeal in 2025?              The 10-year Treasury yield, a critical indicator of global financial health, has shown notable volatility in 2025. As of May 9, 2025, the yield stands at approximately 4.37%-4.39%.The yield’s movement is driven by factors such as trade tensions, inflation expectations and Fed policy, with recent rate cuts not lowering yields as expected, diverging from historical trends.In the crypto space, yields are earned through activities like staking, lending and liquidity provision, often offering returns of 5%-10% or higher. However, the rising 10-year Treasury yield poses challenges. Research suggests that higher yields on safe assets can reduce demand for riskier crypto yields, as investors may prefer the stability of Treasurys. This competition for capital can lead to lower participation in crypto lending platforms, potentially pushing yields up to attract users, but overall market activity may decline. It is because many crypto platforms borrow money to operate, and their borrowing costs are tied to broader interest rates, which the 10-year yield influences. If rates rise, these platforms might pass on higher costs to users, affecting the yields you earn.                  How Treasury yields impact stablecoins              Stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) are closely tied to traditional finance because their value is often backed by assets like cash, bonds or — you guessed it — Treasury notes. Here’s how the 10-year yield impacts stablecoins:Backing assets: Many stablecoins, like USDC, hold US Treasurys in their reserves to maintain their $1 peg. Higher Treasury yields, now at 4.39%, mean that stablecoin reserves earn more income, which could theoretically be passed on to users as yields. Regulatory complexity: Regulatory frameworks in some countries complicate this. In the European Union, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation prohibits stablecoin issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) from offering interest to discourage their use as stores of value, though users can still generate yields through decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.Opportunity cost: If the 10-year yield is high, holding stablecoins (which often earn lower yields than riskier crypto) might seem less appealing compared to buying Treasurys directly. Investors might move money out of stablecoins, reducing the capital available for lending and potentially lowering stablecoin yields.Market sentiment: Rising Treasury yields often signal tighter monetary policy (like higher interest rates from the Fed), which can spook crypto markets. In 2023, for instance, when yields hit multi-year highs, crypto prices, including stablecoin-related tokens, felt the pressure as investors grew cautious. This can indirectly affect the yields you earn on stablecoins, as platforms adjust to market conditions.DeFi dynamics: In decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins are the backbone of lending and trading. If Treasury yields rise and traditional finance looks more attractive, DeFi platforms might see less activity, which could lower the yields on stablecoin pools. On the flip side, some DeFi protocols might boost yields to keep users engaged.Notably, there is a growing push for regulations that allow stablecoins to share yields with users, particularly in jurisdictions like the UK and US, where legislative efforts are ongoing. This debate is crucial, as allowing yield sharing could enhance stablecoin adoption, leveraging higher Treasury income, but regulatory clarity is needed to avoid legal risks.Did you know? Liechtenstein was one of the first countries to pass a full-fledged blockchain law — the “Blockchain Act” — in 2020.                  USDC vs. US Treasurys: Where should you park your money?              USDC staking offers higher but variable yields with moderate risk, while US Treasurys provide stable, low-risk returns backed by the government.When users stake USDC — by lending it on platforms like Aave or Coinbase — they earn variable returns, typically between 4% and 7% APY, depending on demand and platform risk.US Treasurys, especially 10-year notes, offer a fixed return; the yield stands at approximately 4.37%-4.39%. These securities are backed by the US government, making them one of the safest investments.While USDC can offer higher yields, it comes with added risks like smart contract bugs, platform failures and regulatory changes. Treasurys, though safer, offer limited upside.                  Implications of rising Treasury yields for crypto investors              For crypto investors, higher Treasury yields may reduce risk appetite, but tokenized Treasurys provide a secure alternative. If you’re thinking about staking your Ether (ETH) or lending USDC, knowing what’s happening with Treasury yields can give you a heads-up on whether yields might rise, fall or come with extra risks.For example:If yields are rising, it might be a sign that crypto yields could get more competitive, but it could also mean global markets are getting jittery. You might want to stick to stablecoins or safer platforms.If yields are low, investors might pour money into crypto, boosting yields but also increasing volatility. This could be a chance to earn more, but you’ll need to watch for risks.Plus, if you’re using stablecoins to park your cash or earn a little extra, the 10-year yield can hint at whether those yields will stay attractive or if you might find better returns elsewhere. And with its global reach, the yield can signal broader economic shifts that might affect your crypto strategy.Also, stablecoin holders may benefit from higher reserve income if regulations evolve to allow yield sharing, particularly in the US, though EU restrictions push yield generation to DeFi. Alternatively, traditional investors can explore tokenized Treasurys for blockchain-based Treasury exposure, potentially integrating them into broader portfolios as regulatory clarity emerges.A notable development in 2025 is the rise of tokenized Treasurys, digital representations of US Treasury bonds on blockchains. As of May 4, 2025, the total value of tokenized Treasurys has reached $6.5 billion, with an average yield to maturity of 4.13%, according to analytics from RWA.xyz. This trend offers crypto investors a way to earn yields comparable to traditional bonds, potentially mitigating the impact of rising Treasury yields on crypto markets.Moreover, the emergence of tokenized Treasurys signals a blurring of lines between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. These blockchain-native representations of government debt instruments not only offer yield stability but also reflect a broader trend: the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) into crypto markets. This development has the potential to reshape risk management practices, attract more conservative capital, and accelerate regulatory engagement with digital assets.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-the-10-year-treasury-yield-means-for-crypto-yields-and-stablecoins?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-15T14:02:30.000Z,"Tether blacklist delay allowed $78M in illicit USDT transfers: Report","A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.Tether’s blacklisting procedure is a multi-step process with a first transaction effectively warning of the upcoming blacklisting. First, a Tether administrator multisignature transaction submits a pending call to “addBlackList” on the USDT-TRC20 contract.This results in a public “submission” of the target address as a blacklist candidate. This is followed by a second multisignature transaction confirming the submission, resulting in an “AddedBlackList” emission, making the blacklisting effective.Related: Tether, Tron and TRM Labs jointly froze $126M USDT in 2024A warning on incoming blacklistingIn one example shared with Cointelegraph, an onchain transaction submitting a Tron address as a blacklist candidate took place at 11:10:12 UTC. The second transaction that actually enforced the action did not occur until 11:54:51 UTC on the same day, a 44-minute delay. In practice, this delay can be treated by owners of USDt about to be blacklisted as a notice to move their assets to avoid them being frozen. The report stated:“This delay between a freeze request and its on-chain execution creates a critical attack window, allowing malicious actors to front-run enforcement and move or launder funds before the freeze takes effect.“Example of USDt blacklisting transactions. Source: AMLBotThe report says that “for blockchain-savvy attackers, these delays are golden.” By tracking Tether’s calls in real time, a fraudster can be instantly alerted that their address is being targeted. When asked by Cointelegraph whether the delay is a technical limitation or just a delay in the actions of a multisignature wallet key holder, AMLBot researchers said that they cannot determine it without knowledge of Tether’s internal procedures.Tether had not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment at time publication.Related: Tether stablecoin issuer and Tron launch financial crime unitNot just theoreticalAMLBot said its data shows that over $28.5 million in USDT was withdrawn during the delay between the two transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This amount of freeze avoidance occurred between Nov. 28, 2017, and May 12, 2025. The average amount moved during the delay exceeded $365,000.Similarly, $49.6 million was reportedly withdrawn during freeze delay windows on the Tron blockchain, resulting in a total on Ethereum and Tron of $78.1 million. Exploiting this delay on Tron is not particularly rare, according to AMLBot:“170 out of 3,480 wallets (4.88%) on Tron blockchain exploited the lag before getting blacklisted. Each of these wallets made 2–3 transfers during the delay, withdrawing: Average: $291,970.“Tether has previously promoted its ability to freeze assets as a compliance feature. In 2024, Tether, Tron, and analytics firm TRM Labs cooperated to freeze over $126 million in USDT linked to illicit activity.Still, the AMLBot report raises questions about the effectiveness and speed of those enforcement actions.Magazine: Chinese Tether laundromat, Bhutan enjoys recent Bitcoin boost: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-blacklist-delay-allowed-78-million-usdt-move?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-15T13:59:32.000Z,"Bitcoin mining 2025: Post-halving profitability, hashrate and energy trends","After the 2024 halving, Bitcoin mining entered its fifth epoch and block rewards were reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This forced miners to rethink their operations, optimize efficiency, cut energy costs and upgrade hardware to remain profitable. Cointelegraph Research, with insights from industry experts at Uminers, examines this transformation in its latest report. The analysis covers ASIC efficiency improvements, corporate performance, geographical expansion and new revenue models. As miners adapt, Bitcoin moves into a new era where institutional momentum and sovereign adoption could redefine its role in the global financial system.Download the full report to uncover how miners are navigating this shift and what the future holds for Bitcoin’s mining industry.The mining industry’s response to rising hashrate and shrinking marginsDespite the adverse financial impact of the halving, Bitcoin’s network hashrate has continued to climb. As of May 1, 2025, the total computational power of the network reached 831 EH/s. Earlier in the month, hashrate peaked at 921 EH/s, marking a 77% increase from the 2024 low of 519 EH/s. This rapid recovery underscores the industry's relentless drive for efficiency as larger mining firms reinvest in fleet upgrades and energy optimization to maintain profitability.The mining arms race has always revolved around power efficiency. With energy costs rising, the latest ASIC models from Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan are further optimizing the energy required per hash. Bitmain’s Antminer S21+ delivers 216 TH/s at 16.5 J/TH, while MicroBT’s WhatsMiner M66S+ pushes immersion-cooled performance to 17 J/TH. Meanwhile,  semiconductor giants TSMC and Samsung are driving the next wave of innovation, with 3-nm chips already in use and 2-nm technology on the horizon. Post-halving profitability: The global shift toward low-cost energyBitcoin mining profitability has tightened significantly post-halving. Hashprice, the daily revenue per terahash per second, dropped from $0.12 in April 2024 to about $0.049 by April 2025. At the same time, network difficulty has surged to an all-time high of 123T, making it harder for miners to generate returns. To stay competitive, operations must extract maximum value from every watt of power consumed. This shift has intensified the search for cheap, reliable power, driving mining expansion into regions where energy costs remain low.Electricity pricing now dictates mining profitability. In Oman, licensed miners benefit from government-backed subsidies, securing electricity at $0.05–$0.07 per kWh, while in the UAE, semi-governmental projects operate at even lower rates of $0.035–$0.045 per kWh. These incentives have turned the region into a prime destination for institutional-scale mining. Meanwhile, in the US, where industrial power costs often exceed $0.1 per kWh, miners face shrinking margins, forcing a migration toward more cost-efficient locations. Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have emerged as key battlegrounds in this race, offering the energy arbitrage opportunities miners need to survive.Download the full report to uncover how miners are navigating this shift and what the future holds for Bitcoin’s mining industry.What’s next for Bitcoin mining?The 2024 halving has reinforced a hard truth: Efficiency is no longer optional; it’s a necessity. The industry is shifting toward leaner, more optimized operations, where only the most power-efficient miners can thrive. The rise of AI computing, global regulatory shifts and ongoing hardware advancements will continue to shape the sector over the next 12–18 months.Cointelegraph Research’s Bitcoin mining report: Post-halving insights and trends offers a data-driven breakdown of the key forces shaping mining profitability, infrastructure investments, and strategic decision-making.Download the full report to uncover how miners are navigating this shift and what the future holds for Bitcoin’s mining industry.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply would surpass Ethereum’s USDT supply. In terms of circulating supply, Tron also has the lead with $73.6 billion USDT on the network, while Ethereum only has $71.8 billion. Source: PeckShieldAlertTether’s USDT mints replenish the company’s token inventoryTether CEO Paolo Ardoino previously said on X that some of the company’s blockchain-based USDT mints are used to replenish their USDT inventory on blockchain networks. This means the tokens will be used for the next batch of issuance requests and chain swaps. In traditional business settings, inventory replenishment requires stock orders to meet demands. Similarly, Tether may mint USDT to maintain a sufficient supply and hold on to the assets until they are issued officially. This ensures that the firm’s liquidity management is smooth. This means that authorized USDT supply on a network means that the stablecoin issuer anticipates future issuance demand of the stablecoin on a blockchain. Related: Altcoins’ roaring returns and falling USDT stablecoin dominance suggest ‘altseason’ is hereEthereum and Tron battle for USDT supply dominanceTron led USDT circulation between July 2022 and November 2024.

2025-05-15T13:38:54.000Z,"Tariff doubts push NFL, NBA to bet big on digital merch","As more and more businesses are impacted by tariff volatility, some executives, like Ridhima Kahn, vice president of business development at Dapper Labs, are viewing the assault on the cost of physical goods as another use case for digital markets powered by blockchain to shine.“I’m seeing a lot of brands rethinking where revenue and fan engagement come from,” Kahn said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “A lot of franchises, like the ones we work with — NBA, NFL, Disney — have already had years of success with digital collection, and we’re seeing a lot of brands express interest in digital collectibles as a way to engage with fan bases at a time when physical costs are riskier and unknown.”Propelling brands to take a deeper look at digital merch is the desire to better understand fandom. Flow now has tradable highlights like a “LeBron Dunk” or a “Steph Curry 3-Pointer” that live inside the NBA app and has commemorative NFTs tied to NFL game highlights in NFL All Day.But with Super Bowl ticket stubs and other digital mementos powered by blockchain, digital goods are proving they can unlock deeper in real life (IRL) fan experiences, courtside or on the field.“When you look at the amount of time folks are spending online or in digital environments, it’s only increasing,” Kahn said. “That’s really motivating brands to identify where their fans are spending time and where they can reach them where they’re at. It’s also a great way to engage a more global fan base simultaneously, versus in a more limiting, geo-targeted way, which caters more toward the global fan bases that want to engage with these brands.”Digital as a go-to-market strategyBecause fan bases have become more globalized, the online experience just happens to offer a faster, more accessible environment for digital goods, particularly collectibles, versus the current marketplace for physical goods that’s being hampered by enigmatic tariffs.Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?“Average NFT sales are up 7% quarter-over-quarter, with NFL All Day and NBA Top Shot delivering $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively,” Kahn said. “We’re also seeing total value locked (TVL) at an all-time high of $44.4 million on Flow, led by protocols like KittyPunch and other markets that offer next-gen investing and trading opportunities — a trend that’s signaling a broadening use case for blockchain and crypto beyond just NFTs.”Helping broaden the blockchain use case is the recently enhanced onramping and offramping technology that’s permeated throughout the industry, enabling a smoother user experience for those getting started in crypto and the world of digital commodities than what was available three years earlier.Per Kahn:A lot of blockchain companies are realizing the number of users they can have is capped if they don’t enhance the user experience. We’re seeing the enhanced user experience as a core driver of adoption, and from a regulatory standpoint, the positive moment for blockchain is also really exciting.NBA Top Shot sales have dropped significantly since 2022, but the start of the 2024-2025 season reignited interest. Source: FlowLess fear, more utility As more defined blockchain regulation is established, companies that might have initially been skeptical of blockchain are now taking it more seriously because regulators are taking it more seriously, helping boost confidence in the tech, especially among well-known brands.“IP-backed collections are winning,” Kahn said. “Upon Flow’s recent integration with OpenSea, NBA Top Shot was ranked among OpenSea’s top-five trending collections for four consecutive weeks. We go deep into specific fan bases to understand user behavior, and we A/B test our experiences, meaning the products we ultimately put out to market for fans are very well-vetted to ensure they’re actually what fans want.”Kahn and Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou took a group of VIP collectors during the NBA’s in-season tournament to dinner and openly solicited their opinions on what they wanted to see more of on the platform. It’s the kind of swift, efficient, real-life research and development (R&D) that can more easily impact the end product, because the end product is digital.Related: 4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto markets“We take those insights back to our product team, and we embed those insights into our product to ensure we’re creating the best fan experience, agnostic of the technology we’re using to get there,” Kahn said. “It’s about what the fans want, and we leverage blockchain technology to deliver the fan experiences people might not be able to get elsewhere.”Elsewhere being the physical goods market.“The technology in our products really fades into the background, and what’s left is a collectible that feels meaningful, shareable and valuable,” Kahn said. “Digital collectibles unlock layers of engagement that physical goods cannot: They can be personalized, connected to real-world access, or used to reward loyalty for years and years to come. They’re also remixable, lightweight and global from day one.”But Khan doesn’t believe the physical goods market is going to go by the wayside anytime soon.I don’t think brands are turning their backs on merchandise. It’s more about expanding the playbook and looking to one of the few revenue streams immune to the volatility of physical goods as a way to engage with fans further.Outside of the internet, sports and media fans are limited to where they are physically when it comes to purchasing a physical good and where they can take that physical good. But Kahn believes the next evolution of fandom is mobile.“We love the concept of being able to take your most prized possessions with you on your phone, wherever you are,” Kahn said. “Being limited to trading in a physical environment isn’t nearly as fun as being able to trade wherever you are with people all across the world.”Moving forward, Kahn believes brands will continue to expand their playbooks by engaging more with fans in digital spaces.“Consumers are also going to be more willing to adopt new ways to engage with brands in digital spaces if the value proposition is there,” Kahn said. “If we’re able to continue to offer utility to fans for what they do in a digital space — and what they do in a digital space benefits them in a physical world — that’s going to be the recipe for success.”Magazine: Crypto ‘more taboo than OnlyFans,’ says Violetta Zironi, who sold song for 1 BTC",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tariff-doubts-nfl-nba-bet-big-digital-merch?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-15T13:30:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Season 2: Why the next wave of Bitcoin innovation is all about utility","Bitcoin’s (BTC) next evolution isn’t just about price. It’s about potential. On this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Isabel Foxen Duke, general partner at Unbroken Chain and longtime Bitcoin advocate, to unpack what she calls “Bitcoin Season 2.”Bitcoin beyond money“Bitcoin Season 2 is really about seeing what we can do with Bitcoin outside of just being money,” said Duke. “What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?”New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value. One key innovation under discussion is trustless lending — allowing users to borrow against their Bitcoin without involving third-party intermediaries. “We don’t have the ability to lend against our Bitcoin in a trustless way without third-party intermediaries,” Duke said. “I would argue that is the second most important and second most used use case in the real world other than making payments.”Lending on BitcoinOne emerging solution involves Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which let users maintain control of their Bitcoin while locking it as collateral. Smart contract logic enforces repayment, not a central authority. “That’s proven by math rather than trust,” Duke said.Related: Bitcoin looks ‘ridiculous’ as bulls attempt $2T market cap flip — AnalystDuke said she is equally excited about trustless bridging, which could allow Bitcoin to interact with external computation platforms without compromising its decentralized ethos. “If you could use Bitcoin not just as money but as a base asset that can trustlessly plug into any financial system, that would be… the end of the road for this asset.”Looking ahead, Jenkinson highlighted how Bitcoin-native DeFi could unlock real-world financial access for people excluded from traditional banking. “A few little changes to some lines of code might just unlock [permissionless finance] for all of us,” he said. “And that’s the kind of future I’m hopeful about.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

It trades 6% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached on Jan. 20. Nevertheless, several fundamental, onchain and technical metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s upside is not over.Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows mirror past BTC ralliesBitcoin’s latest recovery was accompanied by high investor appetite for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recorded $2.9 billion in net inflows over the last two weeks.The chart below shows that after the launch of the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, these investment products saw net inflows of approximately $8.5 billion between Feb. 13, 2024, and March 13, 2024, peaking at a record single-day inflow of $1.045 billion on March 12, 2024.Spot Bitcoin ETF flows. Source: Glassnode Similarly, between Nov. 6, 2024, and Dec. 16, 2024, cumulative daily inflows hit $5.7 billion, aligning with Bitcoin’s 60% rally from $67,000 to $108,000 over the same period. If ETF inflows continue, Bitcoin is likely to resume its uptrend toward new all-time highs. Bitcoin market volatility index: risk-onIncreased inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs signal high risk-on sentiment, as evidenced by a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures 30-day market volatility expectations.Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson highlighted that the VIX index has dropped substantially from 55 to 18 over the past 25 trading days.A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. The analyst said:“This will be a 'risk on' environment for the foreseeable future.”CBOE Volatility Index. Source: Timothy PetersonPeterson’s model, which has a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low.Strong Bitcoin accumulation continuesReinforcing the risk-on sentiment are Bitcoin whales, who have been increasing their holdings even as the price rallied. Glassnode data shows the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score (ATS) at 1 (see chart below), which signifies intense accumulation by large investorsAccording to Glassnode, the spike in trend score indicates a transition from distribution to accumulation across almost all cohorts. This shift mirrors a similar accumulation pattern observed in October 2024, which preceded Bitcoin’s rise from $67,000 to $108,000, spurred by US President Donald Trump’s election victory.Bitcoin accumulation trend score.

Source: CryptoQuantDecreasing BTC balances on exchanges simply means investors could be withdrawing their tokens into self-custody wallets, indicating a lack of intention to sell in anticipation of a future price increase.Increasing network activityBitcoin’s potential to rise higher is supported by high network activity, as highlighted by crypto investor Ted Boydston in a May 15 post on X. The Bitcoin transaction volume Z-Score measures the difference between the current transaction volume and the average. It is often used to gauge network activity and market interest.The chart below shows the metric has risen sharply from the negative zone and is approaching 1. A rising transaction volume Z-score, especially when it approaches or exceeds 1, is historically associated with Bitcoin price rallies.“This is a good sign for Bitcoin price acceleration,” remarked Boydsto, adding:“Bitcoin should be full bull once the Z-Score breaches 1.”Source: Ted BoydstonBTC rounded bottom pattern targets $140KFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price has formed a rounded bottom chart pattern on the daily chart (see below). Bills are now focused on pushing the price above the neckline of the governing chart pattern at $106,660.A daily candlestick close above this level would confirm a bullish breakout from the rounded bottom formation, ushering BTC into price discovery with the technical target set at $140,000 or a 37% increase from the current level.A daily candlestick close above this level would confirm a breakout into price discovery, with the technical target set at $140,000 or a 37% increase from the current level.BTC/USD daily chart.

2025-05-15T12:09:08.000Z,"Jim Chanos takes opposing bets on Bitcoin and Strategy","Prominent short-seller Jim Chanos, once a vocal critic of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, revealed a new trading play that involves shorting shares of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and buying Bitcoin.At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos told CNBC he’s “selling MicroStrategy stock and buying Bitcoin.” The investor described the move as buying something for $1 and selling something for $2.50, referring to what he sees as a significant price mismatch.Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of retail speculation.”Selling Strategy stock to buy BitcoinChanos’ recent move assumes investors overpay for Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers like Strategy and other firms that follow its Bitcoin accumulation blueprint. The investor’s move reflects a stance that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing Strategy’s stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Chanos’ move suggests that holding Bitcoin through companies reflects excessive speculation and risk mispricing. It assumes that retail investors’ idea of having Bitcoin indirectly through corporate wrappers can inflate the company’s stock valuations. While shorting Strategy may seem like a good idea, investors have already lost billions shorting Saylor’s company. In 2024, investors who bet against the firm lost about $3.3 billion as the stock rose. As of May 2025, Strategy holds about 568,840 Bitcoin, valued at around $59 billion. Since the company started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, its stock price has surged by 1,500%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gains during the same period. In a recently released documentary from the Financial Times, Strategy analyst Jeff Walton said that the company’s Bitcoin holdings would help it become the “number one publicly traded equity in the entire market” in the future.Chanos previously called Bitcoin a “libertarian fantasy”  Chanos has not always been favorable toward Bitcoin. In a 2018 interview, Chanos described Bitcoin as a “libertarian fantasy.” Chanos said that having digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario wouldn’t work. The investor said that if fiat currency brings the world down, the last thing he’d want to own is Bitcoin. “Food would work the best,” he said. He also criticized Bitcoin for enabling illicit activity, calling the crypto sector “the dark side of finance” in a 2023 interview, and accusing the industry of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.Chanos also expressed skepticism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), saying that Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in crypto to profit from the fees. Despite those critiques, Chanos now appears to see value in holding Bitcoin directly, particularly in contrast to investing in public companies with large BTC treasuries.Related: $1B Bitcoin exits Coinbase in a day as analysts warn of supply shockChanos’ history in short-sellingChanos is best known for his short position against the energy company Enron before the firm filed for bankruptcy in 2001. The move generated profits for Kynikos Associates, a firm that he founded. A short position involves borrowing assets from a broker, selling them at the current price, and then repurchasing the assets once the value falls to give back what is owed to the broker. Short sellers profit when the asset’s value declines, but face losses when the asset appreciates. While the investor profited from short-selling Enron, Chanos’ predictions weren’t always correct. Chanos was bearish on Tesla and announced a short position in 2016. Tesla stock skyrocketed by 2,200% between 2015 and 2021. The event caused major losses to Chanos’ fund. In 2020, the fund ended with $405 million in assets under management after having over $900 million the previous year. The fund was converted into a family office, and external assets were returned to investors. Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chanos-shorts-microstrategy-buys-bitcoin-retail-speculation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-15T10:00:00.000Z,"Pareto launches synthetic dollar backed by private credit","Private credit marketplace Pareto has introduced a new synthetic dollar aimed at linking institutional investors with decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities — a move that highlights the expanding role of stablecoins in global finance.The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT), which are then held as collateral.“USP is backed 1:1 by the stablecoins used during the minting process,” Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants.To maintain its peg to the US dollar, Pareto uses what it calls a “native backing” process. Each USP token is minted only when an equivalent amount of USDC or USDT is deposited, ensuring full collateralization when the token is created. An arbitrage mechanism also supports the dollar peg’s ongoing stability.In addition, Pareto has set up a protocol-funded stability reserve to act as a buffer in case of borrower defaults.Related: Coinbase invests in Canadian stablecoin issuerInstitutional entry into RWA credit marketThe company said the synthetic dollar gives institutional investors a regulated onchain entry point into real-world asset (RWA) credit markets — a segment of the tokenization industry that has expanded rapidly over the past year. Recent examples of private credit tokenization include Tradable’s portfolio of 30 credit positions and Apollo’s Diversified Credit Securitize Fund.When asked about the potential risks of connecting DeFi to the often opaque private credit sector, Pareto acknowledged the concern but emphasized its approach to risk management.“That’s a fair concern, but Pareto was specifically built to address the inefficiencies and opacity that have historically plagued traditional credit markets,” Pandolfi said, adding:“By bringing private credit onchain, we enable real-time transparency, programmable risk management, and automated settlement while reducing counterparty risk and operational friction.”A chart highlighting the growth of the tokenized credit market.

2025-05-15T09:02:00.000Z,"Coinbase’s x402: Crypto payments over HTTP for AI and APIs","What is HTTP 402, and why does it matter?              The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.HTTP status codes: A quick refresherUnderstanding HTTP status codes helps clarify how the web communicates behind the scenes. Here are some key ones to know:HTTP 200 — OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.HTTP 401 — Unauthorized: Indicates the request requires user authentication; typically used when credentials are missing or invalid.HTTP 403 — Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it (often due to lack of permissions or access control).HTTP 404 — Not found: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found.HTTP 402 — Payment required: Originally intended to support digital payments directly within the protocol but left as a “reserved for future use” status code due to the lack of global payment infrastructure at the time.HTTP 500 — Internal server error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.Although the creators of the web imagined a future where online services might request payments directly through the protocol, for decades, no one found a practical use for it. It sat dormant for over 25 years, with no widespread adoption or defined behavior.Today, HTTP 402 is finally coming to life, thanks to Coinbase’s x402 protocol. X402 turns HTTP 402 from a placeholder into a real mechanism. It allows websites, APIs and services to signal that a payment is required before granting access to digital goods or services.Unlike traditional payment systems, which rely on external redirects or complex integrations, x402 enables native, in-protocol payments using stablecoins directly over HTTP.But why do x402 and the activation of HTTP 402 matter?With machine-to-machine interactions, autonomous agents and AI-driven services on the rise, the internet needs a payment layer that is:InstantProgrammableInteroperableTrust-minimized.Activating HTTP 402 positions it as a key enabler for decentralized commerce, autonomous agents and crypto-native applications. It could become as foundational as HTTP 200 or 404 in a future where services charge micro-fees, stream value or sell access dynamically.                  Coinbase x402: A native payment layer for the web              Coinbase’s x402 is an open protocol that allows websites and APIs to request and receive payments in stablecoins directly over HTTP. It works by using the existing HTTP infrastructure and augmenting it with a lightweight payment layer. Here is the step-by-step process for machine-to-machine transactions using the x402 protocol:Client requests a paid resource: A client, such as an AI agent, app, or browser initiates a request to an x402-enabled server (e.g., an API, data set or digital service) that requires payment to access.The server responds with a 402 Payment Required: In response, the server returns an HTTP 402 status code, along with the payment details. This includes the amount to be paid, the supported token (such as USDC) and a payment payload or address to use.Client submits the payment: The client uses its crypto wallet to sign and submit the payment. This happens programmatically — no user interaction is needed, which enables fully automated or agentic payments. It resends the original request, this time including the encoded payment information in an X-PAYMENT HTTP header.The payment is verified and settled onchain: A payment facilitator service, such as Coinbase’s x402 Facilitator, checks the blockchain to verify that the payment has been made and confirmed.The server delivers the resource: Once the payment is validated, the server fulfills the request and returns the data or content. It also includes an X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header confirming the success of the transaction.In x402, payments happen over standard HTTP using two custom headers: X-PAYMENT and X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE. These headers allow seamless, automated payments between apps, agents and servers — without changing how HTTP works. It’s a simple yet powerful way to enable web-native, machine-to-machine commerce using stablecoins.What makes x402 revolutionary is that it doesn’t require platforms, plugins or third-party integrations. It creates a native payment layer for the web itself, just like HTTPS added security or cookies enabled session management.Did you know? HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the foundational protocol used to transfer data on the web.                  What are agentic payments, and why are they important?              As AI systems become more advanced, the agentic era has begun. In this new paradigm, software agents, ranging from AI bots to autonomous scripts, are expected to act on behalf of users or even independently. AI agents will need to perform actions like accessing data, subscribing to services or renting compute power. And all of these tasks often require payments.This is where the concept of agentic payments comes in. These are payments made by agents, not humans — fast, automatic and often low-value. Think of a data-scraping AI paying a cent to read a scientific article or a supply chain bot paying fractions of a dollar for live port data.Traditional payment infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of use case. It falls short because of the below reasons:Built for humans, not machines.Requires logins, manual steps and batch processing.High fees and slow settlement times make them unsuitable for high-frequency, low-value, autonomous transactions.Because of the limitations of traditional payment systems, agentic payments matter for several key reasons:They enable a machine-first economy, where software can transact just like humans.Make real-time AI decision-making possible by removing friction from access to paid services.Pave the way for composable services, where agents can chain together paid APIs and tools autonomously.As discussed, such payments require machine-readable protocols, instant settlement and predictable pricing, all of which x402 enables. It’s a vital step in building a transactional layer for a machine-first internet.                  x402 vs. traditional payment systems              Today’s online payment systems are deeply human-centric. Whether it’s signing up for a subscription, entering credit card information or passing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, the current infrastructure assumes a person is at the center of every transaction.This design becomes a bottleneck when payments need to be made automatically, in real time and at scale. APIs that want to monetize often face hurdles like creating user accounts, handling fraud, managing disputes and integrating with centralized processors like Stripe or PayPal. These systems are slow, costly and often region-specific.X402 removes these barriers by allowing servers to ask for and receive payment directly through the protocol itself. There’s no need for logins, billing dashboards or delayed bank transfers. The value transfer is embedded into the fabric of the internet, optimized for agents and apps.The contrast between x402 and traditional payment infrastructure is stark. While x402 is protocol-first, built on crypto rails, systems like Visa, Stripe and PayPal are platform-first. X402 enables payments to settle in seconds using onchain transactions, while traditional rails typically settle over one to three business days.Moreover, x402 supports micropayments as small as fractions of a cent, making it viable for high-frequency, low-cost interactions — something that’s infeasible on credit card networks due to fees. It’s also global by design, requiring no currency conversions or regional banking relationships. Chargebacks, fraud risk and intermediary fees are virtually eliminated, thanks to the immutability of onchain transfers.Where traditional systems focus on human users with front-end interfaces, x402 enables machine-native, backend-to-backend monetization.Did you know? You can detect HTTP 402 responses using tools like Sitechecker Pro, which scans your site like a search bot and flags unusual status codes — including payment-related ones.                  Incumbents’ act: How Visa, Stripe and PayPal are exploring AI-powered payments              To be fair, incumbents aren’t ignoring this trend. Visa, Stripe and PayPal have all acted to be in line with the trend and incorporate appropriate changes in their approach.VisaVisa has announced initiatives to allow AI agents to make purchases on behalf of users by linking them to its global payments network. This move aims to facilitate autonomous AI assistants capable of performing shopping tasks, such as managing routine purchases, based on user-defined budgets and preferences.In partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider, Visa is launching stablecoin-linked Visa cards across multiple countries in Latin America. This collaboration enables users to make everyday purchases using cryptocurrency tokens, with plans to expand to Europe, Africa and Asia in the coming months.StripeStripe has unveiled a new AI foundation model aimed at improving fraud detection and authorization rates. This model, trained on billions of transactions, has significantly increased the detection rate for fraudulent activities, such as card-testing attacks, enhancing the security of its payment systems.Stripe has introduced Stablecoin Financial Accounts, allowing businesses in over 100 countries to hold balances in dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDB. These accounts support global payments and enable firms to manage stablecoins alongside traditional payment methods. PayPalPayPal is set to launch a rewards program offering users a 3.7% annual yield on holdings of its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in PayPal or Venmo wallets. This initiative aims to encourage the adoption and utilization of PYUSD for various transactions, including merchant payments and peer-to-peer transfers.PayPal has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption and utilization of PYUSD. This collaboration focuses on developing stablecoin-based payments and banking solutions, as well as exploring other use cases for PYUSD in DeFi and onchain platforms.Protocols vs. platforms: The distinct approachesWhile Visa, Stripe and PayPal are making significant strides in integrating AI and stablecoins into their services, these companies still operate within walled gardens. They offer services, not protocols. Their infrastructures are:Centralized: Governed by corporate policies and APIs.Permissioned: Access requires onboarding, KYC and platform approval.Closed ecosystems: Where user experience and interoperability are tightly controlled.In contrast, x402 is permissionless and open, allowing any developer to plug into it without needing a merchant account. And the distinction between centralized services and open protocols like x402 will play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of digital payments, potentially leading to a more decentralized and agent-driven economy.                  What is x402’s monetization model?              One of the most practical use cases for x402 is API monetization. In today’s model, developers must create keys, handle access tiers, and enforce rate limits manually. With x402, APIs can simply respond to unauthenticated requests with a 402, indicating a cost, for example, $0.001 to access a data endpoint.A client can then send the required stablecoin payment and receive the response instantly. This turns APIs into microservices with embedded pricing, enabling fine-grained monetization at the level of individual function calls. It’s a model that fits naturally with both AI workloads and human developers who want to pay only for what they use.Stablecoins like USDC are central to the success of x402 and agentic payments more broadly. Their key benefit is price stability, allowing developers and agents to transact in predictable units without worrying about crypto volatility. That’s critical for applications that operate with tight budgets or usage-based pricing.USDC also offers fast finality, especially on chains like Base, Solana and Ethereum layer 2s, where transfers can confirm in seconds with minimal fees. Its broad support across wallets, APIs and ecosystems makes it a practical choice for integration. Other stablecoins like PYUSD or EURC may become relevant, but USDC’s dominance in DeFi and institutional finance gives it a clear head start.                  Challenges and opportunities for agentic payments              Agentic payments raise important questions around security, like how can bots manage private keys safely? There’s also the issue of abuse — will bad actors flood servers with fake payments or exploit pricing models? Regulatory concerns also loom.But the upside is enormous. The emergence of a machine-to-machine economy has led to a situation where agents transact for data, compute, bandwidth and services without human input. Protocols like x402 are the rails that will power this fast, open and crypto-native economy.Coinbase’s x402 is more than a technical upgrade; it’s a new payment primitive for the programmable web. By bringing crypto payments over HTTP to AI agents and APIs, x402 transforms how the internet handles value. It opens the door to a future where transactions are embedded, automatic and driven by machines, not just people. As the digital economy evolves, protocols like x402 could become the foundation of the new internet, powered by a new-age financial infrastructure.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbases-x402-crypto-payments-over-http-for-ai-and-apis?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-15T09:01:03.000Z,"Nasdaq-listed BTCS to boost ETH holdings with $57.8M raise","Publicly traded company BTCS announced a $57.8 million financing agreement led by investment firm ATW Partners to purchase Ether as it expands its blockchain infrastructure strategy. The Rockville, Maryland-based company announced the deal on May 14, saying that the move will allow it to expand validator node operations and build recurring revenue from Ether (ETH) staking.BTCS CEO Charles Allen said the move follows Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) high-profile Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation blueprint and will leverage Ethereum for long-term growth. “We are executing a disciplined strategy to increase our Ethereum exposure and drive recurring revenue through staking and our block building operations,” Allen said.Source: BTCSBTCS issues initial $7.8 million convertible notesAs part of the agreement, BTCS issued an initial $7.8 million tranche in convertible notes, with the option to draw an additional $50 million in funding subject to mutual agreement.  The notes are convertible to BTCS common stock at a fixed price of $5.85 per share, almost 200% more than the company’s $1.99 stock price on May 13. The notes carry a two-year maturity and a 6% annual interest rate. This means that BTCS has two years to repay the loan if it’s not converted into stock, and that while the notes are active, the company will pay 6% in interest yearly. In simple terms, investors are betting that BTCS stock will rise. In exchange, the company gains access to capital for scaling its Ethereum operations.  Investors also received an option to buy 1.9 million shares at $2.75 each for the next five years. This is much higher than the current stock price but lower than the conversion rate stated in the agreement. The financing agreement follows the company’s recent use of the lending protocol Aave to borrow funds to acquire ETH. However, the company did not disclose in the announcement how much ETH it had acquired through the protocol.

2025-05-15T09:00:00.000Z,"The value of virtual: Economies are powered by ownership of the intangible","Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca BrandsA discussion on digital property rights, copyright, intellectual property, the open metaverse, AI and value without physical form.When I attend conferences and similar public events, someone almost always approaches me to ask how cryptographic tokens (fungible or non-fungible) can have value even though tokens are virtual and do not exist in the physical world. It's a surprisingly common question, especially one-on-one.Virtual objects like NFTs and cryptocurrencies are both digital and intangible; their existence is not based in the real (physical) world, and (unlike digital currencies) they generally do not have backing by real-world institutions. The ability to have value (specifically, monetary worth) is crucially important regarding the open metaverse, the decentralized internet of Web3 characterized by true digital ownership (see What IS the open metaverse?).I recently delved into the value of the virtual during an interview with CNBC, which may prove quite helpful to some readers. I'd like to discuss this topic in greater detail and with some historical context.When discussing whether something that doesn't exist in the real world can have real monetary worth, it is important to remember that intangible things have carried value for centuries; the key is ownership and the benefits associated with that ownership.How the ownership of ideas created the modern worldOne of the most important building blocks of modern industry and innovation-based economies was laid down more than three centuries ago in Great Britain with the long form title of \""An Act for the Encouragement of Learning by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of Such Copies, During the Times Therein Mentioned.\"" Also known as the Statute of Anne and the Copyright Act of 1709 (or 1710), this legislation provided the basis for modern copyright and intellectual property laws by establishing that the author of a particular work, not its publisher, was its rightful owner. The statute marked a pivotal moment in history by distinguishing between creators and distributors in much the same way that today we distinguish between creators (artists, writers, musicians, etc.) and the platforms that distribute their works (Netflix, Medium, Spotify, etc.).By granting creators exclusive rights to their works for a limited time, the Statute of Anne and subsequent acts established an economic framework for intellectual property under which creators could retain control and financial benefits over their works. At the same time, society gained access to those works through public libraries, book sales and similar means of distribution. The result was a veritable explosion of literature, science and philosophy that fueled the European Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution.This period in history saw the rise of literary giants such as Jane Austen, Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, and intellectual titans including Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, Hume, Mary Wollstonecraft and Adam Smith. In the sciences, the publicly available work of visionaries like Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and Marie Curie allowed us to radically advance our understanding of the physical world. The ability to own their ideas brought fame and financial independence to innovators, enabling them to challenge norms, push boundaries and distribute groundbreaking ideas. Copyright provided an economic incentive to create and share idea-based works, ensuring that contributions would endure and inspire future generations. Copyright was so powerful and impactful that other nations followed with their own measures, including the United States with its Copyright Act of 1790.Copyright and other forms of intellectual property protection have been accelerating innovation and powering economies for over three centuries. One of the most notable examples of this effect is China.China was a free haven for IP infringement. Pirated digital and physical goods were prevalent until the 1990s and early 2000s, when China began to strengthen its IP protection. This contributed to a meteoric rise in domestic Chinese innovation, and today, China is the world's leading generator of ideas in the form of scientific studies, patents, technology, content, etc.China's reforms to IP protection in the 1990s and early 2000s contributed to an explosion in the number of annual patent applications, considered a proxy indicator of innovation (image from Our World in Data)Owning the work of our mindsToday, it is widely acknowledged that intellectual property is subject to ownership just like material things, even though it is intangible and time-bound. We recognize that copyright, trademarks, patents and similar measures establish and protect ownership of the intangible.In a previous essay, I mentioned the work of the philosopher John Locke, describing the man as \""one of the OGs in the field of ownership and a major inspiration for both the European Enlightenment and the US Constitution.\""Loosely stated, Locke reasoned that a person has a natural right to own the labor of their \""body\"" and \""hands.\"" Copyright applied this Lockean view to the intangible products of the mind. Recent: Why crypto’s next breakthrough could start in the classroom — Animoca’s Yat SiuAs I noted in that essay, Locke's reasoning — that a person's labor generates property — provided a strong basis for \""ownership of intangibles including intellectual property, usage time, data, and the derivatives of data.\"" Intellectual property is fundamentally intangible: Scientific breakthroughs, literary works, musical compositions and various other creations of the mind emerge \""from thin air\"" and without fixed physical form. In capitalist economies, the protection of intellectual property plays a crucial role in supporting and incentivizing creators, making it possible for the work of our minds to enjoy commercial success, distribution and longevity. Without IP protection, entire industries (including technology, science and medicine) would be severely stunted by the lack of economic incentives to undertake research and development. It is no exaggeration to say that the Statute of Anne changed the world by launching a framework for creators to own and protect the work of their minds, which in turn made it possible to enhance and sustain innovation.The introduction of intellectual property protection laid the foundation for ownership over the intangible. It enabled our minds to create intangible capital assets, thus fuelling the economic engines of wealth generation. Just as importantly, copyright granted rights explicitly to creators, helping to decentralize the concentration of power away from big publishers.Ownership of the intangible represents such obvious and immense value to us at Animoca Brands that we made the advancement of digital property rights our core mission.The economic power of assets without physical existenceIt is well established in traditional business and finance that the intangible can have worth. Brand equity, intellectual property and goodwill are all considered valuable. The reams of intangible data you produce daily through your online activities are highly prized by companies and platforms that use it (and sometimes abuse it) to extract value from you.Consider that intangibles already dominate the global economy:The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) estimated that in 2019, IP-intensive industries contributed 41% of US domestic economic activity, supporting 63 million jobs (44% of total US employment).The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) estimated that in 2023, intangible assets were valued at $62 trillion — multiples more than the total market cap of gold (about $17 trillion to $25 trillion).(On a related topic, the sheer economic power of IP makes recent suggestions by Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk that we should \""delete all IP law\"" all the more bizarre. Removing something that has successfully driven innovation, investment and development for more than 300 years hardly seems like the wisest course of action. I discussed this matter in a thread on X.)Blockchain technology is a game-changer because it can provide provable ownership, scarcity and economic opportunities for intangible assets in a decentralized manner at minimum cost, quickly and securely.In a non-blockchain framework, a public record of ownership for an asset is maintained by a trusted central authority, often a government agency. This presents significant challenges, including security, barriers to access, poor efficiency, high costs to owners, red tape and the poor cost-effectiveness of protecting items of relatively little worth.In blockchain-enabled frameworks, however, decentralized and immutable ledgers can greatly reduce waste, vulnerability and opportunity loss while providing and automating important record-keeping functions more efficiently and securely than centralized systems. But that's not all.The work of artificial mindsIP-based value creation is particularly critical in the context of the artificial intelligence revolution currently underway. IP protection recently gained attention through a viral trend of AI-generated images in the style of Hayo Miyazaki, the legendary founder of Studio Ghibli. This trend brought to the forefront some concerns about AIs that are trained using protected IP and the potential impact that easily generated imitations have on rightful IP owners.The film industry has been wrangling with this issue for years:\""OpenAI, a major US artificial intelligence company, and Google both wrote to the Office of Science and Technology Policy about an AI action plan this month, making the case that it would be beneficial for AI developers to be able to use copyrighted materials to train AI…\""SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents about 160,000 performers, wanted film and TV producers to obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas. They also fought for actors to be compensated at their usual rate — even if a digital replica of them performs the role.\""CBS News, March 17, 2025These are thorny issues that will impact most industries, sooner or later. Can a society successfully legislate to protect the work of our minds from the highly efficient imitative assaults of artificial intelligence? Will AI regulation enhance industries or merely restrict innovation and competitiveness? There is a technological solution to some of the concerns around AI and copyright. Blockchain provides a secure and trustable type of framework for large-scale tracking, provenance, ownership and various other aspects of intellectual property that are currently being challenged by generative AIs. Even better, blockchain can also facilitate usage tracking and royalty payments related to ownership of individual assets, even for assets of very low value. In the AI-driven world of the near future, blockchain technology can be the basis for efficient mechanisms that provide fair rewards and accreditation to creators whose intellectual property fuels AI (a subject I addressed briefly in my TED Talk). Digital property rights: The next frontierWhen someone asks me how NFTs or cryptocurrencies can have real value despite being intangible, I usually ask them the same question about the work of their favorite musician, author or filmmaker. Most people have a fundamental appreciation for intellectual property rights in the context of \""traditional\"" industries because those industries have considerable experience managing ownership of the intangible. Intellectual property is recognized to have real value without physicality, and creators have the right to ownership over their intangible creations, empowering them to create capital \""out of thin air\"" through the work of their minds. This also applies to virtual objects (and, indeed, virtual objects often represent or are linked to intellectual property).Whether you own an idea, something you wrote, a digital currency, or an NFT, the key point is ownership and its associated benefits. Ownership of something (virtual or real) confers some degree of opportunity that would otherwise not be possible without that ownership.As the world embraces the digital frontier, the mission of Animoca Brands strikes me as more relevant than ever: to make available digital property rights for all, thereby helping to ensure that all creators can be rewarded fairly not only for their own creations but also for their relative contributions to the work of others (such as AIs, social networks, advertisers, remixers, etc.).The same principle of ownership over the intangible that helped fuel the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, and the Information Age can now be extended to our digital lives in the decentralized open metaverse, where technological frameworks already enshrine provable ownership of the virtual, and where creating and accessing virtual assets is inherently democratic and easily available to all participants. A little over 315 years after the Statute of Anne began to pave the road that leads to the open metaverse, the confluence of technology and property rights is now poised to unlock nearly unimaginable creativity, economic empowerment and progress for billions of people. Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca Brands.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: PACERMills allegedly began ghosting them shortly afterward, according to the plaintiffs, adding that he created a flawed shareholder agreement to falsely support his claim that the holding company controlled the project's assets.This was “rife with errors” to support his lie, the plaintiffs said.According to the supposedly flawed shareholder agreement, Mills was to receive a 67% equity share in Proof of Work Labs (before he later renamed it to Satoshi Labs) while several other investors contributed up to $20,000 into the company in exchange for just 2% equity.He allegedly assured them that their equity stakes would remain unchanged despite the name change.Mills also held a 67% voting stake on all matters related to Proof of Work Labs (at the time) while no other partner held more than 2%.Cointelegraph reached out to Mills but didn’t receive an immediate response.Mills supposedly didn’t know much about NFTsThe Hashling NFT project was born from a different idea that Mills had initially discussed with one of the plaintiffs, Dustin Steerman, who initially established rapport with Mills from earlier collaborations.They followed through with the Hashling NFT project despite Mills initially telling Steerman that he had no money and no NFT-related experience to contribute to the project.Related: Bitcoin NFTs surpass Ronin in all-time sales“[Mills] had a willingness to help push the project forward, and he did have an idea at the start,” the investor’s attorney, Clinton Ind of Ind Legal Group LLC told Law360.\""Even though that wasn't the final idea, it did embolden it, and … everyone kind of enjoyed working together in those early stages.\""To ensure the Hashling NFT project’s success, Mills and Steerman recruited other investors, now also plaintiffs, to assist with everything from the NFT art and social media marketing to even attending NFT conferences in New York.Mills even got his girlfriend to invest in the Hashling NFTs project, the plaintiffs claimed.In addition to the fraud and breach of fiduciary actions, the plaintiffs also requested a constructive trust over the project’s assets and full legal restitution.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-bitcoin-project-ceo-stole-millions-partners-allege?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

What this bill is really intended to do is regulate the entire space of stablecoins,” she added.Gillibrand said the revised bill includes “some ethics requirements,” but it was “not an ethics bill.”“If we were dealing with all President Trump’s ethics problems, it would be a very long and detailed bill,” she added.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, also on stage, was hopeful the Senate would vote on the stablecoin bill “early next week.”Armstrong, whose company cozied up to Trump by donating $1 million to his inauguration fund, declined to comment when asked if the President’s memecoin could impact the passage of bipartisan crypto bills.“It’s not my place to really comment on President Trump’s activity,” he said. “What I do think is important is that this bill remains focused on stablecoins.”Crypto bills “absolutely critical” to pass before midtermsThe crypto industry is pushing for Congress to pass the GENIUS Act and a Republican-drafted crypto market structure bill before the midterm elections on Nov. 3, 2026, where all 435 House seats and a third of the 100 Senate seats are up for election.“We have a very narrow window to get legislation through between now and the midterms,” Marta Belcher, the president of the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto.“I strongly suspect that window is going to close very quickly. I don't know if we're going to get another window like this to get legislation through,” she added.“It's absolutely critical that we get it through now, especially because there really is a real possibility that in the future we end up with an administration that is hostile to crypto.”The Association’s communications director, Chris Jonas, added that it’s critical the bills pass before Congress takes a recess for the month of August.Related: Crypto execs flock to DC to support Senate stablecoin bill “Once you get into the calendar year of the midterms, historically not a lot of legislation moves, so that's why it's so critical,” he explained.Trump should be on track to sign both crypto bills before the August break, according to Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets.Hines noted on stage at Consensus on May 13 that negotiations on both bills are still ongoing, but it was “the President's desire” to sign both “stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.\""Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-bill-wont-target-trump-senate-could-pass-may-26?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: CointelegraphThere have been two serious crypto-related attacks in Paris so far this month. On May 13, three assailants attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Earlier in the month, on May 3, Paris police freed the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several days as part of a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. The attacks have prompted France’s interior minister to meet with crypto professionals and address rising security concerns. Last year, blockchain investigator ZachXBT sounded the alarm in October that he’d been receiving messages from multiple victims of crypto home invasion thefts in Western Europe at a much higher rate than other regions.“The message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable and that these units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful at holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,” Levin said.“And even if it’s not the people that are kidnapping those people, but actually going upstream to the organized crime groups that are orchestrating these,” he added. Online streamer Amouranth was the victim of a home invasion in March 2025 when several armed assailants held her at gunpoint and demanded the keys to her crypto wallet, four suspects were charged in connection with the incident and arrested by law enforcement.Crypto kidnapping “not such a profitable business”Levin says he hopes organized crime takes a message from crypto robbers being arrested, specifically, that it’s “not such a profitable business to be in,” and in some instances, the ransom payments might even be recoverable.“There is the ability to potentially recover some of those payments as well. I think that in general, the goal here is not necessarily the recovery of the money, but it’s holding those people to account,” he said.However, despite law enforcement having some success in tracking down criminals targeting the crypto industry, Levin says the spate of offline robberies is still a “bleak” situation, and the industry should be taking extra steps to stifle theft as well. “People need to be very careful about what information is shared about them online,” he said.Related: Teens kidnap Las Vegas man at gunpoint, stealing $4M in cryptoThis year, there have been 22 recorded incidents of in-person crypto-related theft compared to 28 in 2024, according to a GitHub list created by cypherpunk and co-founder of self-custodial firm Casa, Jameson Lopp.However, the number could be higher.

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.Source: X/AdrianoFeriaAccording to X user AdrianoFeria, ETH is “the best candidate for institutional diversification” since professional fund managers appreciate “similar levels of regulatory clarity and accessibility” through multiple spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although recent data hasn’t been especially encouraging. Ether remains the sole alternative to spot Bitcoin ETFsBetween May 12 and May 13, US-listed Ether ETFs saw net outflows of $4 million. The size of the Ether ETF market is 92% smaller than Bitcoin’s $121.5 billion, highlighting a clear lack of institutional appetite for ETH-based products. This has led some traders to question whether Ether can truly gain traction among professional investors.ETH/USDT vs. competitors XRP, TRX, BNB, ADA. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile competing cryptocurrencies have outperformed ETH in 2025, their chances of being included in US state-level digital asset reserves have plummeted. This follows President Trump’s decision on March 2 to distance himself from lobbyists supporting XRP, SOL, and ADA. The “Digital Asset Stockpile” executive order issued on March 6 was notably more cautious, drawing a clear line between Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins.Ether’s best-case scenario may involve a lack of direct ETF competition, which would depend on the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejecting several pending applications. Analysts also suggest that Ether ETFs could gain momentum from in-kind creation and staking approvals—developments considered highly likely before year-end, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.‘Pectra’ upgrade improved scalability, setting the stage for AI adoptionPreviously hailed as the answer to Ether’s monetary policy, the built-in burn mechanism introduced in 2021 was designed to reduce supply growth based on network demand. However, the shift in focus toward scalability through rollups has largely offset its deflationary impact. As a result, a significant increase in onchain activity is now required for Ether to become deflationary once more.Ethereum rollups ranked by 30-day transactions. Source: L2BeatThe recent ‘Pectra’ upgrade has improved data transmission efficiency, setting the stage for enhanced scalability. Layer-2 network activity rose 23% compared to the previous month, with the Base network taking the lead at 244.2 million transactions in 30 days, according to L2beat. If this momentum holds, it could generate sustained demand for ETH and help further differentiate Ethereum from rival platforms.Related: Ethereum retakes 10% market share, but ETH bulls shouldn't celebrate yetSource: X/econoarThe path to a $5,000 ETH price remains uncertain, but artificial intelligence may serve as a powerful catalyst.

This growth could make a new all-time high for ETH in 2025 achievable, especially if institutional interest accelerates following long-awaited regulatory changes.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability. In the first quarter of 2025, Bitcoin’s spot price swung from more than $100,000 in January to less than $80,000 in March, according to data from Google Finance.

During a panel on May 14 at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, she said the NY estate is frequently asked to provide guidance on regulators. “With respect to federal regulation and legislation [...] members of Congress are often coming to us [NYDFS] asking about our process, about our regulations, about guidance, how they should be thinking about legislation,” Harris said.Interview with Adrienne Harris (pictured left). Source: CointelegraphAccording to Harris, the NYDFS was “unnecessarily tough” and lacked resources in the past. Now, under her purview, she said the NYDFS is “tough but fair,” noting that the digital currency oversight team has since doubled in size.Harris took over as superintendent of the NYDFS in September 2021 after spending time working in the educational, nonprofit, and private sectors. In New York State, crypto businesses must either obtain a BitLicense or a limited-purpose trust charter.“We've added nine pieces of regulatory guidance, so it's still very tough to get a BitLicense or a limited-purpose trust charter,” Harris said. “But I think [...] the proof is in the pudding when you see that FTX, Voyager, Celsius, didn't pass our test and therefore couldn't do business.”All three of those crypto companies went bankrupt in 2022. The result was a widespread contagion in the industry and years-long legal proceedings. FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Celsius Network's Alex Mashinsky were sentenced to 25 and 12 years in prison, respectively. Voyager’s founder, Steven Ehrlich, is facing legal charges for allegedly misleading customers.Related: NYC Mayor doubles down on crypto push ahead of city summitHarris ‘hopeful’ for stablecoin legislationStablecoin legislation has been a topic at the forefront of many crypto industry advocates in 2025.

We've been working with Congress on all the variations of their crypto and stablecoin legislation now over the last three years almost.According to Harris, all recent legislation tied to stablecoin regulation has been reviewed by New York officials. “There isn't a version of any of those bills, be it House or Senate, R's or D's, that don't come to meet to the team to say, give us your feedback, give us your technical assistance, your insights here,” she said, adding that most of these suggestions have been incorporated into legislations.The NYDFS, according to Harrus, still wants to be “a state path for crypto companies.” Magazine: Bitcoin payments are being undermined by centralized stablecoins",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-has-outsized-role-to-play-in-crypto-nydfs-head?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: Coin360However, not everyone is bullish in the short term. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson said in a post on X that Bitcoin is at the “Alpha Price” zone, which could attract profit booking by long-term holders or whales.  Could Bitcoin challenge the all-time high? Will altcoins continue their rally even if Bitcoin consolidates? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rebounded off $100,718 on May 12, indicating that the bulls are trying to flip the psychologically important $100,000 level into support.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price maintains above $100,000, the possibility of a retest of the all-time high increases. There is stiff resistance in the $107,000 to $109,588 zone, but if it is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000.The risk to the upside is a sharp pullback below the 20-day exponential moving average ($98,407), which could tempt several short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($89,952). Ether price predictionEther (ETH) skyrocketed above the $2,550 resistance on May 13, but the higher levels are attracting sellers.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe overbought level on the RSI signals a possible correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price slips below $2,550, the bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the ETH/USDT pair below $2,400. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($2,147).Contrarily, a bounce off $2,550 indicates that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That enhances the likelihood of a rally to $3,000.XRP price predictionXRP’s (XRP) rally is facing resistance at $2.65, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat improves the prospects of a rally above $2.65. Once the resistance is scaled, the XRP/USDT pair could ascend to $3. Buyers are expected to face significant resistance from the bears in the $3 to $3.40 zone.The 20-day EMA ($2.32) is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. If the price turns down sharply from $2.65 and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that bears remain sellers on rallies. That could result in a range formation between $2.65 and $2.BNB price predictionBuyers have kept BNB (BNB) above the breakout level of $644 but are struggling to push the price above the $675 level.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe rising 20-day EMA ($627) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that buyers have an edge. A break and close above $675 opens the doors for a possible rally to the overhead resistance of $745.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($603).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) resumed its up move after breaking above the $180 resistance on May 13, but the bulls are struggling to hold on to the higher levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears have pulled the price back below $180 on May 14. If they sustain the lower levels, the SOL/USDT pair could skid to the 20-day EMA ($159). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish momentum remains intact. The bulls will then try to catapult the pair to $210.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the breakout above $180 may have been a bull trap. The pair may then tumble to $153.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the breakout level of $0.21 on May 13, signaling that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.20) has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating advantage to buyers. A break and close above $0.26 signals the resumption of the rally. That opens the doors for a rally to $0.28 and thereafter to $0.31.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.21, it suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The DOGE/USDT pair may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($0.17), which is likely to act as strong support.Cardano price predictionBuyers have successfully held the retest of the neckline in Cardano (ADA), indicating buying on dips.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above $0.86. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the pattern target of $1.01.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the neckline. That suggests the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.68).Related: Ethereum retakes 10% market share, but ETH bulls shouldn't celebrate yetSui price predictionSui (SUI) has been sandwiched between $4.25 and $3.90 for the past few days, indicating that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf buyers propel the price above $4.25, the SUI/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to $5. Buyers may find it difficult to clear the overhead zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.Alternatively, if the price turns down and closes below $3.90, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may descend to the 20-day EMA ($3.57), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to overcome the barrier at $4.25.Chainlink price predictionChainlink’s (LINK) up move is facing selling at the resistance line, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($15.43) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. A short-term trend change will be signaled if buyers pierce the resistance line. The LINK/USDT pair could then rally toward the target objective of $21.30.Sellers will have to tug the price below the neckline to gain strength. That could pull the pair to the 50-day SMA ($13.96). A break and close below the 50-day SMA suggest the pair may remain inside the descending channel pattern for some more time.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) bounced off the breakout level of $23.50, indicating that the bulls have flipped the level into support.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThere is minor resistance at $28.78, but it is likely to be crossed.

If bears want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly pull the price below the 20-day EMA.

2025-05-14T17:37:33.000Z,"These five crypto figures vanished, died or fooled us all","Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu has been found alive at his parents’ home in San Francisco, days after faking his suicide on a livestream that launched a supposed posthumous memecoin past $100 million.Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.1. Jeffy Yu faked his death, then his crypto pumpedA clip of Yu broadcasting his “suicide” circulated on May 4. The video showed him smoking a cigarette before pulling the trigger, then the camera dropped.Hours later, a scheduled social media post announced the posthumous launch of LLJEFFY, a memecoin described as his “final art piece.” The coin surged to nearly $105 million in market cap.LLJEFFY’s market fell to $5.63 million from its $105 million peak. Source: DEX ScreenerBut Yu wasn’t dead. Blockchain wallets tied to him kept moving. A copy of a letter — allegedly written by Yu — described the exit design as a response to ongoing harassment and blackmail.Yu’s obituary on online memorial site Legacy.com has now been removed. Source: Vee/Legacy.comReporters from The San Francisco Standard eventually found Yu at his parents’ home. He refused to comment on the suicide stunt or whether he profited from it.In the world of memecoins, this kind of spectacle isn’t new. In late 2024, Pump.fun’s livestream feature triggered a wave of stunts — suicide threats, animal abuse and other shocking acts — to pump token prices. The company shut it down and later relaunched a toned-down version.2. A crypto whistleblower’s descent into paranoia and possible deathIn February 2025, a suspected Chinese programmer who called themselves Hu Lezhi burned 500 Ether (ETH) (worth around $1.3 million at the time) and donated another 1,950 ETH (over $5 million) to various groups like WikiLeaks and the Ethereum Foundation. All of it came with onchain messages alleging that a hedge fund called WizardQuant (aka Kuande Investment) was using “brain-computer weapons” to control its employees — including Hu.Related: 4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto marketsThe messages read like sci-fi horror. Hu claimed he’d been a mind-control test subject since childhood and warned of a future where humans were nothing more than “puppets or complete slaves to the digital machine.”Hu Lezhi’s final messages before disappearing. Source: EtherscanIn one of his last messages, Hu said they would “leave the world” if they reached the final stage of becoming a “complete slave to the digital machine.” Some translated the series of messages as an onchain suicide note.To date, they haven’t re-emerged. And unlike Yu, Hu’s wallet hasn’t moved.3. The crypto whiz and the cryptic tweet before his deathOn Oct. 28, 2022, DeFi developer Nikolai Mushegian posted a chilling tweet: “CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring… they are going to torture me to death.”By the next morning, he was found face-down in the surf near his beach house in Puerto Rico.A final tweet, a washed-up body, and silence louder than truth. Source: Nikolai Mushegian/fucnti0nZer0Mushegian wasn’t a random crypto kid. He was an early developer at MakerDAO and a key architect of the stablecoin ecosystem. He was also increasingly paranoid — or, depending on who you ask, increasingly aware. Critics dismissed the tweet as a mental health crisis, but others weren’t so quick to look away.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearThe timing of his death sparked a wave of theories: assassination, targeted silencing or even MKUltra-style mind control.Officially, it was ruled an accidental drowning.4. Crypto investors can’t believe QuadrigaCX founder’s deathIn December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, reportedly died in India from Crohn’s disease. But there was one massive problem: He was the only person with access to $190 million in crypto.Cotten’s case was so high-profile that it became the subject of a Netflix documentary. Source: Netflix/YouTubeAs news of his death spread, so did the questions. There was no public autopsy, his death certificate misspelled his name (spelling Cotten as Cottan), the casket was sealed, and a growing army of investors wanted his body exhumed for DNA testing.Quadriga officially declared bankruptcy in 2019. Thousands of clients were locked out of their funds. Eventually, investigators discovered the cold wallets were empty, prompting auditor EY to begin recovery efforts.Some suspected Cotten had run a Ponzi scheme for years and used his death as the ultimate escape plan. The rumors have not been confirmed, but the official story remains that he died a tragic death, as confirmed by Indian authorities. 5. Reports of Cryptoqueen’s death are greatly exaggeratedSelf-styled “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova, co-founder of the $4-billion OneCoin scam, hasn’t been seen since she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens in October 2017.Cotten left no access. Ignatova left no trace.Since then, rumors have swirled. Some say that she underwent plastic surgery and lives under a new identity or that she’s being protected by the Bulgarian mafia. A Bulgarian investigative outlet claims Ignatova was allegedly murdered in November 2018 on a yacht in the Ionian Sea and that her body was dismembered and dumped overboard under the orders of Bulgarian crime boss Christophoros Amanatidis to cover his ties to OneCoin.More recently, German officials reportedly assumed that Ignatova is in a South African suburb living with private security.Ignatova has been on the US FBI’s 10 Most Wanted list since 2022. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation raised Ignatova’s bounty to $5 million in June 2024.

Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating between an upper range of $105,700 and a lower range of $100,678.

2025-05-14T15:00:00.000Z,"The facet of TradFi most ripe for disruption is equities","Opinion by: Mike Cahill, co-founder and CEO of Douro LabsDespite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private companies is an opportunity historically reserved only for the wealthy and hyper-connected. It is often siloed within the most economically advanced nations. Enhancing access to equities worldwide can be achieved, however, by injecting decentralized technology into three fundamental components of our financial system: price, execution and settlement.The bedrock of traditional financeEquities typically refer to shares of private companies, and they’re one of the most potent tools for wealth creation. On top of regulation, the main factor restricting access to equities is the infrastructure that underpins our financial system: stale and inaccurate pricing data, exclusive execution venues and painfully slow settlement periods. PriceTraditional equity markets are private. Here, pricing data is sequestered behind non-disclosure agreements, paywalls and groups of individuals who want to keep this information to themselves. Access to accurate, real-time pricing is what enables investors to make informed decisions, and it’s the crucial ingredient required to participate at all. If pricing data remains in the hands of those who can afford access or run in the right social circles, the system will continue to support only a small group of wealthy, privileged people.Recent: Ether sentiment hits yearly low but that could be a good thing: SantimentExecutionWhile many apps and platforms might make it seem like buying equities is as easy as pressing a button, the reality is that making these types of investments almost always requires strict vetting processes and minimum investment thresholds that everyday investors just don’t have access to. While it seems like public markets should be exempt from these barriers, brokerage fees and geographic limitations can still hamper participation. As a result, the current systems simply uphold the “rich get richer, poor get poorer” narrative.SettlementMost traders have experienced the frustratingly slow, highly bureaucratic and hazardous equity settlement systems in place today. It can take several days for a single trade to finalize. If it’s a cross-border trade, settlement times can lag even more. This results in capital being locked up, further dissuading smaller investors from participating — a snowball effect that keeps access to equities solely in the hands of the most elite traders. While these barriers are undoubtedly systemic, they’re also very solvable. As history has shown, time and time again, innovation always forces a shift. That’s where decentralized finance (DeFi) comes in.Reimagining infrastructure through DeFiDecentralized technologies have the potential to reimagine TradFi’s infrastructure to create a system that is faster, more accessible and more efficient and unlock new forms of equities participation. These include synthetic equity markets, tokenized private equity and even equity-based prediction markets.Regarding price, execution and settlement, DeFi and TradFi have the opportunity to work together, combining forces to offer a new foundation to the financial system that promotes equity, access and transparency. Decentralized price feeds offer real-time, accurate price data on equities that don’t come at the exorbitant price of a Bloomberg Terminal. They empower traders of any background or location to access fresh market data to trade equities with the same knowledge as the most elite traders. At the same time, decentralized execution platforms enable marketplaces for fractional, tokenized equity exposure. Now, if traders have an internet connection, they can make trades supported by smart contracts that automate trade matching, liquidity provision and order fulfillment. This empowers traders to purchase small, fractional stakes in these assets, empowering those even in the most rural and secluded areas of the world to own a piece of the same high-growth company as an accredited investor in the US. Finally, settlement in DeFi is almost instantaneous. That’s because blockchain removes the need for intermediaries, making it possible for equities to be traded in milliseconds. This dramatically reduces counterparty risk while unlocking capital for continuous use, making trading even more attractive to smaller players. Building the next generation of financeCreating a financial system that is genuinely democratized means more than encouraging institutions to buy and trade digital assets. It means rethinking the way our financial infrastructure exists and operates today. While equities are one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available, most of the global population still can’t access them due to geography, legacy and privilege. Through revolutionizing price, execution and settlement via decentralized innovations, equities can be entirely disrupted — closing the wealth gap that keeps billions of people at the mercy of a select few.Opinion by: Mike Cahill, co-founder and CEO of Douro Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) back toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate its recent rally just yet.Ether’s RSI most overextended since May 2021The strong recovery in Ethereum’s crypto market share has pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI) to its most overbought zone since May 2021, raising red flags for traders betting on further upside, at least in the short term. Historically, such extreme RSI levels on ETH.D have marked the beginning of major pullbacks. One notable instance occurred in early July 2024, when ETH dominance peaked near similar RSI levels. ETH.D daily performance chart. Source: TradingView Over the following 315 days, ETH.D dropped by more than 17.5%. The current RSI spike, again above 80, mimics a similar setup, suggesting that Ethereum could be nearing a local top in its market share.Adding to the bearish outlook, ETH.D remains below its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave). This resistance level has repeatedly capped Ethereum’s dominance during previous recovery attempts.Previous overbought pullbacks have initially pushed Ethereum’s market share toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave).The ETH.D metric, therefore, risks declining toward its current 50-day EMA support at around 8.24% by June, suggesting potential capital rotation out of Ethereum markets to other coins in the coming weeks.Bearish divergence signals 15% ETH price dropOn the four-hour ETH/USD chart, a classic bearish divergence is emerging, where Ethereum’s price continues to print higher highs, but momentum indicators trend lower. Crypto trader AlphaBTC noted that ETH is showing “three clear drives of divergence,” a setup often preceding trend exhaustion. He added that key Fibonacci levels align with potential support zones, suggesting a pullback could be imminent.ETH/USD four-hour price chart. Source: AlphaBTCWith ETH hovering near the $2,740 Fibonacci extension, profit-taking pressure may intensify, opening the door for a short-term correction toward lower Fib levels at around $2,330 or even $2,190, down 10-15% from the current prices.Independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests ETH’s decline in the coming weeks could serve as a “buy-the-dip opportunity,” indicating that the cryptocurrency would eventually climb over $3,500.
