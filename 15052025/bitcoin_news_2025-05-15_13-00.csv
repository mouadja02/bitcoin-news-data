The fund will invest in startups and businesses building on Pi Network or contributing to its broader ecosystem.“This strategic program intends to invest in high-quality startups and companies across sectors, driving innovation and ecosystem growth,” Pi Network said in an X post.Source: Pi NetworkThe Pi Foundation, the organization behind Pi Network, is described as an “ownerless” entity focused on supporting long-term ecosystem development. The foundation said the new venture fund will draw from the 10% of Pi tokens reserved for ecosystem initiatives.  Pi Network had not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication.Related: Is Pi Network dead? What really went wrong behind the hypeWhat is Pi Network Ventures?Pi Network Ventures is tasked with increasing Pi’s utility by investing in startups and businesses that integrate it into products and services. The new organization will also attempt to bring more apps, transactions and companies onto the network while developing new use cases:“By aligning incentives and providing resources to high-potential founders, startups and companies, this initiative aims to create a feedback loop of innovation and adoption.“Related: Pi Network price nears all-time lows as supply pressure mountsPi Network Ventures’ strategyPer the announcement, Pi Network Ventures plans to invest in startups from the early stages until Series B funding rounds and beyond. The hope is that such an approach allows access to high-potential innovators while also helping scale proven businesses.Pi Network Ventures claims to differ from other crypto ecosystem programs in its focus and processes. The announcement states that the company aims not to limit itself to crypto investments and also fund general technology sectors, including generative AI and AI applications, fintech, embedded payments, e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, social networks and real-world consumer and enterprise applications.Another claimed difference is that the investment fund in question aims to act like traditional Silicon Valley venture capital firms. This will reportedly be primarily seen in sourcing, selection and vetting processes — the objective of which is to “identify and support high-impact and disruptive startups and businesses.”Magazine: Help!

2025-05-15T10:00:00.000Z,"Pareto launches synthetic dollar backed by private credit","Private credit marketplace Pareto has introduced a new synthetic dollar aimed at linking institutional investors with decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities — a move that highlights the expanding role of stablecoins in global finance.The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT), which are then held as collateral.“USP is backed 1:1 by the stablecoins used during the minting process,” Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants.To maintain its peg to the US dollar, Pareto uses what it calls a “native backing” process. Each USP token is minted only when an equivalent amount of USDC or USDT is deposited, ensuring full collateralization when the token is created. An arbitrage mechanism also supports the dollar peg’s ongoing stability.In addition, Pareto has set up a protocol-funded stability reserve to act as a buffer in case of borrower defaults.Related: Coinbase invests in Canadian stablecoin issuerInstitutional entry into RWA credit marketThe company said the synthetic dollar gives institutional investors a regulated onchain entry point into real-world asset (RWA) credit markets — a segment of the tokenization industry that has expanded rapidly over the past year. Recent examples of private credit tokenization include Tradable’s portfolio of 30 credit positions and Apollo’s Diversified Credit Securitize Fund.When asked about the potential risks of connecting DeFi to the often opaque private credit sector, Pareto acknowledged the concern but emphasized its approach to risk management.“That’s a fair concern, but Pareto was specifically built to address the inefficiencies and opacity that have historically plagued traditional credit markets,” Pandolfi said, adding:“By bringing private credit onchain, we enable real-time transparency, programmable risk management, and automated settlement while reducing counterparty risk and operational friction.”A chart highlighting the growth of the tokenized credit market.

2025-05-15T09:02:00.000Z,"Coinbase’s x402: Crypto payments over HTTP for AI and APIs","What is HTTP 402, and why does it matter?              The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.HTTP status codes: A quick refresherUnderstanding HTTP status codes helps clarify how the web communicates behind the scenes. Here are some key ones to know:HTTP 200 — OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.HTTP 401 — Unauthorized: Indicates the request requires user authentication; typically used when credentials are missing or invalid.HTTP 403 — Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it (often due to lack of permissions or access control).HTTP 404 — Not found: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found.HTTP 402 — Payment required: Originally intended to support digital payments directly within the protocol but left as a “reserved for future use” status code due to the lack of global payment infrastructure at the time.HTTP 500 — Internal server error: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.Although the creators of the web imagined a future where online services might request payments directly through the protocol, for decades, no one found a practical use for it. It sat dormant for over 25 years, with no widespread adoption or defined behavior.Today, HTTP 402 is finally coming to life, thanks to Coinbase’s x402 protocol. X402 turns HTTP 402 from a placeholder into a real mechanism. It allows websites, APIs and services to signal that a payment is required before granting access to digital goods or services.Unlike traditional payment systems, which rely on external redirects or complex integrations, x402 enables native, in-protocol payments using stablecoins directly over HTTP.But why do x402 and the activation of HTTP 402 matter?With machine-to-machine interactions, autonomous agents and AI-driven services on the rise, the internet needs a payment layer that is:InstantProgrammableInteroperableTrust-minimized.Activating HTTP 402 positions it as a key enabler for decentralized commerce, autonomous agents and crypto-native applications. It could become as foundational as HTTP 200 or 404 in a future where services charge micro-fees, stream value or sell access dynamically.                  Coinbase x402: A native payment layer for the web              Coinbase’s x402 is an open protocol that allows websites and APIs to request and receive payments in stablecoins directly over HTTP. It works by using the existing HTTP infrastructure and augmenting it with a lightweight payment layer. Here is the step-by-step process for machine-to-machine transactions using the x402 protocol:Client requests a paid resource: A client, such as an AI agent, app, or browser initiates a request to an x402-enabled server (e.g., an API, data set or digital service) that requires payment to access.The server responds with a 402 Payment Required: In response, the server returns an HTTP 402 status code, along with the payment details. This includes the amount to be paid, the supported token (such as USDC) and a payment payload or address to use.Client submits the payment: The client uses its crypto wallet to sign and submit the payment. This happens programmatically — no user interaction is needed, which enables fully automated or agentic payments. It resends the original request, this time including the encoded payment information in an X-PAYMENT HTTP header.The payment is verified and settled onchain: A payment facilitator service, such as Coinbase’s x402 Facilitator, checks the blockchain to verify that the payment has been made and confirmed.The server delivers the resource: Once the payment is validated, the server fulfills the request and returns the data or content. It also includes an X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header confirming the success of the transaction.In x402, payments happen over standard HTTP using two custom headers: X-PAYMENT and X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE. These headers allow seamless, automated payments between apps, agents and servers — without changing how HTTP works. It’s a simple yet powerful way to enable web-native, machine-to-machine commerce using stablecoins.What makes x402 revolutionary is that it doesn’t require platforms, plugins or third-party integrations. It creates a native payment layer for the web itself, just like HTTPS added security or cookies enabled session management.Did you know? HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the foundational protocol used to transfer data on the web.                  What are agentic payments, and why are they important?              As AI systems become more advanced, the agentic era has begun. In this new paradigm, software agents, ranging from AI bots to autonomous scripts, are expected to act on behalf of users or even independently. AI agents will need to perform actions like accessing data, subscribing to services or renting compute power. And all of these tasks often require payments.This is where the concept of agentic payments comes in. These are payments made by agents, not humans — fast, automatic and often low-value. Think of a data-scraping AI paying a cent to read a scientific article or a supply chain bot paying fractions of a dollar for live port data.Traditional payment infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of use case. It falls short because of the below reasons:Built for humans, not machines.Requires logins, manual steps and batch processing.High fees and slow settlement times make them unsuitable for high-frequency, low-value, autonomous transactions.Because of the limitations of traditional payment systems, agentic payments matter for several key reasons:They enable a machine-first economy, where software can transact just like humans.Make real-time AI decision-making possible by removing friction from access to paid services.Pave the way for composable services, where agents can chain together paid APIs and tools autonomously.As discussed, such payments require machine-readable protocols, instant settlement and predictable pricing, all of which x402 enables. It’s a vital step in building a transactional layer for a machine-first internet.                  x402 vs. traditional payment systems              Today’s online payment systems are deeply human-centric. Whether it’s signing up for a subscription, entering credit card information or passing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, the current infrastructure assumes a person is at the center of every transaction.This design becomes a bottleneck when payments need to be made automatically, in real time and at scale. APIs that want to monetize often face hurdles like creating user accounts, handling fraud, managing disputes and integrating with centralized processors like Stripe or PayPal. These systems are slow, costly and often region-specific.X402 removes these barriers by allowing servers to ask for and receive payment directly through the protocol itself. There’s no need for logins, billing dashboards or delayed bank transfers. The value transfer is embedded into the fabric of the internet, optimized for agents and apps.The contrast between x402 and traditional payment infrastructure is stark. While x402 is protocol-first, built on crypto rails, systems like Visa, Stripe and PayPal are platform-first. X402 enables payments to settle in seconds using onchain transactions, while traditional rails typically settle over one to three business days.Moreover, x402 supports micropayments as small as fractions of a cent, making it viable for high-frequency, low-cost interactions — something that’s infeasible on credit card networks due to fees. It’s also global by design, requiring no currency conversions or regional banking relationships. Chargebacks, fraud risk and intermediary fees are virtually eliminated, thanks to the immutability of onchain transfers.Where traditional systems focus on human users with front-end interfaces, x402 enables machine-native, backend-to-backend monetization.Did you know? You can detect HTTP 402 responses using tools like Sitechecker Pro, which scans your site like a search bot and flags unusual status codes — including payment-related ones.                  Incumbents’ act: How Visa, Stripe and PayPal are exploring AI-powered payments              To be fair, incumbents aren’t ignoring this trend. Visa, Stripe and PayPal have all acted to be in line with the trend and incorporate appropriate changes in their approach.VisaVisa has announced initiatives to allow AI agents to make purchases on behalf of users by linking them to its global payments network. This move aims to facilitate autonomous AI assistants capable of performing shopping tasks, such as managing routine purchases, based on user-defined budgets and preferences.In partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure provider, Visa is launching stablecoin-linked Visa cards across multiple countries in Latin America. This collaboration enables users to make everyday purchases using cryptocurrency tokens, with plans to expand to Europe, Africa and Asia in the coming months.StripeStripe has unveiled a new AI foundation model aimed at improving fraud detection and authorization rates. This model, trained on billions of transactions, has significantly increased the detection rate for fraudulent activities, such as card-testing attacks, enhancing the security of its payment systems.Stripe has introduced Stablecoin Financial Accounts, allowing businesses in over 100 countries to hold balances in dollar-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDB. These accounts support global payments and enable firms to manage stablecoins alongside traditional payment methods. PayPalPayPal is set to launch a rewards program offering users a 3.7% annual yield on holdings of its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), in PayPal or Venmo wallets. This initiative aims to encourage the adoption and utilization of PYUSD for various transactions, including merchant payments and peer-to-peer transfers.PayPal has expanded its partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption and utilization of PYUSD. This collaboration focuses on developing stablecoin-based payments and banking solutions, as well as exploring other use cases for PYUSD in DeFi and onchain platforms.Protocols vs. platforms: The distinct approachesWhile Visa, Stripe and PayPal are making significant strides in integrating AI and stablecoins into their services, these companies still operate within walled gardens. They offer services, not protocols. Their infrastructures are:Centralized: Governed by corporate policies and APIs.Permissioned: Access requires onboarding, KYC and platform approval.Closed ecosystems: Where user experience and interoperability are tightly controlled.In contrast, x402 is permissionless and open, allowing any developer to plug into it without needing a merchant account. And the distinction between centralized services and open protocols like x402 will play a crucial role in shaping the future landscape of digital payments, potentially leading to a more decentralized and agent-driven economy.                  What is x402’s monetization model?              One of the most practical use cases for x402 is API monetization. In today’s model, developers must create keys, handle access tiers, and enforce rate limits manually. With x402, APIs can simply respond to unauthenticated requests with a 402, indicating a cost, for example, $0.001 to access a data endpoint.A client can then send the required stablecoin payment and receive the response instantly. This turns APIs into microservices with embedded pricing, enabling fine-grained monetization at the level of individual function calls. It’s a model that fits naturally with both AI workloads and human developers who want to pay only for what they use.Stablecoins like USDC are central to the success of x402 and agentic payments more broadly. Their key benefit is price stability, allowing developers and agents to transact in predictable units without worrying about crypto volatility. That’s critical for applications that operate with tight budgets or usage-based pricing.USDC also offers fast finality, especially on chains like Base, Solana and Ethereum layer 2s, where transfers can confirm in seconds with minimal fees. Its broad support across wallets, APIs and ecosystems makes it a practical choice for integration. Other stablecoins like PYUSD or EURC may become relevant, but USDC’s dominance in DeFi and institutional finance gives it a clear head start.                  Challenges and opportunities for agentic payments              Agentic payments raise important questions around security, like how can bots manage private keys safely? There’s also the issue of abuse — will bad actors flood servers with fake payments or exploit pricing models? Regulatory concerns also loom.But the upside is enormous. The emergence of a machine-to-machine economy has led to a situation where agents transact for data, compute, bandwidth and services without human input. Protocols like x402 are the rails that will power this fast, open and crypto-native economy.Coinbase’s x402 is more than a technical upgrade; it’s a new payment primitive for the programmable web. By bringing crypto payments over HTTP to AI agents and APIs, x402 transforms how the internet handles value. It opens the door to a future where transactions are embedded, automatic and driven by machines, not just people. As the digital economy evolves, protocols like x402 could become the foundation of the new internet, powered by a new-age financial infrastructure.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbases-x402-crypto-payments-over-http-for-ai-and-apis?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The notes are convertible to BTCS common stock at a fixed price of $5.85 per share, almost 200% more than the company’s $1.99 stock price on May 13. The notes carry a two-year maturity and a 6% annual interest rate. This means that BTCS has two years to repay the loan if it’s not converted into stock, and that while the notes are active, the company will pay 6% in interest yearly. In simple terms, investors are betting that BTCS stock will rise. In exchange, the company gains access to capital for scaling its Ethereum operations.  Investors also received an option to buy 1.9 million shares at $2.75 each for the next five years. This is much higher than the current stock price but lower than the conversion rate stated in the agreement. The financing agreement follows the company’s recent use of the lending protocol Aave to borrow funds to acquire ETH. However, the company did not disclose in the announcement how much ETH it had acquired through the protocol.

2025-05-15T09:00:00.000Z,"The value of virtual: Economies are powered by ownership of the intangible","Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca BrandsA discussion on digital property rights, copyright, intellectual property, the open metaverse, AI and value without physical form.When I attend conferences and similar public events, someone almost always approaches me to ask how cryptographic tokens (fungible or non-fungible) can have value even though tokens are virtual and do not exist in the physical world. It's a surprisingly common question, especially one-on-one.Virtual objects like NFTs and cryptocurrencies are both digital and intangible; their existence is not based in the real (physical) world, and (unlike digital currencies) they generally do not have backing by real-world institutions. The ability to have value (specifically, monetary worth) is crucially important regarding the open metaverse, the decentralized internet of Web3 characterized by true digital ownership (see What IS the open metaverse?).I recently delved into the value of the virtual during an interview with CNBC, which may prove quite helpful to some readers. I'd like to discuss this topic in greater detail and with some historical context.When discussing whether something that doesn't exist in the real world can have real monetary worth, it is important to remember that intangible things have carried value for centuries; the key is ownership and the benefits associated with that ownership.How the ownership of ideas created the modern worldOne of the most important building blocks of modern industry and innovation-based economies was laid down more than three centuries ago in Great Britain with the long form title of \""An Act for the Encouragement of Learning by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of Such Copies, During the Times Therein Mentioned.\"" Also known as the Statute of Anne and the Copyright Act of 1709 (or 1710), this legislation provided the basis for modern copyright and intellectual property laws by establishing that the author of a particular work, not its publisher, was its rightful owner. The statute marked a pivotal moment in history by distinguishing between creators and distributors in much the same way that today we distinguish between creators (artists, writers, musicians, etc.) and the platforms that distribute their works (Netflix, Medium, Spotify, etc.).By granting creators exclusive rights to their works for a limited time, the Statute of Anne and subsequent acts established an economic framework for intellectual property under which creators could retain control and financial benefits over their works. At the same time, society gained access to those works through public libraries, book sales and similar means of distribution. The result was a veritable explosion of literature, science and philosophy that fueled the European Age of Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution.This period in history saw the rise of literary giants such as Jane Austen, Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, and intellectual titans including Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, Hume, Mary Wollstonecraft and Adam Smith. In the sciences, the publicly available work of visionaries like Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and Marie Curie allowed us to radically advance our understanding of the physical world. The ability to own their ideas brought fame and financial independence to innovators, enabling them to challenge norms, push boundaries and distribute groundbreaking ideas. Copyright provided an economic incentive to create and share idea-based works, ensuring that contributions would endure and inspire future generations. Copyright was so powerful and impactful that other nations followed with their own measures, including the United States with its Copyright Act of 1790.Copyright and other forms of intellectual property protection have been accelerating innovation and powering economies for over three centuries. One of the most notable examples of this effect is China.China was a free haven for IP infringement. Pirated digital and physical goods were prevalent until the 1990s and early 2000s, when China began to strengthen its IP protection. This contributed to a meteoric rise in domestic Chinese innovation, and today, China is the world's leading generator of ideas in the form of scientific studies, patents, technology, content, etc.China's reforms to IP protection in the 1990s and early 2000s contributed to an explosion in the number of annual patent applications, considered a proxy indicator of innovation (image from Our World in Data)Owning the work of our mindsToday, it is widely acknowledged that intellectual property is subject to ownership just like material things, even though it is intangible and time-bound. We recognize that copyright, trademarks, patents and similar measures establish and protect ownership of the intangible.In a previous essay, I mentioned the work of the philosopher John Locke, describing the man as \""one of the OGs in the field of ownership and a major inspiration for both the European Enlightenment and the US Constitution.\""Loosely stated, Locke reasoned that a person has a natural right to own the labor of their \""body\"" and \""hands.\"" Copyright applied this Lockean view to the intangible products of the mind. Recent: Why crypto’s next breakthrough could start in the classroom — Animoca’s Yat SiuAs I noted in that essay, Locke's reasoning — that a person's labor generates property — provided a strong basis for \""ownership of intangibles including intellectual property, usage time, data, and the derivatives of data.\"" Intellectual property is fundamentally intangible: Scientific breakthroughs, literary works, musical compositions and various other creations of the mind emerge \""from thin air\"" and without fixed physical form. In capitalist economies, the protection of intellectual property plays a crucial role in supporting and incentivizing creators, making it possible for the work of our minds to enjoy commercial success, distribution and longevity. Without IP protection, entire industries (including technology, science and medicine) would be severely stunted by the lack of economic incentives to undertake research and development. It is no exaggeration to say that the Statute of Anne changed the world by launching a framework for creators to own and protect the work of their minds, which in turn made it possible to enhance and sustain innovation.The introduction of intellectual property protection laid the foundation for ownership over the intangible. It enabled our minds to create intangible capital assets, thus fuelling the economic engines of wealth generation. Just as importantly, copyright granted rights explicitly to creators, helping to decentralize the concentration of power away from big publishers.Ownership of the intangible represents such obvious and immense value to us at Animoca Brands that we made the advancement of digital property rights our core mission.The economic power of assets without physical existenceIt is well established in traditional business and finance that the intangible can have worth. Brand equity, intellectual property and goodwill are all considered valuable. The reams of intangible data you produce daily through your online activities are highly prized by companies and platforms that use it (and sometimes abuse it) to extract value from you.Consider that intangibles already dominate the global economy:The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) estimated that in 2019, IP-intensive industries contributed 41% of US domestic economic activity, supporting 63 million jobs (44% of total US employment).The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) estimated that in 2023, intangible assets were valued at $62 trillion — multiples more than the total market cap of gold (about $17 trillion to $25 trillion).(On a related topic, the sheer economic power of IP makes recent suggestions by Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk that we should \""delete all IP law\"" all the more bizarre. Removing something that has successfully driven innovation, investment and development for more than 300 years hardly seems like the wisest course of action. I discussed this matter in a thread on X.)Blockchain technology is a game-changer because it can provide provable ownership, scarcity and economic opportunities for intangible assets in a decentralized manner at minimum cost, quickly and securely.In a non-blockchain framework, a public record of ownership for an asset is maintained by a trusted central authority, often a government agency. This presents significant challenges, including security, barriers to access, poor efficiency, high costs to owners, red tape and the poor cost-effectiveness of protecting items of relatively little worth.In blockchain-enabled frameworks, however, decentralized and immutable ledgers can greatly reduce waste, vulnerability and opportunity loss while providing and automating important record-keeping functions more efficiently and securely than centralized systems. But that's not all.The work of artificial mindsIP-based value creation is particularly critical in the context of the artificial intelligence revolution currently underway. IP protection recently gained attention through a viral trend of AI-generated images in the style of Hayo Miyazaki, the legendary founder of Studio Ghibli. This trend brought to the forefront some concerns about AIs that are trained using protected IP and the potential impact that easily generated imitations have on rightful IP owners.The film industry has been wrangling with this issue for years:\""OpenAI, a major US artificial intelligence company, and Google both wrote to the Office of Science and Technology Policy about an AI action plan this month, making the case that it would be beneficial for AI developers to be able to use copyrighted materials to train AI…\""SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents about 160,000 performers, wanted film and TV producers to obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas. They also fought for actors to be compensated at their usual rate — even if a digital replica of them performs the role.\""CBS News, March 17, 2025These are thorny issues that will impact most industries, sooner or later. Can a society successfully legislate to protect the work of our minds from the highly efficient imitative assaults of artificial intelligence? Will AI regulation enhance industries or merely restrict innovation and competitiveness? There is a technological solution to some of the concerns around AI and copyright. Blockchain provides a secure and trustable type of framework for large-scale tracking, provenance, ownership and various other aspects of intellectual property that are currently being challenged by generative AIs. Even better, blockchain can also facilitate usage tracking and royalty payments related to ownership of individual assets, even for assets of very low value. In the AI-driven world of the near future, blockchain technology can be the basis for efficient mechanisms that provide fair rewards and accreditation to creators whose intellectual property fuels AI (a subject I addressed briefly in my TED Talk). Digital property rights: The next frontierWhen someone asks me how NFTs or cryptocurrencies can have real value despite being intangible, I usually ask them the same question about the work of their favorite musician, author or filmmaker. Most people have a fundamental appreciation for intellectual property rights in the context of \""traditional\"" industries because those industries have considerable experience managing ownership of the intangible. Intellectual property is recognized to have real value without physicality, and creators have the right to ownership over their intangible creations, empowering them to create capital \""out of thin air\"" through the work of their minds. This also applies to virtual objects (and, indeed, virtual objects often represent or are linked to intellectual property).Whether you own an idea, something you wrote, a digital currency, or an NFT, the key point is ownership and its associated benefits. Ownership of something (virtual or real) confers some degree of opportunity that would otherwise not be possible without that ownership.As the world embraces the digital frontier, the mission of Animoca Brands strikes me as more relevant than ever: to make available digital property rights for all, thereby helping to ensure that all creators can be rewarded fairly not only for their own creations but also for their relative contributions to the work of others (such as AIs, social networks, advertisers, remixers, etc.).The same principle of ownership over the intangible that helped fuel the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, and the Information Age can now be extended to our digital lives in the decentralized open metaverse, where technological frameworks already enshrine provable ownership of the virtual, and where creating and accessing virtual assets is inherently democratic and easily available to all participants. A little over 315 years after the Statute of Anne began to pave the road that leads to the open metaverse, the confluence of technology and property rights is now poised to unlock nearly unimaginable creativity, economic empowerment and progress for billions of people. Opinion by: Yat Siu, executive chairman and co-founder, Animoca Brands.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

What this bill is really intended to do is regulate the entire space of stablecoins,” she added.Gillibrand said the revised bill includes “some ethics requirements,” but it was “not an ethics bill.”“If we were dealing with all President Trump’s ethics problems, it would be a very long and detailed bill,” she added.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, also on stage, was hopeful the Senate would vote on the stablecoin bill “early next week.”Armstrong, whose company cozied up to Trump by donating $1 million to his inauguration fund, declined to comment when asked if the President’s memecoin could impact the passage of bipartisan crypto bills.“It’s not my place to really comment on President Trump’s activity,” he said. “What I do think is important is that this bill remains focused on stablecoins.”Crypto bills “absolutely critical” to pass before midtermsThe crypto industry is pushing for Congress to pass the GENIUS Act and a Republican-drafted crypto market structure bill before the midterm elections on Nov. 3, 2026, where all 435 House seats and a third of the 100 Senate seats are up for election.“We have a very narrow window to get legislation through between now and the midterms,” Marta Belcher, the president of the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto.“I strongly suspect that window is going to close very quickly. I don't know if we're going to get another window like this to get legislation through,” she added.“It's absolutely critical that we get it through now, especially because there really is a real possibility that in the future we end up with an administration that is hostile to crypto.”The Association’s communications director, Chris Jonas, added that it’s critical the bills pass before Congress takes a recess for the month of August.Related: Crypto execs flock to DC to support Senate stablecoin bill “Once you get into the calendar year of the midterms, historically not a lot of legislation moves, so that's why it's so critical,” he explained.Trump should be on track to sign both crypto bills before the August break, according to Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets.Hines noted on stage at Consensus on May 13 that negotiations on both bills are still ongoing, but it was “the President's desire” to sign both “stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.\""Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-bill-wont-target-trump-senate-could-pass-may-26?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: CointelegraphThere have been two serious crypto-related attacks in Paris so far this month. On May 13, three assailants attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Earlier in the month, on May 3, Paris police freed the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was held for several days as part of a 7 million euro ($7.8 million) kidnapping plot. The attacks have prompted France’s interior minister to meet with crypto professionals and address rising security concerns. Last year, blockchain investigator ZachXBT sounded the alarm in October that he’d been receiving messages from multiple victims of crypto home invasion thefts in Western Europe at a much higher rate than other regions.“The message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable and that these units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful at holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,” Levin said.“And even if it’s not the people that are kidnapping those people, but actually going upstream to the organized crime groups that are orchestrating these,” he added. Online streamer Amouranth was the victim of a home invasion in March 2025 when several armed assailants held her at gunpoint and demanded the keys to her crypto wallet, four suspects were charged in connection with the incident and arrested by law enforcement.Crypto kidnapping “not such a profitable business”Levin says he hopes organized crime takes a message from crypto robbers being arrested, specifically, that it’s “not such a profitable business to be in,” and in some instances, the ransom payments might even be recoverable.“There is the ability to potentially recover some of those payments as well. I think that in general, the goal here is not necessarily the recovery of the money, but it’s holding those people to account,” he said.However, despite law enforcement having some success in tracking down criminals targeting the crypto industry, Levin says the spate of offline robberies is still a “bleak” situation, and the industry should be taking extra steps to stifle theft as well. “People need to be very careful about what information is shared about them online,” he said.Related: Teens kidnap Las Vegas man at gunpoint, stealing $4M in cryptoThis year, there have been 22 recorded incidents of in-person crypto-related theft compared to 28 in 2024, according to a GitHub list created by cypherpunk and co-founder of self-custodial firm Casa, Jameson Lopp.However, the number could be higher.

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.Source: X/AdrianoFeriaAccording to X user AdrianoFeria, ETH is “the best candidate for institutional diversification” since professional fund managers appreciate “similar levels of regulatory clarity and accessibility” through multiple spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), although recent data hasn’t been especially encouraging. Ether remains the sole alternative to spot Bitcoin ETFsBetween May 12 and May 13, US-listed Ether ETFs saw net outflows of $4 million. The size of the Ether ETF market is 92% smaller than Bitcoin’s $121.5 billion, highlighting a clear lack of institutional appetite for ETH-based products. This has led some traders to question whether Ether can truly gain traction among professional investors.ETH/USDT vs. competitors XRP, TRX, BNB, ADA. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphWhile competing cryptocurrencies have outperformed ETH in 2025, their chances of being included in US state-level digital asset reserves have plummeted. This follows President Trump’s decision on March 2 to distance himself from lobbyists supporting XRP, SOL, and ADA. The “Digital Asset Stockpile” executive order issued on March 6 was notably more cautious, drawing a clear line between Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins.Ether’s best-case scenario may involve a lack of direct ETF competition, which would depend on the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejecting several pending applications. Analysts also suggest that Ether ETFs could gain momentum from in-kind creation and staking approvals—developments considered highly likely before year-end, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart.‘Pectra’ upgrade improved scalability, setting the stage for AI adoptionPreviously hailed as the answer to Ether’s monetary policy, the built-in burn mechanism introduced in 2021 was designed to reduce supply growth based on network demand. However, the shift in focus toward scalability through rollups has largely offset its deflationary impact. As a result, a significant increase in onchain activity is now required for Ether to become deflationary once more.Ethereum rollups ranked by 30-day transactions. Source: L2BeatThe recent ‘Pectra’ upgrade has improved data transmission efficiency, setting the stage for enhanced scalability. Layer-2 network activity rose 23% compared to the previous month, with the Base network taking the lead at 244.2 million transactions in 30 days, according to L2beat. If this momentum holds, it could generate sustained demand for ETH and help further differentiate Ethereum from rival platforms.Related: Ethereum retakes 10% market share, but ETH bulls shouldn't celebrate yetSource: X/econoarThe path to a $5,000 ETH price remains uncertain, but artificial intelligence may serve as a powerful catalyst.

This growth could make a new all-time high for ETH in 2025 achievable, especially if institutional interest accelerates following long-awaited regulatory changes.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability. In the first quarter of 2025, Bitcoin’s spot price swung from more than $100,000 in January to less than $80,000 in March, according to data from Google Finance.

Source: Coin360However, not everyone is bullish in the short term. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson said in a post on X that Bitcoin is at the “Alpha Price” zone, which could attract profit booking by long-term holders or whales.  Could Bitcoin challenge the all-time high? Will altcoins continue their rally even if Bitcoin consolidates? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rebounded off $100,718 on May 12, indicating that the bulls are trying to flip the psychologically important $100,000 level into support.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price maintains above $100,000, the possibility of a retest of the all-time high increases. There is stiff resistance in the $107,000 to $109,588 zone, but if it is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000.The risk to the upside is a sharp pullback below the 20-day exponential moving average ($98,407), which could tempt several short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($89,952). Ether price predictionEther (ETH) skyrocketed above the $2,550 resistance on May 13, but the higher levels are attracting sellers.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe overbought level on the RSI signals a possible correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price slips below $2,550, the bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the ETH/USDT pair below $2,400. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($2,147).Contrarily, a bounce off $2,550 indicates that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That enhances the likelihood of a rally to $3,000.XRP price predictionXRP’s (XRP) rally is facing resistance at $2.65, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat improves the prospects of a rally above $2.65. Once the resistance is scaled, the XRP/USDT pair could ascend to $3. Buyers are expected to face significant resistance from the bears in the $3 to $3.40 zone.The 20-day EMA ($2.32) is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. If the price turns down sharply from $2.65 and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that bears remain sellers on rallies. That could result in a range formation between $2.65 and $2.BNB price predictionBuyers have kept BNB (BNB) above the breakout level of $644 but are struggling to push the price above the $675 level.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe rising 20-day EMA ($627) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that buyers have an edge. A break and close above $675 opens the doors for a possible rally to the overhead resistance of $745.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($603).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) resumed its up move after breaking above the $180 resistance on May 13, but the bulls are struggling to hold on to the higher levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears have pulled the price back below $180 on May 14. If they sustain the lower levels, the SOL/USDT pair could skid to the 20-day EMA ($159). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish momentum remains intact. The bulls will then try to catapult the pair to $210.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the breakout above $180 may have been a bull trap. The pair may then tumble to $153.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the breakout level of $0.21 on May 13, signaling that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.20) has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating advantage to buyers. A break and close above $0.26 signals the resumption of the rally. That opens the doors for a rally to $0.28 and thereafter to $0.31.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.21, it suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The DOGE/USDT pair may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($0.17), which is likely to act as strong support.Cardano price predictionBuyers have successfully held the retest of the neckline in Cardano (ADA), indicating buying on dips.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above $0.86. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the pattern target of $1.01.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the neckline. That suggests the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.68).Related: Ethereum retakes 10% market share, but ETH bulls shouldn't celebrate yetSui price predictionSui (SUI) has been sandwiched between $4.25 and $3.90 for the past few days, indicating that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf buyers propel the price above $4.25, the SUI/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to $5. Buyers may find it difficult to clear the overhead zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.Alternatively, if the price turns down and closes below $3.90, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may descend to the 20-day EMA ($3.57), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to overcome the barrier at $4.25.Chainlink price predictionChainlink’s (LINK) up move is facing selling at the resistance line, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($15.43) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. A short-term trend change will be signaled if buyers pierce the resistance line. The LINK/USDT pair could then rally toward the target objective of $21.30.Sellers will have to tug the price below the neckline to gain strength. That could pull the pair to the 50-day SMA ($13.96). A break and close below the 50-day SMA suggest the pair may remain inside the descending channel pattern for some more time.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) bounced off the breakout level of $23.50, indicating that the bulls have flipped the level into support.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThere is minor resistance at $28.78, but it is likely to be crossed.

If bears want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly pull the price below the 20-day EMA.

2025-05-14T17:37:33.000Z,"These five crypto figures vanished, died or fooled us all","Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu has been found alive at his parents’ home in San Francisco, days after faking his suicide on a livestream that launched a supposed posthumous memecoin past $100 million.Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.1. Jeffy Yu faked his death, then his crypto pumpedA clip of Yu broadcasting his “suicide” circulated on May 4. The video showed him smoking a cigarette before pulling the trigger, then the camera dropped.Hours later, a scheduled social media post announced the posthumous launch of LLJEFFY, a memecoin described as his “final art piece.” The coin surged to nearly $105 million in market cap.LLJEFFY’s market fell to $5.63 million from its $105 million peak. Source: DEX ScreenerBut Yu wasn’t dead. Blockchain wallets tied to him kept moving. A copy of a letter — allegedly written by Yu — described the exit design as a response to ongoing harassment and blackmail.Yu’s obituary on online memorial site Legacy.com has now been removed. Source: Vee/Legacy.comReporters from The San Francisco Standard eventually found Yu at his parents’ home. He refused to comment on the suicide stunt or whether he profited from it.In the world of memecoins, this kind of spectacle isn’t new. In late 2024, Pump.fun’s livestream feature triggered a wave of stunts — suicide threats, animal abuse and other shocking acts — to pump token prices. The company shut it down and later relaunched a toned-down version.2. A crypto whistleblower’s descent into paranoia and possible deathIn February 2025, a suspected Chinese programmer who called themselves Hu Lezhi burned 500 Ether (ETH) (worth around $1.3 million at the time) and donated another 1,950 ETH (over $5 million) to various groups like WikiLeaks and the Ethereum Foundation. All of it came with onchain messages alleging that a hedge fund called WizardQuant (aka Kuande Investment) was using “brain-computer weapons” to control its employees — including Hu.Related: 4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto marketsThe messages read like sci-fi horror. Hu claimed he’d been a mind-control test subject since childhood and warned of a future where humans were nothing more than “puppets or complete slaves to the digital machine.”Hu Lezhi’s final messages before disappearing. Source: EtherscanIn one of his last messages, Hu said they would “leave the world” if they reached the final stage of becoming a “complete slave to the digital machine.” Some translated the series of messages as an onchain suicide note.To date, they haven’t re-emerged. And unlike Yu, Hu’s wallet hasn’t moved.3. The crypto whiz and the cryptic tweet before his deathOn Oct. 28, 2022, DeFi developer Nikolai Mushegian posted a chilling tweet: “CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring… they are going to torture me to death.”By the next morning, he was found face-down in the surf near his beach house in Puerto Rico.A final tweet, a washed-up body, and silence louder than truth. Source: Nikolai Mushegian/fucnti0nZer0Mushegian wasn’t a random crypto kid. He was an early developer at MakerDAO and a key architect of the stablecoin ecosystem. He was also increasingly paranoid — or, depending on who you ask, increasingly aware. Critics dismissed the tweet as a mental health crisis, but others weren’t so quick to look away.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearThe timing of his death sparked a wave of theories: assassination, targeted silencing or even MKUltra-style mind control.Officially, it was ruled an accidental drowning.4. Crypto investors can’t believe QuadrigaCX founder’s deathIn December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, reportedly died in India from Crohn’s disease. But there was one massive problem: He was the only person with access to $190 million in crypto.Cotten’s case was so high-profile that it became the subject of a Netflix documentary. Source: Netflix/YouTubeAs news of his death spread, so did the questions. There was no public autopsy, his death certificate misspelled his name (spelling Cotten as Cottan), the casket was sealed, and a growing army of investors wanted his body exhumed for DNA testing.Quadriga officially declared bankruptcy in 2019. Thousands of clients were locked out of their funds. Eventually, investigators discovered the cold wallets were empty, prompting auditor EY to begin recovery efforts.Some suspected Cotten had run a Ponzi scheme for years and used his death as the ultimate escape plan. The rumors have not been confirmed, but the official story remains that he died a tragic death, as confirmed by Indian authorities. 5. Reports of Cryptoqueen’s death are greatly exaggeratedSelf-styled “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova, co-founder of the $4-billion OneCoin scam, hasn’t been seen since she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens in October 2017.Cotten left no access. Ignatova left no trace.Since then, rumors have swirled. Some say that she underwent plastic surgery and lives under a new identity or that she’s being protected by the Bulgarian mafia. A Bulgarian investigative outlet claims Ignatova was allegedly murdered in November 2018 on a yacht in the Ionian Sea and that her body was dismembered and dumped overboard under the orders of Bulgarian crime boss Christophoros Amanatidis to cover his ties to OneCoin.More recently, German officials reportedly assumed that Ignatova is in a South African suburb living with private security.Ignatova has been on the US FBI’s 10 Most Wanted list since 2022. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation raised Ignatova’s bounty to $5 million in June 2024.

Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating between an upper range of $105,700 and a lower range of $100,678. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin might retest the $100,000-$102,000 level before potentially breaking above $110,000.

Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the Association said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30.The departure of Mersinger, who has served in one of the CFTC’s Republican seats since 2022, opens the way for President Donald Trump to nominate another member to the financial regulator.

2025-05-14T15:00:00.000Z,"The facet of TradFi most ripe for disruption is equities","Opinion by: Mike Cahill, co-founder and CEO of Douro LabsDespite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private companies is an opportunity historically reserved only for the wealthy and hyper-connected. It is often siloed within the most economically advanced nations. Enhancing access to equities worldwide can be achieved, however, by injecting decentralized technology into three fundamental components of our financial system: price, execution and settlement.The bedrock of traditional financeEquities typically refer to shares of private companies, and they’re one of the most potent tools for wealth creation. On top of regulation, the main factor restricting access to equities is the infrastructure that underpins our financial system: stale and inaccurate pricing data, exclusive execution venues and painfully slow settlement periods. PriceTraditional equity markets are private. Here, pricing data is sequestered behind non-disclosure agreements, paywalls and groups of individuals who want to keep this information to themselves. Access to accurate, real-time pricing is what enables investors to make informed decisions, and it’s the crucial ingredient required to participate at all. If pricing data remains in the hands of those who can afford access or run in the right social circles, the system will continue to support only a small group of wealthy, privileged people.Recent: Ether sentiment hits yearly low but that could be a good thing: SantimentExecutionWhile many apps and platforms might make it seem like buying equities is as easy as pressing a button, the reality is that making these types of investments almost always requires strict vetting processes and minimum investment thresholds that everyday investors just don’t have access to. While it seems like public markets should be exempt from these barriers, brokerage fees and geographic limitations can still hamper participation. As a result, the current systems simply uphold the “rich get richer, poor get poorer” narrative.SettlementMost traders have experienced the frustratingly slow, highly bureaucratic and hazardous equity settlement systems in place today. It can take several days for a single trade to finalize. If it’s a cross-border trade, settlement times can lag even more. This results in capital being locked up, further dissuading smaller investors from participating — a snowball effect that keeps access to equities solely in the hands of the most elite traders. While these barriers are undoubtedly systemic, they’re also very solvable. As history has shown, time and time again, innovation always forces a shift. That’s where decentralized finance (DeFi) comes in.Reimagining infrastructure through DeFiDecentralized technologies have the potential to reimagine TradFi’s infrastructure to create a system that is faster, more accessible and more efficient and unlock new forms of equities participation. These include synthetic equity markets, tokenized private equity and even equity-based prediction markets.Regarding price, execution and settlement, DeFi and TradFi have the opportunity to work together, combining forces to offer a new foundation to the financial system that promotes equity, access and transparency. Decentralized price feeds offer real-time, accurate price data on equities that don’t come at the exorbitant price of a Bloomberg Terminal. They empower traders of any background or location to access fresh market data to trade equities with the same knowledge as the most elite traders. At the same time, decentralized execution platforms enable marketplaces for fractional, tokenized equity exposure. Now, if traders have an internet connection, they can make trades supported by smart contracts that automate trade matching, liquidity provision and order fulfillment. This empowers traders to purchase small, fractional stakes in these assets, empowering those even in the most rural and secluded areas of the world to own a piece of the same high-growth company as an accredited investor in the US. Finally, settlement in DeFi is almost instantaneous. That’s because blockchain removes the need for intermediaries, making it possible for equities to be traded in milliseconds. This dramatically reduces counterparty risk while unlocking capital for continuous use, making trading even more attractive to smaller players. Building the next generation of financeCreating a financial system that is genuinely democratized means more than encouraging institutions to buy and trade digital assets. It means rethinking the way our financial infrastructure exists and operates today. While equities are one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available, most of the global population still can’t access them due to geography, legacy and privilege. Through revolutionizing price, execution and settlement via decentralized innovations, equities can be entirely disrupted — closing the wealth gap that keeps billions of people at the mercy of a select few.Opinion by: Mike Cahill, co-founder and CEO of Douro Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) back toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate its recent rally just yet.Ether’s RSI most overextended since May 2021The strong recovery in Ethereum’s crypto market share has pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI) to its most overbought zone since May 2021, raising red flags for traders betting on further upside, at least in the short term. Historically, such extreme RSI levels on ETH.D have marked the beginning of major pullbacks. One notable instance occurred in early July 2024, when ETH dominance peaked near similar RSI levels. ETH.D daily performance chart. Source: TradingView Over the following 315 days, ETH.D dropped by more than 17.5%. The current RSI spike, again above 80, mimics a similar setup, suggesting that Ethereum could be nearing a local top in its market share.Adding to the bearish outlook, ETH.D remains below its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave). This resistance level has repeatedly capped Ethereum’s dominance during previous recovery attempts.Previous overbought pullbacks have initially pushed Ethereum’s market share toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave).The ETH.D metric, therefore, risks declining toward its current 50-day EMA support at around 8.24% by June, suggesting potential capital rotation out of Ethereum markets to other coins in the coming weeks.Bearish divergence signals 15% ETH price dropOn the four-hour ETH/USD chart, a classic bearish divergence is emerging, where Ethereum’s price continues to print higher highs, but momentum indicators trend lower. Crypto trader AlphaBTC noted that ETH is showing “three clear drives of divergence,” a setup often preceding trend exhaustion. He added that key Fibonacci levels align with potential support zones, suggesting a pullback could be imminent.ETH/USD four-hour price chart.

Fake team membersWhat to watch for: It’s easy to make an “our team” page on any website, let alone one offering a decentralized service. At a minimum, these pages should include photos, descriptions and links to LinkedIn or other verified social media platforms.How to verify: Double-check team pages for legitimacy. Some scammers might also set up fake social media pages, so scan those for authentic interactions and delve deep into each team member’s project history.3. Inconsistent white paperWhat to watch for: Let’s be honest, most scammers won’t expect customers to read their project white paper. It’s probably something they threw together in ChatGPT or even plagiarized from a legitimate project.How to verify: Read a project’s white paper in-depth and watch for legitimate use cases. Make sure the project solves a real problem, has a legitimate purpose and a realistic plan for the future. Don’t fall for buzzwords!Did you know? Justin Sun, founder of Tron’s long-standing blockchain platform, has been accused of plagiarizing Ethereum’s white paper.4. False endorsementsWhat to watch for: Just as it’s super easy to fabricate an “our team” page, scammers can place fake endorsements all over their home page. It’s as quick as copying and pasting a company logo like Forbes.How to verify: Instead of trusting an exchange’s webpage, look up news releases and other proof of these supposed endorsements. Cointelegraph provides a directory of legit exchanges to help you identify fake crypto websites.5. Lack of regulatory informationWhat to watch for: Now, regulatory requirements may vary depending on whether you’re looking at a centralized or decentralized platform, but if you’re looking at the former, know that centralized platforms cannot operate without regulatory approval from your government.How to verify: Typically, you can check a government database to confirm if a platform is licensed. If it’s not, it may not be trustworthy. For example, the CEO of Tether (USDT) refuses to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The company is known for its resistance to comply with regulatory policies, causing industry-wide suspicion.6. Pushy sales tacticsWhat to watch for: Pushy sales tactics are a big red flag. If a platform reaches out to you through social media, such as through a direct message on X, Discord or Telegram, you can be sure it’s a scam. Scammers might claim to be an employee or crypto influencer ready to provide you with an “exclusive offer” or “limited time deal.” How to verify: A real exchange would never reach out to potential customers like this, especially via social media. Social media DMs are widespread crypto scam tactics.Did you know? Some top crypto scams in 2024 were phishing attacks, rug pulls and fake airdrops. 7. Fake location/contact infoWhat to watch for: Crypto investment platforms with a real product, even decentralized ones, will have contact information. Even Uniswap has a support email with which to get in touch. Centralized entities should also have addresses of their offices, ones that you can cross-reference with Google Maps for legitimacy purposes. How to verify: If a crypto investment platform is missing any contact information, consider that a red flag. This is an easy sign to miss.8. Fake reviewsWhat to watch for: Tech products, blockchain-based and otherwise, feature user reviews front and center on their websites. That said, you can tell if these are real or manufactured. Keep an eye out for reviews with repetitive language and a lack of a critical eye, which only praise the platform. Glowing reviews are often fake, possibly even written by AI.How to verify: Search for platform reviews on Reddit and other social media sites. Other users will tell you if the platform is legit or not. If a platform has no social media accounts, there is more reason to avoid it.9. Fake airdrops or giveawaysWhat to watch for: Some fraudulent platforms may offer airdrops or giveaways as promotions to attract positive attention. However, participating in the fake airdrop might require inputting a wallet seed phrase or private key. How to verify: Legitimate airdrops will be announced on social media platforms like X, the platform’s blog on Medium or its official website. They’ll only ask for your wallet address, nothing more.3. No fiat offrampingWhat to watch for: A crypto exchange with no fiat offramping means it’s not registered with local financial institutions. The platform might demand that you only work in crypto.How to verify: If you sign up for an exchange and it immediately asks you to send crypto into your wallet on the platform instead of linking a payment method like a bank or card, this is a big red flag.Cryptocurrency investment scams thrive on urging you to make rash decisions. It’s always best to be skeptical when choosing where to trade, invest or hold your crypto. Take your time, do your research, and double-check every piece of information a platform provides. These crypto fraud prevention tips will help keep you safe, protecting your assets and peace of mind. Use them to create a crypto scam checklist.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-spot-a-fake-crypto-investment-platform-10-red-flags?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-14T07:50:00.000Z,"The Q-Day Prize challenge, explained: Can quantum computers really break Bitcoin?","What is the Q-Day prize?              The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.Quantum computing and the threat to BitcoinBitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, a National Security Agency (NSA)-developed encryption algorithm. SHA-256 prevents brute force attacks against the Bitcoin network, as decrypting it with current hardware can take decades. However, the emerging threat to SHA-256 is quantum computing, a method of computing that harnesses quantum physics and is much faster than traditional computing.At a fundamental level, quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states. This contradicts binary (traditional) computing, which uses binary bits (1s and 0s). In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor presented an algorithm for quantum computers to solve complex algorithms in seconds, rather than the decades it can take for conventional hardware. At the time, no hardware could effectively run it, but recent advances like Google Willow are nearing that capability.Quantum computing, when paired with Shor’s algorithm, can disrupt Bitcoin cryptographic systems as we know them. Shor’s algorithm allows quantum computers to solve complex math super fast, potentially threatening Bitcoin’s safety.Did you know? If quantum tech gets strong enough, Bitcoin’s current security could become obsolete, so developers are racing to create “quantum-proof” shields using new math that even Shor’s algorithm can’t break.                  Quantum threat to Bitcoin: How real is the danger?              Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum computing, but how serious is the risk?When you create a crypto wallet, it generates two important things: a private key and a public key. The private key is a secret code, like a password, that you must keep safe. The public key is created from your private key, and your wallet address (like a bank account number) is made from the public key.You share your wallet address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency, just like you share your email address for someone to contact you. However, you never share your private key. It’s like the password to your email — only you need it to access and spend the money in your wallet.Your private key is like a master password that controls your crypto wallet. From this private key, your wallet can create many public keys, and each public key generates a wallet address. For example, if you use a hardware wallet, it has one private key but can create unlimited public keys (wallet addresses). This means you can have different addresses for each cryptocurrency supported by the wallet or even multiple addresses for the same cryptocurrency, all managed by a single private key.While generating a public key from a private key is straightforward, figuring out a private key from a public key is extremely hard — almost impossible — which keeps your wallet secure. Every time you send cryptocurrency, your private key creates a special code called a signature. This signature proves you own the funds and want to send them. The system that uses your private key, public key and signature to secure transactions is called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).It is believed that quantum computing could reverse the process and generate private keys out of public ones. It is feared that this could cause many Bitcoin holders (especially whales and Satoshi-era wallets) to lose their funds. Bitcoin address types and quantum risksWhen you send Bitcoin, you use a specific address type to direct the payment. Each address type has unique features, affecting security, privacy and vulnerability to quantum computing attacks like Shor’s algorithm.P2PK address typesWhen you pay someone with Bitcoin, the transaction is typically considered a “pay-to-public-key” (P2PK). This was the most common payment method in 2009, according to a report from consulting firm Deloitte. Much of the original Bitcoin released at the network’s launch is held in wallets with the P2PK address type, primarily due to the fact that they’ve sent transactions since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch. These addresses are long (up to 130 characters), making them less user-friendly.Wallets with the P2PK address type are most susceptible to Shor’s algorithm, as it can brute force the private key from a P2PK wallet address. P2PKH address typesThere’s a second address type that’s more resistant to Shor’s algorithm: the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH). P2PKH addresses are shorter and are generated from the hash (a unique, hexadecimal value) of a public key created using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms instead of displaying the full key itself.These addresses are shorter (33-34 characters), start with “1,” and are encoded in Base58 format. Such addresses are widely used and include a checksum to prevent typos, making them more reliable.P2PKH addresses are more resistant to Shor’s algorithm than P2PK because the public key is hashed. The public key is only revealed when you spend from the address (not when receiving). If a P2PKH address never sends Bitcoin, its public key stays hidden, offering better protection against quantum attacks. However, reusing a P2PKH address (sending from it multiple times) exposes the public key, increasing vulnerability. Also, when you spend from a P2PKH address, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, making transactions trackable.Taproot addressesTaproot is the newest address type, introduced in November 2021 via the Taproot soft fork. It uses Schnorr signatures instead of the ECDSA signatures used by P2PK and P2PKH. These addresses start with “bc1p,” use Bech32m encoding, and are 62 characters long.They offer better privacy. Multisignature (multisig) transactions look like single-signature ones, hiding complex spending conditions. However, Taproot addresses expose the public key (or a tweaked version), making them vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, similar to P2PK. Did you know? Google’s “Willow” computer chip is capable of solving a complex problem in just five minutes. The same task would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion (!) years.                  The race toward quantum-proofing Bitcoin              Quantum resistance is a real challenge, but not an impossible one.Quantum computers, still in early development, could one day use Shor’s algorithm to break Bitcoin’s cryptography by deriving private keys from public keys. This would threaten Bitcoin and other systems using SHA-256 or ECDSA (the algorithms securing Bitcoin transactions). However, this threat is not imminent, and solutions are already in progress.While some believe that Project 11 presented the Q-Day Prize to take down Bitcoin, the company claims this initiative is aimed at “quantum-proofing” the network.In July 2022, the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced four quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms resulting from a six-year challenge to develop such solutions.Quantum computing won’t develop in isolation, and centralized systems like government and financial networks could be bigger targets than Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain. These systems use outdated cryptography, like RSA, vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, and store sensitive data (e.g., banking records). Their single points of failure make breaches easier than attacking Bitcoin’s distributed nodes. The International Monetary Fund warns quantum computers could disrupt mobile banking, while Dr. Michele Mosca from the Institute for Quantum Computing highlights “harvest-now, decrypt-later” risks for centralized data (where attackers store encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers). In 2024, the G7 Cyber Expert Group urged financial institutions to assess quantum risks, noting that centralized systems’ data could be exposed if intercepted now and decrypted later.Did you know? Many blockchain networks are exploring quantum-resistant algorithms, such as Quantum Resistant Ledger or Algorand. These quantum computing blockchain security methods present a few different approaches.                  How to increase your security against quantum threats              While the quantum computing cryptocurrency risk is less of a threat than one might think, it’s still best to stay prepared.Still, if you’re worried about Bitcoin quantum vulnerability, there are a few precautions you can take to secure your crypto finances.Avoid reusing public addresses: Most crypto wallets allow you to generate a new public address for every transaction. This practice will make it much harder to track your spending habits.Move funds to a private wallet: If you’ve been using the same public wallet address for some time, consider moving your funds to a new wallet with no history. This will help keep your spending habits private. Use a different blockchain network: Legacy networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered less quantum resistant than newer networks with more modern security algorithms. Consider alternative networks with quantum resistance in mind.Stay informed: Pay attention to the results of the Q-Day Prize challenge, and stay up to date with quantum computing news so you can react accordingly. The best defense is an informed one.While quantum risk is not immediate, developers and cybersecurity experts are actively working on solutions to ensure long-term security. In the meantime, users should stay updated about Bitcoin protocol updates and best practices, such as avoiding address reuse, as the network gradually moves toward quantum resistance.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/the-q-day-prize-challenge-explained-can-quantum-computers-really-break-bitcoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:47:22.000Z,"Kima joins Mastercard sandbox to enable stablecoin card top-ups","Decentralized settlement protocol Kima has integrated into Mastercard’s sandbox program, enabling stablecoin-powered top-ups for prepaid cards directly from self-custody wallets.According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Mastercard partners can now rely on Kima’s settlement infrastructure to allow their prepaid cards to be topped up with stablecoins, including USDC (USDC) and Tether’s USDt (USDT), from self-custody wallets across more than 10 blockchains. Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use and remove friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability.“Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said.Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024Infrastructure designed for interoperabilityKatz described Kima’s settlement system as asset-agnostic and designed to simplify cross-ecosystem payments, supporting public blockchains, private ledgers and traditional banking rails:“Kima’s asset-agnostic settlement layer is designed to abstract the complexity of transferring value across disparate ecosystems, whether that’s public blockchains, private ledgers, or even traditional banking systems.”According to the announcement, Kima’s infrastructure is aligned with Mastercard’s aim to bring stablecoins into mainstream financial usage. Katz rejects the Bitcoin and crypto hardliner vision of digital assets being contrapposed to fiat currency, claiming that “crypto and fiat must coexist seamlessly to reach their full potential.”Katz explained that Kima’s solution allows for easy crosschain interoperability and eliminates the reliance on intermediaries, custodians or complex smart contracts. This, in turn, reportedly enhances security and efficiency for all parties involved.Related: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin paymentsECB includes Kima in digital euro initiativeEarlier in May, the European Central Bank (ECB) included Kima in a list of 70 private sector partners tasked with helping with digital euro innovation. The firms on the list have signed up to work with the ECB to explore digital euro payment functionalities and use cases.“The breadth and creativity of the proposals highlights the digital euro’s potential as a catalyst for financial innovation in Europe,” ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone said at the time.Source: KimaDespite Kima’s institutional partnerships, Katz told Cointelegraph that “compliance shouldn’t mean giving up control of your funds or your data.” He said that know-your-client and Anti-Money Laundering checks are handled by third-party banks and virtual asset service providers at onboarding, and Kima never has access to the data. Katz added that “once a user is cleared, every transaction carries immutable metadata tags that our protocol-level engine checks against local rules.” This, he said, covers compliance “from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to Singapore’s regulatory guidelines — before settlement.”Katz said that “keys are kept entirely under the users’ control,” while cryptographic proofs still allow for compliance.“Institutions get a plug-and-play control layer and users enjoy true self-custody,” Katz added.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kima-integrates-with-mastercard-sandbox-to-enable-stablecoin-card-top-ups?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:11:44.000Z,"Alarm bells ring in US over OpenAI’s crypto project World","World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices.World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.World’s latest foray into the US could prove to be CEO Sam Altman’s biggest challenge yet, where privacy concerns are heightened by a patchwork of enforcement that differs state by state.Varying privacy laws could leave World users open to discriminationOn April 30, Altman announced that World would set up in “key innovation hubs” in five states in the US: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Would-be verified humans can scan their irises at these hubs, giving World unique biomedical markers. These markers, per World, can be used to prove one’s humanness when interacting with others on digital platforms. But as World expands into the US, an uncertain regulatory landscape could put people off and make it difficult for the platform to build user trust. Andrew Rossow, a cyber and public affairs attorney at Rossow Law, told Cointelegraph, “There is no comprehensive federal law specifically regulating biometric data (such as iris scans) in the US.”Indeed, laws differ state by state. Two states in which World will operate, Texas and California, have some form of legal protections on the books for biometric data. Users in the remaining three states, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, must rely on federal law, which requires that “companies must be transparent and fair, but there are no special state rules for iris scans.”But even the existence of state law is no guarantee of protection. In Texas, there is no private right of action for biometric data — only the state attorney general (AG) can enforce the state’s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier law. Altman announced World’s foray into the US market at a company event two weeks ago. Source: World“The effectiveness of user data protections, as it pertains to World, hinges almost entirely on the Texas AG’s priorities, resources and willingness to act,” said Rossow. A more aggressive AG could mean more robust protections, while “a less aggressive administration could deprioritize enforcement, which leaves consumers open and vulnerable to exploitation.”The potential for exploitation is one of the key factors driving activist efforts against systems like World. Privacy International, a privacy protection group that supported legal action in Kenya against World, states that in “the absence of strong legal frameworks and strict safeguards, biometric technologies pose grave threats to privacy and personal security, as their application can be broadened to facilitate discrimination, profiling and mass surveillance.”Related: Over 70 crypto firms join forces to tackle Big Tech’s AI monopolyAs far back as 2021, Amnesty International had raised concerns over discrimination and biometric systems’ applications of dubious methodologies. Such systems, they said, can “make inferences and predictions about things such as people’s gender, emotions, or other personal attributes, suffer from serious, fundamental flaws in their scientific underpinnings.”“This means that the inferences they make about us are often invalid, in some cases even operationalizing eugenicist theories of phrenology and physiognomy.”Not everyone is convinced of privacy watchdogs’ concerns. Tomasz Stańczak, co-executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, said that he has spent “over 100 hours” analyzing World, which is building on the Ethereum network. He added that it “looked very promising and much more robust and privacy-focused than my initial intuition.”Paul Dylan-Ennis, an Ethereum researcher and academic, said that he believes World’s tech “is likely strong in privacy terms” but admitted that the aesthetic could be putting people off: “Just some intangible Black Mirror-ness to it all.”Worldcoin faces mounting bans worldwideOpenAI may be doubling down on an American strategy, but other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly investigating, limiting or outright banning the firm’s activities. In 2023, regulators in India, South Korea, Kenya, Germany and Brazil began investigating the firm’s data collection practices. Spain became the first country to ban World data collection outright in March 2024. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interviewThe Spanish Data Protection Agency previously told Cointelegraph that its course of action was based on reports from Spanish citizens. It claimed that Orb operators provided “insufficient information, collected data from minors and even failed to allow withdrawal of consent.”Following the ban, World published a blog post stating that it operates “lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available.” World has recently made its iris-scanning orbs more compact and transportable. Source: WorldGlobal regulators disagreed. Hong Kong followed Spain in May 2024 and ordered World to cease operations as it was allegedly violating the city-state’s Personal Data Privacy Ordinance.Further accusations of improper data collection practices followed, and a number of countries like Germany and, more recently, Kenya, have ordered World to delete the data of thousands of users, while Colombia and Argentina have issued hefty fines.In January 2025, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority banned World outright, citing concern over the irreversible nature of data collection and the potential for World to influence economically disadvantaged people with the promise of crypto for their data. Opportunities in Japan and the USDespite protestations in various countries, the ID system is making inroads. In Japan, World is now a part of dating online. Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Match Group, which includes dating app Tinder in its portfolio, announced on May 1 that Tinder would be trialing World’s ID system on Tinder in Japan, “giving users a privacy-first way to prove they’re real humans.”Tinder users in Japan can swipe right with World ID-verified users. Source: WorldThe integration in Japan is yet to take off, but as Tinder is the most popular dating app in Japan, it provides a major use case for the World identity platform. In 2024 alone, it had some 1.38 million downloads.If World could score a Tinder partnership in the US, it would acquire 7.8 million monthly active members overnight. If it expanded to similar services like Bumble or Hinge — the next two most popular dating apps in the country — World will have captured 67% of the US online dating market, comprising the personal, unique identities of tens of millions of users. But privacy rights in the US are far from settled. In Texas, one of the states where World plans to operate, Google recently settled to the tune of $1.4 billion. The company paid the eye-watering sum to the state of Texas after settling two lawsuits alleging the firm of tracking user search and location data, as well as collecting facial recognition information. Elsewhere, in Illinois and New York, biometrics firms face court proceedings, while lawmakers take measures to curtail the collection of biometric data.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alarm-bells-us-openai-world-privacy-concerns?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:09:58.000Z,"Crypto VC deals drop in Q1, but funding more than doubles: PitchBook","Crypto venture capital deals in the first quarter of 2025 saw deal values jump even as the number of deals sank from the same quarter a year ago, says PitchBook.The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.PitchBook's senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”VCs poured nearly $2.55 billion across 16 deals into businesses like crypto asset managers, exchanges, and financial services at a rate that far surpassed any other segment.Crypto infrastructure and development firms saw the next largest venture funding, fetching nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively. Source: PitchBook.Looking ahead, PitchBook’s Le said Circle’s pending initial public offering (IPO) “represents the most important price-discovery event for crypto equity since Coinbase listed in 2021.”If Circle is valued above the rumored $4 billion to $5 billion range, it could show venture investors that business models similar to Circle’s are profitable and sustainable while also providing a clearer benchmark for future exits.“A strong roadshow could therefore crowd in new late-stage capital and reset valuation expectations upward across the payments and infrastructure stack.”Circle has raised $1.18 billion in VC funding to date, according to PitchBook, which estimates a 64% chance that it will go public in the future.“Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application”Le noted that the market value of stablecoins grew 12% over the first quarter, from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion, even as other cryptocurrencies saw their values fall or stagnate.“In our view, this divergence underscores a growing consensus: Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially— from broader risk-off moves.”Le said PitchBook expected that near-term venture investments could increase, “especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.”Related: Bitcoin builders defend venture capital's role in layer-2 growthLe added that the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit in February — the largest in crypto history — may accelerate institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tooling, improved custody solutions and middleware that simplifies key management.“Startups addressing those vectors should find a more receptive funding environment despite the broader valuation reset,” he added.Notable crypto venture-backed or growth-stage companies that received investment in Q4 2024.

2025-05-14T07:07:14.000Z,"Crypto swapper eXch shows signs of life after post-Bybit shutdown","Once a go-to swapper for hackers and drainers, eXch was shut down by German police in April — but continued activity suggests the story isn’t over.Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, German authorities made it official.But according to security firm TRM Labs, the platform may have continued operating in stealth mode after the takedown. Here’s the rise, fall and afterlife of alleged crypto laundromat eXch.eXch shuts front door, keeps back door unlockedAlongside its shutdown announcement, eXch posted a message claiming it would not facilitate criminal proceeds. The post was removed within hours, and operations quietly resumed — signs of an internal disagreement or perhaps even a calculated attempt to lower visibility, according to TRM.CSAM-related fund flows traced to eXch. Source: TRM LabsGerman authorities seized eXch’s servers and confiscated 34 million euros ($38 million) in crypto, along with more than eight terabytes of data, effectively dismantling its public-facing infrastructure.Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview“Just like we saw with Garantex rebranding as Grinex, eXch didn’t fully die after the shutdown. It quietly kept servicing a handful of partners via API, which meant laundering activity continued even after the public takedown,” said Jeremiah O’Connor, co-founder and chief technology officer of security firm Trugard.O’Connor added that it’s not unlikely for such platforms to serve loyal customers even after seizures.EXch website visited on May 13. Source: eXch“The people behind eXch.ch took full advantage of operating across multiple countries. The domain was registered through a UK-based provider, listed Switzerland as an admin location, hosted infrastructure in France, and had servers seized in Germany,” O’Connor said.It’s still unclear if eXch will kill its API or come back under a new name. TRM said in the May 2 blog post that the platform’s remaining back-end access continued to provide anonymization infrastructure for threat actors.No KYC, pooled liquidity draws illicit funds to eXchEXch’s origins trace back to 2014, according to “Fantasy,” lead investigator at crypto insurance firm Fairside Network. In an October 2024 investigation, Fantasy identified the platform’s first public appearance as a BitcoinTalk forum account promoting automatic swaps between Bitcoin (BTC), Perfect Money and BTC-e vouchers — payment methods commonly associated with high-risk transactions. Fantasy also traced the original Bitcoin wallet tied to eXch and found it was likely funded via BTC-e, the now-defunct crypto exchange shuttered by US authorities in 2017 for its role in laundering criminal proceeds.Fantasy’s forensic research found that the modernized form of eXch emerged in 2022, when its Ethereum hot wallet was first funded. Not long after, it became a hub for prominent crypto drainers.Monkey Drainer — the first known large-scale drainer-as-a-service operator — used eXch before its retirement. Other draining service providers like Pink Drainer and Inferno Drainer also passed funds through the platform, along with several major exploiters.EXch’s modern wallets traced to accounts held at Binance and OKX. Source: Fantasy/MetaSleuthEXch required no identity verification, allowing users to move funds with anonymity. That made it an attractive tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen assets.“EXch managed to stay active for years — despite facilitating obvious illicit activity — because there’s still a big gap between what regulators ‘can’ do and how fast technology is moving,” Amit Levin, former investigator at Binance, told Cointelegraph.“In today’s world, anyone can launch a smart contract or run a crypto service from anywhere, often without revealing who they are. And if there’s no registration, no KYC and no one to hold accountable, enforcement becomes close to impossible.”The platform also drew confidence from threat actors by using a pooled liquidity system that blended user deposits and withdrawals, making it difficult for investigators and law enforcement to trace the flow of funds.When eXch knew and did nothingEXch denied laundering funds for North Korean crypto hackers, and in its shutdown notice, it framed the project as an attempt by privacy enthusiasts to “restore balance” in the industry. It criticized Anti-Money Laundering enforcement and condemned companies offering address risk scoring APIs as “parasites” profiting off government fear.“Service providers in the crypto space are, for the most part, not decentralized; that is, they retain control over or access to customers’ assets, as demonstrated in the case of eXch,” Gal Arad Cohen, partner at S. Horowitz & Co, told Cointelegraph.“A financial intermediary operating in the crypto sector faces risks similar to those of traditional financial service providers and should, therefore, be held to equivalent standards and regulatory requirements,” she said.The closure of eXch is a “huge win” for crypto, according to Alex Katz, CEO of security firm Kerberus. However, Katz warned that bad actors can migrate to alternative projects, like THORChain, which received a shoutout in eXch’s unapologetic farewell manifesto.In the Bybit hack, decentralized swap protocol THORChain was used as the main bridge to swap around 500,000 Ether (ETH) to Bitcoin.EXch operators also used THORChain to allegedly obfuscate trails. Source: Tanuki42EXch stated that its partners would retain access to its API for a limited time, but future operations would depend on the “new management team.” The old team recommended setting up new liquidity pools to maintain seamless functionality and said it would provide consultations.It signed off with a defiant message: “Privacy is not a crime.”German authorities reported that $1.9 billion in crypto flowed into eXch since its inception. Its operators are suspected of commercial money laundering and running a criminal trading platform.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exch-signs-life-bybit-shutdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

He added that the tokens will be launched within the next two months.The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments.“One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in government bonds.” Until recently, retail investors have been limited or excluded from large investment product offerings in Thailand, which are predominantly aimed at institutional and wealthy investors.Finance Minister Pichai said the initial token mint is designed to “test the market” and investors will earn higher returns than bank deposits, but did not specify yields.Commercial banks in Thailand offer very low interest rates to savers, currently just 1.25% for a 12-month fixed deposit, which is much lower than rates set by its central bank, which has kept rates elevated until recently despite increasing economic woes. Related: Tether Gold enters Thailand with listing on Maxbit exchangeThe report noted that the asset was not a cryptocurrency. It would be tradable on licensed digital asset exchanges, which are not accessible to non-Thai citizens residing in the country.Government bonds are debt securities issued by the state to fund public spending. When investors buy them, they are essentially lending money to the government for a specified period in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of their principal at maturity.In February, Thailand’s securities regulator revealed plans to launch a tokenized securities trading system for institutional investors. Global bond value onchain doubles in 2025The value of tokenized bonds globally has surged recently and is currently $225 million, according to real-world asset tokenization analytics platform RWA.xyz. Global bond value onchain.
