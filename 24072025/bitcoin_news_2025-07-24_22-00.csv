2025-07-24T19:55:20,"Billionaire Mike Novogratz Says Ethereum Has a Chance To Outperform Bitcoin in Coming Months ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why","The chief executive of crypto investment firm Galaxy says that Ethereum ( ETH ) looks primed to outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the coming months. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Mike Novogratz says that if the top altcoin were to hit the $4,000 price tag again, it would trigger a ‚Äúprice discovery‚Äù phase for the asset, one that could see it outpace the crypto king. ‚ÄúEther is caught up a lot. It feels like if ETH takes out $4,000, it goes into price discovery. And so we feel kind of destined to at least knock on the $4,000 ceiling a few times. The narrative [that] Ether is really powerful in the market was really short. And now we have not just one, we have two major ETH treasury companies and another one coming, and they‚Äôre raising capital every day and buying Ether. And so there‚Äôs not a lot of supply of ETH, and so I think ETH probably has a chance of outperforming Bitcoin in the next three to six months.‚Äù Ethereum is trading for $3,756 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Moving on to the crypto king, the billionaire says that the top crypto asset by market cap appears destined to hit a price tag of $150,000. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in price discovery [for] a lot of these things. And so $150,000 seems to me a decent target‚Ä¶. We have seen sellers that have come in, and so it‚Äôs not a one-directional trade. There have been some sellers that have come in and have slowed things down, but it feels like we‚Äôre destined to go higher as long as this narrative continues. If Trump changes his mind, you know, and says, hey, we‚Äôve done such good work, the economy doesn‚Äôt need lower rates, that would that would, you know, that would change my thesis. But until that happens, I think we‚Äôre headed towards $150,000.‚Äù BTC is trading for $119,328 at time of writing, a 1% gain during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-24T19:21:46,"$250K in 24H: Bitcoin Hyper Rockets Past $4.5M as Capital Flows From BTC to HYPER Ahead of ‚ÄòAltcoin August‚Äô","Staying true to its high-speed DNA, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has now smashed past $4.5 million in presale funding, and it hasn‚Äôt even been two months since launch. As the first Bitcoin (BTC) Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper blends Solana‚Äôs unmatched speed with Bitcoin‚Äôs base-layer security, converting BTC from a static store of value into a programmable asset that mobilizes across DeFi, apps, payments, and token ecosystems. And while Bitcoin itself hovers just below $120,000, over $250,000 flooded into the HYPER presale in the past 24 hours alone ‚Äì a clear signal that early investors are repositioning, shifting capital toward what could be the token that will define ‚ÄòAltcoin August‚Äô. The current presale round is still open at $0.012375 per HYPER token but only for the next three hours, before the price automatically ticks up. The Setup for a Full-Blown Alt Season Summer in the northern hemisphere often acts as a springboard for the crypto market, with capital typically boosting prices before more decisive moves hit in October and November. In previous years, we‚Äôve seen DeFi summers, NFT booms, and last year‚Äôs meme coin frenzy. Now, with Ethereum (ETH) climbing faster than Bitcoin ‚Äì which still hasn‚Äôt made clear attempts at another all-time high ‚Äì speculation around an incoming altcoin season is gaining wide currency. Meme coins briefly surpassed $90 billion in market cap this week before cooling off as traders locked in gains. This pause could signal another push for a BTC peak, which would then be followed by a true altcoin rally, potentially turning August into a full-blown alt season. Ethereum‚Äôs continued outperformance remains the clearest signal. Historically, when ETH leads, capital flows down the ladder ‚Äì first to Layer-1s, then to smaller, higher-beta plays. Since late May, ETH/USD has steadily climbed, and if profit-taking begins here, the next surge could target fresh narratives and newer tokens. Source: TradingView So what will define August this time around? Will meme coins reclaim the spotlight? Could AI tokens steal the stage? Or will the spotlight shift to a project that metamorphoses the world‚Äôs most valuable crypto into the foundation of an entirely new ecosystem? If it‚Äôs the latter, Bitcoin Hyper is the one leading that charge. From Digital Gold to Digital Everything Bitcoin Hyper is the first project to utilize the SVM as an execution layer for Bitcoin. It enables lightning-fast throughput and developer-friendly infrastructure while anchoring to the security of Bitcoin‚Äôs fully decentralized architecture. Think of it like building a high-speed expressway on top of a fortified vault: the value stays protected, but it finally becomes usable at scale. For most of its history, Bitcoin has served primarily as digital cash ‚Äì a payment layer or store of value. But even in that role, it‚Äôs rarely practical. Why would anyone buy a coffee with BTC when the transaction fee could cost more than the drink, and confirmation might take 10 minutes or longer? Yes, there are solutions like the Lightning Network but adoption has remained limited. And yes the network is secure ‚Äì but for utility, vastly limited. That‚Äôs where Bitcoin Hyper changes everything. It keeps the unmatched security of the Bitcoin base layer while unlocking the programmability and speed needed for modern use cases. And it does so using Solana‚Äôs tech stack ‚Äì a blockchain that, since its debut in 2020, has rivaled Ethereum in the smart contract space by offering faster settlement and much lower fees. In fact, Solana‚Äôs throughput exceeds even traditional payment processors like Visa and Mastercard. Source: https://changelly.com/blog/what-is-solana/ By fusing that speed with Bitcoin‚Äôs trust layer, Bitcoin Hyper creates a foundation where BTC can finally support DeFi, NFTs, staking, payments, and more without compromising cost or security. How Bitcoin Enters Hyper Mode The way Bitcoin Hyper works is through a simple bridge that connects Bitcoin to its high-speed Layer-2. When a user wants to use their BTC within the Bitcoin Hyper network, the Bitcoin is sent to the bridge and locked securely on the base chain. Once confirmed, an equal amount of wrapped BTC is minted on the Layer-2 ‚Äì this is what users interact with. That wrapped BTC can now move quickly across apps, be used for trading, or take part in DeFi ‚Äì all with near-zero fees and instant confirmation. But it doesn‚Äôt leave Bitcoin behind. The original BTC stays locked and untouched, protected by the Bitcoin network. When users are ready to exit, they simply burn the wrapped version. The system then verifies everything and releases the original BTC back to their wallet. It‚Äôs Bitcoin, but faster, easier to use, and ready for a new generation of applications. Why HYPER Could Be the Breakout Star of Altcoin August The bridge brings BTC into the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem but it‚Äôs HYPER that makes the ecosystem run. Every transaction on this new Layer-2 is powered by HYPER, keeping costs near zero while enabling fast, seamless movement of value. It‚Äôs also what secures the network and drives participation. Holders can stake HYPER to earn rewards, vote on protocol upgrades, and shape the system‚Äôs evolution through decentralized governance. Developers who deploy apps early can earn HYPER through bounties and grants, while the protocol includes burn mechanics that can reduce supply as adoption grows. So while Bitcoin Hyper extends what BTC can do, HYPER is what makes it usable. It transforms Bitcoin from a passive store of value into the foundation of an active, scalable, and permissionless economy ‚Äì and that‚Äôs what makes HYPER a serious contender for August‚Äôs top altcoin. This is Your Headstart on HYPER Head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website to secure your tokens while this round is still live. You can buy using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.

2025-07-24T19:15:18,"Russia greenlights mutual funds to offer crypto investments","The Central Bank of Russia intends to allow the establishment of mutual funds that will offer Russian investors another avenue to crypto assets. A high-ranking official of the monetary authority has made it clear that the bank is going to discuss the matter with market participants in response to their requests. Russia‚Äôs central bank is ready to expand access to the crypto market The main financial regulator of the Russian Federation plans to consider permitting management companies to create mutual investment funds for qualified crypto investors, the Russian business news agency Prime reported, quoting one of its executives. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) will discuss this possibility with market players who have been demanding such an arrangement, said Olga Shishlyannikova, director of the bank‚Äôs Department of Investment Financial Intermediaries. During a conference organized by Russia‚Äôs National Association of Securities Market Participants ( NAUFOR ), Shishlyannikova remarked: ‚ÄúWe have heard exactly the same ideas from the brokerage community ‚Ä¶ and they have received this opportunity.‚Äù This year came with significant changes in the Bank of Russia‚Äôs conservative approach to cryptocurrencies. In March, the authority proposed to permit coin trading under an ‚Äúexperimental legal regime‚Äù (ELR). In May, it issued a circular authorizing financial firms to offer crypto derivatives to ‚Äú highly qualified ‚Äù investors, although it warned against direct investments in the risky assets. While reporting earlier this month that investments in Russian bitcoin futures reached $16 million in the first few weeks of trading, between June 4 and June 27, the CBR didn‚Äôt miss the opportunity to note that despite their increase, the volume has been ‚Äúminimal.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe see that investors have not reacted strongly yet, and this hype is greater among financial institutions than among the investors you are counting on,‚Äù Shishlyannikova now commented. ‚ÄúTherefore, of course, we will think in this direction, but it seems to us that this is still not the main problem when it comes to the lack of investment strategies in the collective investment market,‚Äù she added, speaking of the proposal to set up mutual funds for crypto investors. Bank of Russia still opposed to direct investments in crypto Despite a recent estimate revealing that Russians already hold more than $25 billion worth of crypto, their country‚Äôs central bank remains opposed to providing even qualified investors with direct access to the underlying assets of the legalized derivatives. ‚ÄúIn general, we have had a discussion and made a decision that these crypto-based instruments are acceptable for qualified investors,‚Äù noted Olga Shishlyannikova. She explained that the situation with asset management companies is a bit different, and a simple circular won‚Äôt be enough to change it. Amending existing regulations will be needed to allow them to create the mutual funds for crypto investments, the CBR executive clarified, speaking to media on the sidelines of the ‚ÄúCollective Investment Market 2025‚Äù conference. Shishlyannikova admitted, however, that this is more likely to happen in 2026, with the Bank of Russia‚Äôs next annual regulatory plan. The authority won‚Äôt be able to update the current one, which was approved and published at the beginning of the year. The CBR representative concluded: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we don‚Äôt have the opportunity to expand this plan. Therefore, we will return to this discussion with the market next year.‚Äù 2026 is bringing other changes to Russia‚Äôs crypto space as well. The central bank will start introducing its digital ruble from September, in parallel with a new universal QR code for payments. At the same time, fines will be imposed for using Bitcoin and the like to pay for goods and services outside the ELR framework, currently reserved primarily for cross-border settlements in foreign trade under Western sanctions.

2025-07-24T19:10:23,"AI Estate Processing: Lauren Kolodny‚Äôs Brilliant Bet on Revolutionizing Inheritances","BitcoinWorld AI Estate Processing: Lauren Kolodny‚Äôs Brilliant Bet on Revolutionizing Inheritances In the dynamic world of financial technology, where innovation constantly reshapes how we manage our money, the focus often shifts to groundbreaking platforms like neobanks or digital asset exchanges. Yet, some of the most profound transformations occur in the less glamorous, but equally critical, corners of personal finance. For those deeply invested in the efficiency and accessibility that digital solutions promise, particularly within the cryptocurrency space, the evolution of services like AI estate processing represents a significant leap forward. Enter Lauren Kolodny, a name synonymous with visionary Fintech investment . As a partner at Acrew Capital, Kolodny has consistently demonstrated an uncanny ability to spot disruptive potential where others see only risk. Her track record speaks volumes, most notably with her early and decisive backing of Chime. In 2016, when the fledgling neobank struggled to secure funding for its mission to serve the working class, Kolodny was the singular venture capitalist among a hundred pitches who saw the immense opportunity. Her firm stepped in with a crucial $9 million Series A extension, a move that proved not just prescient but transformative. Just last month, Chime made headlines with a staggering $14.5 billion valuation, solidifying Kolodny‚Äôs reputation as a top-tier investor, earning her a spot on the Forbes Midas list for three consecutive years. The Visionary: Lauren Kolodny‚Äôs Trailblazing Fintech Investment Lauren Kolodny‚Äôs investment philosophy has always centered on leveraging technology to democratize access to essential financial services. Her early support for Chime wasn‚Äôt merely a financial transaction; it was an affirmation of a belief that technology could empower everyday individuals by simplifying complex financial processes and making them more accessible. This commitment to consumer empowerment is now guiding her latest significant move: leading a $20 million Series A investment in Alix, a startup poised to revolutionize estate settlement through artificial intelligence. Kolodny‚Äôs consistent focus on problems that affect the majority, rather than just the affluent, highlights her unique perspective. She understands that financial services, at their core, should reduce friction and provide clarity, especially during life‚Äôs most challenging moments. Her investment in Alix is a testament to this enduring principle, aiming to bring efficiency and ease to a process historically fraught with stress and complexity. From Frustration to Innovation: The Birth of Alix AI The genesis of Alix AI stems from a deeply personal and frustrating experience. Alexandra Mysoor, Alix‚Äôs founder, witnessed firsthand the immense burden of estate settlement when she volunteered to help her best friend navigate her late mother‚Äôs affairs. What seemed like a straightforward task quickly spiraled into an arduous, time-consuming ordeal. Mysoor recounted to Bitcoin World that it took her a staggering 900 hours over 18 months to complete tasks that included: Calling banks to transfer assets Locating all retirement accounts (e.g., 401Ks) Cancelling various accounts and subscriptions Distributing assets among family members according to the will ‚ÄúI was shocked that this process was so hard,‚Äù Mysoor stated. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs paper-driven. It‚Äôs archaic. You‚Äôre googling to-do lists that are not helpful. You‚Äôre calling attorneys who might do a sliver of the work, and they cost thousands and thousands of dollars.‚Äù This profound realization sparked the idea for Alix. Mysoor recognized that many of the most labor-intensive aspects of trust administration ‚Äì such as scanning and extracting data from documents, pre-populating complex forms, and managing communications with financial institutions ‚Äì could be efficiently handled by AI agents. How AI Estate Processing is Changing the Game The traditional estate settlement process is notoriously inefficient. It involves mountains of paperwork, endless phone calls, and often, significant legal fees. For individuals already grieving, this administrative burden can be overwhelming. AI estate processing , as envisioned by Alix, offers a powerful antidote to this archaic system. Alix‚Äôs platform leverages advanced AI capabilities to: Automate Data Extraction: AI can rapidly scan and extract relevant information from various legal and financial documents, saving countless hours of manual data entry. Pre-populate Forms: Complex legal and financial forms can be automatically filled out using extracted data, significantly reducing errors and time spent. Streamline Communication: AI agents can manage and automate routine communications with banks, brokerage firms, and other institutions, ensuring timely information exchange. Provide Comprehensive Workflow Management: The platform guides users through the entire settlement process, ensuring no critical step is missed, from initial probate to final asset distribution. When Kolodny encountered Mysoor and learned about the problem Alix was addressing, the issue resonated deeply. Kolodny recognized that despite economists predicting trillions of dollars would transfer to millennial and Gen Z generations over the next two decades, the administrative burden of estate settlement largely remained a heavy weight on those already dealing with loss. While some startups, like Empathy, offer assistance with closing accounts as part of bereavement support, Kolodny found no company providing comprehensive, start-to-finish estate settlement services. ‚ÄúHow is it possible that there‚Äôs this messy problem that involves so much project management that there aren‚Äôt even meaningful services around?‚Äù Kolodny mused to Bitcoin World. ‚ÄúIt was this real aha moment for me. This is exactly the kind of problem that AI should be solving.‚Äù Democratizing Access: A New Era for Financial Services Kolodny believes Alix is just the beginning of a wave of startups powered by AI that will democratize financial services and administrative processes. Historically, services like comprehensive estate planning and settlement were often perceived as luxuries, primarily accessible to the ultra-wealthy who could afford expensive legal and financial advisors. Alix aims to change this paradigm, making sophisticated tools available to a much broader audience. This democratization aligns perfectly with the broader trends seen in fintech, where digital platforms are making investing, banking, and even complex financial planning more accessible. By automating the most labor-intensive and error-prone aspects of estate settlement, Alix significantly reduces the cost and time commitment, making professional-grade assistance available to middle-class families who might otherwise struggle through the process alone or incur prohibitive legal fees. Alix‚Äôs fee structure reflects this commitment to accessibility. While it charges 1% of an estate‚Äôs value, for inheritances under $1 million, customers can expect to pay between $9,000 and $12,000. The exact cost is determined by the complexity of the estate, providing a transparent and predictable fee model compared to hourly legal rates that can quickly escalate. The Chime Backer‚Äôs Next Big Impact Lauren Kolodny‚Äôs journey from backing Chime to investing in Alix showcases a consistent dedication to leveraging technology for societal benefit. Her ability to identify critical, underserved needs within the financial landscape, and then back the innovative solutions addressing them, marks her as a true leader in venture capital. The success of Chime validated her initial conviction, and now, with Alix, she is poised to make another profound impact on millions of lives by simplifying one of life‚Äôs most challenging administrative tasks. The vision extends beyond just estate settlement. The principles behind Alix ‚Äî using AI to automate and streamline complex, document-heavy, and emotionally taxing processes ‚Äî could be applied to numerous other areas of personal and business administration. As the digital transformation continues, companies like Alix, backed by insightful investors like Kolodny, are paving the way for a future where administrative burdens are minimized, and essential services are within reach for everyone.

2025-07-24T19:10:06,"Societe Generale To Provide Liquidity For 21Shares Crypto ETFs","Banking conglomerate Societe Generale has strategically partnered with cryptocurrency asset manager 21Shares to provide liquidity for its crypto-based Exchange-traded Products (ETPs) in European markets. Ultimately, this is a step towards expanding institutional access to this type of liquidity in Europe. Societe Generale‚Äôs Partnership Brings Expansion to 21Shares‚Äô ETPs 21Shares recently announced the news, noting that this is an opportunity to enhance liquidity across its ETPs on fund platforms for investors in both Germany and Eastern Europe. As its partner, Societe Generale, which has a stellar reputation with ETPs, will provide support for the trading of 21Shares‚Äô Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, including ABTC, CBTC, AETH, and CETH. In other words, the European banking giant will be the market maker and liquidity provider in this partnership. Precisely, its core responsibility would be to provide over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity on key fund platforms in the regions mentioned above. Initially, these platforms are operated by major financial institutions, serving as critical infrastructure, especially for institutional trading. This is a strategic approach that expands 21Shares‚Äô flagship crypto products to a broader base of professional investors. Alistair Byas-Perry, the global head of capital markets and EMEA investment at 21Shares, acknowledged the company‚Äôs thrill at having Societe Generale on board for this initiative. Societe Generale also does not overlook the importance of the partnership to its ecosystem. Martina Schroettle, Head of ETF Sales Trading (UK) at Societe Generale, described it as a significant milestone in the company‚Äôs commitment to providing innovative liquidity solutions. Societe Generale and its Other Blockchain-based Deals Aside from this deal, Societe Generale has been scouting for blockchain-based partnerships and investments to engage with. Last September, the banking giant partnered with Bitpanda. The primary aim was to fast-track the mainstream adoption of Societe Generale‚Äôs euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV). Similarly, the French bank announced the launch of USD CoinVertible (USDCV) , a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. This new stablecoin will be available on both the Solana and Ethereum networks. Notably, this move positions Societe Generale as the first major European bank to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin on public blockchains. As reported by TheCoinRise, USDCV will be issued through SG-Forge, Societe Generale‚Äôs digital asset division, which specializes in blockchain-based financial solutions. With the products already in place, creating a dollar equivalent is the next logical move for the bank. Crypto ETPs See Significant Inflows Recall that crypto investment products recently saw record-breaking inflows two weeks ago, marking the 14th consecutive week of gains. According to reports, global crypto ETPs recorded $4.4 billion in inflows that week. The inflows came as Bitcoin surged past $122,000 for the first time on July 14. With the latest gains , year-to-date inflows in crypto ETPs reached a new high of $27 billion, while total assets under management in crypto ETPs crossed $220 billion for the first time.

This 2.98% point drop marks one of the largest weekly declines this year. #Bitcoin dominance fell from 63.76% to 60.78% over the past week ‚Äì a 2.98 percentage point drop. One of the sharpest weekly declines this year, as capital rotated into altcoins. pic.twitter.com/aPpZtZsTQ9 ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 22, 2025 Institutional Investors Show Interest in Altcoins At the time of writing, BTC dominance has gone up by about 0.5%, demonstrating a slight comeback after nearly hitting 60%. While this may be the case, some market analysts believe that recent data demonstrates institutional interest in altcoins . Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, told Cryptonews that while spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are seeing some outflows after an epic run , the industry is witnessing rising institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). Greenspan explained that one of the most important metrics to watch to identify the onset of ‚Äúaltcoin season‚Äù is the Bitcoin dominance chart. This measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market value relative to the rest of the crypto space. ‚ÄúJust a month ago, Bitcoin dominance stood near 66%. As of Monday this week, it had dropped to nearly 60%, with most of that move happening over the past week,‚Äù Greenspan said. ‚ÄúThe message is clear: after a prolonged period of consolidation into Bitcoin, altcoins are back in style.‚Äù Danny Nelson, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, further told Cryptonews that Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally and Ethereum‚Äôs recovery have renewed investor interest in some sectors of the altcoin market. ‚ÄúAt Bitwise, we‚Äôre certainly fielding more questions on Cardano (ADA), Ripple, Polkadot (DOT), Solana, and other altcoins,‚Äù Nelson said. According to Greenspan, this is a sign that ‚Äúmature capital is diversifying into broader blockchain infrastructure plays.‚Äù Altcoins Dominating the Crypto Market This appears to be the case, as altcoins like Ethereum are being bolstered by institutional inflows and successful spot ETH ETFs . Over the past several weeks, these ETFs have recorded positive flows totaling more than 100,000 ETH. A new research report from the Binance crypto exchange also shows that BNB hit a historic all-time high this week. The report notes, ‚ÄúBNB has shattered its previous all-time high of $794, decisively breaking the key psychological barrier of $800 to establish a new peak.‚Äù The report points out that this has pushed the token‚Äôs total market capitalization to $112 billion. According to Binance Research, a new wave of ‚ÄúBNB Treasury‚Äù strategies appears to be emerging among publicly traded companies. Corporations are apparently beginning to hold BNB as a reserve asset to enhance treasury returns, improve liquidity, and gain strategic exposure to the crypto ecosystem. According to Binance founder CZ, at least 30 teams are actively exploring this strategy. Source: Binance Research In addition, Cardano is becoming a leading platform in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi on Cardano surged from $1.2 billion to $2.5 billion this year. This week, Cardano‚Äôs ADA surged 1.31% as 2025 ETF approval odds rose to 90%, attracting institutional capital. Altcoin Interest Meets With Challenges Yet while institutional interest in altcoins is evident, Nelson remains somewhat skeptical. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doubtful institutions are anchoring an upswing for altcoins,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDespite the great strides crypto‚Äôs taken in 2025, we haven‚Äôt yet reached a critical mass of understanding.‚Äù Altcoins are showing broad strength following #Bitcoin ‚Äôs lead, but surging open interest across the sector suggests speculative froth may be building, raising the risk of sharper volatility ahead.

He believes this won‚Äôt happen until the launch of additional altcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). Jake Claver, CEO and Founder of asset management firm Digital Ascension Group, told Cryptonews that he thinks a large rotation for Bitcoin ETFs will eventually flow into XRP ETFs once approved. This may take longer than expected, though. For instance, while an XRP ETF approval was expected this week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) abruptly reversed the approval for Bitwise Asset Management‚Äôs crypto ETF. Two theories from @JSeyff on why SEC holding up Grayscale & Bitwise crypto index ETFs‚Ä¶ I lean towards the latter theory. Both of these were approved by SEC Division of Trading & Markets and then immediately stayed. Doesn't make sense. via @isabelletanlee @nicola_m_white pic.twitter.com/UdmGG6TF9H ‚Äî Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 23, 2025 On July 23, the SEC‚Äôs Division of Trading and Markets initially greenlit the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund‚Äôs transition to an ETF, which would have marked the first US multi-asset spot crypto ETF. However, the decision was suspended by Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood, citing the need for a full commission review under Rule 431. What‚Äôs Next For Altcoins? While it appears that a new altcoin season is underway, Greenspan commented that, as of writing, the crypto industry is seeing a noticeable pullback in many altcoins. ‚ÄúThis is likely due to a correction after the massive run-up of the last week. Bitcoin has remained fairly stable in contrast, consolidating near its all-time highs,‚Äù he said. Alex Tapscott, managing director of Ninepoint Digital Asset Group, added that if Bitcoin dominance continues to decline, a true altcoin season will likely emerge. He also added that this may slightly mute Bitcoin ETF inflows as capital rotates into other assets. ‚ÄúGiven crypto‚Äôs inherent reflexivity, flows into cryptoassets, whether from ETFs or public companies, are a net positive for the ecosystem,‚Äù Tapscott commented. ‚ÄúAccess for investors to gain exposure to crypto has never been more democratized than it is today.‚Äù The post Altcoins Gain Traction With Institutional Investors, But Challenges Remain appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoins-gain-traction-with-institutional-investors-but-challenges-remain/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|BNB|BUSINESS","Altcoin News|News|Altcoin|Institutional Investors|United States",cryptocompare
2025-07-24T19:00:56,"Analyst Says Next 3 Weeks In XRP Could Change Your Life. Here‚Äôs why","Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has stirred excitement with a bold claim: ‚ÄúThe next 3 weeks in XRP could change your life. Don‚Äôt give up now!‚Äù His statement comes alongside a compelling chart showing the Altcoin Season Index moving sharply toward the ‚ÄúAltcoin Season‚Äù threshold, an indicator that historically precedes powerful rallies in non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies like XRP. Altcoin Season Nears as XRP Gains Momentum The Altcoin Season Index, developed by BlockchainCenter, measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Values below 25 indicate ‚ÄúBitcoin Season,‚Äù while readings above 75 mark the start of ‚Äú Altcoin Season .‚Äù According to the chart STEPH shared, the index is climbing fast, suggesting that market dominance may be rotating away from Bitcoin and toward altcoins like XRP. This shift is significant. During past altcoin seasons, XRP has seen exponential growth, and current technical signals hint that history could be repeating. The next 3 weeks in #XRP could really change your life. Don‚Äôt give up now! pic.twitter.com/RLBaPxzTfH ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 24, 2025 XRP Price Action and Technical Strength As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.25, slightly down on the day but holding firm near its recent high of $3.66, set earlier this month. Despite the minor pullback, the asset remains up over 90% in the past 30 days, signaling strong upward momentum. This surge began around the $1.90 mark and has followed a clear breakout pattern. Analysts credit the rally to multiple factors, including a completed triple-tap formation, Elliott Wave alignment, and a decisive flip of resistance into support. The current pullback is being viewed not as weakness but as a healthy consolidation before a potential next leg up. Adding to the narrative, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past week. This divergence supports the Altcoin Season thesis and suggests capital is actively rotating into altcoins. Why the Next Three Weeks Matter Steph‚Äôs emphasis on the next three weeks is rooted in timing. As the Altcoin Season Index pushes toward 75, it historically triggers explosive moves in major altcoins. XRP, already in motion, could accelerate significantly if the index confirms full altseason status. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coupled with declining Bitcoin dominance, now hovering near key levels around 60%, this sets the stage for altcoins to take center stage. XRP is positioned as a frontrunner in this rotation, with many investors eyeing the potential for new all-time highs in the near term. Be Cautious, But Stay Alert While the setup is promising, traders should remain cautious. Recent volatility has led to more than $30 million in XRP liquidations , a reminder that crypto rallies are rarely linear. Moreover, macro factors such as ETF approval delays or broader risk-off sentiment in the market could stall momentum temporarily. Still, the prevailing structure remains bullish. XRP is consolidating above support, the Altcoin Season Index is rising, and investor sentiment is turning optimistic. All eyes are now on the coming weeks. Steph‚Äôs message captures the mood of a market on the verge of something bigger. XRP has the technical structure, market positioning, and timing in its favor. If current conditions hold and altcoin season kicks into full gear, these next three weeks may indeed prove life-changing for XRP holders.

2025-07-24T19:00:25,"Industrial AI Breakthrough: CVector‚Äôs Unwavering Trust Revolutionizes Operations","BitcoinWorld Industrial AI Breakthrough: CVector‚Äôs Unwavering Trust Revolutionizes Operations In the fast-paced world of technology, where rapid innovation often meets swift acquisitions, a core concern for customers is stability. This is particularly true in critical sectors like industrial operations, where long-term partnerships are paramount. For those familiar with the volatility of crypto markets, the concept of trust and longevity resonates deeply. It‚Äôs about more than just a product; it‚Äôs about the assurance that your chosen partner will be there for the long haul. This is precisely the challenge and opportunity that Industrial AI startup CVector is addressing, setting a new standard for customer confidence. How Industrial AI Startups Build Trust? When an Industrial AI startup like CVector engages with major manufacturers, utility providers, and other potential customers, a recurring question often arises: ‚ÄúWill you still be here in six months? A year?‚Äù This concern is valid in an environment where the largest tech companies frequently acquire promising AI startups , often through ‚Äúacquihire‚Äù deals designed to absorb talent rather than sustain the original product vision. The founders of CVector, Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles, have a consistent and reassuring answer: they are committed to their independence. This steadfast promise is a cornerstone of their strategy, distinguishing them in a competitive landscape. Their customers, which include national gas utilities and a chemical manufacturer in California, rely on CVector‚Äôs software to manage and enhance their industrial operations. Zhang noted to Bitcoin World that this question about longevity comes up in almost every initial call with major players in critical infrastructure, highlighting the profound need for real assurances in this sector. CVector‚Äôs Edge: Expertise in Critical Infrastructure CVector‚Äôs commitment to its customers is deeply rooted in the unique backgrounds of its founders. Richard Zhang‚Äôs early career as a software engineer for oil giant Shell provided him with invaluable on-the-ground experience, developing applications for field workers who were new to digital tools. Tyler Ruggles, holding a PhD in experimental particle physics, spent time at the Large Hadron Collider, where he was responsible for maintaining very high uptime and rapidly troubleshooting issues with nanosecond data. These experiences instilled in them a profound understanding of the demands of critical infrastructure and the importance of reliability and rapid problem-solving. As Ruggles explains, such backgrounds build confidence and trust with clients. This practical, hands-on experience allows CVector to speak the language of industrial operators, understanding their pain points and delivering solutions that truly make a difference in complex, high-stakes environments. Revolutionizing Manufacturing AI with Innovation Beyond the founders‚Äô impressive resumes, CVector has demonstrated remarkable ingenuity since its inception in late 2024. The company has developed an industrial AI software architecture, which they describe as a ‚Äúbrain and nervous system for industrial assets.‚Äù This sophisticated system leverages a diverse range of technologies, from fintech solutions to real-time energy pricing data and even open-source software from the McLaren F1 racing team. This innovative blend allows them to create highly responsive and adaptive AI agents. Zhang provided an illustrative example concerning weather data. While macro-level weather conditions can affect high-precision manufacturing equipment, there are also subtle, knock-on effects. For instance, if salt from snowy roads is tracked into a factory by workers‚Äô boots, it can subtly impact sensitive equipment ‚Äì a factor operators might not have previously identified. Ruggles emphasized the value of integrating such signals into operations and planning, stating, ‚ÄúAll of this is to help run these facilities more successfully, more profitably.‚Äù This granular approach to data integration and analysis is what truly elevates Manufacturing AI capabilities, providing unprecedented visibility and control. Why AI Startups Need Long-Term Vision The strategic importance of long-term vision for AI startups is underscored by CVector‚Äôs recent $1.5 million pre-seed round, led by Schematic Ventures. Richard Zhang specifically sought investors with a reputation for tackling complex problems in supply chain, manufacturing, and software infrastructure, aligning perfectly with Schematic‚Äôs focus as an early-stage fund. Julian Counihan, the Schematic partner involved in the investment, highlighted that while practical solutions like putting code in escrow or offering perpetual software licenses can help allay customer fears about acquisitions, true assurance often ‚Äúcomes down to founders being mission-aligned with the company and clearly communicating that long-term commitment to customers.‚Äù This mission alignment is not just a talking point for CVector ; it‚Äôs a core operational principle. By attracting investors who share their vision for sustained growth and by recruiting team members who are equally dedicated to building a career in physical infrastructure, CVector reinforces its promise of stability, making it easier to convince customers that they are indeed here to stay. CVector‚Äôs Impact: Scaling Industrial AI Solutions CVector has already successfully deployed its Industrial AI agents across various sectors, including chemicals, automotive, and energy. Their ambition extends to what Zhang refers to as ‚Äúlarge scale critical infrastructure .‚Äù A common challenge for energy providers, for example, is their reliance on grid dispatch systems written in outdated coding languages like Cobra and FORTRAN, which hinder real-time management. CVector addresses this by developing algorithms that can seamlessly integrate with these legacy systems, providing operators with enhanced visibility and low-latency insights. Currently, CVector operates with a lean, eight-person team distributed across Providence, Rhode Island, New York City, and Frankfurt, Germany. However, with the completion of their pre-seed round, they anticipate significant growth. Zhang emphasized their commitment to recruiting only ‚Äúmission-aligned people‚Äù who genuinely want to build a career in physical infrastructure. This careful approach to team expansion further strengthens their long-term viability and their ability to continue delivering robust solutions to their customers. Tyler Ruggles, reflecting on his transition from theoretical physics to industrial applications, expressed his satisfaction in seeing tangible impact: ‚ÄúI love the fact that instead of trying to write a paper‚Ä¶ that I‚Äôm working with a client on something that‚Äôs in the ground and that we could be helping them keep it up and running.‚Äù This rapid deployment of features and new solutions for customers is a testament to CVector‚Äôs agile and impactful approach. CVector‚Äôs strategy of prioritizing long-term customer relationships through a steadfast commitment to independence offers a compelling model for AI startups in any sector. By combining deep industrial expertise with innovative technological solutions and a strong, mission-aligned team, they are not just selling software; they are building enduring trust. This approach ensures that their industrial AI agents continue to help critical infrastructure run more successfully and profitably, demonstrating that stability and innovation can indeed go hand-in-hand.

2025-07-24T19:00:25,"Tether Investments Extend Beyond Bitcoin Amid Record Profits ‚Äî Details","Tether, the issuer of the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed a portion of its investment portfolio, revealing an involvement in cryptocurrencies that extend beyond Bitcoin (BTC). The announcement comes as Tether reports record profits in 2024, which have been used to fund these strategic investments in more than 120 companies across multiple sectors. Tether Expands Investment Portfolio Beyond Bitcoin Tether has unveiled a glimpse into its expansive investment portfolio, marking a significant pivot in its capital allocation strategy beyond just Bitcoin. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, confirmed in an X social media post that the stablecoin firm has invested in over 120 companies as part of its Tether Investment division. He added that this number is expected to grow in the coming months and years. Related Reading: Today In Crypto: 3 Major Bills Passed In The US House, Here‚Äôs What You Should Know Notably, Ardoino disclosed that these investments are funded exclusively through the company‚Äôs record profits from 2024, which total $13.7 billion. He emphasized that none of the funds were obtained from reserves backing Tether‚Äôs stablecoin. Interestingly, Tether‚Äôs profits, generated from yield on its holdings of over $130 billion in US Treasuries, are now being directed into transformative industries through some of the most prominent companies. Its venture arm has expanded its focus past Bitcoin, now investing in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, privacy infrastructure, tokenization, agriculture, and others. When asked by Crypto Tale how this diverse portfolio supports USDT‚Äôs position amid an increasingly stringent global regulatory environment, Ardoino underscored its strategic importance. On the question of USDT‚Äôs future in Europe under the continent‚Äôs new MiCA regulations, the Tether CEO stated that the stablecoin company would only consider re-entry once the regulatory landscape offers stronger protections for both consumers and stablecoin issuers. Companies In Tether‚Äôs Venture Portfolio On its official website, Tether shared a partial list of some of the companies among the 120 it has invested in. These range from blockchain infrastructure platforms like Synonym and Holepunch, to AI-focused firms like Crystal Intelligence, and payment technology providers such as CityPay.io and Sorted Wallet. The presence of companies like Blackrock Neurotech and Adecoagro reflects a commitment to broader technological and environmental impact, reaching into neuroscience and agriculture, respectively. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Reveals The Only Thing ‚ÄòBetter Than Bitcoin‚Äô As MSTR Stock Outperforms Tether‚Äôs investment narrative is framed not solely in financial terms but as a deliberate push toward catalyzing decentralization and empowering individuals. The stablecoin firm declared its capital as a ‚Äúcatalyst for change,‚Äù invested in projects that reduce reliance on centralized systems and promote global equity. This mission-driven approach is visible across its portfolio, which also includes companies involved in data sovereignty like Northern Data, cross-border financial solutions such as Quantoz and OrionX, and privacy-first communication platforms. Mansa, a DeFi fintech venture, and Oobit, a global crypto payment platform, have also joined Tether‚Äôs investment portfolio, marking another step toward the company‚Äôs push toward real-world crypto adoption.
