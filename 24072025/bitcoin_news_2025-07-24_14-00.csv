2025-07-24T11:55:23,"Unveiling the Mystery: A Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer Shakes the Market","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Mystery: A Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer Shakes the Market In the often-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, certain events stand out, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. One such seismic event recently occurred: a colossal Bitcoin whale transfer . Imagine nearly half a billion dollars in Bitcoin, previously dormant for years, suddenly stirring and moving to a new digital address. This isn’t just a transaction; it’s a profound signal that sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. What does such a massive Bitcoin whale transfer signify, and why should you care? The Awakening: What Exactly Happened in This Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The crypto community was abuzz when news broke of a long-inactive Bitcoin (BTC) whale making an extraordinary move. According to Onchain Lens on X , an entity holding a staggering 3,962.62 BTC, valued at approximately $468.67 million at the time of the transfer, shifted its entire holdings to a brand-new wallet. This monumental Bitcoin whale transfer wasn’t impulsive; it was preceded by a small, almost imperceptible test transaction, a common practice among large holders to ensure the main transfer goes smoothly. To put this into perspective, a “whale” in crypto terms refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. A “dormant” whale is one whose holdings have remained untouched for an extended period, often years. The sudden activation of such a large, previously inactive wallet is rare and always triggers intense speculation. This specific Bitcoin whale transfer represents one of the largest movements from a long-term dormant address in recent memory. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale Transfer of This Magnitude Matter? The movement of hundreds of millions of dollars by a single entity is never a trivial matter, especially in a relatively nascent market like cryptocurrency. A significant Bitcoin whale transfer can have multiple implications, affecting everything from market sentiment to liquidity. Here’s why this event is so closely watched: Market Psychology: The crypto market is heavily influenced by sentiment. A large transfer from a dormant whale can be interpreted in various ways – as a precursor to selling, a repositioning for long-term holding, or even a security measure. These interpretations can sway market participants’ decisions, leading to either fear or optimism. Liquidity Dynamics: While the transfer itself doesn’t directly impact price, the possibility of these funds entering exchanges for sale could significantly increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop. Conversely, if the funds are moved to a cold storage wallet, it might signal an intent to hold, reducing immediate supply. On-Chain Transparency: Unlike traditional finance, blockchain technology offers unparalleled transparency. Every Bitcoin whale transfer is recorded on the public ledger, allowing analysts to track movements and infer potential intentions, even if the identity of the whale remains anonymous. This transparency provides valuable insights into the behavior of large market players. Unpacking the Mystery: Who Could Be Behind This Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The identity of this specific whale remains shrouded in mystery, as is often the case with large crypto holdings. However, speculation runs rampant, with several theories emerging about who might be behind such a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer : Early Adopter or “Satoshi Era” Holder: Many believe these long-dormant wallets belong to early Bitcoin miners or investors who acquired BTC when it was worth mere pennies. The activation could mean they are finally moving their assets for various reasons, perhaps to secure them better or prepare for a future event. While unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto themselves (whose known wallets remain untouched), it could be someone from that formative period. Institutional Investor or Fund: As institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows, it’s plausible that a large fund or corporation that acquired BTC years ago is simply reorganizing its assets or transferring them to a new custodian for improved security or operational efficiency. Exchange or Custodian: Sometimes, these transfers are internal movements by exchanges or custodial services managing large amounts of client funds. They might be consolidating wallets, upgrading security protocols, or preparing for large withdrawals/deposits. “Lost and Found” Wallets: In rare cases, individuals who lost access to their early Bitcoin holdings due to forgotten passwords, corrupted drives, or misplaced hardware wallets manage to regain access. This could represent a monumental personal discovery for the whale in question. Without direct confirmation, these remain educated guesses. The beauty and challenge of blockchain lie in its pseudonymity, where actions are public but identities are private. Navigating the Waves: What Are the Potential Implications for Bitcoin? The implications of this significant Bitcoin whale transfer are multi-faceted and depend heavily on the whale’s ultimate intentions. Here’s a look at potential scenarios: Bullish vs. Bearish Interpretations Bearish Outlook: The most immediate fear is that the whale is preparing to sell their holdings, which could flood the market with supply and drive down Bitcoin’s price. Such a massive sell-off could trigger panic among smaller investors. Bullish Outlook: Conversely, the transfer could be a move to a more secure cold storage solution, indicating a long-term holding strategy (HODLing). It could also be a repositioning for participation in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols, staking, or other yield-generating activities, which would reduce circulating supply and be bullish for Bitcoin. Neutral Rebalancing: The whale might simply be rebalancing their portfolio, moving funds between different types of wallets or preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal that wouldn’t impact exchange prices directly. Impact on Market Sentiment Regardless of the actual intent, the sheer size of this Bitcoin whale transfer inevitably creates a buzz. It reminds the market of the significant concentration of wealth in Bitcoin and the potential for large movements to dictate short-term price action. Experienced investors often view such events as opportunities to observe market reactions and adjust their strategies, rather than reacting impulsively. Insights from On-Chain Analysis: Decoding Whale Activity This event highlights the crucial role of on-chain analysis in the cryptocurrency space. Tools and platforms like Onchain Lens, Arkham Intelligence, Whale Alert, and Glassnode track every transaction on the blockchain, providing invaluable data. By monitoring large movements, analysts can: Identify Trends: Spot patterns in whale behavior that might precede significant market shifts. Assess Risk: Understand potential selling pressure or accumulation trends. Enhance Transparency: Despite pseudonymity, on-chain data offers a level of transparency far exceeding traditional financial markets, allowing for a more informed understanding of market dynamics. The ability to track such a massive Bitcoin whale transfer in real-time underscores the unique nature of blockchain technology and its power to provide insights into market movements that would be impossible in conventional finance. Protecting Your Portfolio: Actionable Steps for Crypto Investors While a massive Bitcoin whale transfer can be exciting and a bit unnerving, it’s important for individual investors to react strategically rather than emotionally. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, Not Alarmed: Follow reputable on-chain analytics platforms and news sources, but avoid succumbing to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Understand that one large transaction doesn’t define the entire market trend. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t just rely on headlines. Dig deeper into the data if possible, or consult with trusted financial advisors. Understand the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin beyond short-term price fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a cornerstone, a well-diversified crypto portfolio can mitigate risks associated with sudden large movements in a single asset. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders if you’re trading, and stick to a long-term investment strategy if that aligns with your financial goals. Conclusion: The Enduring Mystery of the Bitcoin Whale Transfer The recent awakening of a dormant Bitcoin whale transfer , involving nearly half a billion dollars, serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often enigmatic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact intentions of this mysterious whale remain unknown, the event underscores the critical role of on-chain analysis in deciphering market signals and the profound impact that large holders can have. It reinforces the importance of a measured, informed approach to crypto investing, urging participants to look beyond sensational headlines and understand the underlying mechanics. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the movements of these digital giants will undoubtedly remain a focal point for those seeking to navigate its complex currents. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “Bitcoin whale”? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their buying or selling activity. The exact threshold varies, but it generally refers to addresses holding thousands of BTC. Q2: Why is a dormant Bitcoin whale transfer significant? A dormant Bitcoin whale transfer is significant because it indicates a long-inactive holder is moving their funds. This can signal various intentions, such as preparing to sell, securing assets in a new wallet, or reallocating funds, all of which can create speculation and impact market sentiment or liquidity. Q3: How can I track large Bitcoin whale transfers? You can track large Bitcoin whale transfers using on-chain analytics platforms and services like Onchain Lens, Whale Alert, Arkham Intelligence, and Glassnode. These platforms monitor blockchain transactions and often alert users to significant movements. Q4: Does a Bitcoin whale transfer always mean a price dump is coming? Not necessarily. While a transfer might precede a sale, it could also be for security purposes (moving to cold storage), rebalancing a portfolio, or preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal that doesn’t affect exchange prices. It’s crucial to observe subsequent actions and broader market trends. Q5: What should I do if a major Bitcoin whale transfer occurs? Instead of panicking, stay informed through reputable sources, do your own research, and stick to your investment strategy. Consider the broader market context and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on a single large transaction. Did you find this article insightful?

While the wallet’s owner remains unidentified, transactions of this size and vintage often spark speculation around early Bitcoin adopters and miners from the cryptocurrency’s first years. Similar movements have been observed throughout 2025, including a Satoshi -era wallet that moved $4.68 billion in Bitcoin after 14 years and another address that transferred $1 billion worth of BTC after remaining dormant since April 2011. Importantly, while the wallet has been activated, there is no indication yet that the Bitcoin has been moved to an exchange . Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $118,040, down 1.97% in the last 7 days. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $120,551 last week and has remained relatively close to these peak levels since then. BTC 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold According to crypto analyst Crypto Patel, over 1.48 million BTC changed hands in the last 30 days. Most selling happened below $105K, while new buyers are stepping in between $105K and $120K. A new support zone appears to be forming around $117K-$118K. If the market pulls back, this area could hold, suggesting continued strength in Bitcoin’s price structure. Bitcoin’s strong rally has led traders to secure profits, triggering a sudden crypto market decline as profit-taking accelerated across the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. In fact, in the last 24 hours, over 314,000 traders were liquidated, wiping out $968 million , mostly from long trades. Featured image via Shutterstock.

2025-07-24T11:51:00,"Here Are 6 Ways to Know It’s Time to Sell Your Crypto","Investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be extremely rewarding, but it’s also very risky. Knowing when to sell is just as critical as knowing when to buy. That’s because selling too early can mean missing out on potentially life-changing gains, while selling too late can lead to devastating losses. Timing the market is very challenging, but there are clear signs that can undoubtedly help you out. In this article, we take a look at six key signs that it might be time to sell your crypto (or at least some of it). You Need the Money This is the most practical reason to sell your cryptocurrency. If you need money for a major expense that cannot tolerate any delays, such as a medical bill, selling some (or all, if needed) of your cryptocurrency can be a smart move. Investments are not just about growing wealth. They are supposed to support your life and make it better. Crypto markets are highly volatile, and holding on during a prolonged downturn while needing funds on hand can put you in a tough situation. Remember, nothing is more important than your health – if selling helps you meet an urgent bill, it may be the right choice, regardless of what the charts are saying right now. You Have Hit Your Target Price One of the most basic but effective strategies is to simply set a target price before you buy. Now, this could be a specific dollar amount or a percentage gain. For example, you may want to sell once your investment doubles, or when BTC’s price hits $1 million. Sticking to your plan helps remove emotion from the decision. Many investors get greedy when the prices start to increase drastically and hold on for too long. This often leads to sharp corrections that simply wipe out your gains. Setting a target also helps you lock in profits and reduce exposure. Also, keep in mind that you don’t have to sell everything at once – selling part of your position when you reach your goal can be a very balanced approach. The Fundamentals Have Changed Every single cryptocurrency is tied to a set of assumptions. These can include various things – from the strength of the development team, user growth, regulatory clarity, overall merits, and many more. When those assumptions change – it’s time to reassess. For instance, if a project starts delaying its roadmap, fails to deliver promised upgrades, starts losing key developers or team members that were part of your original investment thesis – your reasoning might no longer apply. Another interesting scenario is competition – if a new project enters the space that offers a better version of the same product, your investment thesis might weaken. In cases like these, holding on based on past performance could be a mistake. It might be better to exit and look for better and stronger opportunities. Market Sentiment Turns EXTREMELY Bullish At a glance, this might sound quite counterintuitive, but extreme optimism can oftentimes be a warning sign. When everyone is talking about buying, and prices are increasing fast, this could signal a market top. During crypto bull runs, prices often move beyond what the project’s fundamentals support. Valuations tend to become incredibly inflated. In many cases, this is followed by very sharp corrections. You can track sentiment indicators such as Google Trends, social media chatter, fear-and-greed indexes, and others – all of it can help. If hype reaches levels that you think are unsustainable – it may be time to take some profits off the table. You Are Overexposed to One Asset Diversification is a basic risk management rule. If one of your crypto positions grows to become a very large part of your portfolio, your overall risk increases. For instance, if one of your altcoins that you bought early on has taken off and now makes up 60% of your holdings, a sudden drop in that coin could impact your whole portfolio. Rebalancing is a very common strategy. This means selling part of the overgrown position and reinvesting the proceeds into other assets or holding it in cash. It helps keep your portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. I understand that sometimes this may feel like giving up gains, but it’s a long-term strategy to reduce volatility and avoid major losses. You are No Longer Comfortable With the Risk The crypto market is not for everyone. It is quite common for people to enter during bull markets when euphoria is high and prices move fast. But when the volatility goes the other way, many realize that they can’t handle the stress. If price swings keep you up at night or cause emotional stress, you may be overexposed. Selling some or all of your holdings can help reduce anxiety, which may also translate into overall improvement of your financial well-being. Investing should be based on your risk tolerance, not just the potential rewards. There is nothing wrong with stepping back if the risk is no longer acceptable for you. It’s better to invest in line with what your comfort level is rather than to force yourself to stay in volatile markets. Conclusion: is it time to sell? Nobody can determine whether it’s time for you to sell your crypto – it’s something that only you can do. A lot of the factors are entirely subjective. For instance, $100,000 can be life-changing for some and just a drop in the ocean for others, making their risk tolerance profiles astronomically different. A good rule of thumb is to sell whenever you start thinking about your crypto holdings too much. If you find yourself checking your portfolio every other hour and are emotionally moved by a price swing, regardless of its direction, then perhaps it’s time to reduce your exposure. Also, we have a quite a extensive article on some of the must-read bitcoin & crypto trading tips that will help you in your journey altogether.

2025-07-24T11:45:16,"XRP Eyes Record High Despite Recent Price Dip","XRP remains positioned for a potential breakout despite a sharp pullback in the last 24 hours, according to market observers. The token saw a 10% decline, falling to $3.21, but analysts suggest its long-term trajectory could still push it beyond its previous all-time high if the broader crypto market momentum continues. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO at Bitpanda, noted that while predicting exact levels is challenging in fast-moving markets, XRP surpassing its 2018 peak would not be surprising if conditions remain favorable and capital continues to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins. Altcoin Season Provides Tailwinds for XRP XRP recently touched a year-to-date high of $3.66 but has yet to retest its all-time high of $3.84, set in January 2018. Analysts attribute the potential for further gains to the ongoing strength across the altcoin sector, driven by a shift in investor sentiment and capital flows. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which gauges the market’s appetite for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, transitioned from “Bitcoin Season” to “Altcoin Season” on Sunday. This shift aligns with a notable drop in Bitcoin’s dominance, which has decreased by over 5% in the past month as traders explore opportunities in alternative cryptocurrencies. Enzersdorfer-Konrad emphasized that the 3rd larget crypto’s movement is heavily tied to broader altcoin sentiment, suggesting that continued liquidity and confidence in the altcoin space will be crucial for sustaining the rally. “XRP tends to be highly sensitive to broader altcoin sentiment and regulatory narratives,” he said, adding that the next phase will depend on whether momentum expands across other altcoins or remains concentrated in select tokens. Analysts See Upside Potential Towards $10 Crypto analyst Dom recently projected that XRP could climb to a range between $7 and $10 if the current market dynamics continue to favor altcoins . However, the outlook for the crypto remains intertwined with the overall performance of the crypto market, with investors watching for signals of sustained altcoin strength. For now, XRP’s path higher will rely on the market’s ability to maintain momentum while navigating the volatility that has long characterized the digital asset sector, as the token eyes reclaim and surpass its historical peak in the coming months.

ADA Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Cardano price prediction for 2025 is generating significant buzz in the crypto market, particularly as we have entered Q3 2025 with July. The transformative Plomin Hard Fork, implemented in Q1, has played a crucial role in this momentum, especially with the announcement of full decentralized governance. This landmark upgrade has reinforced Cardano’s commitment to community-driven innovation, leading to a strengthening of its internal ecosystem. Even bigger institutions like Grayscale have been applauding the project’s vision and gave 1/5th allocation in its fund. Industry leaders like IOHK and EMURGO are also actively advancing the Cardano ecosystem. EMURGO’s partnership with Ctrl Wallet on July 2, 2025, has enhanced Cardano’s interoperability, enabling connections to over 2,300 blockchains. Moreover, community-driven initiatives focusing on scalability, privacy through the Midnight chain, and integration with Bitcoin DeFi are paving the way for substantial growth. Additionally, Bloomberg analysts have raised odds of potential spot ADA ETF approvals , and strong technical indicators signaling positive trends, investor enthusiasm is at an all-time high. Questions abound: “Will Cardano spearhead the altcoin movement?” and “What heights can ADA reach by 2050?” Explore this Cardano price prediction for 2025 and beyond, filled with expert insights and ambitious forecasts. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) is predicted to reach a potential high of $2.05 in 2025 , driven by hopes of ETF approval, full decentralization after the Plomin Hard Fork, and increasing institutional interest. However, if ADA fails to hold above key support, it may range between $0.85 and $1.25 . Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 Cardano AI Price Prediction For August 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.81413717 -5.56% Market Cap $ 28,827,370,091.2175 Trading Volume $ 2,452,180,490.8108 Circulating Supply 35,408,492,715.29 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 After months of stagnation in the first half of 2025, the Cardano price was able to finally break free from its downtrend. The turning point arrived in late June when geopolitical tensions between Iran, Israel, and the US eased, sparking a relief rally across risk-on assets. Seizing this opportunity, Cardano price rebounded impressively, climbing 80% from the $0.55 level over the past 30 days. Adding to the positive sentiment, Bitcoin also reached a new all-time high of $123,231, injecting momentum into the altcoin market. Cardano has successfully flipped the 200-day EMA into support, and a golden cross between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs has formed, signaling long-term bullish potential. However, as of the fourth week of July, the Cardano price faced a sell-off from retail holders, pushing its price below the critical $0.85 mark. While this level has been lost, the breakout remains intact from the falling wedge. Similarly, data from Santiment indicates that this decline is primarily due to retail offloading, while whales are quietly accumulating. This suggests that the short-term drop may be limited, serving as a necessary cooldown after the July rally. Interestingly, this sell-off has also confirmed the formation of a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern. If bulls can maintain their momentum and Cardano closes convincingly above $0.85, a near-term move toward $1.10 could be on the horizon. From there, reaching $1.32 by the end of July or august becomes a realistic target. Nonetheless, support levels are crucial. If ADA slips below $0.70, it could open the door to further declines toward $0.65 or even $0.55, the base that previously fueled its latest rally. As the market evolves, all eyes will be on these key levels to gauge Cardano’s next move.

Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. Another would be a global attraction in the sector with BTC continuing northward moves. Therefore, if ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

2025-07-24T11:38:56,"Crypto Breakout Watch: $3.25 Surge Could Ignite XRP’s Run to $5.50","XRP’s Wave 4 Plays Out According to renowned crypto market analyst Man of Bitcoin, a decisive breakout above $3.25 would mark the end of wave-4 in XRP’s current Elliott Wave cycle, signaling a bottom and paving the way for a powerful rally. The analyst noted , “Wave-(C) of 4 has completed a 5-wave move to the downside, the pattern is now technically complete.A break above $3.25 would be the first confirmation that wave-4 has bottomed. For now, the possibility of another low remains on the table.” The Elliott Wave Theory, often used by technical analysts to predict market cycles, suggests that XRP is currently completing wave-4, a corrective phase following its pullback to the psychological price of $3.00. At the time of this writing, XRP had gained some momentum to trade at $3.09, according to CoinGecko data . Crypto pundit XRPunkie shares similar sentiments that XRP is presently at the wave 4 correction phase. The techical analyst pointed out that XRP may have completed its wave 4 correction, though a dip to $2.64 remains possible before Wave 5 begins, which could see a bullish run to $5.50. XRPunkie added, “Pullbacks are part of the game. Enjoy the ride to higher prices soon.” Notably, wave-4 corrections typically precede explosive upward moves, and a confirmed breakout above $3.25 would invalidate bearish structures, signaling that wave-5 has begun. Conclusion XRP’s battle at $3.25 could be the turning point for a fresh wave of upside depending on whether wave 4 has bottomed at the present price of $3.09. If this is the case, the next major target might be $5.50, a level not seen in XRP’s history and a potential signal that a new bull phase is underway.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10137/crypto-breakout-watch-3-25-surge-could-ignite-xrp-s-run-to-5-50,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

The BNB price prediction anticipates a potential high of $1,292 in 2025. Binance price may reach a maximum of $2,749 by 2030. Binance Coin has been the talk of the town after its euphoric run to claim a new all-time high at $809.31. The buzz is also fueled by Forbes’ estimation of Changpeng Zhao holding 64% of BNB’s supply, which is 95M tokens worth about $76 billion. Amid the changing landscape, the Binance Coin fundamentals remain solid, with our new all-time high target at around the $1000 level. However, the underlying uncertainties amid the global tensions raise questions like, “Is Binance safe or not?” or “Will Binance go higher in 2025?” To answer these questions and provide a clear view of the BNB price action, we present our latest Binance Coin (BNB) Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

BNB Coin Price Prediction for August 2025 BNB’s strong uptrend remains intact, with the price testing current levels at $766.68 after briefly hitting $809.31. The RSI at 75.02 indicates overbought conditions, which justifies the current pullback. However, sustained momentum above current levels could propel BNB toward $820 and even $860 in August. Key support lies at $684. A short-term consolidation around $780–$800 is likely before the next leg up, provided macro conditions and sentiment stay bullish. Volatility remains elevated as bulls eye higher resistances. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High August $684 $765 $860 Binance Coin Price Prediction 2025 With a highly anticipated altcoin season toward late 2025, the Binance token is projected to achieve its milestone price of $1,000. Moreover, with the growing list of catalysts such as BNB ETF approval, upcoming Hong Kong License, and quarterly token burns, BNB token price could surge to fresh highs. Investors can anticipate the BNB coin price reaching a new All-Time High of $1,292. On the flip side, the Binance crypto may experience a low of $761 during that year.

2025-07-24T11:25:18,"Mysterious Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Awakens After 14.5 Years","BitcoinWorld Mysterious Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Awakens After 14.5 Years In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where market movements can be triggered by a whisper, the sudden activity of a dormant Bitcoin wallet can send ripples of intrigue and speculation across the globe. Imagine a digital treasure chest, locked away and untouched for over a decade, suddenly showing a sign of life. This isn’t a scene from a sci-fi movie; it’s the reality of a recent event that has captured the attention of the crypto community. What Just Happened with This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? The crypto analytics platform Lookonchain recently brought to light a fascinating development via X (formerly Twitter): a Bitcoin whale wallet, holding a staggering 3,962 BTC – an amount valued at approximately $468 million at the time of the report – has stirred from its 14.5-year slumber. The wallet, which had been inactive since its creation, made a minimal test transaction of 0.0018 BTC (worth around $218). This isn’t just any transaction; it’s a significant event for several reasons: Long-Term Dormancy: 14.5 years is an exceptionally long period for such a large sum of Bitcoin to remain untouched. This suggests the owner either lost access, was a very early adopter with extreme conviction, or simply forgot about it. Significant Holdings: With nearly 4,000 BTC, this wallet represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, making its movements potentially impactful. The ‘Test’ Transaction: The small amount sent is characteristic of a test transaction, typically performed to verify wallet access and functionality before a larger transfer. This indicates the owner has regained or confirmed control. The identity of the wallet owner remains shrouded in mystery, as is common with pseudonymous blockchain transactions. However, the sheer volume of BTC involved naturally leads to questions about the potential implications for the broader market. Why Does an Awakened Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Matter? The awakening of such a long-inactive, large-volume dormant Bitcoin wallet can spark a flurry of speculation and analysis within the crypto ecosystem. Here’s why it’s a big deal: 1. Potential Market Impact: Selling Pressure: The primary concern is that the whale might be preparing to sell their substantial holdings. A sudden influx of 3,962 BTC onto exchanges could create significant selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop, especially in a less liquid market. Market Confidence: Conversely, if the whale moves the funds to a secure, non-exchange wallet, or simply holds them, it could be interpreted as a sign of continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, potentially boosting sentiment. 2. Historical Precedents: Historically, movements from long-dormant wallets have often preceded significant market events. While not every awakening leads to a crash, they are closely watched. For instance, the movement of early Bitcoin blocks (mined in 2010 or earlier) often generates similar buzz due to the massive unrealized gains involved and the potential for large-scale selling. Notable Dormant Wallet Awakenings & Potential Outcomes Year of Awakening Amount (BTC) Dormancy Period Common Speculation Recent (2024) 3,962 14.5 years Market dump, security transfer, lost keys found 2020 50 11 years Early miner selling, testing old keys 2021 1,000+ 8+ years Institutional movement, long-term holder redistribution Who Are These Bitcoin Whales, Anyway? The term ‘Bitcoin whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. These are often early adopters, institutional investors, or large-scale traders whose actions can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. Their movements are tracked by blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain, Arkham Intelligence, and Glassnode, providing insights into potential market shifts. The awakening of a dormant Bitcoin wallet belonging to such a whale is particularly noteworthy because their decisions can create a ripple effect, influencing smaller investors and traders. Are they about to take profits? Are they moving funds for security reasons? Or are they simply re-organizing their portfolio? These questions drive the narrative around such events. What Could Trigger a Dormant Bitcoin Wallet to Awaken? There are several plausible reasons why a wallet that has been dormant for nearly 15 years might suddenly become active: Rediscovery of Lost Keys: One of the most common scenarios. An early adopter might have found an old hard drive, a forgotten paper wallet, or recovered mnemonic phrases. Inheritance or Estate Settlement: The original owner may have passed away, and their heirs or estate executors have finally gained access to the funds. This process can often take years. Strategic Market Timing: The owner might have been waiting for a specific market condition – perhaps a significant price milestone or a period of high volatility – to make a move. Security Consolidation: With advancements in wallet technology and security practices, the owner might be moving funds from an older, potentially less secure wallet to a newer, more robust solution (e.g., a hardware wallet). Tax Planning: Moving funds could be part of a larger financial strategy related to capital gains or tax implications in different jurisdictions. Without direct confirmation from the wallet owner, all explanations remain speculative. However, the small test transaction strongly suggests a verification of access rather than an immediate intention to liquidate. Actionable Insights: How Should You React to a Dormant Bitcoin Wallet’s Activity? For the average crypto investor, the awakening of a large dormant Bitcoin wallet can be a source of anxiety. Here’s how to approach such news with a level head: Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on a single whale movement. The crypto market is influenced by numerous factors, and one transaction, even a large one, doesn’t dictate the entire market’s direction. Monitor Follow-Up Transactions: Keep an eye on blockchain analytics reports. If the 3,962 BTC are moved to an exchange, it might indicate an intent to sell. If they are moved to a new, secure cold storage address, it suggests long-term holding. Focus on Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s long-term value is driven by its adoption, network security, halving cycles, and macroeconomic factors, not just individual whale movements. Diversify and Manage Risk: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you’re not over-exposed to any single asset. Implement stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Learn from Whales: While their actions shouldn’t dictate yours, observing whale behavior can provide insights into market sentiment and potential trends. Remember, the crypto market thrives on information, but also on speculation. Differentiating between the two is key to navigating its volatility. The Enduring Mystery of the Dormant Bitcoin Wallet The awakening of this 14.5-year dormant Bitcoin wallet serves as a potent reminder of the unique characteristics of the cryptocurrency world: its transparency (in terms of transactions) juxtaposed with its pseudonymity (in terms of identity). It highlights the incredible long-term holding power of early adopters and the potential for significant wealth to remain untouched for decades. Whether this whale will trigger a major market event or simply re-secure their vast holdings remains to be seen. What is clear is that every movement of such a historic wallet contributes another chapter to Bitcoin’s fascinating narrative, keeping the community on the edge of its seat, constantly analyzing, speculating, and learning from the silent giants of the blockchain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a dormant Bitcoin wallet? A1: A dormant Bitcoin wallet is a digital address that holds Bitcoin but has shown no outgoing transaction activity for an extended period, often years or even over a decade. It indicates that the owner has not moved or spent the funds during that time. Q2: How can a wallet remain dormant for so long and then awaken? A2: Wallets can remain dormant if the owner is an early adopter with a long-term holding strategy, lost access to their private keys and later recovered them, or if the wallet is part of an inheritance that took time to settle. The ‘awakening’ usually involves a test transaction to confirm access. Q3: Does a dormant Bitcoin wallet awakening always lead to a market crash? A3: Not necessarily. While large movements can create selling pressure, the market’s reaction depends on various factors, including the whale’s subsequent actions (selling vs. re-securing), overall market sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions. Often, the initial fear subsides if no major selling occurs. Q4: How do blockchain analytics firms identify these dormant wallets? A4: Firms like Lookonchain use sophisticated blockchain analysis tools and algorithms to track wallet activity, identify large holdings, monitor transaction patterns, and flag addresses that have been inactive for significant periods before becoming active again. Q5: What should I do if I have an old, dormant crypto wallet? A5: If you have an old wallet with forgotten crypto, carefully attempt to recover your private keys or seed phrase. Once access is confirmed (perhaps with a small test transaction), consider moving your assets to a modern, secure hardware wallet for long-term storage and protection. Q6: Is it possible to know the identity of the owner of this awakened wallet? A6: On a public blockchain like Bitcoin, wallet addresses are pseudonymous, meaning they are not directly linked to real-world identities. While advanced forensic analysis or external information might sometimes lead to identification, it’s generally very difficult to pinpoint the exact owner of a specific address without their voluntary disclosure.

Best known for winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls, Pippen recently took to X to share his 2026 price predictions for top cryptocurrencies. He even asked his 729,000 followers to vote on which ones they believe could actually happen. Pippen has long shown support for Bitcoin and has even claimed to have spoken with Satoshi Nakamoto in a dream. But this time, he’s going beyond Bitcoin, showing love for Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. The big question is, are these predictions based on anything solid, or are they just for fun? Pippen’s 2026 Crypto Price Predictions According to Pippen, by 2026: Bitcoin could soar to $233,000 Ethereum might hit $10,000 XRP could reach $10 Solana might jump to $1,000 He also referenced Elon Musk’s recent promise that by next year, Tesla’s Optimus robots would be delivering food at the company’s new diner while people wait for their cars to charge. Which one of these will happen in 2026: • Bitcoin will hit 233k • $ETH will hit $10k • $SOL will hit $1k • $XRP will hit $10 • Your UBER driver will tell you about the @game5ball • Optimus will deliver you food • Aliens will invade • 2pac returns — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 24, 2025 If that wasn’t futuristic enough, Pippen asked followers whether they believe Earth will be invaded by aliens in 2026. While some users were amused, others focused on the price targets. Many agreed XRP at $10 and Solana at $1,000 felt possible, but few seemed convinced that Bitcoin would climb all the way to $233,000. Will Pippen’s Crypto Predictions Come True? Between Pippen’s surprising predictions and Ripple’s mysterious transfers, crypto watchers have plenty to think about. Is XRP really on track to hit $10? Can Bitcoin break the $200K mark in just a year? No one knows for sure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/nba-star-scottie-pippen-reveals-top-4-crypto-predictions-for-2026/,"BTC|XRP|SOL|ETH|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-24T11:18:12,"Crypto Market Surges Today: Three Major Catalysts Fueling the Rally","The crypto market advanced on Thursday, buoyed by institutional inflows, political support in Washington, and renewed risk appetite in altcoins. With visibility a growing priority for emerging projects in this bullish environment, firms like Outset PR are stepping in to shape how narratives align with momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) hovered above $118,000, extending gains after bouncing off technical support earlier this week. Ethereum retreated modestly but remains up nearly 9% month-to-date. Below is a review of three key drivers behind the move: regulatory clarity, ETF momentum, and capital rotation into altcoins. 1. Political Tailwinds and Regulatory Clarity The biggest boost to the market this week comes from pro-crypto legislation in the United States. Two pivotal bills—the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY for Payment Stablecoins Act—have gained strong support in Congress, with backing from the current administration and influential financial figures. The Market Impact: The GENIUS Act provides a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and use, encouraging innovation while ensuring consumer protection. The CLARITY Act establishes clear guidelines for how stablecoins can be used for payments, addressing longstanding compliance concerns. This wave of crypto-friendly regulation signals a seismic shift in Washington’s stance on digital assets, offering long-awaited legal clarity that institutional investors demand. It sets the stage for the mainstream adoption of crypto as a viable component of the global financial system. 2. Institutional Inflows via Bitcoin ETFs The second catalyst is the ongoing wave of institutional demand, primarily funneled through spot Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year. Industry giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have continued to accumulate Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. Key Stats: Bitcoin ETFs have seen billions in inflows over the last two months. Institutional accumulation has helped Bitcoin maintain support levels above $115,000, despite short-term volatility. Trading volume on regulated crypto exchanges has spiked, a sign of growing confidence among large investors. These ETFs have effectively bridged the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, opening the door for 401(k) funds, hedge funds, and family offices to enter the market without touching crypto wallets or exchanges. The result is a stable foundation for price growth, anchored in long-term capital. 3. Altcoin Season Ignites as Bitcoin Dominance Drops The third factor fueling today’s rally is the resurgence of altcoin activity, often referred to as the beginning of “altseason.” As Bitcoin consolidates gains, traders are rotating capital into smaller-cap cryptocurrencies that tend to outperform during bull runs. What's Driving It: Bitcoin dominance has fallen by over 7% in the last 30 days, indicating a shift toward altcoins. Projects in the AI, DeFi, meme, and gaming sectors are seeing double-digit daily gains. Tokens like Solana, Chainlink, and various Layer-2 ecosystems are attracting fresh liquidity. This trend marks the return of risk-on sentiment, where investors are more willing to chase high-reward opportunities. While volatility may rise, it also opens the door for significant upside in under-the-radar tokens. In a Fragmented Narrative, Outset PR Sharpens the Message As crypto projects race to capitalize on the current rally, narrative clarity and timing have never mattered more — and that’s where Outset PR has carved out a competitive edge. Founded by crypto PR visionary Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR blends data intelligence with a boutique approach, operating less like a traditional agency and more like a market-fit workshop. Campaigns are not dictated by templates or generic placements — they are built to move with the market. Outset PR’s approach includes: Editorial precision: Writers with journalistic and analytics backgrounds tailor content for both impact and indexability. Tier-1 targeting: Strong relationships with major editors power curated outreach strategies that consistently land coverage in high-value publications. Performance-driven reach: Using proprietary traffic modeling, Outset PR positions content across high-CTR surfaces — pushing brand visibility far beyond traditional SEO. While many agencies focus on vanity metrics, Outset PR focuses on momentum, trust-building, and actual results. For early-stage and growth-phase projects navigating the current bull environment, it offers a visible edge in attention acquisition and media lift. 👉 Contact Outset PR today to align your story with market momentum What’s Next for the Crypto Market? With favorable legislation, strong institutional participation, and growing interest in altcoins, the crypto market appears to be entering a new bullish phase. However, traders should watch for: Regulatory decisions on Ethereum ETF proposals Macroeconomic indicators like interest rates and inflation data Momentum sustainability across mid-cap and low-cap tokens For now, all signs point to continued upward momentum. The crypto market surge today is a convergence of structural, financial, and political forces. Final Thoughts As crypto markets regain strength fueled by regulatory breakthroughs, institutional capital, and renewed appetite for altcoins, projects face an increasingly competitive environment for attention and credibility. In this context, narrative becomes a strategic asset. That’s where Outset PR stands apart. With a data-powered approach, the agency engineers relevance. By aligning storytelling with timing, platform dynamics, and media intent, Outset PR helps crypto teams seize market moments and turn visibility into long-term value.

2025-07-24T11:18:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $1 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.796 Market Cap $28.92B Trading Volume (24-hour) $2.1B Circulating Supply 36.16B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8636 24-hour Low $0.7666 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 17.13% 50-day SMA $0.6640 14-Day RSI 62.76 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 20/30 (67%) 200-day SMA $ 0.6097 Cardano (ADA) price analysis A breakdown below $0.82 signals a trend reversal. Failed SMA reclaim at $0.8627 with weak CMF reading suggests limited buying interest. ADA’s Support at $0.7615 is crucial. Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: ADA breaks down from ascending channel Cardano’s daily chart for July 24 reveals a troubling technical deterioration as the price has broken below a well-established ascending channel. The breakdown occurred around $0.82, with ADA currently trading at $0.7962, representing a 2.43% decline. The Bollinger Bands are expanding, indicating increased volatility, although the price remains above the middle band at $0.7381, which provides support. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram shows weakening bullish momentum with the signal line beginning to flatten, though it remains above zero for now. This channel breakdown typically signals a shift in market structure, and the failure to reclaim the $0.82 level could lead to further downside pressure toward the middle Bollinger Band around $0.738. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Indicators confirm bearish reversal with failed recovery attempts The 4-hour timeframe corroborates the bearish downturn, with Cardano struggling below the 20-period SMA at $0.8627, having failed multiple attempts during the day to reclaim this critical level. The price action shows a series of lower highs and lower lows, with the most recent candle closing at $0.7967 after testing support near $0.7615. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView The CMF indicator at 0.06 suggests minimal buying pressure, while the recent red candles with significant wicks indicate selling pressure at higher levels. The inability to hold above $0.80 psychological support and the breakdown below the SMA confluence creates a concerning technical setup. Key support now lies at $0.7615, and a break below this level could accelerate selling toward the $0.74-$0.72 zone, where previous consolidation occurred. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7794 BUY SMA 5 $0.8400 SELL SMA 10 $0.8162 SELL SMA 21 $0.7306 BUY SMA 50 $0.6640 BUY SMA 100 $0.6929 BUY SMA 200 $0.6097 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7232 BUY EMA 5 $0.6972 BUY EMA 10 $0.6811 BUY EMA 21 $0.6803 BUY EMA 50 $0.7117 BUY EMA 100 $0.7469 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.7227 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano appears positioned for further downside in the near term. The daily channel breakdown, combined with the 4-hour failure to reclaim key moving averages, suggests the path of least resistance is lower. Traders should watch the $0.7615 support level closely, as a break could trigger accelerated selling toward $0.72-$0.74. Any recovery attempts will face strong resistance at $0.82, making it a critical reclaim level for bulls to regain control. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely unlikely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705.

TLDR: Crypto market cap fell below $4 trillion; Large majority of top 100 coins have dropped in 24 hours; BTC and ETH are both down, trading at $118,256 and $3,574; Market sentiment decreased slightly today; US ETH spot ETFs continue the inflow streak, US BTC spot ETFs see further outflows; ’Investor appetite for the two biggest blockchains is undeniable’; ’The real opportunity lies at the intersection of Bitcoin and Ethereum’. Crypto Winners & Losers Over the past 24 hours, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have turned red. Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by only 0.2% in a day, meaning it’s unchanged. The current price is $118,256, holding above the $118,000 level. BTC’s is the lowest fall on this list. Then, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 2.6% over the same period. It’s now trading at $3,574. This is the second lowest decrease. Two coins saw double-digit drops. XRP (XRP) fell the most in this category: 12.1% to $3.05. Also, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 10.7%, now trading at $0.2303. The other coins in this category saw decreases between 3% and 8% each. In the top 100 coins category, only four coins are green, and only one had an increase above 0.3%.

The highest of these are 16.3% and 15.6% by Aptos (APT) and Flare (FLR) , now trading at $4.59 and $0.02205. Moreover, PUMP , the native token of Pump.Fun , dropped 20% in 24 hours after founder Alon Cohen said there is no immediate token airdrop. “We want to make sure that it is a meaningful airdrop and it is executed well,” Cohen said . “We’re actually focusing on bringing back a lot of that attention and hype to our ecosystem. That being said, the airdrop is not going to be taking place in the immediate future.” Allon speaks about the pumpfun airdrop live on threadguy stream, ""We want to reward OG pumpfun users"" pic.twitter.com/gdfE7H4oRV — ً (@0xsyste) July 23, 2025 Meanwhile, bankrupt crypto exchange FTX said it would begin its next round of cash distributions to creditors on or around 30 September. The payments will be processed through FTX’s designated distribution partners, including BitGo , Kraken , and Payoneer . Industry is Shifting to Bitcoin-Ethereum Interconnection James Harris, Group CEO of digital asset firm Tesseract , commented that “crypto hitting $4 trillion in total market cap earlier this month was a serious milestone, and while we’ve seen a bit of a pullback in the past couple of days, the rally has been driven by a combination of structural and cyclical forces.” “It’s a powerful trifecta: regulatory clarity, macro easing, and corporate adoption. Together, they’re pushing crypto from speculative asset to serious portfolio contender. That said, these same forces can reverse — so while the momentum is real, disciplined risk management remains essential.” Also, Dom Harz, co-founder of hybrid chain BOB , commented that Ethereum ETFs saw the third-largest day of inflows in history this week. They also celebrated their one-year anniversary yesterday, coming far since their launch. The high inflows may be the result of buy-in from investors who “missed out” on BTC, which hit a new record high of $122,000 the week prior. “Either way, investor appetite for the two biggest blockchains is undeniable,” Harz says. What’s more, this momentum is not showing signs of slowing down. ETH is “outperforming the original blockchain so far this month. Institutional investors are taking note, and many major players are announcing plans to grow their ETH treasuries.” Therefore, Harz argues, “the real opportunity lies at the intersection of Bitcoin and Ethereum.” Fast developments in innovations like BitVM and Bitcoin DeFi are making “the idea that investors must look beyond Bitcoin for DeFi opportunities” outdated. “The industry is experiencing a shift toward a more interconnected future, where Bitcoin’s robust security and Ethereum’s programmability align to drive broader adoption without compromising decentralization,” Harz concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,256. Its intraday high was $119,197, after which the price fell to the intraday low of $117,422, before returning to the current level. The coin still stands above $118,000 and is trying to hold on to it. It has dipped below this level several times over the past 24 hours. Observers are now looking to see if it will manage to keep the level and move upwards again, or if it will drop below it, possibly into the $116,700 zone. Keep an eye on the $120,094 mark, after which the price could move above $122,000 and towards $128,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,574. The coin began the day at $3,689, dropping to $3,544, then surging back to $3,662, falling to $3,530, and recovering to the current level. The coin is working to move above $3,660, but it’s also being pulled below $3,530. Investors are waiting to see which side will prevail. Ethereum has been performing very well over the past few weeks, so many argue that the price will continue rising towards $4,000. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment has dropped today, but it still remains in greed territory. It stands at 67 today , compared to 70 yesterday. The sentiment remains overall positive, but it currently doesn’t indicate a major incoming correction.

Recently, analyst Tom Lee, who is also the Chief Investment Officer at Fundstrat Capital and Chairman of Bitmine , said that BTC could hit $1 million in the coming years. “I believe the $200,000 to $250,000 range for Bitcoin remains realistic, as this would only represent approximately 25% of gold’s current market size,” Lee noted. All eyes on the next leg up for $BTC ! Bitcoin is holding strong above the bullish flag breakout. Last week's move was validated with clean structure and sustained momentum.

2025-07-24T11:15:10,"Altcoin Season Hope Dim as Traders Unwind Bullish Bets: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin's (BTC) consolidation continues to take the wind out of the bull run in the broader market that had raised hopes for the so-called alt season marked by prolonged outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies. Over the past 24 hours, major altcoins have experienced a significant decline, led by a double-digit drop in the payments-focused XRP and an 8% slide in SOL. The CoinDesk 80 Index, which tracks the performance of altcoins, has dropped over 7% while the CoinDesk 20 Index, which is dominated by bitcoin and ether, has declined by 4%. ""The crypto market took a nosedive, losing almost 4% of its market cap over the last 24 hours. Without bitcoin's growth, altcoins, which had been driving the market upwards in previous days, found themselves on sale. Forty-eight of the top 100 altcoins are losing double-digit rates over 24 hours, while only three are growing,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. Amid all this, social media is abuzz with posts about some $2 billion worth of ether waiting to be unstaked , with over 475 Ethereum validators awaiting exit. (check chart of the day section). Some are drawing parallels with January 2024, when large unstaking marked a temporary price top. The latest surge in unstaking appears to be driven by the soaring ether borrowing rates on decentralized platforms like Aave, which have diminished the appeal of looping strategies designed to boost ether staking yields. Typically, these strategies involve users depositing liquidity staking (LST) or liquid restaking tokens (LRT) as collateral on platforms like AAVE and borrow ETH. The borrowed ETH is again converted to LRT and LSTs and redeposited, creating a loop. The strategy works when staking yields are greater than borrowing costs. However, with borrowing costs on the rise, the loop is likely being reversed, leading traders to rush to repay loans, exit LST/LRT, and reclaim ETH. ""The real trigger is soaring ETH borrowing rates since July 16 (peaking at 18%). This forced mass unwinding of ETH leverage loops on Aave, as negative yield spreads crushed profitability. Traders rushed to repay loans, exit LST/LRT positions, and reclaim ETH — causing depegs and queue congestion,"" pseudonymous observer Degen Station noted on X. It added that arbitrageurs are now scooping up LSTs and LRTs at a discount to redeem them for ether, worsening the issue, while demand for new staking remains strong. To cut to the chase, the large queue for unstaking is not necessarily a bearish signal. In other key news, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that the company is planning to re-enter the U.S. with stablecoin offerings for payments, interbank settlements, and trading. In traditional markets, major currencies traded flat against the U.S. dollar, except for the risk-sensitive AUD/USD pair, which crossed above resistance at 0.66. Traders were closely watching for signs of sustainability as failure could be a harbinger of broad-based risk aversion. Stay Alert!

The token jumped 21% in 24 hours, extending a multiday rally and overtaking its previous all-time high of $0.042 from January. South Korean traders are driving momentum, with 38% of PENGU volume now in KRW pairs, up from 32% earlier this month, a significant concentration of localized demand. Open interest in PENGU futures is at a record high, indicative of expectations of further volatility. The Pudgy Penguins NFT floor price has almost doubled to 16.2 ETH, reinforcing the connection between token price and NFT ecosystem strength. PENGU’s rally comes amid weak sentiment around PUMP following its underwhelming post-ICO performance, pushing attention and liquidity toward other Solana memecoins. The token is increasingly being viewed as a proxy for meme market sentiment, combining high liquidity, exchange access, cultural mindshare and ties to a top-tier NFT IP. Derivatives Positioning Open interest in BTC, ETH, XRP and SOL offshore perpetual has declined along with prices in the past 24 hours. Yet, funding rates hold positive. This combination indicates that the market swoon is predominantly driven by the unwinding of bullish bets rather than outright shorts. On the CME, the annualized three-month basis in BTC futures has ticked up to nearly 9%, the highest since May. However, open interest remains locked in familiar ranges. ETH CME futures open interest has pulled back slightly from the record 2.08 billion ETH to 1.87 billion ETH. Basis, meanwhile, has topped 10% for the first time since the end of May, indicating a bullish sentiment. On Deribit, the put bias in short-dated BTC risk reversals has strengthened, indicating fears of deeper price pull back. ETH options continue to show a bullish call bias across all tenors. Surprisingly, XRP risk reversals remain bullish despite the sharp price drop in the past 24 hours.

In total, the government still holds nearly 198,000 BTC across various wallets owned by the FBI, DOJ, DEA, and several U.S. Attorney’s Offices, which translates to about $23.5 billion, as the most recent data published by Arkham Intelligence suggests. U.S. Government crypto moves. Source: Arkham Government crypto moves Some of the government’s BTC holdings have been partially liquidated, for example, around 41,700 BTC of the 51,680 BTC seized from James Zhong’s Silk Road stash. However, Arkham confirms that no tracked wallets have made any such moves in over four months, suggesting no ongoing liquidation activity. Likewise, not all seized Bitcoin has been legally forfeited, and some of it may be held pending court decisions. This has created a lot of confusion regarding how much “digital gold” the government really owns as opposed to just holding for the time being. Bitcoin price remains stable Despite the rumors, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stable. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at approximately $118,200, down just 0.08% over the past seven days. BTC 7-day price chart.

Further inflation, however, could further drive Bitcoin’s role as a hedge. The market is also expecting the results of the upcoming release of President Donald Trump’s crypto task force report, scheduled for July 30. Marking six months since the formation of the presidential digital assets working group, the report could become one of the most important crypto policy documents in 2025, likely addressing regulatory reform and stablecoin oversight.

2025-07-24T11:04:45,"BNB Hits All-Time High as Alt Season Beckons","BNB, the native token of BNB Chain and the broader Binance ecosystem, has hit an all-time high (ATH) this week after surpassing $800. The milestone attests to the significant progress Binance has made in its relentless quest to expand the token’s utility and integrations. But there’s also another reason why BNB’s ATH should be a cause for cheer, even for those not holding the asset: it may be the first signs that an altcoin season is coming. BNB Goes ATH On July 23, BNB hit its all-time high of over $800 per token, giving it a market cap of around $112B . Not bad for a token that launched eight years ago priced at $0.15 and which is now a top five crypto asset. During the intervening period, Binance and BNB have both been on quite the ride, complete with the ups and downs that are characteristic of crypto. But lately, it’s been almost exclusively Up Only for the Binance ecosystem and this progress has been reflected on the charts as BNB’s momentum looks poised to send it higher still. From a technical perspective, there are plenty of reasons that can be attributed to BNB’s multi-year ascent. The token boasts a Sharpe ratio of 2.5, indicating that for every dollar of risk taken, the return was $2.5. This means that BNB has experienced significantly lower drawdowns compared to most cryptos and traditional market indices, offering investors a more stable and attractive risk-reward profile over the past five years. It’s not quite Bitcoin, but it is BNB – the second “B” former Binance CEO CZ used to jokingly remind his followers not to bet against. But putting its superior Sharpe ratio and relatively low volatility aside, there may be a simpler reason why BNB has broken out in the past week: it was its turn. Bitcoin has done Bitcoin things all year. And in recent weeks, ETH has finally started to move up. The next candidate on the list is BNB, both on account of its market capitalization and deep integration. BNB is everywhere, and unlike BTC, its holders are even willing to use it for payments and rewards. BNB Utility Fuels Value Flywheel It would be fair to say that BNB began life as an exchange token. It would also be fair to say that it has long since escaped that box. While Binance’s shadow still looms large over the exchange landscape, using BNB to obtain discounted trading fees is just one use case among many. As the Binance ecosystem has expanded over the last five years, so have the places where BNB is accepted. It’s still an integral part of Binance’s global exchange and BNB Chain of course, but it’s also transcended these ecosystems to gain its own trajectory. Beyond blockchain, BNB is expanding into real-world use cases like payments via Binance Pay and travel bookings on Travala.com , bridging digital assets with everyday life. Institutional adoption is also growing, with corporate treasury demand even surpassing Ethereum’s. Supporting this ecosystem is BNB’s deflationary tokenomics: an auto-burn mechanism has permanently removed 31% of the total supply, enhancing the notion of scarcity and driving long-term value. On Binance’s centralized exchange, BNB holders get their share of perks including access to token sales and staking opportunities that lock up supply and incentivize long-term holding. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s multi-layer framework, including its Layer 1 as well as the opBNB Layer 2, continue to drive demand for the native asset. Elsewhere it’s being used in everything from decentralized storage on Greenfield to serving as DeFi collateral. Outside of ETH, no other asset has this level of everyday utility and adoption. And that’s why BNB is flying. Wen Alt Season? While there’s no question that BNB has followed BTC and ETH’s lead in rallying strongly, the question of whether this means alt season is imminent has still to be settled. Definitions of this period, during which the long tail of crypto assets outperform majors, vary, but Blockchaincenter’s index holds that when 75% of the top 50 coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, alt season has arrived. Its index currently sits at 39, but briefly flirted with 60 in recent days. We’re not quite there, in other words, but we’re close. Sentiment among seasoned crypto traders appears to be that alt season will arrive but that it will be shorter than previous cycles. Potentially on course to kick in by early to mid-August, this could see altcoins significantly increase their total capitalization for several months in succession. Despite this, many alts are still down significantly on their previous ATH will struggle to regain this territory – even ETH is still down 30% from its all-time high, despite its bullish performance over the past 30 days. BNB, in comparison, finds itself in the same position as BTC: teasing new highs as the crypto market grinds its way upwards. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-24T11:01:08,"Crypto wrap: BTC steady but PUMP, Flare, and Aptos among big altcoin losers","The cryptocurrency market remains largely bullish, but traders are reeling from a sharp downturn seen during the Asian hours on July 24. As most altcoins flipped negative on the 24 hour timeframe, the global market capitalization fell 1.5% to $3.89 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, global trading volume over the past 24 hours reached $225 billion, up 20% amid heightened activity. But as most analysts note, the volatile conditions aside, market sentiment leans bullish. In the short term, attention is on the significant altcoin declines. PUMP, Flare, and Aptos rank among biggest losers today, even as Bitcoin shows resilience. Over $960 million liquidated as altcoins fall Crypto market’s sharp decline has come amid more than $960 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data , total liquidations jumped more than 260% in the past 24 hours, the majority of those wiped out being long positions. Data shows $828 million in bullish bets wiped out in the past day, a lot of this coming on the back of traders being caught off-guard by sharp altcoin declines. Per Coinglass, leveraged positions with Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP contributed significantly to the liquidated longs tally. Bitcoin saw $81 million in leveraged positions rekt. The downturn appears driven by profit-taking following recent market highs, as well as macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin steady as BTC price rebounds to $118k While Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to keep bears off following its run to a new all-time high, the bellwether crypto continues to demonstrate stability. Bulls have rebounded to highs of $118,377 after a brief stall below $117k. As altcoins shed some gains, this resilience has Bitcoin’s dominance back above 61%. Ethereum dominance is at 11%. Bitcoin’s price has hovered around $117,000–$118,000 this week, supported by robust capital flows and institutional demand. Notably, on-chain metrics indicate traders are showing some cautious optimism. Yet, with reduced profit-taking and steady accumulation by large holders, the overall take is that the leg up isn’t done. PUMP, Flare, and Aptos top losers in 24 hours Among the hardest-hit altcoins, PUMP, Flare, and Aptos led the losses over the past 24 hours. PUMP, a meme-driven token, plummeted by 18% to $0.003.
