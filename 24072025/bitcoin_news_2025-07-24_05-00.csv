2025-07-24T02:40:23,"Groundbreaking: 21Shares and Societe Generale Forge Strategic Alliance for Crypto ETPs","BitcoinWorld Groundbreaking: 21Shares and Societe Generale Forge Strategic Alliance for Crypto ETPs Imagine a financial landscape where the innovative spirit of digital assets seamlessly integrates with the robust infrastructure of traditional banking. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality, and a recent announcement from 21Shares, a leading global issuer of cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), and French banking giant Societe Generale, marks a truly pivotal moment for Crypto ETPs . This strategic collaboration is not just another headline; itâ€™s a testament to the growing maturity and institutional acceptance of digital assets, promising to reshape how investors access the burgeoning crypto market. According to a press release on GlobeNewswire , 21Shares has officially signed an ETP market-making fund platform agreement with Societe Generale. This landmark deal positions the venerable French bank to provide crucial over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity for 21Sharesâ€™ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs across major fund platforms in Germany and Eastern Europe. For anyone watching the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world, this development signals a significant leap forward, particularly for the accessibility and stability of Crypto ETPs in key European markets. What Does This Groundbreaking Partnership Mean for Crypto ETPs? The collaboration between 21Shares and Societe Generale is far more than a simple business transaction; it represents a profound shift in the perception and practical application of digital assets within mainstream finance. For investors, especially institutions, direct exposure to cryptocurrencies can be fraught with complexities, including custody, security, and regulatory uncertainties. This is precisely where Crypto ETPs shine. Crypto ETPs are financial instruments that track the price of underlying cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning the digital assets. They trade on regulated stock exchanges, offering a familiar and compliant pathway for traditional investors. This partnership enhances several key aspects: Enhanced Accessibility: By leveraging Societe Generaleâ€™s extensive network and market-making capabilities, 21Sharesâ€™ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs become more readily available to a broader range of investors, particularly institutional clients in Germany and Eastern Europe. Increased Trust and Credibility: The involvement of a banking giant like Societe Generale lends significant credibility to the crypto asset class. It signals to a wider audience that digital assets are maturing and are being integrated into established financial frameworks. Regulatory Comfort: ETPs operate within regulated environments, providing a level of investor protection and oversight that direct crypto investments often lack. Societe Generaleâ€™s involvement further solidifies this regulatory comfort. 21Shares has been at the forefront of the Crypto ETPs space, consistently innovating and expanding its product suite. Their expertise in structuring and managing these products, combined with Societe Generaleâ€™s deep financial market experience, creates a powerful synergy poised to drive further adoption. How Does Societe Generale Enhance Liquidity for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs? Liquidity is the lifeblood of any financial market. It refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. In nascent markets like cryptocurrency, liquidity can sometimes be a concern, leading to wider bid-ask spreads and higher transaction costs. Societe Generaleâ€™s role as a market-making fund platform is designed to address this directly for 21Sharesâ€™ Crypto ETPs . A market maker facilitates trading by constantly offering both buy and sell prices for an asset. By doing so, they ensure thereâ€™s always a counterparty for trades, making it easier for investors to enter or exit positions. Societe Generale will provide over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity, which is particularly significant for several reasons: Direct, Private Transactions: OTC trading involves direct deals between two parties, bypassing public exchanges. This is crucial for large institutional trades, as it allows for significant volumes to be executed without causing large price swings on public order books. Reduced Price Impact: Large orders placed on public exchanges can sometimes move the market against the trader. OTC desks mitigate this by absorbing large trades discreetly. Tighter Spreads: With a major player like Societe Generale actively making markets, the difference between the buy and sell price (the spread) for Bitcoin ETPs and Ethereum ETPs is likely to narrow, leading to more efficient trading for investors. Deeper Order Books: Societe Generaleâ€™s commitment adds significant depth to the available liquidity, ensuring that even substantial trades can be executed smoothly and reliably. This commitment from a traditional banking powerhouse underscores a growing confidence in the underlying assets (Bitcoin and Ethereum) and the regulated ETP wrapper. Itâ€™s a strategic move that enhances the trading experience for all participants in the Crypto ETPs ecosystem, fostering greater market stability and efficiency. Why is Institutional Adoption of Crypto ETPs Crucial? The journey of any asset class from niche to mainstream is marked by increasing institutional participation. For cryptocurrencies, Crypto ETPs serve as a vital bridge, making it palatable for large institutional investors like pension funds, endowments, and asset managers to allocate capital. Their involvement is crucial for several reasons: Market Maturation: Institutional capital brings stability, depth, and professionalism to the market. It signals that crypto is no longer just a speculative retail play but a legitimate asset class worthy of serious consideration in diversified portfolios. Vast Capital Pools: Institutions manage trillions of dollars in assets. Even a small allocation from these funds can represent a significant influx of capital into the crypto market, driving further development and innovation. Validation and Legitimacy: When established financial giants like Societe Generale get involved, it sends a powerful message. It helps to dispel lingering doubts about the long-term viability and legitimacy of digital assets, paving the way for broader acceptance. Risk Mitigation and Compliance: Institutional investors operate under stringent regulatory and fiduciary duties. Crypto ETPs , being regulated products, offer the necessary compliance frameworks, audit trails, and security protocols that direct crypto holdings often lack, making them an ideal entry point. The partnership between 21Shares and Societe Generale is a prime example of how the traditional financial world is adapting to and embracing the digital asset revolution, primarily through regulated and accessible vehicles like Crypto ETPs . This symbiotic relationship benefits both sides: crypto gains legitimacy and capital, while traditional finance expands its product offerings to meet evolving investor demand. What Are the Broader Implications for the European Crypto Market? The agreement between 21Shares and Societe Generale is set to have ripple effects far beyond the immediate beneficiaries. Its focus on Germany and Eastern Europe is particularly noteworthy, as these regions represent significant growth opportunities for digital asset adoption. Setting a Precedent: This high-profile collaboration could encourage other major European banks and financial institutions to explore similar partnerships or launch their own crypto-related services. It validates the business model and reduces the perceived risk for late adopters. Market Expansion: By enhancing liquidity and accessibility in Germany, one of Europeâ€™s largest economies, and the dynamic markets of Eastern Europe, the partnership is directly contributing to the geographical expansion of regulated crypto investment products. Regulatory Evolution: As more traditional players enter the space via regulated products like Crypto ETPs , it naturally pushes regulators towards developing clearer, more comprehensive frameworks. This can lead to a more predictable and safer environment for all participants. Increased Competition and Innovation: A more robust and liquid market for Crypto ETPs will likely foster greater competition among issuers. This competition can drive innovation in product design, reduce fees, and improve services for investors. Investor Confidence: The stamp of approval from a bank like Societe Generale can significantly boost confidence among retail and institutional investors who may have previously been hesitant to enter the crypto market due to its perceived volatility or lack of regulation. Ultimately, this partnership is a significant step towards the mainstreaming of digital assets within the European financial ecosystem, solidifying the position of Crypto ETPs as a crucial investment vehicle. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto ETPs While the path ahead for Crypto ETPs looks promising, itâ€™s important to acknowledge that challenges remain, alongside immense opportunities. The crypto market, by its nature, is still subject to significant volatility, and the regulatory landscape, while evolving, is not yet fully harmonized globally. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite the regulated nature of ETPs, the broader crypto regulatory environment is still fragmented across different jurisdictions, which can pose challenges for global expansion and product diversification. Market Volatility: While ETPs offer a regulated wrapper, they still track volatile underlying assets. Investors need to be aware of the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Investor Education: Despite increasing awareness, a significant portion of the investor base still requires comprehensive education on the nuances of crypto assets and the specific risks and benefits of ETPs. Opportunities: Product Diversification: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, thereâ€™s potential for ETPs tracking other major cryptocurrencies, baskets of digital assets, or even DeFi protocols, offering investors broader exposure. Global Expansion: As regulatory clarity improves in other regions, the model pioneered by 21Shares and Societe Generale could be replicated globally, opening up new markets. Integration with Traditional Products: Further integration of Crypto ETPs into traditional investment portfolios, potentially as components of multi-asset funds or retirement plans. This collaboration is a clear indicator that major financial institutions are moving beyond mere observation to active participation in the digital asset space. It underscores a growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and increasingly integral part of the global financial system, with Crypto ETPs leading the charge for institutional adoption. In conclusion, the partnership between 21Shares and Societe Generale is a monumental step forward for the digital asset industry. By enhancing liquidity and accessibility for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, it not only strengthens the position of Crypto ETPs as a reliable investment vehicle but also accelerates the broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This is a clear signal that the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with the innovation of the blockchain, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient global market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Crypto ETP? A Crypto ETP (Exchange Traded Product) is a type of financial instrument that tracks the price performance of an underlying cryptocurrency or a basket of cryptocurrencies. It allows investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning them, trading on regulated stock exchanges similar to traditional stocks or ETFs. Q2: Why is Societe Generaleâ€™s involvement in this agreement significant? Societe Generale is a major French banking giant with a long history in traditional finance. Their involvement lends significant credibility and institutional trust to the crypto asset class. By providing market-making and OTC liquidity, they enhance the stability, efficiency, and accessibility of 21Sharesâ€™ Crypto ETPs for institutional investors. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies are supported by this market-making agreement? This specific agreement between 21Shares and Societe Generale focuses on providing over-the-counter liquidity for 21Sharesâ€™ Bitcoin ETPs and Ethereum ETPs. Q4: How does this partnership impact investors in Germany and Eastern Europe? For investors in Germany and Eastern Europe, this partnership means improved liquidity and potentially tighter trading spreads for 21Sharesâ€™ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on major fund platforms. This makes it easier and more cost-effective for both institutional and retail investors to trade these products. Q5: What are the long-term implications for institutional crypto adoption? The long-term implication is a significant acceleration of institutional crypto adoption. Such partnerships build necessary infrastructure, increase regulatory comfort, and validate cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.

2025-07-24T02:25:23,"Spot Bitcoin ETF: Fidelityâ€™s Crucial Move Unlocking In-Kind Redemptions","BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETF: Fidelityâ€™s Crucial Move Unlocking In-Kind Redemptions The world of cryptocurrency investment is constantly evolving, and a recent development from asset management giant Fidelity is creating significant buzz. If youâ€™ve been following the journey of the Spot Bitcoin ETF , you know the excitement and challenges involved. Now, Fidelity is making a bold move, seeking U.S. SEC approval to amend its existing Spot Bitcoin ETF filing to allow for â€˜in-kindâ€™ redemptions and creations. This isnâ€™t just a technical tweak; itâ€™s a potential game-changer that could redefine how investors interact with Bitcoin through traditional financial vehicles. What Exactly Are In-Kind Redemptions, and Why Do They Matter for Your Spot Bitcoin ETF Investment? To truly grasp the significance of Fidelityâ€™s filing, we first need to understand what â€˜in-kindâ€™ redemptions mean, especially in the context of a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Traditionally, many ETFs, particularly those involving less liquid assets or those with regulatory sensitivities, operate on a â€˜cashâ€™ redemption model. This means that when an authorized participant (AP) wants to redeem ETF shares, the issuer sells the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin) and gives the AP cash in return. Similarly, for creations, the AP provides cash, and the issuer buys the underlying assets. However, â€˜in-kindâ€™ redemptions are different. They allow authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying assets themselves â€“ meaning Bitcoin, in the case of a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Conversely, for creations, APs would deliver Bitcoin directly to the ETF issuer in exchange for new shares. This fundamental shift is particularly significant for a Spot Bitcoin ETF , where the underlying asset is a volatile digital currency. It streamlines the process and introduces several potential advantages for investors and the market alike. Hereâ€™s a quick comparison: Feature Cash Redemption Model In-Kind Redemption Model Underlying Asset Exchange Sold for cash by issuer; AP receives cash. Direct exchange of Bitcoin for shares; AP receives Bitcoin. Tax Implications Potential for capital gains events for the ETF. Generally more tax-efficient for the ETF structure. Operational Complexity Requires cash management and market execution by issuer. Requires secure digital asset custody and transfer. Market Impact Issuerâ€™s buying/selling can influence market price. Direct exchange can reduce market impact. Why is Fidelity Championing This Change for the Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape? Fidelity, a financial powerhouse with decades of experience in asset management, has long been an advocate for Bitcoin and digital assets. Their pursuit of in-kind redemptions for their Spot Bitcoin ETF is not arbitrary. It stems from a deep understanding of market mechanics and a desire to offer the most efficient and beneficial investment vehicles to their clients. By pushing for this model, Fidelity aims to: Enhance Tax Efficiency: In-kind redemptions can often be more tax-efficient for the ETF structure itself. When an ETF sells assets for cash to meet redemptions, it can trigger capital gains taxes within the fund, which are then passed on to investors. In-kind redemptions, by directly exchanging assets, can potentially avoid these taxable events, leading to better after-tax returns for investors. Improve Operational Efficiency: Direct exchange of Bitcoin for shares can simplify the operational process for both the issuer and authorized participants, reducing the need for complex cash management and market timing for large transactions. Reduce Trading Spreads: With a more efficient creation and redemption mechanism, the ETFâ€™s price is likely to track the underlying Bitcoin price more closely, potentially leading to tighter spreads for investors. Align with Traditional ETF Best Practices: Many established commodity ETFs (like gold or silver ETFs) operate on an in-kind model. Fidelityâ€™s move seeks to align the Spot Bitcoin ETF with these proven structures, lending it more credibility in the eyes of traditional finance investors and regulators. Their commitment underscores a belief in the long-term viability and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, especially through a robust Spot Bitcoin ETF structure. The SECâ€™s Evolving Stance: A Key Factor for Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious, even skeptical, about approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Concerns primarily revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, the landscape has significantly shifted. The approval of several cash-settled Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a monumental turning point, signaling a growing, albeit cautious, comfort level within the regulatory body regarding the mechanisms surrounding a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Fidelityâ€™s amendment filing, as reported by outlets like Bitcoin Magazine on X, comes at a time when the SEC is gaining more experience and understanding of the operational realities of these products. While the initial approvals favored cash redemptions, the industry has consistently argued for the benefits of in-kind. The SECâ€™s decision on Fidelityâ€™s request will be a crucial indicator of its evolving perspective on the ideal structure for these innovative financial products. It will also reveal how far the SEC is willing to go in accommodating the unique characteristics of digital assets within existing regulatory frameworks. How Could In-Kind Redemptions Impact the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? If Fidelityâ€™s request for in-kind redemptions is approved, it could set a powerful precedent for the entire Spot Bitcoin ETF market. Hereâ€™s how it might play out: Increased Competition and Innovation: Other issuers of Spot Bitcoin ETFs would likely follow suit, filing their own amendments to allow for in-kind redemptions. This competition could drive further innovation in the market, leading to more sophisticated and investor-friendly products. Enhanced Market Efficiency: The ability to directly exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares could lead to more efficient arbitrage mechanisms, ensuring that the ETFâ€™s price remains tightly correlated with the underlying Bitcoin price. This benefits investors by reducing premium or discount discrepancies. Greater Institutional Adoption: The tax efficiency and operational simplicity offered by in-kind redemptions might make Spot Bitcoin ETFs even more attractive to large institutional investors, who are highly sensitive to cost and tax implications. This could unlock a new wave of capital flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Broader Acceptance of Crypto as an Asset Class: An in-kind Spot Bitcoin ETF would further legitimize Bitcoin as a mature, investable asset class within traditional finance, akin to commodities like gold. This could accelerate its integration into mainstream investment portfolios. This move by Fidelity could pave the way for a more mature and efficient Spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. What Are the Potential Benefits for Investors in a Spot Bitcoin ETF ? For the everyday investor, the shift to in-kind redemptions in a Spot Bitcoin ETF could translate into several tangible advantages: Improved Performance: By potentially avoiding internal capital gains within the fund, the ETF might offer better after-tax returns, meaning more money stays in your pocket. Lower Management Fees: While not a direct consequence, increased operational efficiency could allow issuers to potentially lower management expense ratios (MERs) over time, making the ETF a more cost-effective way to gain Bitcoin exposure. Enhanced Price Tracking: As mentioned, better arbitrage mechanisms due to in-kind redemptions mean the ETFâ€™s market price is more likely to closely mirror Bitcoinâ€™s actual spot price, reducing tracking error. Greater Confidence: An ETF structure that mirrors established commodity ETFs (like gold) can instill greater confidence in investors who are accustomed to traditional financial products, making the leap into crypto investing feel less daunting. These benefits collectively make the prospect of an in-kind Spot Bitcoin ETF highly attractive. Are There Any Hurdles on the Road to In-Kind Spot Bitcoin ETF Redemptions? While the benefits are clear, the path to full in-kind redemptions for a Spot Bitcoin ETF is not without its challenges. The SECâ€™s primary concern remains market integrity and investor protection. Key hurdles include: Custody and Security: Managing direct transfers of Bitcoin requires robust and secure custody solutions. The SEC will scrutinize how these digital assets are held and transferred to prevent theft or loss. Valuation: Ensuring accurate and fair valuation of Bitcoin during in-kind creations and redemptions is crucial, especially given its 24/7 trading nature and potential for price volatility. Regulatory Compliance: The SEC will need to be convinced that the in-kind mechanism doesnâ€™t introduce new avenues for market manipulation or other illicit activities. This includes robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Operational Readiness of APs: Authorized participants will need to have the necessary infrastructure and expertise to handle direct Bitcoin transfers, which might be a new operational challenge for some traditional financial firms. The SECâ€™s approval will hinge on Fidelityâ€™s ability to convincingly address these concerns and demonstrate a secure, compliant, and operationally sound framework for in-kind redemptions. The Road Ahead: Whatâ€™s Next for the Spot Bitcoin ETF ? The outcome of Fidelityâ€™s filing will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of the Spot Bitcoin ETF market. If approved, it could accelerate the maturation of the crypto investment landscape, encouraging more institutional participation and potentially leading to a more robust and liquid market for Bitcoin. It signifies a continued push towards integrating digital assets seamlessly into traditional finance, offering investors increasingly sophisticated and efficient ways to access this burgeoning asset class. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, such innovations are crucial in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future. In conclusion, Fidelityâ€™s pursuit of in-kind redemptions for its Spot Bitcoin ETF represents a pivotal moment for digital asset investing. It signifies a maturation of the market, a deepening understanding by regulators, and a potential win for investors seeking more efficient and cost-effective ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such innovations are crucial in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an in-kind redemption for a Spot Bitcoin ETF ? An in-kind redemption for a Spot Bitcoin ETF allows authorized participants (APs) to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying Bitcoin, rather than receiving cash. This means the AP receives Bitcoin itself from the ETF issuer when redeeming shares. 2. How does an in-kind redemption differ from a cash redemption? In a cash redemption, when an AP redeems ETF shares, the ETF issuer sells the underlying assets (Bitcoin) and gives the AP cash. In an in-kind redemption, the AP receives the actual underlying assets (Bitcoin) directly, without a cash conversion step by the issuer. 3. Why is Fidelity seeking this amendment for its Spot Bitcoin ETF ? Fidelity is seeking this amendment primarily to enhance the tax efficiency of the ETF for investors, potentially reduce operational complexities, and align the Spot Bitcoin ETF with the structure of other traditional commodity ETFs that use in-kind redemptions. 4. What are the main benefits of in-kind redemptions for investors? The main benefits for investors include potential tax efficiency (by avoiding capital gains events within the fund), lower overall costs, and improved tracking of the ETFâ€™s price to the underlying Bitcoin price due to more efficient arbitrage mechanisms. 5. Could this change impact other Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers? Yes, if the SEC approves Fidelityâ€™s request, it could set a significant precedent. Other Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers would likely file similar amendments to offer in-kind redemptions, leading to increased competition and further innovation across the market.

2025-07-24T02:00:44,"Analyst Sounds Alarm For 50% Crash If Bitcoin Doesnâ€™t Make A New ATH Soon","Bitcoin (BTC) may be on the edge of a significant market move, as a crypto analyst warns that failure to reach an all-time high in the coming weeks could trigger a sharp correction. While long-term bullish sentiment remains strong, the immediate outlook hinges on whether BTC can maintain an upward momentum and avoid a damaging setback that could derail or further stall its current rally. Bitcoin Faces 50% Crash Threat A prominent crypto analyst, Tony Severino, has issued a stark warning to Bitcoin investors on X social media. He cautions that a failure to break a new all-time high soon could spark a massive price crash â€”potentially wiping out over 50% of BTCâ€™s current value. In his shared Elliott Wave chart analysis , Severino highlights Bitcoinâ€™s current position within what appears to be an intermediate Wave 4 Expanded Flat correction. According to the structure, Bitcoin may be nearing the end of wave B, which typically precedes a steep drop in wave C. Severinoâ€™s analysis draws parallels between BTCâ€™s current price behavior and the 2021-2022 expanded flat correction that defined Primary Wave 4. At the time, Bitcoin peaked in wave B before cascading into wave C, resulting in a brutal bear market . A similar pattern appears to be developing in BTCâ€™s current chart structure. The chart highlights that the recent surge in the cryptocurrencyâ€™s price could be forming a deceptive wave B peak, which may soon reverse into a wave C crash targeting the $60,000 region or lower. A decline to this level would represent a 50% drawdown from current levels, near $118,000. Notably, Severinoâ€™s warning does not stem from a bearish conviction but rather from cautious optimism. While he maintains a strong bullish long-term outlook and believes Bitcoin still has a final Wave 5 rally ahead , the analyst emphasizes the need for BTC to break out into a new ATH soon to invalidate the expanded flat scenario. Should the market fail to deliver this upside move, the corrective structure could dominate and significantly delay the next upward impulse leg. A potential crash could also severely disrupt the long-anticipated altcoin season , stalling momentum across the broader crypto market. Analyst Sets Bitcoinâ€™s Next ATH Target Bitcoin has ignited fresh optimism over the past week following its latest price surge above $123,000 . Despite pulling back to its current price above $118,000, a market expert identified as â€˜The Crypto Professorâ€™ on X predicts that the flagship cryptocurrency is gearing up for a fresh all-time high. The Crypto Professor has set Bitcoinâ€™s next ATH target at $129,948, coinciding with the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level. With BTC now trading at $118,612, this would represent a solid 9.6% price gain. Notably, the analystâ€™s chart shows previous consolidation zones around the $110,000 and $100,000 region, matching the Fibonacci Retracement levels of 1 and 0.786. These levels now serve as potential support zones in the event of a retest.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/a-50-crash-for-bitcoin/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO","Bitcoin|Altcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Professor|Elliot Wave Theory|Fibonacci Extension Level|Tony Severino",cryptocompare

Its relative strength index is sitting at 64.04â€”well above neutral, but not yet in overbought territory. Thatâ€™s a good sign for bulls hoping for more upside without triggering a correction too soon. Volume Spikes Add Fuel To Momentum Traders are now watching the $0.038 level closely. Thatâ€™s just below the Fibonacci 1.618 extension, which sits at $0.03846. If PENGU manages to break above it, more traders could jump in, especially with the derivatives side already heating up. More than 38 million PENGU tokens were exchanged in the past 24 hours, underpinning the strength of the move. The bullish configuration is also aided by support levels near the 0.786 Fib, 0.618, and 0.5 regions. These are areas where buyers have intervened in the past, and they might do the same if prices retract. There are no signs of bearish divergence on the RSI, and each dip has been followed by quick recoveries. That keeps the overall trend in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Too Pricey?
