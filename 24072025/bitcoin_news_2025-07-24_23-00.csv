2025-07-24T20:40:23,"Donald Trump Fed: Bold Demand for Lower Interest Rates Unleashes Economic Debate","BitcoinWorld Donald Trump Fed: Bold Demand for Lower Interest Rates Unleashes Economic Debate The intersection of politics and monetary policy often sends ripples through global markets, and for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is paramount. When Donald Trump Fed interactions become public, especially regarding critical issues like interest rates, the implications can be profound, shaping everything from bond yields to Bitcoin’s volatility. Recently, a direct encounter between former President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has ignited fresh debate, highlighting the persistent tension between political desires and central bank independence. This pivotal meeting at the Federal Reserve headquarters saw Trump express a clear preference for lower interest rates, a move that could significantly influence the economic landscape and, by extension, the crypto market. What Sparked Donald Trump’s Fed Visit and His Demands? In a move that underscored his characteristic directness, former U.S. President Donald Trump Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve headquarters with a clear message: he wants lower interest rates. This encounter, as reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, was more than just a courtesy call; it was a direct expression of presidential economic philosophy. Upon his arrival, Trump reportedly questioned the substantial $3.1 billion cost of renovating the Fed headquarters, to which Powell allegedly responded with a simple shake of his head. This exchange quickly escalated, with Trump remarking that he generally fires managers of projects that exceed their budgets, setting a confrontational tone for the subsequent discussion on monetary policy. This visit reignited discussions about the delicate balance between executive influence and the Fed’s mandated independence, a principle designed to shield monetary policy from short-term political pressures and ensure long-term economic stability. The Crucial Call for Lower Interest Rates: Why It Matters for Donald Trump Fed Policy President Trump’s demand for lower interest rates isn’t merely a casual suggestion; it represents a significant economic stance with far-reaching implications for the U.S. and global economies. Historically, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging investment, spending, and economic growth. This can lead to increased job creation and a more vibrant economic environment. For instance, businesses might expand operations, consumers might take out more loans for homes or cars, and the government’s cost of servicing its national debt could decrease. However, they also carry risks, such as fueling inflation if the economy overheats, or creating asset bubbles as investors chase higher returns in a low-yield environment. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are particularly interesting. Periods of lower interest rates and increased liquidity in the financial system have often coincided with increased investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. When traditional safe-haven returns, like those from bonds or savings accounts, diminish, investors tend to seek higher yields elsewhere. This “search for yield” can drive capital into alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, the future direction of Donald Trump Fed policy, especially concerning rates, becomes a key factor for crypto investors to watch. A consistent push for lower rates could potentially create a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop for digital assets, making alternative investments more appealing as the opportunity cost of holding cash increases. Navigating the Budget Battles: A Key Aspect of Donald Trump Fed Discussions Beyond the interest rate debate, the discussion surrounding the Federal Reserve’s $3.1 billion headquarters renovation cost added another layer of intrigue to the Donald Trump Fed meeting. Trump’s questioning of this expenditure and his subsequent comment about firing managers of over-budget projects highlight a broader theme of fiscal scrutiny that often characterizes his approach to governance. This perspective, while applied to building costs, reflects a mindset that could influence broader economic policy. For example, a focus on reducing government spending or ensuring efficiency in public projects could align with a desire for a more streamlined economy. It also serves as a reminder that even seemingly bureaucratic details can become points of political contention, reflecting a populist appeal to fiscal responsibility. The Fed’s operational budget, while separate from its monetary policy decisions, is still subject to public and political scrutiny. A $3.1 billion renovation project, especially for a public institution, can easily become a lightning rod for criticism, particularly from those advocating for tighter government spending. Trump’s comments underscore a desire for accountability and efficient use of taxpayer money, even if the Fed primarily funds itself through its operations rather than direct congressional appropriations. This particular exchange paints a vivid picture of Trump’s managerial style and his readiness to challenge established norms, even within institutions designed for independence. The Delicate Balance: Understanding Federal Reserve Independence and Donald Trump Fed Interactions The Federal Reserve operates with a significant degree of independence from political influence, a design enshrined in its structure to allow it to make monetary policy decisions based on economic data rather than short-term political cycles or election considerations. This independence is crucial for maintaining stability and credibility in financial markets, preventing policies that could lead to hyperinflation or economic instability due to political expediency. However, presidential pressure on the Fed is not unprecedented; various administrations have, to varying degrees, expressed their preferences regarding monetary policy. Yet, Trump’s direct and public demands have often been more pronounced and frequent than those of his predecessors, pushing the boundaries of traditional decorum. The interaction between Donald Trump Fed Chairman Powell underscores this ongoing tension. Powell, appointed by Trump himself, has often had to navigate a challenging path, balancing his commitment to the Fed’s independent mandate with the public demands of the executive branch. This dynamic is a critical aspect of U.S. economic governance, influencing everything from bond yields to the perceived stability of the dollar, and indirectly, the broader financial landscape that impacts assets like cryptocurrencies. The integrity of the Fed’s independence is vital for investor confidence, as it signals that monetary policy will be guided by economic fundamentals rather than political whims, providing a more predictable environment for long-term planning and investment. Potential Economic Impacts and Market Reactions to Donald Trump Fed Policy Shifts Should the Federal Reserve heed calls for lower interest rates, or even just face persistent pressure that subtly influences its decisions, the economic ripple effects could be substantial. Lower rates could stimulate borrowing and investment, potentially boosting economic growth and employment. However, they also carry risks, such as exacerbating inflation, encouraging excessive risk-taking, or creating asset bubbles in real estate or equity markets. For markets, including the volatile cryptocurrency space, such shifts in monetary policy expectations are closely watched. Investors might interpret a dovish Fed stance as a signal to move into riskier assets, potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies as the yield on safer investments becomes less attractive. Conversely, any perceived erosion of the Fed’s independence could introduce uncertainty, leading to market volatility. A central bank seen as bowing to political pressure might lose credibility, which could have detrimental effects on currency stability and investor confidence. The direct nature of Donald Trump Fed discussions ensures that these potential shifts remain a central topic for analysts and investors alike, as they gauge the future trajectory of the U.S. economy and its global implications. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed investment decisions, especially in asset classes highly sensitive to liquidity and interest rate environments. The Dual-Edged Sword of Lower Interest Rates While the prospect of lower interest rates often sounds appealing, especially to borrowers and those seeking to stimulate economic growth, it’s essential to understand the full spectrum of their effects. Here’s a quick look at the common arguments: Potential Benefits Potential Risks Stimulates economic growth by encouraging borrowing and spending. Can lead to higher inflation if demand outstrips supply. Reduces the cost of debt for businesses and consumers. May encourage excessive risk-taking and asset bubbles (e.g., in real estate, stocks, or even cryptocurrencies). Can make exports more competitive by weakening the domestic currency. Reduces returns on savings accounts and fixed-income investments, hurting savers. Increases the attractiveness of riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Could lead to over-indebtedness if borrowing becomes too easy. Key Considerations for Investors: Interest Rate Sensitivity: Understand how changes in interest rates can affect different asset classes, particularly cryptocurrencies, which often thrive in environments of abundant liquidity. Inflationary Pressures: Monitor inflation data closely, as lower rates can sometimes contribute to rising prices, impacting purchasing power and real returns. Central Bank Independence: Keep a vigilant eye on the political discourse surrounding the Fed. Its perceived independence is a cornerstone of market stability and can influence investor confidence. Global Economic Interconnectedness: Recognize that U.S. monetary policy has profound global ramifications, impacting international trade, capital flows, and the strength of other currencies, which in turn affects global markets. In conclusion, the recent interaction between former President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding interest rates and budget oversight is a potent reminder of the intricate relationship between political leadership and independent economic institutions. Trump’s direct demands for lower interest rates, coupled with his critique of the Fed’s renovation costs, highlight his consistent approach to economic policy, often prioritizing growth stimulation and fiscal accountability. While the Federal Reserve maintains its independence, such high-profile encounters inevitably shape public discourse and market expectations. For those navigating the complexities of the financial world, particularly in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency space, understanding these dynamics is not just academic; it’s essential for informed decision-making. The ongoing dialogue between political power and monetary policy will continue to be a defining feature of the economic landscape, with profound implications for investors, the broader economy, and the future trajectory of digital assets. Summary of Key Takeaways: Direct Presidential Pressure: Donald Trump’s visit to the Fed headquarters involved direct demands for lower interest rates and scrutiny of renovation costs, signaling a hands-on approach to economic policy. Monetary Policy Implications: Lower rates could stimulate the economy but also carry inflation risks, impacting asset classes like cryptocurrencies by making them potentially more attractive in a low-yield environment. Fed Independence Under Scrutiny: The interaction highlights the ongoing tension between political desires and the Federal Reserve’s crucial independence, a cornerstone of stable financial markets. Economic and Market Sensitivity: Markets closely watch such interactions for signals on future monetary policy, influencing investor sentiment, asset allocation, and the overall economic outlook. Fiscal Scrutiny: The debate over the Fed’s renovation budget underscores a broader theme of accountability in public spending, reflecting a consistent aspect of Trump’s economic philosophy.

2025-07-24T20:38:00,"ChatGPT’s 42-Indicator BTC Analysis Flags Key $120K Test Amid Altseason Uncertainty","ChatGPT’s AI model processed 42 live indicators, revealing consolidation momentum as Bitcoin holds at $118,688 following a historic $123,091 ATH achieved on July 14 , with a minimal daily movement of -0.06%, testing whether smart money accumulation overcomes emerging altseason rotation. The market cap remains at $2.37 trillion, with institutional validation through Genius Group’s 200 BTC acquisition, which targets a 10,000-BTC treasury, as Goldman Sachs and BNY launch tokenized money funds. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, institutional treasury developments, altseason implications, and smart money positioning to assess BTC’s 90-day trajectory amid a key inflection between continued dominance and altcoin rotation acceleration. Technical Consolidation: Historic High Pause Creates Decision Point Bitcoin’s current price of $118,688 reflects a minimal 0.06% daily movement, representing healthy consolidation after reaching a historic all-time high of $123,091 on July 14 . The $2,347 intraday range represents 2.0% of the current price, demonstrating controlled volatility typical of institutional accumulation phases. Source: TradingView RSI at a healthy 63.83 provides optimal reading with room for continued appreciation without overbought concerns, suggesting sustainable consolidation rather than trend exhaustion. This technical reset creates a foundation for the next major move while maintaining bullish structure above all EMAs. Source: TradingView MACD indicators exhibit a concerning divergence, with the line at -141.12 below zero, despite a positive histogram at 2,895.80 , creating mixed signals that require careful monitoring. The divergence suggests a potential momentum shift, while the histogram indicates building pressure for directional resolution. Altseason Looming: Dominance Shift Threatens BTC Leadership Bitcoin’s market dominance at 61.64% faces pressure from emerging altseason dynamics as institutional capital explores high-performance blockchain alternatives. Source: TradingView The dominance level near multi-year highs creates vulnerability to rotation as altcoins demonstrate superior performance metrics. Altseason Index holding above 44 indicators potential capital flow from Bitcoin toward altcoin alternatives offering higher growth potential. Source: Coinglass This rotation pattern has historically preceded a strong decline in BTC dominance as institutions diversify beyond Bitcoin-only strategies toward broader crypto exposure. Smart Money Accumulation: Institutions Drive Treasury Expansion Despite altseason uncertainty, institutional treasury adoption accelerates, with Genius Group boosting its holdings to 200 Bitcoin while targeting an ambitious 10,000-BTC treasury accumulation. This aggressive institutional strategy demonstrates a sophisticated long-term position that transcends market rotation concerns. The launch of tokenized money funds by Goldman Sachs and BNY represents the mainstream financial infrastructure’s embrace of cryptocurrency technology. Japanese AI companies are targeting 3,000 BTC treasury allocations, and UK firms raising $135 million for Bitcoin strategies demonstrate a global momentum in institutional adoption. Quantum Computing Threat: Long-term Security Concerns Emerge Emerging quantum computing developments pose a potential long-term security risk, with 7 million Bitcoin potentially vulnerable within a 3-year timeline . This technological threat creates underlying uncertainty for institutional adoption strategies requiring multi-decade security assurance. While the quantum threat remains distant, institutional treasury managers must consider technological evolution in their long-term allocation decisions. Security concerns could accelerate the development of quantum-resistant alternatives, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. Market Dynamics: Ancient Wallet Activity and Institutional Flows The ancient Bitcoin wallet activation , after 14.5 years, involves moving 3,962 BTC worth $468 million, demonstrating long-term holder distribution patterns. These historic movements typically indicate cycle maturation rather than bearish sentiment among original adopters. The wallet’s cost basis of $0.37 per Bitcoin in January 2011 versus the current $118,688 price represents an extraordinary 32,000,000% appreciation, validating Bitcoin’s long-term store-of-value thesis for institutional adoption consideration. Support & Resistance: EMA Structure Maintains Bullish Framework Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $117,103 , reinforced by 20-day EMA support at $115,993 . The exceptional EMA positioning, with the price above all major moving averages, confirms the success of institutional accumulation despite the consolidation phase. Source: TradingView Major support extends through the 50-day EMA at $111,273 and the 100-day EMA at $105,992 , providing multiple safety nets during any correction periods. This support structure appeals to institutional risk management, which requires defined downside protection. Key resistance begins at today’s high around $119,450 , followed by psychological resistance at $120,000-$121,000 . Breaking above this zone would indicate continuation toward major resistance at $125,000-$130,000, representing the next institutional milestone targets. Social Sentiment: Dominance Spike Suggests Caution Bitcoin’s social dominance, reaching 43.06% during its recent all-time high achievement, represents a concerning retail FOMO indicator. Historical analysis reveals that spikes in social dominance often precede short-term corrections, particularly when retail participation peaks. Community sentiment at 80% positive, with declining engagement metrics, reflects typical consolidation-phase behavior while maintaining institutional confidence in the long-term adoption thesis. Professional investors recognize social dominance peaks as opportunities for distribution. This is perhabs one of the biggest bullish catalyst for $BTC I've seen in a while.

These developments provide institutional confidence for continued Bitcoin treasury allocation. Tokenized money market funds by Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon could lead a shift toward real-time asset mobility and programmable finance. #goldmansachs #bny #rwa https://t.co/lWdln2hRe9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 23, 2025 Societe Generale’s entry into making markets in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs demonstrates the European institutional embrace of cryptocurrency trading infrastructure. This regulatory progress supports sustained institutional adoption, regardless of short-term altseason dynamics. 90-Day BTC Price Forecast Institutional Momentum Continuation (Bull Case – 45% Probability) A successful $120K breakout, combined with continued treasury adoption, could drive appreciation toward $130,000-$140,000 , representing a 10-18% upside. This scenario requires institutional accumulation overcoming altseason rotation pressures with sustained volume confirmation. Source: TradingView Technical targets include $125K , $130K , and $140K based on institutional flow projections and treasury adoption momentum. The infrastructure development could attract additional conservative capital seeking digital store-of-value exposure. Altseason Rotation Impact (Base Case – 40% Probability) Extended consolidation between $115K-$125K could persist through Q3 2025 as capital rotates toward altcoin alternatives during institutional diversification. This scenario allows for a decline in dominance while maintaining structural support. Source: TradingView Support at the EMA cluster around $111K-$116K would likely hold during rotation, with volume declining toward 50-60 billion daily. This sideways action presents an opportunity for altcoin appreciation while preserving Bitcoin’s institutional foundation. Dominance Breakdown (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below the $115K support level could trigger a deeper correction, potentially targeting the $105K-$110K range , representing an 11-17% downside. This scenario would require strong institutional demand disappointment or accelerated altseason momentum. Source: TradingView The strong treasury adoption backdrop limits extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $105K-$110K providing a foundation for recovery during continued institutional validation cycles. BTC Forecast: Digital Gold Meets Institutional Evolution Bitcoin’s current positioning reflects the convergence of historic achievement, institutional treasury adoption, and emerging altseason uncertainty. The 42- indicator analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency is at a key juncture between continued dominance and diversification pressure. Next Price Target: $125,000-$130,000 Within 90 Days The immediate trajectory requires a decisive breakout above $120K resistance to validate continued institutional dominance over altseason rotation. From there, treasury adoption momentum could propel Bitcoin toward the $125K psychological milestone, with sustained institutional flows driving it toward $130K-$140K, representing new cycle highs. However, failure to break the $120K resistance would indicate extended consolidation in the $115K-$118K range as altseason rotation accelerates, creating an optimal institutional accumulation opportunity before the next treasury adoption wave drives Bitcoin toward $150K+ targets, validating the digital gold thesis.

2025-07-24T20:00:47,"Bold Forecast: Bitcoin Headed For $1 Million In The Long-Term, Says Fundstrat’s Co-Founder","Bitcoin has become a major topic of the day among several prominent figures and businesses in the crypto and financial sectors. While continuously flagged digital gold, the crypto king is predicted by many popular figures to reach the $1 million price mark in the following years. A Bitcoin Million-Dollar Moment Imminent After a period of steady upward movement that led to a new all-time high of $122,000, Bitcoin appears to have slowed down, now hovering near $117,000. BTC may have slowed down, but veteran market strategist and co-founder of Fundstrat Capital, Tom Lee , has rekindled optimism in the cryptocurrency market with a daring forecast. Tom Lee offered his bold prediction for BTC in a recent interview with CoinDesk. In the interview shared by Trending Bitcoin on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the chairman was seen predicting that BTC’s value could soar to the $1 million price mark. Even though this forecast is expected to occur in the long term, some still consider the price level a daring and overly optimistic target for the digital asset. However, the founder remains unmoved or unhinged by this skepticism, stating that he is an adamant fan of the crypto leader. Lee’s robust optimism toward Bitcoin is strengthened by the fact that the flagship asset is turning out to be the ultimate form of trust in the financial landscape. He also reiterated that Bitcoin is digital gold, reflecting its potential to match Gold, the current largest asset in the world. According to Lee, Bitcoin, easily being considered digital gold , is likely to attract a market value similar to Gold. Gold’s market cap is now valued at a whopping $23 trillion, putting it at the top of the financial hierarchy. With BTC matching the market cap of Gold, Lee is confident that the crypto asset’s price should be worth $1 million in the following years. Another key factor to drive BTC’s value remarkably higher is the future businesses that can be created on the network. Lee stated that many future businesses can be built on the leading network because of its stability. $1 Million Value For BTC After New Act Tatiana Koffman, a seasoned investor, author, and creator of the weekly newsletter MythOfMoney, has also predicted that Bitcoin might surge to the $1 million mark. In an interview with Schwab Network, Koffman expressed her strong belief in the asset hitting this level, while pointing to the Bitcoin Act. According to the seasoned investor, the United States government is expected to purchase BTC steadily into its reserves following the Act. Also, Koffman believes that this move is likely to be adopted by other countries and corporations to create their treasury assets. As a result of this significant nationwide adoption, the investor contends that BTC could be worth between $500,000 and $1 million in the long term. Speaking on the major drivers, Koffman has highlighted BTC’s limited supply. With only 21 million in circulation, she stated that the Bitcoin Act will allow the US government to buy about 200,000 BTC each year, thereby limiting supply and pushing prices higher.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-headed-for-1-million/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|BITCOIN Act|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|coindesk|digital gold|Fundstrat Capital|gold|MythOfMoney|Schwab Network|Tatiana Koffman|Tom Lee|US government",cryptocompare
2025-07-24T20:00:10,"Bitcoin LTHs Start Distributing: CDD Ratio Hits Historic Levels","Bitcoin has remained trapped in a tight range between $115K and $120K for the past 10 days, signaling an extended phase of price compression. With bulls unable to push the price above the $120,000 resistance, analysts are increasingly warning that a correction may be imminent. The coming days are expected to be decisive, as both technical and on-chain fundamentals point to a potential surge in volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Adoption Accelerates As Daily Transactions Set 2025 Record According to data from CryptoQuant, a key long-term metric—the Monthly Cumulative Days Destroyed (CDD) to Yearly CDD ratio—has reached an anomalously high level of 0.25. This is occurring within the $106,000 to $118,000 price range, a zone that has seen heavy long-term holder activity. Historically, similar CDD spikes were observed during the 2014 macro peak and the 2019 corrective phase, both of which marked periods of intense market distribution. This unusual on-chain behavior reflects heightened movement of long-dormant coins, suggesting that experienced holders may be taking profits at current levels. While this doesn’t confirm an immediate trend reversal, it reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s current consolidation is a critical inflection point—one that could either lead to renewed upside or trigger a deeper correction if bulls fail to regain momentum soon. Long-Term Holders Begin Distributing, But Rally Still Intact Top analyst Axel Adler has shared insights highlighting a key shift in Bitcoin market behavior: the sharp rise in the Monthly CDD to Yearly CDD ratio indicates that long-term holders (LTHs) are beginning to actively move dormant coins back into circulation. Historically, such elevated CDD levels have marked periods of heightened activity from experienced investors, often signaling a distribution phase where profits are realized after prolonged holding. These spikes are significant because they suggest that coins held for years are now re-entering the market. According to Adler, this kind of activity isn’t random—it typically comes from holders with deep market knowledge who recognize potential turning points. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the rally is over. While it may cap short-term upside and introduce volatility, current macro and institutional trends provide a solid counterbalance. Treasury demand remains strong, and Bitcoin ETF inflows are still flowing steadily, acting as a buffer against excessive downward pressure. This structural support is crucial in maintaining overall bullish momentum, even as some distribution unfolds.

Price action remains compressed between the $115,724 key support and the $122,077 resistance level. After a strong impulse earlier this month, momentum has clearly cooled, with BTC now oscillating within this horizontal channel for over 10 days. Notably, the price is currently hovering near $118,500—right around the 50-period moving average (blue), which has acted as dynamic support since early July. The 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) moving averages remain well below the current price, indicating that the broader trend remains bullish despite the pause in upward movement. Related Reading: Ethereum Big-Money Flow Hits 3-Year High With $100B In Weekly Volume However, volume has steadily declined during this consolidation phase, signaling indecision and a potential lack of conviction among buyers at current levels. A breakout above $122,000 could renew bullish momentum, opening the door for a run toward new highs, while a breakdown below $115,700 would expose BTC to deeper retracement levels, likely targeting the 100 MA near $109,800.

2025-07-24T20:00:02,"Bitcoin Flashing Rare and Historically Bullish Signal, According to Analytics Firm – Here’s the Outlook","Bitcoin ( BTC ) possesses more upside potential even as it sits just below the record high reached mid this month, according to crypto analytics platform Swissblock. The analytics platform says that while Bitcoin is hovering close to the all-time high, the risk posed to the crypto king by the broader economic trends and global financial conditions remains low. Swissblock says the low macro risk is a “rare and historically bullish” signal for the flagship crypto asset. According to Swissblock, the reason Bitcoin has enjoyed only a slight uptick over the last couple of days is due to the fact that “bulls are not bidding aggressively.” “They’re waiting for volatility.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is trading at $117,589 at time of writing. The analytics platform says that Bitcoin could appreciate by around 17% from the current level before the short-term holders of the crypto king find themselves underwater based on the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis Model. “Short-Term Holders are active but not overheated. Profit-taking is present, but the Short-Term Holder risk zone (approximately $138,000) hasn’t been reached. This suggests there’s still room for expansion before we see any panic selling or euphoria.” Source: Swissblock/X According to Swissblock, the bullish cycle for Bitcoin has not ended despite altcoins outperforming over the short term. “BTC is acting as the structural anchor, not the explosive leader. The bid is rotating into Ethereum, Solana, and high-impulse altcoins. BTC holds. Altcoins move. The cycle isn’t ending.

2025-07-24T19:59:00,"Solana Price Prediction: Analyst Calls for $500 Breakout – How Quickly Can it Happen?","As SOL retreats by 6% in the past 24 hours, a top-ranked trader at Bybit has shared a bullish Solana price prediction that could deliver sizable gains to those who take advantage of this dip. Crypto trader Christiaan, a DeFi investor and official partner for the large crypto exchange, believes that Solana still has much more to give as this bullish cycle is only getting started. $SOL is ready for a massive pump. Targeting $400-$450 for this bull run. pic.twitter.com/gYc6AmBBOt — Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) July 21, 2025 In an X post he shared earlier this week, Christiaan sees an uptrend forming that could initially boost the price to $300 and then to $400+ after a brief pullback. This means that SOL could soon make its second all-time high of this year, following the footsteps of Bitcoin (BTC) and officially kicking off altcoin season. The passing of the Genius Act in the United States and Congress’s apparent willingness to also push forward another two key crypto bills have encouraged market participants to believe that this is the dawn of a new era for the industry. Meanwhile, Solana meme coins have also been performing positively lately. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is a remarkable example of this trend as the official meme coin of the NFT project has delivered gains of over 400% in the past 30 days. Other tokens like Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) have also booked gains of 158% and 38% respectively, during this same period. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Could Rise to $245 If This Key Support Holds Looking at the daily chart, we can see that the price has encountered strong resistance upon hitting the $200 psychological threshold. This is expected as early buyers may have set their take-profit orders at this price to cash out from SOL’s latest rally. However, this doesn’t mean the uptrend is over. A key support zone sits between $168 and $170 — a former resistance area that may now be flipping into strong support. A decisive bounce from this level would reinforce a bullish Solana price prediction, with $200 as the first target, followed by $245, and eventually the long-term goal of $500. At the same time, some of the best crypto presales this year are showing potential to outperform even top-tier tokens. One standout is SUBBD (SUBBD), a rising project aiming to revolutionize how creators distribute content across the internet.
