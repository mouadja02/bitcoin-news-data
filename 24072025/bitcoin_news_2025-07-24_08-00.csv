2025-07-24T05:58:43,"Ethereum Spot Volumes Eclipse Bitcoin’s as Altseason Heats Up","First time in over a year, Ethereum spot trading volume is greater than Bitcoin’s, reported CryptoQuant on Wednesday. Last week, ETH spot trading hit $25.7 billion compared to $24.4 billion for Bitcoin, it added, noting that this pushed the ETH/BTC spot volume ratio above 1 for the first time since June 2024. “Investors are rotating to ETH and altcoins,” analysts said. Ethereum Outperforming Bitcoin Ethereum’s price ratio against Bitcoin has surged from 0.018 to 0.031, reaching its highest level since January. This recovery comes after ETH hit extremely undervalued levels earlier this year, the analysts stated. First time in over a year: ETH spot volume > BTC Last week, ETH spot trading hit $25.7B vs. BTC’s $24.4B, pushing the ETH/BTC spot volume ratio above 1 for the first time since June 2024. Investors are rotating to ETH and Altcoins. pic.twitter.com/X7mBFVCg5Y — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 23, 2025 US ETF data also reveals investors are allocating more capital to Ethereum relative to Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ETF holding ratio doubling from 0.05 to 0.12. Additionally, ETH faces less selling pressure than Bitcoin, as measured by lower exchange inflows , suggesting the outperformance trend could continue, they added. CryptoQuant also noted that altcoin spot trading volume surged to the highest level since March, suggesting that a rotation of capital was underway. “The spot trading volume for altcoins totaled $67 billion on July 17, signaling renewed interest from traders for these types of coins.” The CoinGlass “crypto flippening index” reports an increase in flippening potential for ETH versus BTC, although it remains low at 18.5%. However, the metric has climbed from 11.5% in late April when ETH was wallowing around $1,700. Ethereum’s price ratio against Bitcoin has fallen 5.8% in the past 60 hours, commented Santiment on Thursday, predicting a second wave. “If trading and social volume fall the rest of the week, this would be a strong signal that a second bullish wave is coming up due to impatience and profit taking coming from the retail crowd.” Meanwhile, Glassnode commented that altcoins were “showing broad strength following Bitcoin’s lead,” cautioning that surging open interest across the sector “suggests speculative froth may be building, raising the risk of sharper volatility ahead.” Ether Price Retreats Ethereum prices dipped more than 7% from their 2025 high on Monday in a fall below $3,600 in late trading on Wednesday. It is natural for some profit to be taken after a massive 50% rally in just one month, and many analysts predict that Ether will continue higher due to sustained institutional and corporate buying pressure. A number of prominent analysts have predicted a sharp move to $8,000 over the coming months.

2025-07-24T05:53:37,"XRP Tanks 10%, Analysts Say $10–$30 Still in Sight After ‘Healthy Pullback’","The post XRP Tanks 10%, Analysts Say $10–$30 Still in Sight After ‘Healthy Pullback’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is down today, with the global market cap slipping 6% to $3.92 trillion. Bitcoin is holding above the $118K mark with a modest 0.7% dip. However, altcoins faced steeper losses, with Ethereum down 6% and XRP plunging 10%. Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also seen sharp declines, losing between 7-10% over the past 24 hours. XRP Drops 10%, Sees $89 Million In Liquidations Ether, XRP, and Bitcoin traders were hit hard in Tuesday’s crypto sell-off, with Ether seeing the biggest losses at $159 million in the last 24 hours, followed by XRP at $89 million, as liquidations surged across the market. However, even with XRP’s 10% drop, experts believe that this is just a healthy pullback. Analyst XRPunkie points out that XRP has surged 92% in just 20 days, rising from $1.95 to $3.66. According to him, this kind of pullback is a normal and healthy part of crypto market movements. He believes it’s a short-term pause before prices head higher, and a target of $10 to $15 is still very much in play. $XRP went from $1.95 to $3.66, up 92% in 30 days. We just had a 16% pullback. It's a healthy correction. Nothing out of the ordinary in crypto. Sit back, chill and relax. Let it bottom out and we should be on our way to much higher prices real soon. $10-$15 still in play. pic.twitter.com/aUQup1VctA — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 23, 2025 He also believes that $8 is the minimum for XRP, and we should be expecting much more, with a target of $20 to $30 still on the cards. Will XRP Break Above $3.84? Experts believe that XRP could still break past its 2018 high of $3.84 if the broader altcoin rally continues. Bitcoin dominance is slipping, and capital is flowing into altcoins. XRP’s next move will depend on the overall market momentum. CryptoBull points out that XRP is forming a classic Cup & Handle pattern, a bullish setup. If it plays out, the next move could push XRP above $7, based on the pattern’s projected target. XRP Adoption Grows with Strategic Treasury Moves Meanwhile, XRP’s corporate adoption keeps growing. Nature’s Miracle is adding $20M worth of XRP to its treasury, signaling growing confidence in XRP as a tool for balance sheet diversification. The move comes during a market dip, offering a strategic entry point. At the same time, a Brazilian company called VERT launched a $130 million blockchain platform on the XRP Ledger. These moves show that XRP is gaining traction in corporate finance and global infrastructure.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-tanks-10-analysts-say-10-30-still-in-sight-after-healthy-pullback/,"XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-24T05:30:00,"Mara Holdings Plans $1B Note Sale to Buy More Bitcoin","The offering includes $850 million due in 2032 and a $150 million optional extension. The company intends to use the proceeds to repurchase existing debt, execute capped call transactions, buy more Bitcoin, and support general operations. This latest offering follows a $2 billion stock sale plan that was announced earlier this year and the recent acquisition of a minority stake in institutional advisor Two Prime. With 50,000 BTC, Mara is now the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, a growing number of more traditional companies from various industries are adding crypto to their treasuries, though analysts warn of high risks, especially for firms holding altcoins. Mara Ramps Up Bitcoin Push Mara Holdings, one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies, announced that it plans to offer up to $1 billion in convertible senior notes as the next step in its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The offering includes $850 million in notes due in 2032, which will be available to qualified institutional buyers. Additionally, these buyers will have the option to purchase an extra $150 million in principal, bringing the total potential raise to $1 billion. According to the company, a portion of the proceeds—up to $50 million—will be used to repurchase part of its outstanding 1.00% convertible senior notes due in 2026. The remainder of the capital is expected to fund capped call transactions, purchase more Bitcoin, and support general corporate initiatives. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Mara Holdings, and will not bear interest. However, the offer remains subject to prevailing market and other conditions. This means that there is no guarantee the deal will be completed or finalized under the current terms. Press release (Source: MARA Holdings ) This debt offering is the latest in a series of strategic financial maneuvers by the company that are specifically aimed at scaling its Bitcoin reserves and mining operations. In late March, Mara disclosed plans to sell up to $2 billion in stock “from time to time” through agreements with institutional investors, with proceeds primarily used for expanding its Bitcoin holdings. The announcement was also made after the company's recent acquisition of a minority stake in Two Prime , an institutional investment advisor managing $1.75 billion in assets. This deal effectively boosted the amount of Bitcoin managed on Mara’s behalf. Additionally, Mara’s mining operations showed some remarkable growth. The company increased its Bitcoin production by 35% in May despite heightened mining difficulty and rising hashrates. Its annualized mining revenue recently surpassed $752 million, a new record. Mara Bitcoin holdings over time (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Currently, Mara Holdings holds 50,000 BTC , making it the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after Strategy, which holds an industry-leading 607,000 BTC. Crypto Treasuries Rise, But Risks Mount A growing wave of more traditional companies are beginning to incorporate digital assets into their corporate treasury strategies. This is very likely due to the shift in how businesses perceive the role of cryptocurrencies in financial management. This trend gained a lot of momentum, with firms across a wide range of industries—from agriculture to textiles—announcing crypto allocations this week alone. Among them, agricultural technology company Nature’s Miracle revealed that it will allocate up to $20 million to XRP. On the same day, consumer manufacturing firm Upexi disclosed it acquired 83,000 Solana (SOL) tokens, worth approximately $16.7 million, for its corporate reserve. A day earlier, Kitabo , a Japanese company that was founded nearly 80 years ago and known for its work in textiles and recycling, announced plans to purchase around $5.6 million in Bitcoin. Press release from Upexi These moves are part of the broader trend driven by the growing appeal of digital assets as a hedge or diversification strategy in treasury portfolios. Bitcoin is often seen as the anchor asset in this trend, and still attracts attention from publicly listed companies. However, analysts warn that while the allure of digital asset holdings is strong, it still comes with big risks. According to a report from venture capital firm Breed, only a small number of Bitcoin treasury companies are expected to survive long-term. The report warns that even minor declines in Bitcoin’s price could trigger a cascade of forced sales among overleveraged firms, which could lead to a feedback loop of declining prices and reduced access to corporate credit. This “death spiral” scenario is seen as a key systemic risk. Crypto treasury ‘death spiral’ (Source: Breed ) The situation is even more precarious for companies holding altcoins, which often experience extreme drawdowns of up to 90% between cycles and lack the long-term floor that Bitcoin tends to have. These firms could face not only market volatility but also potential investor lawsuits if digital assets underperform or if their traditional financial metrics, like share prices, deteriorate. According to content creator Viktor , altcoins tend to collapse when market momentum fades, while Bitcoin has historically rebounded over time. This distinction may become increasingly important as more companies navigate the uncertain terrain of crypto-based treasury strategies.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10130/mara-holdings-plans-1-b-note-sale-to-buy-more-bitcoin,"BTC|SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Bessent announced details of the trade agreement with Japan. The agreement will implement a new 15% tariff on automobiles and will see Japan create an innovative financing mechanism to provide capital to strategic US industries. He noted that ongoing negotiations with the European Union are progressing slowly due to the “problem of joint action” among the 27 member states. The minister said he hoped to move beyond issues like rare earths and export controls to focus on “bigger discussions” at his meeting with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm. Bessent spoke of the potential for a “big, beautiful rebalancing” where the US focuses on production and China on consumption. He also suggested that a new purchasing agreement similar to the Phase One agreement from the previous administration is possible. Related News: Watch Out: Jim Cramer Spoke About Bitcoin and Ethereum! Will it be Inverse Cramer Again? Bessent stated that he believes the Fed's analysis of the tariffs is “a bit off” and that he sees no price pressure from them. He stated that he believes current Fed Chair Jerome Powell should step down to preserve the institution's independence. He also explained that President Trump's strategy of using high tariffs is aimed at creating “maximum negotiating leverage,” and that his actions, while not always immediately apparent to the market, are part of a plan. *This is not investment advice.

XRP, which was among the top performers until yesterday evening, has plunged by double-digits to a new weekly low. As such, it has caused substantial losses to over-leveraged traders, even more than BTC. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView What goes up, must come down, right? This narrative proved correct for Ripple’s cross-border token, which was in an ‘up only’ mode for over a week. Recall that the asset broke out of its consolidation range ($2.2-$2.3) where it spent a month or so last week and shot up above $3 in days. The bulls kept the pressure on and, after more than seven years, XRP made history by breaking above its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4, and it set a new record at over $3.65. Thus, the cryptocurrency had gained more than 50% in a week or so, and its market cap flew past the $200 billion mark. What followed were a few days of sideways trading between the previous and the latest ATHs. However, the bears took control in the past 12 hours or so, pushing XRP south hard. In a matter of hours, the third-largest cryptocurrency plummeted from almost $3.6 to under $3.05, losing roughly 15% of its value. Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still down by over 11% daily. This sudden but painful drop has resulted in a lot of pain for over-leveraged traders who were long on XRP. Data from CoinGlass shows that XRP longs were liquidated for over $93 million on a daily scale, which is second only to ETH and above BTC’s $70 million. Liquidation Heat Map.

A Delaware bankruptcy court has greenlit the release of $1.9 billion in reserves, paving the way for a new wave of customer distributions. The record date is locked for August 15, with payouts potentially rolling out by September 30, 2025. But it’s not as simple as sitting back and waiting for the money. FTX is enforcing strict KYC and tax verification steps, warning that unverified users won’t receive anything. Distribution Winds Pick Up—But Stay Scam-Aware The released funds stem from a reduction in the reserve for disputed claims, which has now shrunk from $6.5 billion to $4.3 billion. This strategic reallocation follows the disqualification or resolution of several claims, unlocking assets for the next round of disbursements. Funds will be distributed via BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer, each of which will be tasked with processing claims through the FTX Recovery Trust. However, there’s a strong warning from FTX, reminding users that it will never ask them to connect wallets or share private keys, citing an increase in phishing attempts ahead of the payouts. X Reacts: Community Still Frustrated While the development signals progress, the crypto community remains cautious. On X, users shared mixed reactions, with some celebrating the step forward and others still questioning the timeline. That's really good news! At least we shouldn't wait until year-end.

However, no confirmation has been issued about their use, adding another layer of mystery to the recovery plan. FTX Payouts Use 2022 Prices, Sparking Backlash Even though repayments are finally starting, many crypto holders are upset that FTX is using prices from way back in November 2022 to calculate how much people get. That’s a big deal for those who held Bitcoin on the exchange before it collapsed, because since then, BTC has shot up nearly 500%. Right now, Bitcoin is trading under $120K , but the payouts are being calculated using much lower prices from two years ago. For many, that feels like missing out on massive gains. This mismatch is frustrating for investors and may be one reason why Bitcoin’s price dipped slightly today , as people worry about more coins hitting the market and what that could mean for prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-24T05:10:25,"Bitcoin ETF Milestone: Grayscale’s Mini Trust Achieves Remarkable $5 Billion AUM","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Milestone: Grayscale’s Mini Trust Achieves Remarkable $5 Billion AUM The world of cryptocurrency investment is buzzing with excitement, and for good reason. A significant development has recently captured the attention of both seasoned investors and curious newcomers: Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF has achieved a truly remarkable feat, surpassing an astonishing $5 billion in assets under management (AUM) in less than a year since its launch on July 31, 2024. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the growing mainstream acceptance and institutional confidence in the digital asset space, particularly within the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF market. What does this phenomenal growth signify for the future of crypto investments? What is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF and Why Does it Matter? Understanding the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF is key to appreciating this achievement. This particular Bitcoin ETF emerged from Grayscale’s strategic efforts to offer a more streamlined and competitive product in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Launched on July 31, 2024, this trust was designed to provide investors with a straightforward way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. Key aspects that make this Bitcoin ETF significant include: Simplified Access: It allows traditional investors to access Bitcoin through regulated brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of direct crypto purchases and storage. Institutional Backing: As a product from Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, it carries a level of credibility and trust that appeals to institutional and retail investors alike. Diversification Potential: For many, it represents an opportunity to diversify traditional portfolios with digital assets, harnessing Bitcoin’s growth potential. Liquidity and Transparency: Traded on major exchanges, it offers the liquidity and transparency typically associated with traditional exchange-traded funds. The swift accumulation of over $5 billion in AUM underscores a clear demand for regulated, accessible Bitcoin investment vehicles. The Phenomenal Growth of the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The success of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a reflection of a much larger trend: the explosive growth and increasing maturity of the entire Bitcoin ETF landscape. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions has been a game-changer, opening the floodgates for a new wave of capital into the crypto market. This shift marks a pivotal moment for several reasons: Mainstream Adoption: ETFs bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency, making Bitcoin investment accessible to a wider audience, including large institutional players who previously faced regulatory hurdles. Regulatory Clarity: The existence of regulated Bitcoin ETFs provides a level of legitimacy and security that was once missing from the crypto space, fostering greater investor confidence. Reduced Barrier to Entry: Investors no longer need to navigate crypto exchanges, set up digital wallets, or worry about private key management. Investing in a Bitcoin ETF is as simple as buying shares of a stock. This surge in interest and investment through ETF vehicles signals a significant step towards Bitcoin becoming a widely accepted asset class in conventional financial portfolios. Driving Forces Behind the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF’s Success Several powerful factors have converged to propel the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF to its impressive $5 billion AUM milestone. This success is not merely coincidental; it’s a strategic alignment of market dynamics, investor sentiment, and Grayscale’s established presence. Grayscale’s Brand Recognition: As one of the earliest and largest digital asset managers, Grayscale has built significant trust and brand loyalty within the crypto community. Their long-standing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) laid the groundwork for subsequent products like the Mini Trust Bitcoin ETF . Growing Institutional Appetite: Large institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios with digital assets. The regulated structure of an ETF provides the compliance framework they require. Favorable Market Conditions: The period leading up to and following the launch of various spot Bitcoin ETFs has generally seen renewed optimism in the crypto market, driven by factors such as the Bitcoin halving event and increasing global recognition of digital assets. Competitive Offerings: While specific fee structures can vary, the competitive nature of the ETF market often encourages providers to offer attractive terms, which can draw substantial capital from investors seeking efficient exposure. This confluence of factors has created a fertile ground for the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF to thrive, attracting substantial capital from a diverse range of investors eager to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a familiar and regulated investment vehicle. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs? While the success of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF is certainly a cause for celebration, the journey for Bitcoin ETF s and the broader crypto market is far from over. Investors and market watchers alike are keen to understand what the future holds. Potential Opportunities: Product Diversification: We could see an expansion into other crypto-backed ETFs, such as Ethereum ETFs, further broadening the accessibility of digital assets for mainstream investors. Increased Institutional Adoption: As more financial advisors and institutions become comfortable with these products, the flow of capital into Bitcoin ETFs is likely to accelerate. Enhanced Market Liquidity: The growth of ETFs contributes to deeper and more liquid markets for the underlying cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing price volatility over the long term. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: While ETFs bring regulatory clarity, governments worldwide continue to grapple with how best to regulate the crypto space, which could lead to new rules or restrictions. Market Volatility: Bitcoin, despite its growing maturity, remains a volatile asset. Investors in a Bitcoin ETF are still exposed to these price swings. Competition: The ETF market is highly competitive, with multiple providers vying for market share. This could lead to fee wars and pressure on profit margins for asset managers. For investors, the key actionable insight is to stay informed. Understanding the nuances of each Bitcoin ETF , its underlying assets, and the broader market sentiment is crucial for making informed decisions. Beyond the Headlines: Understanding Your Bitcoin ETF Investment The headlines about AUM milestones are exciting, but for individual investors, it’s vital to look beyond the numbers and understand what investing in a Bitcoin ETF truly entails. This isn’t just about riding a trend; it’s about making a well-informed financial decision. Here are a few considerations: Due Diligence is Paramount: Before investing in any Bitcoin ETF , research the specific fund, its expense ratio, tracking error, and the reputation of the issuer. Risk Management: Understand that while an ETF simplifies access, it doesn’t eliminate the inherent risks of investing in a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment aligns with a long-term ‘hodling’ strategy or if you are looking for shorter-term trading opportunities. Portfolio Allocation: Consider how a Bitcoin ETF fits into your overall investment portfolio. It might be part of a diversified strategy rather than a primary holding. The rise of products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF offers unprecedented opportunities for mainstream investors to engage with digital assets. However, prudent decision-making, informed by thorough research and a clear understanding of risks, remains essential. The remarkable achievement of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF, reaching over $5 billion in AUM in under a year, is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a powerful symbol of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and integration into the traditional financial system. This success story highlights the increasing demand for accessible, regulated investment vehicles that bridge the gap between digital assets and conventional portfolios. As the Bitcoin ETF market continues to mature, it promises to unlock new avenues for investors, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate and compelling asset class. This is an exciting era for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, ushering in a new chapter of digital asset adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF , or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency itself. 2. How does the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF differ from GBTC? The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF is a newer, potentially more cost-efficient product spun off from the larger Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). While both provide exposure to Bitcoin, the Mini Trust was designed to offer a competitive option in the evolving spot Bitcoin ETF market, often with different fee structures or operational specifics compared to its predecessor. 3. What are the benefits of investing in a Bitcoin ETF? Key benefits include simplified access to Bitcoin for traditional investors, enhanced liquidity compared to direct crypto holdings, regulatory oversight providing a sense of security, and the convenience of trading through existing brokerage accounts without needing to manage private keys or crypto wallets. 4. What are the risks associated with Bitcoin ETFs? Despite their benefits, Bitcoin ETF s are still subject to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin’s price. Other risks include regulatory changes, potential tracking errors between the ETF’s price and Bitcoin’s spot price, and the general risks associated with market fluctuations in the cryptocurrency sector. 5. Is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF suitable for all investors? No. While it offers simplified access, a Bitcoin ETF is still an investment in a volatile asset. It may be suitable for investors who understand the risks of cryptocurrency, seek portfolio diversification, and prefer a regulated investment vehicle. It is not recommended for those with a low-risk tolerance or who are unfamiliar with digital asset markets. 6. How do I invest in a Bitcoin ETF? To invest in a Bitcoin ETF like the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, you would typically use a traditional brokerage account, similar to buying shares of a stock. You can place an order for the ETF’s ticker symbol through your broker’s platform.

2025-07-24T05:03:59,"XRP Price Prediction For July 24","The post XRP Price Prediction For July 24 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently showing signs of weakness after its recent rally, and technical signals show that the token could be preparing for a deeper pullback. While the price remains above important support levels, chart patterns and broader market conditions are flashing early warning signs. Bearish Divergence on the Weekly Chart On the weekly timeframe, a bearish divergence is forming. While XRP’s price has made higher highs, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is printing lower highs. This kind of divergence is often a hint that momentum is slowing down. Although this signal hasn’t been confirmed yet, if it does in the coming weeks or months, XRP may face a stronger correction. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, support lies around the $3.00 mark, while the next major resistance is between $4.60 and $4.70. These zones are based on Fibonacci levels, which are commonly used to predict where prices could reverse. Daily Chart Shows Breakdown Signs On the daily chart, XRP is struggling to hold the $3.30–$3.40 range, which recently acted as strong support. If the price closes below $3.30 and fails to recover, this could confirm a bearish shift in short-term trend. In that case, XRP may head toward $3.00 or even $2.95. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around $2.95 is a critical support area during market corrections. If this level holds, XRP could bounce. But if the price drops below $2.75 and then $2.65, a retest of April’s lows becomes possible. Broader Market Impact XRP is not alone. Ethereum is facing resistance and showing short-term bearish divergence, while Bitcoin struggles to break higher. Bitcoin dominance has also ticked upward, often a bearish signal for altcoins. This overall market pressure is affecting XRP’s outlook in the near term. For now, XRP needs to hold above $2.75 to keep hopes of a continued rally alive. If it manages to reclaim $3.36, the correction might be over.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-july-24/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-24T05:00:59,"Are Traders Walking Into a Bitcoin Bull Trap at $118K? Here’s What the Data Shows","Bitcoin’s recent price action reflects a consolidation phase rather than a decisive move in either direction. After briefly touching an all-time high of over $123,000 earlier this month, BTC has seen a gradual pullback, currently trading around $118,000 at the time of writing. This represents a 1.1% drop in the last 24 hours and a 3.9% decline from its peak, as traders evaluate whether the current market structure suggests a continuation or a correction. According to new insights from CryptoQuant contributors, indicators present a split narrative. Some metrics suggest rising optimism among traders, while others indicate a more cautious and holding-focused environment. Related Reading: Trump Shares Viral Bitcoin Breakdown — Here’s What He Posted Surge in Long Positions Raises Contrarian Concerns CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest highlighted a notable spike in the long/short sentiment ratio on Binance, showing a growing preference among traders for long positions. This metric, which tracks the volume of long versus short positions on the exchange, has tilted significantly bullish within the $116,000–$120,000 price range. He noted that during Bitcoin’s previous consolidation between $100,000 and $110,000, sentiment leaned toward short positions, a setup that preceded a breakout to the upside and a wave of short liquidations. This time, however, the environment has flipped. BorisVest explained: Now that sentiment is skewed heavily toward longs, the same principle could apply in reverse. When the majority positions in one direction, it often creates a setup for the opposite move. The current range is acting as a trap zone, where traders’ expectations are repeatedly tested. The historical tendency for sentiment extremes to precede contrary price action has prompted some analysts to advise caution, suggesting that growing bullish bias could lead to a temporary reversal if met with enough liquidity pressure. Bitcoin Exchange Flow Patterns Reflect Investor Patience While Binance sentiment data leans bullish, another key on-chain indicator paints a different picture. CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain examined the Bitcoin Flow Pulse (IFP) indicator, which tracks BTC movements to centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Support For $180,000 Year-End Target, Analyst Says According to the data, despite Bitcoin’s recent high above $120,000, there has not been a corresponding spike in exchange inflows, suggesting that investors are not rushing to take profits or exit the market. This behavior contrasts with historical cycles in 2017 and 2021, where price peaks were accompanied by large exchange inflows and followed by corrections. Arab Chain wrote: The market now shows a consolidating trend, with reduced selling pressure. The low flow to exchanges indicates confidence among holders and suggests that many participants are expecting the uptrend to continue. Still, he cautioned that a shift in the IFP indicator, such as a sudden rise in exchange flows, could act as an early warning for increased supply pressure.

2025-07-24T05:00:09,"Goldman Sachs Partners With BNY Mellon To Bring $7 Trillion Money Market To Crypto","The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain . The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. Blockchain Integration to Expand MMF Utility The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. A Step Toward Collateral Utility and Global Scalability Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.
