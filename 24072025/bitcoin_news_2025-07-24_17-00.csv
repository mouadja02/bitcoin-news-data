2025-07-24T14:55:20,"Ethereum Acquisition: BitMine’s Bold $4.5 Billion Move Reshapes Crypto Investment","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Acquisition: BitMine’s Bold $4.5 Billion Move Reshapes Crypto Investment In a move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape, Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company, BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), has significantly amplified its commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. Announcing a staggering increase in its at-the-market (ATM) offering from an initial $2 billion to an impressive $4.5 billion, BitMine is setting its sights on a massive Ethereum acquisition . This strategic pivot, detailed in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on July 24, signals a bold new chapter for the company and highlights the evolving dynamics within the digital asset space. For investors, enthusiasts, and market watchers alike, this development raises crucial questions: What does this colossal capital raise mean for BitMine? Why is a prominent Bitcoin miner shifting gears to focus on Ethereum? And what could be the broader implications for the crypto market? Let’s delve deep into BitMine’s ambitious strategy and explore the potential ripple effects of this monumental Ethereum acquisition . Ethereum Acquisition: Unpacking BitMine’s Ambitious Strategy BitMine Immersion Technologies, primarily known for its robust Bitcoin mining operations, is making a clear statement about its long-term vision. The decision to more than double its capital raise specifically for the purpose of acquiring additional Ethereum (ETH) is a testament to the company’s belief in Ethereum’s foundational value and future growth potential. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it’s a significant reorientation of capital that underscores a strategic diversification play. Traditionally, Bitcoin miners have focused almost exclusively on BTC. However, as the crypto market matures and various blockchain ecosystems evolve, companies like BitMine are exploring new avenues for growth and risk mitigation. The shift towards a substantial Ethereum acquisition could be driven by several factors: Diversification: Spreading investment across different leading cryptocurrencies can reduce reliance on a single asset’s performance, potentially stabilizing revenue streams and mitigating market-specific risks. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications, offers a wide array of opportunities for value appreciation beyond simple price speculation. Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): With Ethereum’s successful transition to PoS (The Merge), the network’s energy consumption has drastically reduced, making it more appealing from an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) perspective, and potentially opening doors for staking rewards. This substantial capital infusion via the ATM offering will enable BitMine to execute its Ethereum acquisition on a scale that few traditional mining companies have attempted, positioning them as a major holder of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Mechanics Behind the Capital Raise: What is an ATM Offering? Understanding how BitMine plans to fund this massive Ethereum acquisition is crucial. An At-The-Market (ATM) offering is a flexible and cost-effective method for publicly traded companies to raise capital by selling new shares directly into the open market at prevailing market prices. Unlike traditional underwritten offerings, ATMs allow companies to raise funds incrementally over time, giving them greater control and flexibility. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects of an ATM offering: Flexibility: Companies can choose when and how much stock to sell, allowing them to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Cost-Effectiveness: Lower underwriting fees compared to traditional offerings, reducing the overall cost of capital. Market Price Execution: Shares are sold at current market prices, minimizing dilution impact on existing shareholders over a short period, although cumulative sales can still lead to dilution. Transparency: As a public offering, it requires SEC filings, providing transparency to investors about the company’s intentions and financial activities. BitMine’s decision to increase its ATM offering to $4.5 billion signifies a strong strategic intent to accumulate a substantial amount of ETH. This method allows them to acquire Ethereum gradually, potentially mitigating the impact of large single-buy orders on market prices, while continuously raising capital as needed for their Ethereum acquisition strategy. Why Ethereum? Understanding BitMine’s Strategic Rationale While Bitcoin remains the king of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has carved out its own unique and indispensable niche. BitMine’s significant investment in ETH suggests a deep understanding of its long-term value proposition beyond just being a digital currency. Here’s why Ethereum stands out as a compelling asset for such a substantial Ethereum acquisition : Deflationary Mechanics: With EIP-1559 and the Merge, a portion of transaction fees are burned, and new ETH issuance has dramatically decreased. This potentially deflationary supply dynamic can make ETH more scarce and valuable over time. Staking Yields: Post-Merge, ETH holders can stake their assets to secure the network and earn rewards. This provides a passive income stream, making ETH an attractive yield-bearing asset for institutional investors. Dominance in Decentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum is the undisputed leader in smart contract platforms, hosting the vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 projects. This network effect provides inherent value. Future Scalability: Ongoing developments like sharding and Layer 2 solutions aim to significantly enhance Ethereum’s scalability, addressing previous concerns and paving the way for wider adoption. For BitMine, an Ethereum acquisition is not merely about holding a digital asset; it’s about investing in the infrastructure of the decentralized future. It represents a bet on the continued growth and utility of the Ethereum network as a foundational layer for innovation. Potential Market Impact: What Does This Ethereum Acquisition Mean for ETH? A $4.5 billion capital raise earmarked for Ethereum acquisition is a substantial sum, even in the volatile crypto markets. While the funds will likely be deployed over time, such a significant institutional buying interest could have several implications for the price and perception of Ethereum: Increased Buying Pressure: Consistent large-scale buying by an entity like BitMine could provide a steady demand floor for ETH, potentially contributing to price stability or upward momentum, especially during market dips. Enhanced Institutional Confidence: When publicly traded companies make significant, transparent investments in cryptocurrencies, it often signals growing institutional confidence in the asset class. This can encourage other traditional investors to explore similar opportunities. Validation of Ethereum’s Utility: BitMine’s move validates Ethereum not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic investment for a company with a strong understanding of the digital asset space. This could further solidify ETH’s reputation as a blue-chip crypto asset. Market Sentiment Shift: News of major institutional purchases can often trigger positive market sentiment, leading to increased retail interest and further price appreciation. It’s important to note that the actual impact will depend on the timing and pace of BitMine’s ETH purchases, as well as broader market conditions. However, the sheer scale of this planned Ethereum acquisition suggests a significant long-term commitment that could be highly influential. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities of Ethereum Acquisition While the prospect of a multi-billion dollar Ethereum acquisition by BitMine is exciting, it’s also important to consider the inherent challenges and opportunities that come with such a large-scale crypto investment. Challenges: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Even a strategic long-term hold can be subject to significant price swings, impacting the value of BitMine’s ETH holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in policy regarding digital assets could impact the legality or profitability of large-scale holdings. Execution Risk: Deploying $4.5 billion effectively without unduly influencing market prices requires sophisticated trading strategies and careful execution. Competition: As more institutional players enter the crypto space, competition for strategic asset accumulation may increase. Opportunities: Significant Capital Appreciation: If Ethereum continues its growth trajectory, BitMine stands to benefit immensely from the appreciation of its substantial ETH holdings. Staking Revenue: Holding ETH allows BitMine to participate in staking, generating passive income that can further enhance profitability and offset operational costs. Strategic Partnerships: A large ETH holding could open doors for BitMine to engage in strategic partnerships within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as providing infrastructure or participating in decentralized governance. Enhanced Shareholder Value: A successful Ethereum acquisition strategy could lead to increased shareholder value and attract more institutional investors to BMNR stock. BitMine’s move is a calculated risk, balancing the potential for immense rewards against the inherent challenges of the crypto market. Their success will be a closely watched case study for other traditional companies eyeing significant digital asset exposure. BitMine Immersion Technologies’ decision to raise its ATM offering to an unprecedented $4.5 billion for a massive Ethereum acquisition marks a pivotal moment in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. It signifies a profound strategic shift, moving beyond singular focus on Bitcoin mining to embrace the broader potential of the digital asset economy, particularly Ethereum’s burgeoning ecosystem. This bold move by BitMine underscores the growing recognition of Ethereum’s fundamental value, its role in decentralized finance, and its potential as a yield-generating asset. While the path ahead may present its share of market volatility and regulatory considerations, the sheer scale of this investment positions BitMine as a significant player in the Ethereum space. It’s a clear signal that the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world are blurring, with forward-thinking companies like BitMine leading the charge into a multi-chain future. The coming months will undoubtedly reveal the full impact of this ambitious Ethereum acquisition on both BitMine’s trajectory and the wider crypto market.

2025-07-24T14:52:08,"Cramer Warns on $37T U.S. Debt—Bitcoin Hyper Emerges as a Smart Alternative","CNBC’s Jim Cramer stated his unwavering trust in Bitcoin’s power as a safety net against the US’s growing $37T debt. His statement comes amid growing concern about the global financial system’s stability, which casts an economic shadow on future generations. Cramer expressed this exact concern in a recent interview, where he stated: I mean, people want to trade. People want to own some as a hedge against the $37T debt. They don’t want to own the debt. They want to own Bitcoin for their kids.And you know who else feels that way? Me. — Jim Cramer CNBC Interview Cramer’s gravitation towards Bitcoin isn’t based on his personal feelings, but rather the observation that the entire financial system is slowly shifting towards the crypto sector. How Bitcoin’s Influence Grows Among Surging Institutional Adoption Given the growing pro-crypto context, Cramer’s trust in Bitcoin is very well-placed, with Trump’s GENIUS Act setting the foundation for a bullish future. The GENIUS Act passed the House this month, leading Trump to sign it into law less than a week ago. The act establishes a solid legal framework for stablecoin issuers, bringing stability and trust into the crypto sector. This aligns with developments like Ripple applying for banking status and JPMorgan supposedly planning to instate Bitcoin and Ethereum-backed loans by 2026 . On top of that, the institutional adoption rate for Bitcoin is growing by the day, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy now holding 607,770 $BTC and leading a list of 100 institutions with growing Bitcoin reserves. These developments create a powerful pro-Bitcoin and, thus, pro-crypto context where projects like Bitcoin Hyper are almost guaranteed to flourish. How Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Promises to Transform the Bitcoin Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 solution that aims to tackle Bitcoin’s most pressing issue: the subpar transaction speed. Bitcoin is currently capped at 7 transactions per second (TPS), miles below modern industry standards. Bitcoin Hyper relies on two tools to boost Bitcoin’s effectiveness: the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The Canonical Bridge mints the users’ $BTC onto Hyper’s Layer 2, which they can use within the Hyper ecosystem or withdraw to the native Bitcoin layer when necessary. This contributes to decongesting Bitcoin’s network traffic, resulting in smoother transactions and decreased confirmation times. The Solana Virtual Machine enables the lightning-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, further increasing Bitcoin’s performance, without sacrificing the network’s security. Bitcoin Hyper has been in presale since May 2025 and has already accumulated over $4.5M, with $HYPER sitting at $0.012375. This rapid growth highlights the investor trust associated with a project that aims to succeed where the Lightning Network failed . For this reason, $HYPER may experience long-term investor support, especially following its successful implementation post-launch. This could translate into a post-listing boom that would force $HYPER to $0.32 or higher. A 5-year successful run could put 2030’s $HYPER around $1.50 or higher, for an ROI of 12,021%, based on today’s price. This would transform your $100 investment today into a $12,121 profit by 2030. These are conservative predictions because Bitcoin Hyper could go higher than that, thanks to its association with the Bitcoin network, provided everything goes according to plan. This would make $HYPER one of the most promising new crypto projects of 2025 and beyond. If you want to join the Hyper train, go to the presale page and buy your $HYPER today. Why Bitcoin is Still Bullish, Despite the Drawback Cramer’s confidence in Bitcoin reflects the general sentiment, despite Bitcoin’s stagnation and the $86M in outflows recorded recently . The King coin is seemingly impervious to any market drawbacks and seems to be in a consolidation phase that could trigger another sustained bull run. When that happens, projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) stand to gain serious traction. Don’t take this as financial advice.

2025-07-24T14:45:23,"CryptoPunk Acquisition: GameSquare’s Landmark $5.15M Entry into NFTs","BitcoinWorld CryptoPunk Acquisition: GameSquare’s Landmark $5.15M Entry into NFTs The digital asset landscape continues to evolve at a breathtaking pace, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at the forefront of this revolution. Once considered niche collectibles, NFTs are increasingly attracting mainstream attention and significant institutional investment. In a move that underscores this growing trend, Nasdaq-listed GameSquare has made headlines with a landmark CryptoPunk acquisition , signaling a bold new chapter for both the company and the broader Web3 ecosystem. This high-profile transaction isn’t just about owning a piece of digital art; it’s a strategic maneuver that speaks volumes about the future of brand identity, community engagement, and corporate presence in the metaverse. Unpacking the Landmark CryptoPunk Acquisition: The Details GameSquare, a prominent player in the esports, gaming, and entertainment sectors, recently announced its acquisition of CryptoPunk #5577. This particular CryptoPunk, a highly sought-after digital collectible, was purchased from none other than Robert Leshner, the visionary founder of Compound, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. The reported value of this significant CryptoPunk acquisition stands at an impressive $5.15 million. What makes this deal particularly interesting is the payment structure. Instead of a cash transaction, GameSquare exchanged $5.15 million worth of convertible preferred stock for the NFT. This stock is convertible into approximately 3.4 million common shares of GameSquare at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, according to Chainwire. To understand the nuances of this transaction, let’s break down what convertible preferred stock entails: Convertible Preferred Stock: This is a type of preferred stock that gives the holder the option to convert it into a fixed number of common shares of the issuing company. It combines features of both debt (fixed dividends) and equity (conversion into common shares). Preferred Status: Preferred stock typically has a higher claim on company assets and earnings than common stock, meaning preferred dividends are paid before common dividends, and preferred shareholders are paid before common shareholders in case of liquidation. Conversion Option: Robert Leshner now holds stock that can be converted into GameSquare common shares, potentially allowing him to participate in the company’s future growth as a common shareholder. This mechanism offers flexibility and aligns interests, as the value of the convertible stock is tied to GameSquare’s performance. CryptoPunk #5577 itself is a rare “Alien” punk, one of only nine such types, making it exceptionally valuable within the CryptoPunks collection. Its distinct features and scarcity contribute significantly to its high market valuation, making it a prized asset for any collector or corporation looking to make a statement in the NFT space. This particular CryptoPunk acquisition is a testament to the enduring value and cultural significance of these early digital artifacts. GameSquare’s Strategic Leap: Why a CryptoPunk Acquisition? For many, the question arises: why would a Nasdaq-listed company like GameSquare invest millions in a single NFT? The answer lies in GameSquare’s forward-thinking strategy to integrate Web3 technologies into its core business of esports, gaming, and entertainment. This isn’t merely an art purchase; it’s a calculated move to solidify its presence in the burgeoning digital economy. GameSquare operates at the intersection of traditional media and the digital frontier, owning and operating popular esports organizations like Complexity Gaming and creating content for a vast audience. Their decision to pursue a high-profile CryptoPunk acquisition can be seen through several strategic lenses: Brand Identity and Recognition: Owning a CryptoPunk, especially a rare one like #5577, instantly elevates GameSquare’s profile within the Web3 community. It signals a serious commitment to the space and positions the company as an innovator rather than a bystander. This digital asset can serve as a potent symbol for their brand in virtual environments and marketing campaigns. Community Engagement: NFTs are inherently linked to communities. By acquiring a CryptoPunk, GameSquare taps into the passionate and influential CryptoPunks community, and by extension, the broader NFT and Web3 communities. This opens new avenues for engagement, collaboration, and talent acquisition. Metaverse and Digital Presence: As the metaverse continues to develop, digital identities and assets will play a crucial role. GameSquare, deeply embedded in gaming, understands the importance of virtual presence. A CryptoPunk can serve as a foundational digital identity for the company or its key figures within virtual worlds, enhancing their authenticity and reach. Thought Leadership: This acquisition positions GameSquare as a leader in exploring the practical applications of NFTs for traditional businesses. It allows them to experiment with new models of digital ownership, monetization, and fan interaction, setting a precedent for others in the entertainment industry. Investment and Asset Diversification: While volatile, high-value NFTs have demonstrated significant appreciation potential. Holding a rare CryptoPunk can also be viewed as a strategic investment, diversifying GameSquare’s asset portfolio into a new, high-growth digital category. This strategic CryptoPunk acquisition underscores a growing trend where companies are not just observing the Web3 space but actively participating in it, leveraging digital assets for tangible business benefits. The Broader Ripple Effect: What Does This CryptoPunk Acquisition Mean for the NFT Market? GameSquare’s significant investment sends a powerful message across the entire NFT ecosystem. It’s a clear signal of increasing institutional confidence and validation for digital assets. For a Nasdaq-listed company to make such a public and substantial CryptoPunk acquisition highlights the maturation of the NFT market beyond early adopters and speculative investors. The implications are far-reaching: Mainstream Validation: When established companies like GameSquare enter the NFT arena with multi-million dollar investments, it lends credibility to the asset class. This can encourage other corporations and traditional investors to explore NFTs, potentially leading to increased liquidity and broader market adoption. Evolving Utility: The focus shifts from NFTs purely as collectibles to their utility in branding, marketing, community building, and even corporate identity. This acquisition exemplifies how NFTs can serve as valuable strategic assets for businesses. Market Liquidity and Price Discovery: High-profile sales, especially those involving unique assets like rare CryptoPunks, contribute to market liquidity and help in the ongoing process of price discovery for digital collectibles. It reinforces the idea that certain NFTs hold significant, tangible value. Regulatory Scrutiny: As more traditional entities engage with NFTs, the spotlight on regulatory frameworks will intensify. This could lead to clearer guidelines and a more structured environment for digital asset transactions, which could be beneficial for long-term growth. Bridging Traditional Finance and Web3: The use of convertible preferred stock in this CryptoPunk acquisition is a fascinating blend of traditional financial instruments with cutting-edge digital assets. This hybrid approach could become a model for future transactions as the two worlds converge. While the NFT market has experienced periods of volatility, strategic acquisitions by public companies demonstrate a belief in the long-term value and transformative potential of these digital assets. Is This the New Frontier for Corporate Digital Asset Holdings? The idea of companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets is not entirely new. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, for instance, paved the way for corporate treasury management to consider cryptocurrencies. However, GameSquare’s CryptoPunk acquisition represents a distinct evolution, moving beyond fungible cryptocurrencies to unique, non-fungible digital assets. This trend suggests a broader recognition that digital assets can serve multiple purposes for corporations: Brand Equity and Marketing: NFTs can be powerful marketing tools, creating unique experiences, loyalty programs, and exclusive content for customers. Owning iconic NFTs can enhance a brand’s appeal to digitally native audiences. Employee Engagement and Recruitment: Companies might use NFTs as incentives, rewards, or even as part of a digital onboarding experience for employees, especially those in tech-forward industries. Strategic Partnerships: Holding specific NFTs can open doors to exclusive communities and facilitate partnerships within the Web3 ecosystem, leading to innovative collaborations and business opportunities. Future-Proofing: As the digital economy expands, companies that embrace and integrate digital assets are better positioned to adapt to future market dynamics and consumer behaviors. This proactive approach ensures relevance in an increasingly digital-first world. For companies contemplating their own digital asset strategy, GameSquare’s move offers a compelling case study. It highlights the potential for NFTs to be more than just speculative investments; they can be integral components of a modern, digitally-driven business strategy. The question for many now isn’t “if” they should engage with digital assets, but “how” and “when.” Navigating the NFT Landscape: What’s Next for GameSquare and Its CryptoPunk Acquisition? With CryptoPunk #5577 now under GameSquare’s ownership, the natural curiosity turns to how they will leverage this high-value digital asset. While specific plans are often kept under wraps, several possibilities emerge, given GameSquare’s domain in gaming and entertainment: Digital Identity for Executives or Brands: The CryptoPunk could serve as a digital avatar or mascot for GameSquare, its subsidiaries (like Complexity Gaming), or even for key executives in virtual meetings, metaverse events, or social media. This would create a unique and recognizable digital persona. Exclusive Content and Experiences: The CryptoPunk could be integrated into fan engagement initiatives, offering exclusive access to content, events, or merchandise for holders of GameSquare-related NFTs, or even for those interacting with the CryptoPunk’s digital presence. Gaming Integration: Given GameSquare’s core business, there’s potential for CryptoPunk #5577 to be featured in games, virtual worlds, or interactive experiences developed or supported by GameSquare, bridging the gap between digital art and interactive entertainment. Educational and Promotional Tool: The CryptoPunk could be used in educational campaigns about NFTs, blockchain, and Web3, helping GameSquare position itself as an authority in the space while promoting its brand. The utility of NFTs is constantly evolving, moving beyond simple profile pictures to unlock various forms of access, ownership, and experience. GameSquare’s CryptoPunk acquisition is a prime example of a company exploring these new frontiers, and its future utilization of #5577 will be closely watched as a benchmark for corporate NFT strategies. The success of this integration could pave the way for more traditional companies to follow suit, further blurring the lines between physical and digital assets. GameSquare’s acquisition of CryptoPunk #5577 for $5.15 million marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional corporate strategy and the decentralized Web3 economy. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a bold declaration of intent by a Nasdaq-listed company to actively participate in and shape the future of digital assets. By leveraging a unique and iconic NFT, GameSquare is not only diversifying its portfolio but also strategically positioning itself at the forefront of brand innovation, community engagement, and metaverse development. This landmark CryptoPunk acquisition serves as a powerful testament to the growing legitimacy and strategic value of non-fungible tokens. It highlights a future where digital assets are not merely collectibles but integral components of corporate identity, marketing, and investor relations. As the lines between physical and digital worlds continue to blur, GameSquare’s move could inspire a wave of similar corporate ventures into the NFT space, ultimately accelerating the mainstream adoption and utility of Web3 technologies.

Acting US Attorney for Seattle, Teal Luthy Miller, stated, “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims.” According to the attorney’s office, it is seeking the forfeiture of assets belonging to individuals residing in Russia and Nigeria, who used the funds to buy crypto and send it to exchanges in their home countries. US authorities have indicted at least one individual who allegedly facilitated money laundering for transnational criminal organizations. Geoffrey Auyeung was indicted in 2024 after being charged with receiving funds from fraudulent investment schemes. He was also accused of using the stolen funds to buy BTC, USDT, USDC, and ETH, and sending a majority of the assets to Binance. White House Crypto Report Set For July 30 Launch The White House crypto policy report will be released on July 30. The report could potentially ignite an era of US dominance in crypto or increase its regulatory challenges. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Digital Asset Advisory Council, announced that the long-awaited report will be made public on July 30. The document is the result of an extensive, 180-day review by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The Working Group on Digital Assets is a cross-agency effort involving the Treasury, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Department of Commerce. The report will outline strategies to maintain US leadership in digital finance, including a potential Bitcoin reserve and access to the Fed’s payment system for blockchain firms. JPMorgan Calls Stablecoin Forecast Optimistic JPMorgan has called the $2 trillion projection for the stablecoin market, often cited during the recent push to approve crypto market regulation, a “little bit optimistic.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated during a Senate hearing that the stablecoin market could potentially exceed the $2 trillion projection by 2028 if there is adequate legislative support. JPMorgan strategists said in a client note, “We find it hard to believe that the market could grow substantially larger over the next few years, as the infrastructure/ecosystem that supports stablecoins is far from developed and will take time to build out. While adoption is poised to grow further, it might be at a slower pace than what some might anticipate.” Block Joins S&P 500 Jack Dorsey’s Block joined the S&P 500 index on Wednesday. Block is the third public company with Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to join the global benchmark. The company currently holds $8,584 BTC, worth around $1 billion at current prices. Block shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have risen 14% since it announced it would join the S&P 500. The S&P 500 tracks the largest publicly-listed US companies, including Tesla and Coinbase. Goldman Sachs, BNY To Offer Tokenized Money Market Funds Goldman Sachs and BNY are planning to offer institutional investors access to tokenized money market funds. This could enable institutional investors to unlock real-time settlement, 24/7 market access, and greater efficiencies across capital markets. BNY clients will also be able to invest in money market funds whose ownership is recorded on Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain. Laide Majiyagbe, the global head of liquidity, financing, and collateral at BNY, stated, “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a second day, dropping to a low of $117,142 before moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to build momentum this week, trading between $116,000 and $120,000. BTC started the week positively, reaching an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday before settling at $117,397, ultimately registering a marginal decline. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising over 2% to $119,980. Sellers regained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 0.99%, dropping to a low of $117,303 before settling at $118,794. BTC has mostly stayed around $118,000-$119,000 this week as the crypto market capitalization reaches record levels. However, traders and analysts believe the real test for the asset will come during the last week of July as macroeconomic policy events collide with an intense legal battle over President Trump’s tariffs. Felix Juavin, host of Forward Guidance, stated on X, “The last few days of July will set the stage for markets for the rest of the year, imo. FOMC meeting where dovish dissents are looking very likely. QRA meeting where we will get a look at how willing Bessent is going to be to try to weaponize treasury issuance for the first time since being chair. Tariff letter deadlines. The Supreme Court will begin deliberating on whether tariffs via executive order are legal or not. No big edge on either side right now personally, will just react once we get clarity. Stay frosty.” Bitcoin bulls have taken a breather this week, as it struggles to overcome $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has registered a notable decline over the past two sessions, dropping to a low of $116,144 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $118,000. Despite the sluggish price action, overall sentiment around BTC remains bullish. The Fear & Greed Index remains in “greed” territory, indicating that today’s pullback could be temporary instead of a trend reversal. Market conditions remain conducive, with most analysts suggesting BTC’s rally will resume. BTC is currently consolidating after surging to a new all-time high last week. The price has strong support around $116,000, the lower end of its current range. Additionally, Bitcoin dominance has also increased as investors pivot from altcoins to the relative stability of Bitcoin. Paul Howard, Director at Wincent, stated in a comment for FinanceMagnates, “We will see some continued profit taking at the upper end of this $110,000-$120,000 range. Volatility is still relatively low, trading around 40, and I believe this low volume environment will persist over the summer. Looking at September expiries, I expect a slower period over the next six weeks with policymakers away. I would be surprised if BTC breaks out higher and am of the view we consolidate around this band.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, racing past $120,000 and reaching a new all-time high of $123,091. It lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $119,716. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as BTC plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before recovering to reclaim $117,000 and settling at $117,682, ultimately falling 1.70%. It recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.82% and settling at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 1,03%, dropping to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877.

Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as the price fell 0.99% to an intraday low of $117,303 before settling at $118,794. The current session sees BTC marginally down, trading around $118,792, having recovered from a low of $117,142. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum’s (ETH) rally lost momentum at the start of the week as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers at upper levels. As a result, ETH registered a marginal increase on Monday before dropping to a low of $3,620 on Tuesday. The price recovered from this level and settled at $3,747, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as the price fell over 3% to a low of $3,531 before rebounding during the ongoing session. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes ETH’s rally is being fueled by a structural shift in demand. Ethereum ETFs and accumulation by institutional investors have resulted in the acquisition of nearly 2.83 billion ETH, valued at over $10 billion. Hougan pointed out that demand is outpacing new ETH issuance by a factor of 32, creating a significant imbalance in demand-supply dynamics. As a result, ETH has surged, rising 65% over the past month and 160% since April. Inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have also gained momentum in recent months, pulling in over $5 billion since mid-May. Corporate entities have also begun adding ETH to their reserves. Several companies, including Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), SharpLink Gaming (SBET), Bit Digital (BTBT), and The Ether Machine (DYNX), have purchased or announced plans to buy ETH as a reserve asset. Hougan believes that current market sentiment suggests continued demand and growth. ETH started the previous week in positive territory, rising 1.50% on Monday to cross $3,000 and settle at $3,015. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, rising over 4% to cross $3,100 and settle at $3,140.

2025-07-24T14:30:12,"Billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Dumped Bank of America, Citi and Capital One, Pivots to These Two Stocks That Are Up Big Year-to-Date","Two stocks purchased by investment legend Warren Buffett’s firm in the first quarter of the year have witnessed significant gains in 2025. Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year indicate Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) in Q1, worth approximately $204 million. The Omaha-based holding company also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm. Those new shares were worth nearly $50 million in Q1. Domino’s stock is up more than 2.5% in the past five days, more than 4% in the past month and more than 13.5% year-to-date. Heico’s stock is up more than 35% in 2025. Berkshire Hathaway added shares in both firms while hawking $3.23 billion worth of stock in the financial giants Citigroup, Bank of America and Capital One in Q1. Buffett’s firm completely exited Citigroup in the first quarter, unloading its remaining 14,639,502 shares worth about $1 billion. Berkshire sold an additional 48.7 million Bank of America shares in Q1, worth about $2.19 billion, and 300,000 shares in Capital One exposure, worth more than $46 million. Buffett’s firm also sold all of its remaining 40,180,168 shares of the Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings, which were worth more than $416 million. Beyond banking, Berkshire also reduced positions in Charter Communications, DaVita, T-Mobile and Liberty Media’s Formula One stock.

2025-07-24T14:19:08,"What Does the Sharp Drop in XRP Mean? Is the Possibility of a New ATH Over? Celebrity Explains!","XRP, one of the altcoins that benefited most from the victory of US President Donald Trump, made a big move in the latest rise. At this point, XRP has surpassed $3.6, reaching a new ATH, while experiencing a 10% drop in the last 24 hours. While this decline has made investors nervous, the Bitpanda executive said that XRP could reach a new record high despite its recent decline. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of European cryptocurrency platform Bitpanda, said that Ripple (XRP) is likely to reach a new record high despite experiencing a nearly 10% drop in the last 24 hours. The Bitpanda executive noted that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly where XRP is heading, but it is not impossible for the price to break above new ATHs. “While it's difficult to pinpoint exact levels in such a fast-moving market, if market conditions remain favorable and capital flows continue to flow from Bitcoin to altcoins, a break above the current record high wouldn't be surprising.” The Bitpanda executive stated that there is no clear catalyst that would make XRP outperform on its own, saying that XRP reaching new ATHs will likely depend on the overall altcoin market. “XRP's short-term price trend will depend on whether the current bullish momentum in the altcoin market continues, as XRP tends to be quite sensitive to overall altcoin sentiment and regulatory rhetoric.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-24T14:12:50,"Bitcoin Price in Danger Zone! What Happens If Whales Sell?","The post Bitcoin Price in Danger Zone! What Happens If Whales Sell? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price USD has nearly doubled since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, reaching an all-time high of $123,231. However, the recent shift into consolidation has triggered investor concerns, and experts are in a tug of war between bullish and bearish views, creating an uncertain atmosphere for its price action. The altcoins showing selling spikes are creating chaos for top crypto , as many are raising doubts that the current rally may be nearing exhaustion and a fall could be on the horizon. While others advocate it as a healthy halt. Bitcoin Price USD Shows Signs of Exhaustion Near $123K After a strong rally through the first half of the year, the Bitcoin price has successfully marked its latest peak at $123,231. This level was a new all-time high, pushing bullish sentiment to fresh highs. Yet, over the past few days, the rally has paused, and the Bitcoin price USD has transitioned into a sideways consolidation phase. When writing, the Bitcoin price today is exchanging hands at $118,681 with a 24-hour volume of $73.62 billion. Overall, it remains in a broader uptrend on the daily Bitcoin USD chart. However, market watchers are becoming cautious, particularly due to the rising wedge pattern forming in multi-month price action, which is raising the sweat. This pattern is typically associated with trend exhaustion and raises the possibility of a reversal, especially if selling pressure builds. Bull Flag and Pennant Patterns Signal Potential Continuation Despite concerns, some technical analysts believe the ongoing BTC price behavior may be a temporary pause rather than a topping formation. Prior to this consolidation, the Bitcoin price USD had broken out of a bullish flag pattern and its upside potential target is anticipated to be between $130K and $135K. Bitcoin is retesting the breakout of this bullish pennant formation. I think we will see a strong bounce here. pic.twitter.com/M1Nrjp6x5N — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) July 24, 2025 Moreover, following the brief retreat from $123,231, BTC USD price action now appears to be forming a smaller bullish pennant, which is a continuation pattern that often emerges mid-rally. The breakout from this pennant has already occurred, and Bitcoin appears to be retesting for liquidity around the $118K – $120K zone, suggesting possible readiness for a renewed upward move. Retail Exit, Whale Entry: Supply Shift Could Drive Next Leg Beyond technical patterns, the on-chain data is another factor that adds optimism to the analysis. The data reveals that the wallets holding between “0.001 to 10 BTC” (largely considered retail investors) have shown a steady decline in activity. This is reflecting an ongoing trend of profit-taking and fear that the consolidation could mark a market top. In contrast, whale wallets holding “10,000 to 100,000 BTC” have increased their holdings during this pullback. This accumulation trend among large players hints that institutional confidence remains intact, and that the Bitcoin price USD could still make another attempt at new highs. Such a shift in supply ownership from retail to whale wallets hints towards the bullish BTC price continuation. Christmas Risk Looms if Whale Sentiment Shifts However, there remains one key risk that could threaten this outlook. If the current consolidation triggers not just retail exits but also prompts whales to offload their holdings to secure profits, then downside pressure could intensify. In such a case, the Bitcoin price might slip back below $100,000, potentially extending the correction into the Christmas season.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-in-danger-zone-what-happens-if-whales-sell/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Now trading around $3.17 after a 16% pullback, some investors are expressing concern . But crypto analyst XRPunkie is urging calm. In a recent X post, he reassured holders: “It’s a healthy correction. Nothing out of the ordinary in crypto. Sit back, chill, and relax… $10–$15 still in play.” A Natural Pullback After a Parabolic Surge The correction comes after a strong bullish run, and analysts agree it’s likely nothing more than a reset. XRP had broken above key resistance levels before retracing to test support zones between $3.10 and $3.30. According to technical indicators, XRP remains in a long-term uptrend, with this pullback allowing momentum to reset in preparation for the next leg higher. Market-wide consolidation is also a factor. Bitcoin has hovered just below $120,000, exerting downward pressure on altcoins like XRP. Moreover, traders appear to be rotating funds into other assets temporarily, leading to minor corrections across the board. $XRP went from $1.95 to $3.66, up 92% in 30 days. We just had a 16% pullback. It's a healthy correction. Nothing out of the ordinary in crypto. Sit back, chill and relax. Let it bottom out and we should be on our way to much higher prices real soon. $10-$15 still in play. pic.twitter.com/aUQup1VctA — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 23, 2025 Strong Support Zones and Bullish Structures Despite the pullback, XRP is holding above critical support zones, including the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement near $3.25 and the mid-range Bollinger Band between $2.90 and $3.00. These levels have historically acted as solid platforms for price rebounds. Technical analysts point to XRP’s previous breakout from a bullish flag formation and an MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) golden cross as evidence that the larger trend remains intact. Some even see the current price zone as an ideal reaccumulation range ahead of another rally. Institutional Interest and Macro Catalysts Beyond technicals, broader macro trends are favoring XRP. The token has been mentioned in strategic discussions about forming a U.S. digital asset reserve, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. This recognition is helping validate its long-term utility and potential as a major player in the evolving global payments infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Furthermore, expectations around crypto ETFs and XRP’s expanding role in cross-border payments are stoking bullish sentiment. If Bitcoin reclaims momentum and institutional capital flows into altcoins, XRP could be among the biggest beneficiaries. Outlook: Is $10 to $15 Still Realistic? XRPunkie’s optimism isn’t unfounded. Multiple analysts believe XRP could reach between $10 and $15 in the next major rally cycle, especially if Bitcoin approaches a $3 trillion market cap, as some forecasts suggest. Even more conservative models now price XRP between $6 and $9 over the coming months, assuming regulatory clarity and sustained adoption. Correction, Not Collapse This latest drop isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s part of the rhythm of crypto markets. As XRPunkie rightly points out, corrections like this are normal after massive surges. With strong technical support, growing institutional relevance, and continued investor confidence, XRP remains well-positioned for future growth. For now, the message is simple: “Sit back, chill, and relax.” The path to $10–$15 is still wide open. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-24T14:00:18,"Bitcoin STH Realized Price Chart Reveals Key Defense Zones Amid Volatility","Bitcoin saw a modest retracement yesterday, dipping slightly but continuing to trade within a tight range between key support and resistance levels. While the broader altcoin market faces heightened volatility and notable losses, BTC remains relatively resilient, yet momentum appears uncertain. Analysts warn that if sentiment weakens, a broader correction could unfold. Related Reading: Ethereum Adoption Accelerates As Daily Transactions Set 2025 Record Top analyst Darkfost highlighted a critical dynamic now unfolding: the vulnerability of Short-Term Holders (STH). These investors, who entered the market during recent price surges, hold Bitcoin at significantly higher cost bases. As price action stalls or retraces, they’re typically the first to capitulate, creating increased selling pressure. With altcoins already under stress, all eyes remain on whether Bitcoin can hold above current support levels or if it, too, will start to crack under short-term selloffs. This phase could act as a stress test for recent buyers, while long-term holders and institutional participants continue to monitor key price zones. Key Realized Price Levels Suggest Bitcoin Structure Remains Bullish Darkfost has shared a chart offering a deep dive into Bitcoin’s realized prices across various holding cohorts, particularly focusing on Short-Term Holders (STHs). These metrics are proving crucial in identifying support zones that could be defended if the price continues to correct in the short term. The broader realized price for Bitcoin currently stands at $50.8K, while the annual average is significantly higher at $87.5K. More critically, the realized price for STHs—those who purchased coins recently—is positioned at $103.9K. Breaking this down further, we see realized prices by time held: STH 3m–6m: $88.2K STH 1m–3m: $104.1K STH 1w–1m: $113K These figures represent the average price at which different groups of recent investors acquired their coins. As such, they serve as psychological and technical support levels during corrections. With Bitcoin currently consolidating after a small retracement, bulls are eyeing these realized price zones to gauge whether the structure remains bullish. The $104K level, in particular, is essential—it aligns closely with the 1m–3m STH realized price and could serve as a decisive line for sentiment and price defense. If buyers can hold BTC above this level, the market’s bullish structure will likely remain intact, suggesting healthy consolidation rather than trend reversal. Conversely, losing it could trigger short-term panic selling among recent entrants.

As seen in the 3-day chart, BTC is holding above $115,724—a key horizontal support—and below immediate resistance near $122,077. This consolidation range has remained intact for over a week, reflecting both strong demand and hesitation near psychological resistance. Despite the recent small pullback, the overall market structure remains bullish. Price is trading well above the 50-day ($98,536), 100-day ($93,833), and 200-day ($76,201) simple moving averages, which continue to slope upward. This confirms strong medium- and long-term momentum.

2025-07-24T13:59:11,"Web3 scams surge past $3.1 billion in losses during first half of 2025","The first half of 2025 has already proven catastrophic for the Web3 ecosystem, with blockchain security firm Hacken reporting over $3.1 billion in cumulative losses due to scams, breaches, and protocol failures. This figure already surpasses the full-year total of 2024, underscoring the scale of damage inflicted in just six months. The primary cause: access control failures, which contributed to roughly $1.83 billion in damages, including a landmark $1.46 billion Bybit exploit in February. Internal threats, compromised keys drive biggest breaches The largest single incident of the year was the Bybit attack, attributed to a compromised wallet signer that gave malicious actors full control of funds. Hackers used the vulnerability to drain assets undetected, exposing a significant weakness in private key storage and management. This was closely followed by the Infini Protocol attack , where a former developer exploited internal access to steal $50 million in a single transaction. The incident highlighted how insider threats remain an ongoing challenge for decentralised protocols, particularly those with incomplete governance or access restrictions. Geopolitical tensions also entered the spotlight when Iran’s Nobitex exchange lost $90 million in a breach that analysts suggest may have been politically motivated. The incident involved both phishing and technical compromise, combining multiple attack vectors for maximum impact. DeFi platforms suffer from flawed smart contracts Decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms were not spared. Hacken reported $263 million in total losses from smart contract vulnerabilities, mostly from bugs in logic and overflow checks. The most severe case involved Cetus , which saw $223 million drained in May. The bug was traced to a liquidity range miscalculation that allowed attackers to repeatedly withdraw unearned assets. These incidents show that many DeFi platforms continue to deploy unaudited or under-tested code, making them attractive targets for sophisticated exploits. Despite past lessons from similar vulnerabilities in 2020–2022, several protocols still struggle to implement robust logic checks and formal verification. Phishing scams and fake support schemes accelerate Phishing attacks surged to new records, accounting for $600 million in losses—also exceeding 2024’s full-year total. One of the most damaging cases involved an elderly US investor who lost $330 million in Bitcoin after falling prey to a multi-stage scam. Coinbase users were also targeted following a data breach. Using stolen credentials and customer details, scammers impersonated official Coinbase support staff. Victims were tricked into handing over seed phrases and two-factor passcodes, leading to more than $100 million in stolen funds. Additional scams included fake wallets, deceptive browser extensions, and token approval traps embedded in lookalike dApps. All these relied on social engineering and interface manipulation to extract funds without the victim realising it. AI-fuelled attacks rise 1000% with new tactics Artificial intelligence-related attacks are on the rise, with Hacken observing a 1000% increase compared to 2023. The majority of these breaches involved unsafe APIs, where attackers used prompt injection, fake AI agents, and vulnerable toolchains to hijack automation systems and user wallets. These methods bypass traditional cybersecurity protocols by exploiting emerging tech layers that are poorly understood or inadequately protected. As AI tools are increasingly integrated into DeFi, exchanges, and wallets, the attack surface is expanding rapidly, giving hackers new ways to bypass defences. With only half the year gone, the scale and sophistication of these breaches suggest that the crypto industry faces its most critical security moment in years. Security experts are now calling for urgent updates to access controls, contract audits, and AI usage guidelines to reduce further exposure.
