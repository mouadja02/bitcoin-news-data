The blockchain data tracking firm, Arkham Intelligence, has compiled data showing the U.S. government‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings across several agencies to clarify the confusion around the rumors that the U.S. government had depleted its Bitcoin reserves. The U.S. government still holds over 198,000 BTC, Arkham says Public records released by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sparked a wave of confusion and alarm over the size of the U.S. government‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings. The document, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and dated July 15, states that the USMS currently holds 28,988.356 BTC, valued at approximately $3.44B. However, the blockchain intelligence firm, Arkham, has clarified that the U.S. government still holds at least 198,000 BTC, worth roughly $23.5B, across multiple agencies and wallets. The company also asserted that none of the funds have moved in the past four months. U.S. government crypto holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis responded on X to the initial claim of dwindling reserves with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves‚Äîleaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race,‚Äù she wrote .

If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race. https://t.co/ciYf1uhy0x ‚Äî Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) July 16, 2025 But according to Arkham, the FOIA request only accounted for holdings by the US Marshals Service, which traditionally manages seized assets and conducts public auctions. Other agencies like the FBI, IRS, DEA, and Department of Justice also seize Bitcoin but do not regularly disclose their crypto balances, making centralized tracking nearly impossible. Arkham has identified at least 198,012 BTC under government control, spread across several high-profile criminal cases. The largest share of the reserve, totaling 114,599 BTC, which is worth about $13.65B was seized from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, or ‚ÄúRazzlekhan,‚Äù in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Another major holding includes 94,643 BTC seized in two separate Silk Road-related cases. 51,680 BTC from James Zhong, who stole funds from the Silk Road marketplace, and 69,370 BTC previously seized from ‚ÄòIndividual X,‚Äô believed to have hacked Silk Road. Additional seizures include $81.25M in BTC from Alameda Research‚Äôs Binance accounts after the FTX collapse and $79.49M in BTC from HashFlare scammers Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin. Comprehensive data is limited The FOIA request, which was filed by independent journalist, ‚ÄúL0la L33tz‚Äù specifically asked the USMS for ‚Äúthe amount of Bitcoin held by the U.S. Marshals Service.‚Äù In return, she received a detailed spreadsheet , case breakdowns, and a total of 28,988.35643016 BTC as of July 15, 2025. The letter, sent by the Office of General Counsel, confirmed the data came from the Asset Forfeiture Division, though some lines were redacted for legal reasons. The ensuing controversy shows that the lack of a centralized database for all U.S. government BTC holdings is a critical barrier to transparency. For years, analysts have estimated the total government stash to hover around 200,000 BTC, but this number has been difficult to verify given the involvement of multiple law enforcement and regulatory bodies with differing reporting practices. L33tz has already filed a second FOIA request to determine whether the government‚Äôs holdings are being managed through Coinbase Prime, a platform often used to liquidate seized assets. Arkham‚Äôs data supports that Coinbase has been the venue for recent U.S. government BTC sales, including the sale of 9,861 BTC from James Zhong in March of 2023, totaling about $215M. In August 2024, the U.S. government sold 10,000 BTC from James Zhong, which is equivalent to $593.9M. Another 10,000 BTC, approximately $968.6M from James Zhong, was sold in December of 2024. 58.7 BTC from Ryan Farace was sold in July 2024. Despite these sales, Arkham insists that the U.S. government retains significant Bitcoin reserves. For instance, the Bitfinex and Silk Road cases alone account for over 150,000 BTC. However, until more agencies provide official disclosures, the exact total may remain contested. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-23T21:40:23,"Crypto Futures Liquidation: A Shocking $727 Million Wiped Out in 24 Hours","BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: A Shocking $727 Million Wiped Out in 24 Hours The cryptocurrency market is a place of rapid highs and sudden lows, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. Recently, the crypto world witnessed a stark reminder of this volatility, as a staggering $126 million worth of crypto futures were liquidated in just one hour , pushing the total liquidations over the past 24 hours to a shocking $727 million . This massive crypto futures liquidation event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, leaving many traders stunned and prompting crucial questions about market stability and risk management. For anyone involved in or considering entering the crypto space, understanding the mechanics and implications of such events, particularly crypto futures liquidation , is paramount. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the magnitude of recent events, it‚Äôs essential to understand what crypto futures liquidation entails. In simple terms, it‚Äôs the forced closure of a trader‚Äôs leveraged position by an exchange due to a lack of sufficient margin to cover potential losses. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. They often involve leverage, meaning you can trade with more capital than you actually possess, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the core components: Leverage: This is a double-edged sword. It allows traders to open larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, a $100 investment can control a $1,000 position. Margin: This is the collateral (your actual funds) deposited with the exchange to cover potential losses. It acts as a buffer. Margin Call: If the market moves against a leveraged position, the value of the collateral decreases. If it falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange issues a margin call, requesting additional funds. Forced Closure (Liquidation): If the trader fails to add more funds to meet the margin requirements, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. This is the crypto futures liquidation . The recent figures highlight just how quickly and forcefully these mechanisms can kick in, leading to significant capital evaporation for those caught on the wrong side of the market. Analyzing the Shocking Numbers: Who Was Hit Hardest by Crypto Futures Liquidation? The reported $727 million in crypto futures liquidation over 24 hours, with a concentrated $126 million within a single hour, indicates a sharp market movement that caught many leveraged traders off guard. While specific breakdowns by exchange and asset can vary, such large-scale liquidations typically occur during periods of extreme price volatility, often triggered by significant news, macroeconomic shifts, or large institutional trades. Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures tend to account for the largest share of liquidations due to their high trading volumes and open interest. However, altcoins can also experience disproportionately large liquidations if they undergo sudden, steep price corrections. Consider the typical breakdown during such events (hypothetical representation based on common market behavior): Asset 24H Liquidations (Approx.) Primary Direction (Long/Short) Bitcoin (BTC) $350 million Long Ethereum (ETH) $200 million Long Solana (SOL) $50 million Long Other Altcoins $127 million Mixed This table illustrates how a significant downturn can disproportionately impact ‚Äòlong‚Äô positions (bets that the price will go up), leading to widespread crypto futures liquidation as prices fall. What Triggers These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Events? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events are rarely isolated incidents. They are typically the culmination of several factors converging to create a perfect storm in the market. Understanding these triggers is crucial for predicting and potentially avoiding being caught in such a squeeze. Key triggers include: Sudden Price Drops: The most common catalyst. A sharp, unexpected decline in the price of a major cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) can rapidly push many leveraged long positions below their liquidation thresholds. High Leverage Ratios: When traders use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x or 100x), even minor price fluctuations can lead to a margin call or immediate liquidation. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out a position. Cascading Liquidations: This is a vicious cycle. As initial liquidations occur, the forced selling by exchanges adds further selling pressure to the market, driving prices down even more. This, in turn, triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect that can accelerate a market downturn. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, interest rate changes, inflation data, or geopolitical events can impact traditional financial markets, and these sentiments often spill over into the highly interconnected crypto market. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major jurisdictions can create panic and lead to sell-offs, triggering liquidations. Large Whale Movements: Significant buy or sell orders from large institutional players or ‚Äòwhales‚Äô can move the market enough to trigger a wave of liquidations for smaller, leveraged traders. The recent crypto futures liquidation likely stemmed from a combination of these factors, demonstrating the intricate web of influences in the crypto ecosystem. How Does Crypto Futures Liquidation Impact the Broader Market and Trader Confidence? Beyond the immediate financial losses for individual traders, large-scale crypto futures liquidation events have broader implications for the entire market and the collective psyche of investors. Increased Volatility: The forced selling from liquidations can exacerbate price swings, making the market even more unpredictable and challenging to navigate for all participants, not just those using leverage. Erosion of Confidence: Repeated or massive liquidation events can erode investor confidence, especially among newer participants. It highlights the inherent risks of the crypto market and can lead to a more cautious or even fearful sentiment. Reduced Open Interest: After a major liquidation cascade, the total open interest (the number of outstanding futures contracts) typically drops significantly as positions are closed. This can indicate a cooling off period in speculative trading. Market Correction or Reversal: While painful, liquidations can sometimes act as a ‚Äòreset‚Äô for the market, flushing out excessive leverage and creating healthier conditions for a potential rebound. However, they can also signal the start of a deeper correction. Understanding these impacts is vital for any trader or investor aiming to build a sustainable presence in the crypto space. Navigating the Volatility: Smart Strategies to Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risk Given the inherent risks, how can traders protect themselves from the brutal force of crypto futures liquidation ? While no strategy guarantees immunity in a volatile market, several best practices can significantly reduce your exposure. Avoid Excessive Leverage: This is perhaps the most crucial advice. While high leverage offers tempting returns, it dramatically increases your liquidation risk. Start with lower leverage ratios (e.g., 2x-5x) until you gain substantial experience. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predetermined point. This limits your potential losses and prevents total liquidation. Manage Position Sizing: Never allocate a large portion of your portfolio to a single highly leveraged trade. Diversify your positions and only risk a small percentage of your total capital on any given trade. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Always keep more margin than the minimum required. This provides a buffer against sudden market movements and gives you time to react to margin calls before liquidation occurs. Stay Informed and Analyze the Market: Keep abreast of market news, technical indicators, and fundamental developments. Understanding the broader market sentiment can help you anticipate potential volatility. Consider Hedging Strategies: Advanced traders might use hedging techniques, such as taking an opposing spot position, to offset potential losses in their futures trades. Practice on Demo Accounts: Before risking real capital, practice trading futures on demo accounts offered by exchanges. This allows you to understand the mechanics without financial risk. The key takeaway is that responsible trading, particularly with leveraged products like futures, requires discipline, continuous learning, and a robust risk management framework. The recent crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of these necessities. The Broader Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Futures Trading While the threat of crypto futures liquidation is real and often dramatic, futures trading itself is a legitimate and powerful tool within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It offers opportunities for: Hedging: Traders can use futures to hedge against price fluctuations in their spot holdings. Price Discovery: Futures markets often lead spot markets in price discovery, reflecting collective expectations about future prices. Arbitrage: Discrepancies between spot and futures prices can create arbitrage opportunities for sophisticated traders. However, these opportunities come with significant challenges: High Volatility: The crypto market is inherently more volatile than traditional markets, amplifying futures trading risks. Complexity: Futures trading involves complex concepts like funding rates, open interest, and various order types that require deep understanding. Emotional Trading: The rapid price swings can lead to emotional decisions, often resulting in poor outcomes. The recent $727 million crypto futures liquidation underscores the need for a balanced perspective: acknowledge the potential, but respect the risks. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent staggering figures of crypto futures liquidation ‚Äì with $126 million in just an hour and $727 million over 24 hours ‚Äì serve as a potent warning and a crucial learning experience for everyone in the crypto space. These events are not just numbers; they represent significant capital shifts and illustrate the raw power of market dynamics, especially when leverage is involved. While the allure of amplified gains through futures trading is undeniable, the potential for swift and complete liquidation is an ever-present reality. Successful navigation of the crypto futures market demands more than just an understanding of price charts; it requires a deep respect for risk management, a commitment to continuous learning, and the discipline to adhere to a well-defined trading strategy. By prioritizing capital preservation, utilizing risk-mitigation tools like stop-loss orders, and avoiding excessive leverage, traders can better withstand the inevitable market storms. The crypto market will always have its volatile moments, but informed and disciplined participation can turn potential pitfalls into valuable lessons for long-term growth and resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange when a trader‚Äôs margin (collateral) falls below a required level due to adverse price movements, preventing further losses. Why do large crypto futures liquidation events happen? Large liquidations are typically triggered by sudden, significant price movements (often downwards for long positions), high leverage ratios used by traders, and a cascading effect where initial liquidations further depress prices, leading to more liquidations. How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation risks? Key strategies include avoiding excessive leverage, always using stop-loss orders, managing position sizes wisely, maintaining sufficient margin, and staying informed about market conditions. Responsible risk management is paramount. Does a large crypto futures liquidation always mean the market will crash further? Not necessarily. While large liquidations indicate significant selling pressure and can lead to further price drops, they can also ‚Äòflush out‚Äô excessive leverage, potentially setting the stage for a market rebound or stabilization after the initial shock. Which cryptocurrencies are most affected by futures liquidations? Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures typically see the largest liquidation volumes due to their high trading volume and open interest. However, any highly leveraged altcoin can experience severe liquidations during sharp price movements. Did you find this article insightful?

The altcoin market accounted for the lion‚Äôs share of the $563 million in long liquidations during the past 24 hours. According to market aggregate data from Coinglass, the ETH and XRP trading pairs recorded net liquidations of about $126 million and $69 million respectively. Bitcoin (BTC) on the other hand recorded a net liquidation of around $54 million. Major Reasons Why Crypto Dropped Today The 2025 altcoin bull market officially kicked off after the Ethereum price outpaced Bitcoin, leading to a reversal in the BTC dominance. The rising calls for altseason 2025 attracted more FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) traders, thus leading to overheated futures. According to market data analysis from CryptoQuant , an overheated futures market amid weak prices often leads to a distribution phase. Additionally, market data analysis from Santiment shows the social volume and dominance for altseason 2025 surged to yearly peaks after Ether price approached $4k. Historically, an increase in social dominance of ATH often precedes a market correction. The heavy liquidation of long traders has also triggered panic selling, thus increasing the odds of a long squeeze. What Next? The crypto market has gained bullish momentum fueled by clear regulatory frameworks in the United States amid renewed demand from institutional investors. The rising global money supply will further boost the crypto bull market in the coming months. As a result, the wider crypto market is likely to be trapped in a short-term consolidation before a parabolic rally before the end of 2025.

2025-07-23T21:30:53,"FTX Creditor Distribution: A Crucial August 15 Deadline Approaches","BitcoinWorld FTX Creditor Distribution: A Crucial August 15 Deadline Approaches The crypto world has been buzzing with anticipation, and for good reason. For thousands of individuals and institutions impacted by the devastating collapse of FTX, a significant milestone is on the horizon. The FTX Recovery Trust, the dedicated entity managing the remnants of the once-mighty crypto exchange, has officially designated August 15 as the record date for its next substantial FTX creditor distribution . This news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal moment in the long and arduous journey toward recompense for those who lost their assets. Understanding the Catastrophe: The Fall of FTX To truly grasp the importance of this upcoming FTX creditor distribution , it‚Äôs essential to revisit the events that led us here. FTX, once a titan in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, collapsed spectacularly in November 2022. What began as liquidity concerns quickly spiraled into a full-blown bankruptcy, revealing a staggering mismanagement of customer funds, alleged fraud, and a complex web of financial irregularities. The fallout was immediate and far-reaching, impacting millions of users globally and sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market. The collapse wasn‚Äôt just a financial disaster; it was a profound breach of trust. Users who had placed their faith and their digital assets with FTX found themselves in an unprecedented situation, with their funds frozen and their financial futures uncertain. The subsequent legal proceedings, investigations, and the appointment of new leadership to oversee the bankruptcy process have been complex and drawn-out. The FTX Recovery Trust: Pioneering the Path to Repayment In the wake of the collapse, the primary objective became clear: recover as much as possible for the defrauded creditors. This monumental task fell largely to the FTX Recovery Trust. This entity has been diligently working to: Identify and Secure Assets: Tracing and securing various assets, including cryptocurrencies, real estate, and other investments, often hidden or commingled. Navigate Legal Complexities: Engaging in numerous legal battles, negotiations, and settlements to maximize the recovery pool. Establish a Fair Distribution Framework: Developing a transparent and equitable process for distributing recovered funds to a vast number of creditors with diverse claims. The establishment of August 15 as a record date signifies a critical step forward in this intricate process, indicating that the Trust has made sufficient progress to begin another round of repayments. What Exactly is a ‚ÄòRecord Date‚Äô and Why Does it Matter for FTX Creditor Distribution? For many, the term ‚Äòrecord date‚Äô might seem like legal jargon. However, in the context of bankruptcy and creditor distributions, it holds immense significance. The record date, in this case August 15, is the specific cutoff date used to determine which creditors are eligible to receive the upcoming distribution. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its importance: Eligibility Confirmation: Only creditors whose claims are recognized and recorded by this date will be included in the current distribution round. Snapshot of Claims: It provides a definitive snapshot of the creditor base at a particular point in time, streamlining the administrative process for payment. Prevents Future Complications: It helps to manage changes in creditor ownership or claim status that might occur after the date, ensuring a clear and organized payout. Creditors should ensure their claim information is accurate and up-to-date with the FTX Recovery Trust well before this date to avoid any delays or issues with receiving their entitled share of the FTX creditor distribution . The Long Road Traveled: Previous Recovery Efforts and Remaining Challenges The journey to this point has been anything but smooth. Since the initial bankruptcy filing, the FTX estate has made considerable strides in asset recovery. Reports indicate billions of dollars in assets have been identified and secured, far exceeding initial pessimistic forecasts. This success is largely due to the diligent work of the new management team and legal experts. However, significant challenges persist: Valuation Volatility: A substantial portion of recovered assets are cryptocurrencies, whose values can fluctuate wildly, impacting the final payout amounts. Legal Disputes: Ongoing legal battles with various parties, including former FTX executives and other entities, continue to tie up funds and resources. Administrative Hurdles: Managing and verifying claims from millions of creditors worldwide is an enormous logistical undertaking. Despite these hurdles, the setting of the August 15 record date is a strong indicator of the Trust‚Äôs confidence in its ability to proceed with further distributions, offering a glimmer of hope to those who have waited patiently. What Does This Latest Development Mean for FTX Creditors? For those directly impacted by the FTX collapse, this announcement is undoubtedly a source of both relief and continued anxiety. While it signals progress, the full extent of recovery remains to be seen. Here are some actionable insights for creditors: Verify Your Claim Status: It is paramount to regularly check the official FTX bankruptcy portal or communicate with your legal representatives to ensure your claim is properly filed and acknowledged. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the FTX Recovery Trust and reputable news sources. Be wary of unofficial channels or scams. Prepare for Distribution: Understand the mechanisms through which distributions will be made (e.g., direct bank transfer, crypto transfer) and ensure your details are current. The August 15 record date is not the payment date itself, but a crucial step towards it. Creditors should anticipate further communications regarding the actual payout schedule following this date. Broader Implications: Trust and Transparency in Crypto The FTX saga has had a profound impact on the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It highlighted the critical need for greater transparency, robust regulatory frameworks, and stringent internal controls within crypto exchanges. Every step taken by the FTX Recovery Trust, including this upcoming FTX creditor distribution , is watched closely by regulators, investors, and the industry at large. A successful and equitable distribution process for FTX creditors could help restore some of the lost trust in the digital asset space. It demonstrates that even in the face of catastrophic failure, mechanisms for recovery and justice can eventually prevail, reinforcing the importance of due diligence and secure practices for all participants in the crypto economy. Navigating the Future of FTX Recovery: What Comes Next? While the August 15 record date is a significant marker, it‚Äôs important to remember that the FTX recovery process is likely to continue for some time. Future distributions may occur as more assets are recovered and legal disputes are resolved. The Trust will continue its work, and creditors should remain vigilant for further updates. This ongoing process serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in nascent financial markets and the vital role of robust legal and recovery frameworks when things go awry. The hope is that the lessons learned from FTX will contribute to a more secure and trustworthy future for the entire crypto industry. In conclusion, the setting of August 15 as the record date for the next FTX creditor distribution is a beacon of progress in a challenging landscape. While the journey for creditors has been long and arduous, this development signifies tangible movement towards resolution and repayment. It underscores the painstaking efforts of the FTX Recovery Trust and offers a renewed sense of hope for those awaiting the return of their assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the significance of the August 15 record date for FTX creditor distribution? The August 15 record date is the cutoff point to determine which creditors are eligible for the next round of distributions. Only claims recognized and recorded by this date will be included in the upcoming payout. It‚Äôs a critical administrative step before actual payments begin. 2. Does the August 15 record date mean I will receive my funds on that day? No, August 15 is the record date, not the payment date. It‚Äôs the deadline for claim eligibility for this distribution round. The actual payout date will be announced later by the FTX Recovery Trust, following this record date. 3. How can FTX creditors check their claim status? Creditors should regularly check the official FTX bankruptcy claims portal or communicate directly with their appointed legal counsel for updates on their claim status and any required actions. Be cautious of unofficial communications. 4. What types of assets are being recovered for FTX creditor distribution? The FTX Recovery Trust has been recovering a variety of assets, including cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana), fiat currency, real estate, and other investments that were part of the FTX estate. The goal is to maximize the total value for distribution. 5. Is this the final distribution for FTX creditors? It is unlikely that this will be the final distribution. The recovery process is ongoing, with potential for further asset identification and resolution of legal disputes. Creditors should anticipate additional distributions as the FTX Recovery Trust continues its work.

Beyond Lee‚Äôs endorsement, the Bitcoin ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative has gained traction among other influential figures and institutions. Early in 2025, the US Treasury Department published a comprehensive report officially recognizing Bitcoin as digital gold. Additionally, in March, President Donald Trump publicly referred to Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù a sentiment echoed by Crypto Czar David Sacks, who declared that ‚Äú the US strategic reserve functions as a digital Fort Knox for the asset commonly known as digital gold. ‚Äú JUST IN: Crypto Czar David Sacks says the ""US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve. It will be kept as a store of value"" ""The reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called digital gold."" pic.twitter.com/mhini6G9Ug ‚Äî Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 7, 2025 During a Bloomberg interview in June, MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, a longtime advocate for Bitcoin, boldly predicted that bear market cycles are behind us and that Bitcoin is destined to reach $1 million. Crypto analyst ‚ÄúCrypto Busy‚Äù confirmed that BTC maintains strength above its bullish flag breakout pattern. All eyes on the next leg up for $BTC ! Bitcoin is holding strong above the bullish flag breakout. Last week's move was validated with clean structure and sustained momentum. As long as $112K holds, the measured target near $140K remains in play. DYOR pic.twitter.com/8DX4kYhe3u ‚Äî CryptoBusy (@CryptoBusy) July 23, 2025 According to his analysis, maintaining support above $112,000 could propel Bitcoin toward the $140,000 level as the subsequent major target. Bitcoin Price Analysis: RSI at 48.88 Is a Perfect Setup for Next Rally Bitcoin currently trades at $118,160, representing a modest 0.20% decline from its recent all-time high of $123,000. Technical analysis reveals several resistance zones ahead, including an immediate target of around $120,094, followed by a primary objective of $122,013, and an extended target of approximately $128,387. Source: TradingView The current RSI reading of 48.88 occupies neutral territory, having moderated from previously overbought conditions at the all-time high. This RSI positioning indicates Bitcoin retains capacity for additional gains without immediately entering overbought conditions. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $4.3M With 221% APY Staking While Bitcoin prepares for its next significant price surge, a new project called Bitcoin Hyper is gaining attention and has already raised over $4.3 million from early investors. Bitcoin Hyper is developing technology to accelerate and reduce the cost of Bitcoin transactions. Source: Bitcoin Hyper The project also lets people earn money by holding their tokens through staking. Over 237 million HYPER tokens have already been sold , demonstrating strong demand before the token is listed on major exchanges, where anyone can purchase it. Currently, early investors can purchase $HYPER tokens for just $0.012375 each. Plus, they can earn ~221% yearly rewards by staking their tokens, meaning if you hold $1,000 worth of tokens, you could earn $2,210 per year just for keeping them.

2025-07-23T21:00:27,"Crypto Market‚Äôs Fate Hangs On The Last Days Of July","Bitcoin hovers just below its mid‚ÄëMay record at roughly‚ÄØ$119,000, while the global crypto‚Äëasset capitalisation approaches‚ÄØ$4 trillion, but traders say the real test will come in the last week of July, when an unusually dense cluster of US macro‚Äëpolicy events collides with an intensifying legal battle over President‚ÄØTrump‚Äôs tariffs. ‚ÄúThe last few days of July will set the stage for markets for the rest of the year imo. FOMC meeting where dovish dissents are looking very likely. QRA meeting where we will get a look into how willing Bessent is going to be to try to weaponize treasury issuance for the first time since being chair. Tariff letter deadlines. The Supreme Court will begin deliberating on whether tariffs via executive order are legal or not. No big edge on either side right now personally, will just react once we get clarity. Stay frosty,‚Äù Forward Guidance host Felix Jauvin wrote via X. July‚Äôs Final Days Could Shape Crypto The two‚Äëday Federal Open Market Committee meeting on‚ÄØ29‚Äì30‚ÄØJuly is the first shot. Governor Christopher‚ÄØWaller, speaking last week, laid out the case for an immediate 25‚Äëbasis‚Äëpoint rate cut, arguing that tariff‚Äëlinked inflation looks ‚Äútemporary‚Äù and that the labour market is ‚Äúunder strain.‚Äù Related Reading: House Passes Major Bills During ‚ÄòCrypto Week,‚Äô But Significant Changes May Take Time Prediction‚Äëmarket platform Kalshi assigns a 40‚ÄØ% probability to two cuts and a 13‚ÄØ% probability to three cuts by December; Goldman‚ÄØSachs now places the first move in September, but traders emphasise that even a single dovish dissent next week would cement that timetable. As The Kobeissi Letter summed up in a widely shared post: ‚ÄúRate cuts are coming‚ÄØ‚Ä¶‚ÄØNext week‚Äôs Fed meeting will pave the path for a September rate cut.‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott‚ÄØBessent has broken with predecessors‚Äô reticence by all but instructing the central bank to move sooner. ‚ÄúIf [tariff] inflation isn‚Äôt sticky, they could do it sooner than September,‚Äù he told Fox News on‚ÄØ1‚ÄØJuly, after stating two months earlier that ‚Äúthe bond market is sending a signal that the Fed should be cutting.‚Äù Only hours after the Fed decision, Bessent will unveil the Treasury‚Äôs third‚Äëquarter borrowing plans at the Quarterly Refunding Announcement. The agenda published on‚ÄØ11‚ÄØJuly flags a noon release on‚ÄØ30‚ÄØJuly. Desks are watching not just the size but the maturity mix: Bessent‚Äôs advisers have floated heavier use of short‚Äëdated bills to ‚Äúmanage the yield curve,‚Äù a move that would soak up the very cash that cycles into stablecoins and crypto risk. Tariffs Come Back Into Focus Trade policy is the second pressure point. A 7‚ÄØJuly executive order extended reciprocal tariffs and launched a volley of tariff‚Äërate letters to trading partners; the new levies take effect on‚ÄØ1‚ÄØAugust unless renegotiated. Bessent flies to Stockholm next week in a last‚Äëminute bid to defer a mooted 100‚ÄØ% surcharge on Chinese imports, underscoring how fluid the landscape remains. Related Reading: 2025 Crypto Thefts Spike: Stolen Funds Hit $2.7 Billion In H1‚Äì Report Even if diplomats buy time, lawyers may not. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has set 31‚ÄØJuly for expedited oral argument on V.O.S.‚ÄØSelections‚ÄØv.‚ÄØTrump, a case that could decide whether a president can impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Petitioners have already asked the Supreme Court for review before judgment, calling the tariffs a ‚Äú$600‚ÄØbn annual tax.‚Äù A ruling to curtail executive trade powers would remove what many bitcoin bulls see as a long‚Äëterm inflation tail‚Äërisk; the opposite outcome could entrench the policy. Real yields‚Äînow the dominant macro driver of Bitcoin‚Äîmove inversely to rate‚Äëcut expectations and Treasury supply. The benchmark 10‚Äëyear has fallen about 30‚ÄØbp in three sessions to 4.34‚ÄØ%, mirroring BTC‚Äôs 8‚ÄØ% bounce over the same period. For now, the market‚Äôs playbook is simple: Watch the Fed dots, count the bills in the QRA, read the tariff letters‚Äîand, as Jauvin advised, ‚Äústay frosty.‚Äù At press time, total crypto market cap stood at $3.81 trillion.
