2025-07-24T08:40:29,"Bitcoin RSI: Unleashing a Prolonged Bull Run, PlanB Predicts Months of Overbought Conditions","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin RSI: Unleashing a Prolonged Bull Run, PlanB Predicts Months of Overbought Conditions Are you feeling the palpable buzz in the crypto market? Bitcoin has been on an incredible trajectory, captivating investors and analysts alike. But what’s truly driving this momentum, and how long can it last? According to renowned analyst PlanB, the creator of the widely followed Stock-to-Flow model, Bitcoin’s current market behavior, particularly its Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggests we might just be at the beginning of an extended period of strong performance. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; PlanB’s analysis of the Bitcoin RSI points to a sustained overbought condition, mirroring the most explosive phases of past bull cycles. Let’s dive into what this means for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Exactly is the Bitcoin RSI and Why Does it Matter? Before we delve deeper into PlanB’s intriguing prediction, it’s crucial to understand the tool he’s referencing: the Relative Strength Index (RSI). For those new to technical analysis, the RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between zero and 100, providing insights into whether an asset is overbought or oversold. Here’s a quick breakdown: RSI above 70: Typically indicates an overbought condition, suggesting the asset may be overvalued and due for a price correction. RSI below 30: Generally signals an oversold condition, implying the asset may be undervalued and due for a price rebound. RSI between 30 and 70: Suggests the asset is trading within a neutral range, without strong overbought or oversold signals. In the context of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin RSI is a powerful indicator that many traders and investors closely monitor. It helps gauge market sentiment and potential turning points. However, as PlanB’s analysis suggests, sometimes ‘overbought’ isn’t a signal to sell, but rather a characteristic of a strong, enduring bull market. PlanB’s Bold Prediction: A Prolonged Overbought Bitcoin RSI? PlanB recently shared his fascinating observation on X (formerly Twitter), stating that Bitcoin’s (BTC) Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering around 75. What makes this significant is his prediction that the Bitcoin RSI is expected to remain above 80 for several months. This isn’t a random guess; it’s a pattern he identifies by looking back at previous bull cycles. According to PlanB, this sustained high RSI is not an anomaly but a recurring feature of Bitcoin’s most explosive growth phases. He explicitly cited the historical precedents of 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021. In these years, Bitcoin experienced periods where its RSI stayed in the ‘overbought’ territory for extended durations, defying the conventional wisdom that an overbought asset must immediately correct. Instead, it signaled immense buying pressure and a strong upward trend. This perspective offers a refreshing take for many investors who might feel anxious about an ‘overbought’ signal. PlanB, known for his data-driven approach, implies that for Bitcoin, a high RSI during a bull market can simply mean the market is exceptionally strong, not necessarily on the brink of collapse. It’s a testament to the unique market dynamics of Bitcoin during its parabolic runs. Is a Sustained Overbought Bitcoin RSI Truly Unprecedented? While a high RSI might typically trigger caution, PlanB’s assertion that the Bitcoin RSI can remain overbought for months is backed by historical data. Let’s look at some examples from previous cycles: Bull Cycle Year(s) Peak RSI (Approx.) Duration Above 70 (Approx.) Market Behavior 2011 ~95 ~3 months Initial parabolic surge, then significant correction. 2013 ~95 ~4-5 months (two distinct peaks) Massive price appreciation, followed by a bear market. 2017 ~95 ~6 months Extended bull run, reaching all-time highs, before a major correction. 2021 ~90 ~5-6 months (split into two legs) Double-peak bull run, establishing new all-time highs. As the table illustrates, sustained periods of high RSI are indeed a hallmark of Bitcoin’s most aggressive bull markets. This doesn’t mean corrections don’t happen; they do, but often after an extended period of high RSI, or they are shallower and shorter-lived than what might be expected in traditional markets. The challenge lies in discerning whether the current cycle will perfectly mirror these past patterns or present its own unique twists. While history often rhymes, it rarely repeats exactly. Factors like institutional adoption, global macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, adding layers of complexity to the current market. Actionable Insights: Navigating an Overbought Bitcoin RSI Market So, if the Bitcoin RSI is indeed set to remain in overbought territory for an extended period, what does this mean for you as an investor? Understanding this dynamic can help you make more informed decisions, but remember, this is not financial advice, and the crypto market is inherently volatile. Potential Benefits: Continued Price Appreciation: A sustained high RSI in a bull market often signals strong demand and continued upward price momentum. Market Euphoria: Such periods are typically characterized by high investor confidence and excitement, attracting new capital into the ecosystem. Liquidity: High trading volumes ensure ample liquidity, making it easier to enter or exit positions. Potential Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: While prices go up, sharp, sudden pullbacks are common. These can be unsettling for new investors. Risk of Correction: Even in a strong bull market, corrections happen. A prolonged overbought state can make the market susceptible to larger corrections when they do occur. Emotional Trading: The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to impulsive decisions, while sudden dips can trigger panic selling. Actionable Strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital from significant downturns. Profit-Taking Strategy: Have a plan for taking profits. This could involve selling a small percentage of your holdings as Bitcoin reaches new highs, or at specific price targets. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on other market indicators, news, and overall macroeconomic trends. Diversify your information sources beyond just the Bitcoin RSI . Beyond the Bitcoin RSI: Other Indicators to Watch While PlanB’s insights on the Bitcoin RSI are invaluable, it’s always wise to consider a holistic view of the market. No single indicator tells the whole story. Savvy investors often look at a confluence of signals to make their decisions. Here are a few other key indicators and factors that complement RSI analysis: Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model: PlanB’s original model, which predicts Bitcoin’s price based on its scarcity. It suggests a long-term upward trend. On-Chain Metrics: Data directly from the blockchain, such as active addresses, transaction volume, exchange inflows/outflows, and HODLer behavior, can provide deep insights into network health and investor sentiment. Funding Rates: In the derivatives market, positive funding rates often indicate a bullish sentiment, where long positions pay short positions. Macroeconomic Factors: Global interest rates, inflation data, geopolitical events, and the performance of traditional assets can all influence Bitcoin’s price. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reduction events (halvings) have historically preceded major bull runs. By integrating these various data points, investors can build a more robust understanding of Bitcoin’s market position and potential future movements, moving beyond reliance on just one metric. Conclusion: PlanB’s compelling analysis of the Bitcoin RSI offers an exciting outlook for the cryptocurrency market. His prediction of a sustained overbought period, drawing parallels from Bitcoin’s most historic bull cycles, suggests that the current momentum could be far from over. While the term ‘overbought’ might typically evoke caution, in Bitcoin’s unique market dynamics, it often signifies immense strength and continued upward trajectory. As we navigate these potentially thrilling months, remember the importance of understanding the indicators, managing your risks, and making informed decisions based on a comprehensive view of the market. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be a fascinating one, full of both opportunities and challenges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘overbought’ mean for Bitcoin’s RSI? A1: For Bitcoin’s RSI, ‘overbought’ typically means the indicator is above 70, suggesting that the asset has been bought very heavily and may be due for a correction. However, in strong bull markets, as PlanB suggests, it can indicate sustained buying pressure and strong momentum rather than an immediate reversal. Q2: How long can Bitcoin’s RSI stay overbought? A2: Based on historical patterns cited by PlanB, Bitcoin’s RSI has remained in overbought territory (above 70, sometimes above 80) for several months during previous major bull cycles (e.g., 2011, 2013, 2017, 2021). Q3: Is a high Bitcoin RSI always a signal to sell? A3: Not necessarily. While a high RSI can indicate an asset is due for a pullback in traditional markets, for Bitcoin during strong bull runs, a prolonged high RSI can be a characteristic of continued price appreciation. It’s crucial to consider other indicators and market context. Q4: What is PlanB’s Stock-to-Flow model, and how does it relate to RSI? A4: PlanB’s Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model predicts Bitcoin’s price based on its scarcity. While S2F is a long-term valuation model, the RSI is a short-to-medium term momentum indicator. They complement each other by offering different perspectives on Bitcoin’s market health and potential future price action. Q5: What are the risks of investing when Bitcoin’s RSI is overbought? A5: The main risks include increased volatility, potential for sharp but often temporary corrections, and the psychological challenge of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) leading to impulsive decisions. Prudent risk management is key. Q6: Should I only rely on the Bitcoin RSI for my investment decisions? A6: No, it is strongly advised not to rely on any single indicator. The Bitcoin RSI is a valuable tool, but it should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators, on-chain data, fundamental analysis, and macroeconomic factors to form a comprehensive market view.

2025-07-24T08:24:12,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Whales Hold on Binance While OKX Traders Rush to Exit Profits","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holders on Binance are showing signs of strong holding behavior. This, however, contrasts with the profit-taking patterns seen on OKX. Behavioral Divergence Between Binance and OKX Users According to new data shared by CryptoQuant, as Bitcoin traded near $120,000 this week, OKX’s realized price on user deposit addresses has jumped to $97,180. This pointed to a rush of inflows and profit-taking as the market moved higher. During the same period, Binance’s realized price for Bitcoin deposits remained steady at $45,070. This means that users are sticking to their cost bases and resisting the urge to sell despite significant volatility. Such a trend is a major shift from previous rallies where Binance whales actively realized profits, and suggests a decline in large-holder selling pressure. Ethereum shows a similar divergence. With ETH around $3,570, OKX’s realized price has climbed to $3,100, while Binance’s sits at $2,920, increasing gradually rather than in sharp moves. This pattern indicates that Binance users are opting for longer-term positioning instead of reacting to every price swing. On the other hand, OKX user behavior aligns with short-term speculative trading as realized prices rise quickly with market gains. The reduction in profit-taking by Binance whales may point to growing confidence in further upside potential or a simple lack of urgency to exit. What’s Next For Bitcoin and Altcoins This broader holding trend among Binance users may reflect the constructive market structure Swissblock described. In its latest analysis, the analytics firm explained that Bitcoin’s price structure remains bullish despite momentum pausing. Currently, while momentum has stalled, there is no breakdown in structure. This means that Bitcoin is holding its $117.4K support and projecting above $118K even after absorbing selling pressure. As such, buyers remain active, and the uptrend is intact. After recent rallies, altcoins are also in a cooling phase with corrections and drawdowns, which also sets up future opportunities. Swissblock said that most altcoins remain in the “de-risk” quadrant and reflect a cautious market without strong buy signals yet. While a few alts show early signs of recovery, it is not the time for aggressive re-entry. The recommended approach is to wait for a clear transition into the “accumulation quadrant,” where structure and momentum align.

2025-07-24T08:20:23,"Bitcoin Rally: Unleashing the Unprecedented Power of Institutions and Whales","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Rally: Unleashing the Unprecedented Power of Institutions and Whales The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, and for good reason. A significant Bitcoin rally is currently unfolding, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. However, if you’re feeling a sense of déjà vu from previous bull runs, take a closer look. This time, the driving forces behind the market’s ascent appear to be remarkably different, signaling a new era for digital assets. What’s Truly Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Rally ? According to insights shared by crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci of CryptoQuant on X, the current Bitcoin rally is not a replay of past retail-driven frenzies. Instead, it’s primarily propelled by the strategic movements of institutional investors and large-scale holders, often referred to as ‘whales.’ This represents a significant shift in market dynamics. Consider these compelling data points: Retail Exodus: Since early 2023, everyday retail investors have consistently reduced their Bitcoin holdings. This suggests a cautious, or perhaps disengaged, stance from the smaller players who often fueled previous explosive surges. Institutional Influx: In stark contrast, institutional investors have been on an aggressive accumulation spree since the beginning of 2024. These are not your average individual traders; we’re talking about hedge funds, asset managers, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds making calculated, large-scale investments. Whale Activity: Alongside institutions, ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin – have also been actively increasing their positions. Their significant capital allows them to move the market in ways smaller investors cannot. This dichotomy paints a clear picture: while many individual investors might still be on the sidelines, the big players are confidently entering the arena, laying the groundwork for what could be a more sustainable upward trend. Is the Retail Investor Missing Out on the Current Bitcoin Rally ? The absence of widespread retail participation is one of the most intriguing aspects of this particular Bitcoin rally . Burak Kesmeci points to Google Trends data, which shows that search volumes for ‘Bitcoin’ remain comparatively low. This is a critical indicator because high search interest often precedes or accompanies significant retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) – a sentiment that was undeniably present during the euphoric bull run of 2021. Let’s compare the sentiment: Characteristic Current Bitcoin Rally (2024) 2021 Bull Run Primary Drivers Institutions and Whales Retail Investors (significant) Google Search Volume for “Bitcoin” Comparatively Low Very High (peak interest) Retail FOMO Sentiment Minimal to Non-existent Widespread and Intense Market Maturity Increasingly Mature Still Nascent The fact that retail investors have yet to enter the market on a large scale, despite Bitcoin’s impressive performance, leads Kesmeci to believe that there is still significant room for the market to rise. This underlying strength, built on institutional conviction rather than speculative retail exuberance, could suggest a more stable and prolonged growth phase. Understanding the Dynamics: Why This Bitcoin Rally is Different The shift in who is driving the Bitcoin rally has profound implications for the market’s future trajectory. This isn’t just about price; it’s about the fundamental maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Key reasons why this rally stands apart: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Acceptance: The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in major markets has opened doors for traditional finance players to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This regulatory endorsement provides a level of comfort and legitimacy that was absent in previous cycles, making it easier for institutions to allocate capital. Long-Term Horizon: Institutional investors typically operate with a longer investment horizon compared to many retail traders. Their accumulation often signifies a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a digital store of value or a hedge against inflation, rather than short-term speculative gains. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While Bitcoin remains volatile, a market driven by institutional capital can exhibit different patterns. Their measured accumulation and less emotional trading behavior could potentially lead to less dramatic price swings compared to periods dominated by retail FOMO and panic selling. Fundamental Growth vs. Hype: This rally appears to be more rooted in fundamental adoption and infrastructure development rather than pure speculative hype. As more institutions integrate crypto into their portfolios and services, the underlying demand strengthens. The implication is that the market might be building a more robust foundation, less susceptible to the wild swings associated with rapid retail entry and exit. Navigating the Bitcoin Rally : Actionable Insights for Every Investor For those looking to engage with the current market, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand what you’re investing in. Don’t rely solely on headlines or social media trends. Learn about Bitcoin’s technology, its scarcity, and its role in the global financial landscape. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the potential for continued growth and the inherent volatility of crypto, investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly) can mitigate risk. This strategy allows you to average out your purchase price over time, regardless of market fluctuations. Focus on the Long Term: If institutions are accumulating for the long haul, perhaps retail investors should adopt a similar mindset. Short-term trading can be highly risky. Consider Bitcoin as a long-term asset in your diversified portfolio. Stay Informed, Not Emotional: Keep an eye on market analysis from reputable sources like CryptoQuant. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on sudden price movements or social media narratives. The absence of retail FOMO this cycle is a lesson in itself – patience can be a virtue. Understand Market Challenges: While the outlook is positive, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties, macroeconomic shifts, and unforeseen market events can always impact prices. Diversification and risk management are key. The current Bitcoin rally , driven by the strategic advancements of institutions and whales, marks a significant chapter in the cryptocurrency story. It highlights Bitcoin’s growing maturity and its increasing integration into mainstream finance. While the exuberance of retail FOMO might be absent for now, its potential future entry could provide another powerful leg up for the market, making this an exciting time to observe and participate in the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean that institutions and whales are driving the Bitcoin rally? It means that large financial entities (like investment firms, hedge funds) and individuals holding vast amounts of Bitcoin are the primary buyers, accumulating significant quantities of Bitcoin. This differs from past rallies largely driven by many smaller, individual retail investors. Who are ‘whales’ in the cryptocurrency market? Crypto ‘whales’ are individuals or entities that hold exceptionally large amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. Their buying and selling activities can significantly influence market prices due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Why is there low retail FOMO during this Bitcoin rally compared to 2021? Retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is low because search interest for Bitcoin (as indicated by Google Trends) is not as high as it was during the 2021 bull run. This suggests that the general public is not yet widely aware or intensely engaged with the current price movements, unlike the widespread excitement seen previously. Does low retail involvement mean the Bitcoin rally has more room to grow? According to analysts like Burak Kesmeci, yes. If retail investors have not yet entered the market on a large scale, it implies a significant pool of potential buyers who could still contribute to future price increases once they become aware of or feel compelled to join the rally. How can I safely participate in the Bitcoin market given these dynamics? Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to invest consistently over time, focus on long-term holding rather than short-term trading, and always conduct thorough research (DYOR) before making investment decisions. Staying informed through reputable sources and avoiding emotional trading are also crucial. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-24T08:15:37,"Over $100B Gone From Crypto Markets as Altcoins Get Obliterated: Market Watch","Bitcoin’s inability to overcome the $120,000 resistance resulted in another nosedive over the past 12 hours or so, as the asset fell toward $116,000. While that might be somewhat worrisome, the altcoins have charted even more substantial losses, with multiple double-digit losers such as XRP and DOGE from the larger caps. Alts Crash The alternative coins were flying high for a few weeks, which sparked speculation whether the much-anticipated altseason had finally started. After registering massive gains for a while, though, it felt inevitable that there would be a more violent correction, which materialized in the past 12 hours or so. Ripple’s native token is among the leaders in this adverse trend, losing over 11% of value and dropping below $3.1. Some of the blame can be attributed to Upbit. DOGE, XLM, HBAR, and PEPE are the other double-digit losers from the larger-cap alts, while APT has plunged by 16% daily. SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX are also deep in the red. ETH has managed to remain relatively still at around $3,600, while BNB has lost more than $40 since yesterday’s peak above $800. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has shed over $100 billion since yesterday’s top and is down to $3.9 trillion now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Trump will make a surprise visit to the Fed today. Details of the visit are being kept under wraps, and it's not yet known whether there will be a private meeting with Powell. According to the statement made by the White House, Trump will go to the FED building at 23:00 Turkish time. As is well known, Donald Trump has been constantly pressuring Fed Chair Powell. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates sufficiently, calling him an “idiot.” Trump had publicly hinted that he was considering firing Powell. The day before, Trump had stated that Powell should cut interest rates by 3%, saying, “He'll be gone soon anyway.” Trump, who insulted Powell in his statements, such as calling her stupid and awful, stated that Powell was politically motivated and accused her of causing great financial losses to the country and doing a bad job. Trump, who has targeted Powell many times, has begun holding talks with potential Fed chair candidates as Powell's term approaches. While US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed this, Bessent said in a statement to Fox News that the candidates for the next Fed chair are expected to be announced in December or January. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-24T08:10:43,"ETH spot volumes surge ahead of BTC for the first time in a year","As traders kept rolling into ETH, spot volumes surpassed BTC for the first time in a year. The trend reversal follows the recent spike in ETH derivative trading, briefly surpassing the volumes for BTC. Ethereum (ETH) spot volumes surpassed BTC trading for the first time in a year. During the latest price surge, ETH spot volumes broke out, as both retail and whales are trying to tap the token’s growth. As a result of increased interest in spot ETH, exchanges have seen a drawdown on their reserves, with around 8.9M ETH available on spot markets. Derivative exchanges hold around 10M ETH for collaterals. The top 10 exchanges have seen increased outflows in July, signaling additional accumulation to self-custodial wallets. ETH outflows picked up again in July, as whales started accumulating tokens. | Source: CryptoQuant . For now, ETH behaves as a scarce resource, especially on days of peak demand from whales. Spot trading also reflects selling, as some short-term traders buy ETH only to realize profits. ETH whales are also trading their reserves often, to achieve a lower average ETH price. ETH outperformed on the weekly spot trading volumes, rising above BTC activity for the first time since June 2024. ETH spot volumes reached beyond $25.7B in the past week, while BTC stopped at $24.4B. The ETH rally is still seen as shaky, as the token failed to break above $4,000. After a hike above $3,800, ETH consolidated and slid to $3,579.95, though still remaining interesting for traders and spot buyers. The recent price correction follows long liquidations, as more than 91% of positions liquidated were longs. Despite the spike in ETH spot volumes, derivatives are still leading the market trends, especially when attacking specific positions. Following a recent short squeeze, ETH traders are now sweeping the long positions, potentially leading to a brief return to a lower price range. Is ETH overheated? The recent spike of ETH above $3,800 raised the problem of an overheating market. However, ETH has not shown irrational growth and generally moves with a similar pace to other altcoins. ETH dominance fell to 11.1% from a recent high of 11.2%. The token also traded around 0.03 BTC, down from a peak of 0.031 BTC. ETH has shown that short-term pullbacks are possible, though the underlying bullish factors remain. Open interest is close to the three-year high at over $23B, even after the latest liquidations. The Ethereum network currently carries the highest level of transactions since 2023, boosted by stablecoins and a recent renewed interest in NFTs. Daily active addresses are also standing consistently at over 500K. ETH transfers and USDT are the top on-chain activities, burning around 300 ETH coins daily. Another 91 ETH in fees is burned by USDC transfers. ETH accumulation resumes Over the past week, ETFs kept buying ETH even as the BTC buying streak stopped after 12 days. Additionally, whales returned to ETH accumulation , with seven fresh wallets opened for accumulation in the past day. Fresh wallets have accumulated another 40,591 $ETH ($148M) today. Recently, 7 fresh wallets have accumulated 466,253 $ETH ($1.7B). 0x8eEa received 138,345 $ETH ($505M) from #FalconX in the past 5 days. https://t.co/DQQ8Pna5DX 0x9684 received 122,691 $ETH ($448M) from #FalconX in… pic.twitter.com/I9KTZsmKPg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 24, 2025 World Liberty Fi was also among the day’s buyers, adding another 561 ETH. While the amount was not substantial, it remained a signal of support. World Liberty Fi still uses its ETH for DeFi collaterals, often interacting with Aave.

2025-07-24T08:06:51,"Why Has Crypto Dropped Today?","The post Why Has Crypto Dropped Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market just saw a big drop, wiping out more than $130 billion in a single day. After weeks of strong gains, this sharp pullback has left many traders asking one big question: Why is the market crashing now? Many see this drop as a mix of profit-taking, big liquidations, and weak ETF interest. Let’s break it down. Profit-Taking Kicked Things Off The crash began with many traders cashing in on recent gains. Bitcoin had jumped nearly 17% in the past month, pulling altcoins up along with it. After such a strong rally, it was natural for some investors to lock in profits. This wave of selling added pressure across the board, especially on altcoins. In just one day, the total crypto market dropped by 3.3%, but altcoins fell even harder. XRP plunged 12.4%, DOGE lost 14%, and PEPE dropped 13.5% — showing how quickly gains can vanish when traders rush to sell. ETF Inflows Are Slowing Down On top of profit-taking, institutional buying has slowed down too. The Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw three straight days of outflows, with $85.8 million leaving the market on July 23 alone. Fidelity led the charge, followed by ARK Invest and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are also cooling off. Inflows fell to $332 million, down sharply from $726 million the previous week. This slowdown suggests big players are waiting on the sidelines before placing new bets. Liquidations Hit Traders Hard Another big reason for the drop was the huge liquidation of leveraged positions. In the last 24 hours, over 314,000 traders were liquidated, wiping out $968 million , mostly from long trades. Bitcoin’s fall below $118,000 triggered a chain reaction of stop-losses and forced selling. Ethereum saw nearly $195 million in liquidations, while XRP faced $113 million, showing how quickly high leverage can lead to a deep market flush. SEC Pause and Fed Decision Add Worries Adding to the nerves, the SEC decided to pause Bitwise’s new crypto index ETF. Many people thought this ETF would launch soon and bring fresh money into crypto. The reason? XRP’s ongoing legal issues. SEC’s Bitwise ETF “Pause” — Orchestrated? First, they approve it. Then they slam the brakes. Who benefits from confusion while XRP’s rails are being loaded by institutions? The same elite who don’t want you front-running the reset. Question everything. pic.twitter.com/48cs7w7Wy7 — Pumpius (@pumpius) July 23, 2025 On top of that, traders are waiting for the White House’s crypto report and the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate decision, both coming on July 30. Is A Recovery Next? Even with this big red day, many experts believe this is just a healthy break after a strong rally. Bitcoin bounced back to around $119,000 after dipping near $117,000.

2025-07-24T08:00:15,"Bitcoin Consolidates Below $120K as Exchange Activity Reflects Mixed Market Signals","Bitcoin continues to hover below its all-time high, with current trading levels near $118,000 reflecting a 0.6% daily drop and a 3.8% pullback from the peak above $123,000 recorded earlier this month. While the broader trend remains uncertain, analysts have assessed on-chain activity for signs of the next major move. Recent data from CryptoQuant analysts highlights a divide between retail and institutional behavior across leading exchanges, raising questions about potential profit-taking or strategic accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Support For $180,000 Year-End Target, Analyst Says Bitcoin Retail Traders Sell into Strength, While Whales Accumulate On the one hand, short-term holder (STH) behavior on Binance suggests some market participants are opting to take profits following the asset’s strong rally. On the other hand, Kraken has recorded a sharp outflow of Bitcoin, a movement typically associated with whale activity or long-term accumulation. This contrasting activity across platforms suggests a split in market sentiment, with retail traders potentially trimming their exposure and larger players preparing for sustained upside. According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, the Binance Exchange Inflow Ratio for Short-Term Holders recently crossed the 0.4 level, historically linked to increased retail selling pressure. These STHs, who typically hold Bitcoin for fewer than 155 days, tend to deposit funds to exchanges during periods of price strength to lock in gains. The spike above this threshold may indicate a growing tendency among retail investors to exit positions in anticipation of volatility. In contrast, the same analysis pointed to significant outflows from Kraken, with over 9,600 BTC withdrawn on July 22, one of the highest single-day outflows seen in recent months. Taha interpreted this as a potential signal of whale accumulation, with institutional or high-net-worth participants removing assets from exchange custody, often in preparation for long-term storage. This divergence in behavior between Binance and Kraken highlights the differing strategies employed by market segments, with retail users leaning toward short-term positioning and whales opting for long-term accumulation. Binance Reserve Trends Highlight Strengthening Profit Margins Adding another layer to the evolving market picture, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared that Binance’s unrealized profit on its Bitcoin reserves has hit an all-time high of approximately 60,000 BTC. This figure has grown despite a gradual decline in total BTC reserves held on the platform, which have fallen from 631,000 BTC in September 2024 to 574,000 BTC as of now. A portion of these holdings, around 16,000 BTC, is locked in custodial wallets to back the BTCB token on the BNB Chain, serving operational purposes. Darkfost emphasized that decreasing exchange reserves are often interpreted as a sign of investor confidence, reflecting a preference to store Bitcoin in personal wallets rather than leaving it on centralized platforms.
