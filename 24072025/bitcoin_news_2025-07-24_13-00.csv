In the wake of sharp capital flows and rapid changes in investor sentiment, Bitcoin is once again asserting its supremacy. The total crypto market cap has dipped to $3.82 trillion, a decline of 2.75%, even as 24-hour trading volumes soared to $222 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has climbed to 61.52% and Ethereum holds 11.3%. Further highlighting that the ongoing retreat from altcoins, as the Altcoin Season Index drops to just 34/100. With the Fear & Greed Index flashing greed at 67, the market stands at a crossroads between opportunity and caution. If you are one of the curious minds who are keen on what the future might hold, this analysis is for you. Bitcoin Takes Center Stage as Capital Rotates Again? Recent data shows a reversion to ‚ÄúBitcoin season,‚Äù marked by robust inflows into BTC. Investors, fearing uncertain macro catalysts, are reallocating from riskier altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. This shift is underlined by the dominance metric surpassing 61%, levels not seen since past cycles of heightened caution or anticipation for major Bitcoin-specific catalysts. Source: CoinMarketCap At the same time, the market‚Äôs total value has slipped, indicating possible profit-taking, or de-risking. However, the 13.26% surge in trading volume hints at hectic repositioning. Altcoin Season on Pause? The Altcoin Season Index at only 34/100 signals that fewer top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Historically, this metric suggests traders are consolidating holdings into BTC, either due to regulatory nerves, lack of major altcoin narratives, or simply to avoid risks. Source: CoinMarketCap Supporting this, on-chain activity points to increased Bitcoin holding durations, which we call ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù. Where we see thickening order books and consistent net outflows of BTC from exchanges. Each is contributing to supportive price action for Bitcoin while altcoins lag. Successively, the Fear & Greed Index at 67 reflects ongoing appetite for risk, but in the context of falling altcoin performance. Much of this ‚Äúgreed‚Äù may be directed at Bitcoin rather than speculative plays. The narrative is rich in FOMO, but also conscious of downside risk in less liquid assets. The Road Ahead: What to Watch Regulatory clarity or ETF-led institutional flows could further enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs leadership. ETH‚Äôs relative underperformance with an 11.3% dominance may persist if scaling debates and L2 solutions fail to reignite excitement. Renewed risk appetite could bring swift altcoin rebounds, but for now, discipline favors established assets. FAQs Why is Bitcoin dominance rising right now? Investors are moving funds into Bitcoin as a safer play amid recent market volatility and macro uncertainties. With the Altcoin Season Index at 34, is the bull run for altcoins lost? The market is currently favoring BTC over altcoins, possibly to avoid risks. We can expect the trend to renew once the sentiments stabilize.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-dominance-spikes-as-altcoin-season-index-crashes-is-a-sell-off-coming/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-24T10:25:18,"Bitcoin Investment: Satsuma Technology‚Äôs Bold ¬£100M Move Unlocks New Frontiers","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: Satsuma Technology‚Äôs Bold ¬£100M Move Unlocks New Frontiers In a significant development that underscores the growing convergence of cutting-edge technology and digital assets, UK-listed AI infrastructure company Satsuma Technology has announced the successful closure of its secured convertible loan note offering, raising just over ¬£100 million (approximately $135.5 million). This substantial funding is earmarked for two key areas: bolstering their Bitcoin investment strategy and covering essential operating expenses. This move marks a pivotal moment for Satsuma Technology, especially following its recent rebranding from Tao Alpha and its declared intent to strengthen its Bitcoin treasury. What does this mean for the company, and why is a substantial Bitcoin investment a core part of their future? What Exactly is a Convertible Loan, and Why is it Key to Satsuma‚Äôs Bitcoin Investment? To truly appreciate the significance of Satsuma Technology‚Äôs announcement, it‚Äôs helpful to understand the financial instrument at its core: the secured convertible loan note. Unlike traditional loans, a convertible loan offers a unique blend of debt and equity, providing flexibility for both the issuer and the investor. A Hybrid Instrument: At its essence, a convertible loan starts as a debt instrument, meaning Satsuma Technology has borrowed money that accrues interest. However, it comes with a crucial caveat: the lender has the option to convert the debt into equity (shares in the company) at a predetermined price or a discount to a future valuation event. Benefits for Satsuma: For a company like Satsuma, especially one focused on high-growth sectors like AI and pursuing a significant Bitcoin investment strategy, this structure offers several advantages: Immediate Capital Injection: It provides immediate access to substantial capital without the immediate dilution of existing shareholders, which would occur with a direct equity raise. Deferred Valuation: It allows the company to defer a formal valuation until a later stage, potentially when its growth and market position are stronger, leading to a higher valuation for equity conversion. Lower Initial Interest Rates: Convertible loans often carry lower interest rates than traditional debt, as investors are compensated by the potential upside of converting to equity. Benefits for Investors: Investors in Satsuma‚Äôs convertible loan gain the security of a debt instrument (it‚Äôs ‚Äòsecured,‚Äô meaning there‚Äôs collateral) while also retaining the exciting upside potential of participating in the company‚Äôs growth if it performs well, especially given its bold Bitcoin investment strategy. The fact that this loan is ‚Äòsecured‚Äô adds an extra layer of confidence for investors, indicating a lower risk profile compared to unsecured debt. This substantial funding, as reported by Investigate, provides Satsuma with the financial muscle to execute its ambitious plans. Satsuma‚Äôs Strategic Evolution: Why a Strong Bitcoin Investment Treasury? Satsuma Technology‚Äôs journey has seen a notable strategic pivot, highlighted by its rebranding from Tao Alpha and a clear declaration of intent to strengthen its Bitcoin treasury strategy. This isn‚Äôt just about holding some digital assets; it‚Äôs a deliberate and calculated move that reflects a deeper understanding of macroeconomics and the evolving financial landscape. Why would an AI infrastructure company commit to a robust Bitcoin investment strategy? Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: In an era of increasing global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, many corporations are looking for alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô is seen by many as a decentralized, scarce asset that can act as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value over the long term. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply cap (21 million coins) contrasts sharply with the potentially infinite supply of fiat currencies, which can be devalued by central bank policies. This scarcity is a core tenet of its appeal as a long-term Bitcoin investment . Strategic Diversification: For a forward-thinking company like Satsuma, adding Bitcoin to its treasury provides diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in the long run. Alignment with Innovation: As an AI infrastructure company, Satsuma operates at the forefront of technological innovation. Embracing Bitcoin, a groundbreaking digital asset, aligns with its core identity and vision for the future. It signals a willingness to adopt pioneering technologies not just in its primary business but also in its financial management. This commitment to a Bitcoin investment strategy positions Satsuma Technology among a growing list of public companies that are recognizing Bitcoin‚Äôs potential beyond mere speculation, viewing it as a legitimate treasury asset. How Will This ¬£100M Fuel Both AI Infrastructure and Bitcoin Investment? The ¬£100 million proceeds from the convertible loan are designated for two primary uses: operating expenses and Bitcoin investment . This dual allocation is crucial for understanding Satsuma‚Äôs immediate and long-term goals. The synergy here is clear: the capital generated from the loan will directly fund the company‚Äôs operational needs, ensuring that its AI infrastructure development continues unimpeded. This includes: Research and Development (R&D): Investing in cutting-edge AI technologies, algorithms, and hardware to maintain a competitive edge. Talent Acquisition: Attracting and retaining top-tier engineers, data scientists, and AI specialists. Infrastructure Expansion: Building and upgrading the physical and digital infrastructure necessary to support advanced AI operations. General Operating Costs: Covering day-to-day expenses that keep the business running smoothly. Simultaneously, a portion of these funds will be strategically allocated to Bitcoin investment . This isn‚Äôt just a speculative gamble; it‚Äôs an asset management decision aimed at potentially growing the company‚Äôs reserves over time. The idea is that any significant appreciation in their Bitcoin holdings could provide additional capital for future operational needs, further R&D, or even strategic acquisitions, creating a virtuous cycle where successful financial strategy supports technological advancement. The Broader Trend: Is Corporate Bitcoin Investment Becoming the New Normal? Satsuma Technology‚Äôs move is not an isolated incident but rather part of a burgeoning trend among corporations to include Bitcoin in their balance sheets. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and Marathon Digital Holdings have all made significant forays into Bitcoin investment , each for their own strategic reasons. This trend is driven by several factors: Inflation Concerns: As discussed, a primary driver is the desire to protect corporate treasuries from the erosive effects of inflation on fiat currencies. Digital Transformation: Companies at the forefront of digital innovation often see Bitcoin as a natural extension of their embrace of new technologies. Shareholder Value: Some executives believe that holding Bitcoin can increase shareholder value by providing exposure to a high-growth asset class and demonstrating a forward-thinking approach. Attracting Talent and Customers: In an increasingly crypto-aware world, a company‚Äôs embrace of digital assets can appeal to a younger, tech-savvy workforce and customer base. While the volatility of Bitcoin remains a concern for some, the increasing institutional adoption suggests a growing confidence in its long-term viability as a legitimate asset class. Satsuma Technology is clearly betting on this future. Navigating the Waters: What are the Risks and Rewards of This Bitcoin Investment Strategy? While the potential rewards of a significant Bitcoin investment are substantial, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks. Bitcoin is famously volatile, with its price subject to rapid and sometimes dramatic fluctuations. This volatility can be influenced by a myriad of factors, including: Market Sentiment: News, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends can quickly shift investor sentiment. Regulatory Landscape: Uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulations in various jurisdictions can impact price stability. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic shifts, interest rate changes, and inflation data can all play a role. For Satsuma Technology, managing this volatility will be key. While the press release doesn‚Äôt detail their specific risk management strategies, typical approaches for corporate Bitcoin holders include: Long-Term Horizon: Viewing Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset rather than a short-term trade, riding out market cycles. Diversification: Not putting all their eggs in one basket, ensuring the Bitcoin holdings are part of a broader, diversified treasury strategy. Transparency: Clearly communicating their strategy to investors and stakeholders. The rewards, however, could be transformative. A significant appreciation in their Bitcoin holdings could provide Satsuma with a powerful, non-dilutive source of capital to reinvest in its core AI business, accelerate growth, and potentially establish itself as a leader at the intersection of AI and decentralized finance. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? Satsuma Technology‚Äôs move highlights an exciting trend: the convergence of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Both fields represent the cutting edge of technological innovation, and their integration holds immense potential. Decentralized AI: Could Bitcoin-backed treasuries lead to more decentralized AI development, less reliant on traditional venture capital structures? New Business Models: Companies leveraging crypto assets might unlock new revenue streams or operational efficiencies previously unimaginable. Increased Legitimacy: Each major corporate Bitcoin investment adds another layer of legitimacy and mainstream acceptance to the cryptocurrency space, paving the way for wider adoption. Satsuma Technology, by strategically positioning itself with a robust Bitcoin investment and a focus on AI infrastructure, is not just participating in these trends; it‚Äôs actively shaping them. Their success could serve as a blueprint for other tech companies looking to innovate both technologically and financially. Satsuma Technology‚Äôs successful closure of its ¬£100 million convertible loan offering marks a significant milestone, cementing its commitment to both advanced AI infrastructure and a strategic Bitcoin investment . This bold move, following its rebranding from Tao Alpha, positions the company at the vanguard of a new era where cutting-edge technology and digital assets intertwine. By leveraging this substantial funding for operational growth and a robust Bitcoin treasury, Satsuma aims to secure its financial future while driving innovation in the AI sector. It‚Äôs a compelling example of how companies are increasingly embracing the potential of digital assets to diversify, hedge against economic uncertainties, and unlock new avenues for growth in an ever-evolving global economy. The world will be watching to see how this strategic fusion of AI and crypto unfolds for Satsuma Technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a secured convertible loan note? A secured convertible loan note is a type of debt instrument that allows the lender to convert the loan into equity (shares) in the company at a future date, usually at a predetermined price or discount. Being ‚Äòsecured‚Äô means the loan is backed by collateral, reducing risk for the lender. Why did Satsuma Technology choose a Bitcoin investment strategy? Satsuma Technology chose a Bitcoin investment strategy to diversify its treasury assets, potentially hedge against inflation, and benefit from Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential as a store of value. It also aligns with their identity as an innovative AI infrastructure company. How will the ¬£100 million be used by Satsuma Technology? The ¬£100 million will be used for two primary purposes: funding essential operating expenses for their AI infrastructure development and making strategic investments in Bitcoin to strengthen their treasury. What are the main risks associated with Satsuma‚Äôs Bitcoin investment? The primary risk is Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility. While it offers significant upside potential, its value can fluctuate rapidly due to market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic factors. Has Satsuma Technology rebranded recently? Yes, Satsuma Technology recently rebranded from its previous name, Tao Alpha, signaling a renewed focus and strategic direction that now prominently includes a strengthened Bitcoin treasury strategy.

2025-07-24T10:11:07,"Onchain Analysis Platform CryptoQuant Reveals the Source of Bitcoin's Recent Rise! Here Are the Details","According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin bull cycle is largely driven by institutional investors and individuals with high portfolio values. CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Rise Driven by Institutions, Retail Investors Not Yet Involved Analysts state that individual investors have tended to sell since the beginning of 2023, while institutions have entered a period of serious accumulation since the beginning of 2024. According to Google Trends data, search volumes for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù are still low, and the FOMO (fear of missing out) behavior driven by retail investors seen during the 2021 bull market is absent. This suggests that retail investors have not yet entered the market on a large scale.

2025-07-24T10:10:24,"Finder Earn: A Landmark Victory for Crypto Innovation in Australia","BitcoinWorld Finder Earn: A Landmark Victory for Crypto Innovation in Australia The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, often outstripping the pace of traditional regulation. In Australia, a recent court decision has sent ripples through the fintech sector, providing much-needed clarity on the legal status of certain crypto-related products. Specifically, the Australian Federal Court has delivered a landmark ruling regarding Finder Earn , a yield-generating product offered by the popular fintech company Finder.com. This decision, which found that Finder Earn is not a financial product under Australian law, marks a significant moment for crypto innovation and regulatory frameworks down under. What Exactly is Finder Earn , and Why Was It Under Scrutiny? To understand the significance of this ruling, it is crucial to first grasp what Finder Earn is and why it attracted the attention of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Finder Earn was a product that allowed Finder.com customers to deposit Australian dollars (AUD) with the promise of a fixed, attractive yield. Finder would then use these AUD deposits to invest in a portfolio of digital assets, primarily stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, through third-party platforms. The returns generated from these investments were then passed back to the customers. ASIC, Australia‚Äôs corporate regulator, viewed Finder Earn with concern. Their primary argument was that the product constituted an ‚Äòunlicensed financial product,‚Äô specifically a ‚Äòmanaged investment scheme‚Äô or a ‚Äòdeposit facility‚Äô that should be regulated under the Corporations Act 2001. ASIC‚Äôs mandate is to protect consumers and ensure market integrity, and they believed that products like Finder Earn , offering returns on pooled funds, carried risks that required the oversight and protections afforded by financial product licensing. The regulator‚Äôs contention was that customers were essentially pooling their money, with Finder managing the investments on their behalf, and expecting a return from those efforts. This structure, in ASIC‚Äôs view, resembled traditional financial products that are subject to stringent regulations designed to safeguard investors. The legal battle centered on whether the specific mechanics and characteristics of Finder Earn fit the existing definitions of regulated financial products. The Federal Court‚Äôs Unanimous Verdict: What Does It Mean for Finder Earn ? After a thorough examination, the Australian Federal Court ruled decisively in favor of Finder.com, upholding the initial decision that Finder Earn is not a financial product. This ruling means that the product, as structured, does not fall under the purview of Australia‚Äôs Corporations Act as a ‚Äòmanaged investment scheme‚Äô or a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô requiring specific licensing and disclosure obligations. The court‚Äôs reasoning hinged on a critical distinction: while Finder Earn did involve a ‚Äòdeposit facility,‚Äô it did not meet the criteria of a ‚Äòmanaged investment scheme‚Äô because customers were not pooling their money to produce a return from the ‚Äòcollective efforts‚Äô of the scheme‚Äôs operator. Instead, the court viewed it more akin to a simple debt or loan arrangement where Finder owed the customers their principal plus a fixed interest rate, regardless of the underlying performance of Finder‚Äôs digital asset investments. The risk was primarily counterparty risk with Finder, rather than investment risk in a pooled fund managed by Finder. Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of the court‚Äôs key findings: Not a Managed Investment Scheme: The court determined that the returns on Finder Earn were fixed and independent of the performance of the underlying crypto assets managed by Finder. Customers were not investing in a scheme where their returns depended on the collective efforts of Finder in managing a portfolio. A Deposit Facility, But Not a Financial Product: While the product was acknowledged as a ‚Äòdeposit facility‚Äô where customers deposited money, it did not automatically qualify as a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô requiring specific licensing under the Corporations Act in the context ASIC argued. Focus on Contractual Obligation: The relationship was primarily a contractual one where Finder owed a fixed return, similar to a loan, rather than an investment where the customer bore the direct risk of the underlying asset performance. This nuanced interpretation highlights the challenges regulators face in applying existing laws to novel crypto products that often blur the lines between traditional financial instruments and new digital asset functionalities. Why is This Finder Earn Ruling a Game-Changer for Australian Crypto? The Federal Court‚Äôs decision on Finder Earn is far more than just a win for one company; it establishes a significant legal precedent for the entire Australian cryptocurrency and fintech landscape. This ruling provides a degree of regulatory certainty that has long been sought by businesses operating in the digital asset space. Prior to this, many crypto yield products operated in a grey area, uncertain whether they would be deemed financial products and thus subject to extensive and often ill-fitting regulations designed for traditional finance. This ambiguity created barriers to innovation, discouraged investment, and posed compliance risks for companies. The implications are substantial: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: Companies offering similar fixed-yield products may now have clearer guidance on whether their offerings fall outside the existing financial product definitions. This can foster greater confidence for businesses to innovate and expand in Australia. Innovation Boost: With clearer boundaries, fintech companies can design products with a better understanding of the regulatory landscape, potentially leading to more diverse and sophisticated crypto offerings for Australian consumers. Potential for Global Influence: While a national ruling, Australia‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation is watched globally. This nuanced interpretation could influence how other jurisdictions consider fixed-yield crypto products, especially in common law systems. Consumer Choice: For consumers, this means continued access to products like Finder Earn , which offer alternative ways to earn returns on their capital, albeit with different risk profiles than traditional banking products. It is important to note that this ruling does not mean all crypto products are unregulated. Products that truly involve pooled investments where returns are tied to the collective performance of managed assets, or those offering derivatives or other complex financial instruments, would likely still fall under ASIC‚Äôs regulatory scope. This decision specifically clarifies the status of a particular type of fixed-yield product. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: What‚Äôs Next for Crypto in Australia? While the Finder Earn ruling offers clarity, it also underscores the ongoing need for a comprehensive and tailored regulatory framework for digital assets in Australia. Existing laws, designed for a different era of finance, often struggle to adequately address the unique characteristics and risks of crypto. ASIC‚Äôs appeal in this case demonstrates their commitment to consumer protection and their belief that more crypto activities should fall under their oversight. Despite the court‚Äôs decision, ASIC will likely continue to advocate for stronger regulation of the crypto sector. The Australian government has also signaled its intention to develop a more specific regulatory framework for digital assets, moving beyond trying to fit crypto into existing financial laws. Future regulatory developments could include: New Legislation: The government may introduce specific laws to regulate digital asset service providers, stablecoins, and other crypto activities, creating bespoke frameworks rather than relying on interpretations of existing ones. Consumer Protection Measures: Even if a product is not deemed a ‚Äòfinancial product,‚Äô regulators may still seek to implement consumer protection measures through other avenues, such as marketing standards, dispute resolution mechanisms, or risk disclosure requirements. Global Harmonization: Australia will likely continue to observe and potentially align with international efforts to regulate crypto, as digital assets transcend national borders. The conversation will undoubtedly shift from trying to categorize crypto into old boxes to creating new, fit-for-purpose regulatory approaches that balance innovation with investor safety. Empowering Consumers: Understanding Your Rights and Responsibilities with Finder Earn and Similar Products For consumers, the Finder Earn ruling provides clarity but also highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the products they engage with. Just because a product is not classified as a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô does not mean it is risk-free or unregulated in every sense. It simply means it doesn‚Äôt fall under the specific consumer protections and licensing requirements of the Corporations Act as a managed investment scheme. Here‚Äôs a comparison to illustrate the differences in regulatory oversight and risk: Feature Finder Earn (Post-Ruling) Traditional Bank Deposit (e.g., Term Deposit) Regulatory Status Not a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô under current ruling; viewed as a debt/loan arrangement. Regulated ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô under the Corporations Act. Consumer Protection Less direct ASIC oversight as a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô; relies on general consumer law. Covered by deposit guarantees (e.g., Financial Claims Scheme) and extensive financial services regulation. Return Mechanism Fixed rate on deposited AUD funds, independent of underlying crypto asset performance. Fixed or variable interest on AUD, typically backed by bank‚Äôs balance sheet. Underlying Exposure Finder uses funds for lending to crypto businesses; exposure to counterparty risk. Funds used for general banking operations, loans, etc.; exposure to bank‚Äôs solvency. Primary Risk Profile Higher (counterparty risk with Finder, operational risks of crypto lending). Lower (bank solvency, government deposit guarantee up to a certain limit). It is paramount for consumers to conduct their own due diligence before engaging with any crypto product. This includes: Understanding the Terms: Read the terms and conditions carefully. How are returns generated? What are the withdrawal policies? Assessing Risk: Be aware of the risks involved, including the potential loss of principal. Understand the counterparty risk ‚Äì if the company providing the service fails, your funds could be at risk. Company Background: Research the company offering the product. What is their reputation? How long have they been operating? Diversification: Never put all your funds into a single product, especially in the volatile crypto space. The Finder Earn ruling underscores that innovation often moves faster than regulation. While this provides opportunities, it also places a greater onus on individuals to be informed and cautious. The Australian Federal Court‚Äôs ruling on Finder Earn is a truly landmark decision, injecting a significant dose of clarity into Australia‚Äôs evolving crypto regulatory landscape. By determining that Finder Earn is not a financial product under current law, the court has provided crucial guidance for fintech companies and potentially paved the way for more innovation in the digital asset space. While ASIC‚Äôs commitment to consumer protection remains unwavering, this judgment highlights the nuanced challenges of applying traditional financial regulations to novel crypto offerings. This precedent will undoubtedly shape future discussions and legislative efforts, aiming to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring robust consumer safeguards in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The path forward for Australian crypto regulation will likely involve new, purpose-built frameworks that can adapt to the unique characteristics of digital assets, rather than trying to force them into existing molds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly was the Australian Federal Court‚Äôs ruling on Finder Earn? A1: The Australian Federal Court ruled that Finder Earn, a yield-generating product, is not a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô under the Corporations Act 2001. Specifically, it was deemed a ‚Äòdeposit facility‚Äô but not a ‚Äòmanaged investment scheme‚Äô requiring a financial services license, as its returns were fixed and not dependent on the collective performance of underlying assets. Q2: Why did ASIC challenge Finder Earn? A2: ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) challenged Finder Earn because they believed it operated as an unlicensed financial product, potentially a ‚Äòmanaged investment scheme,‚Äô which would require stricter regulation to protect consumers from associated risks. Q3: How does this ruling impact other crypto products in Australia? A3: This ruling sets a significant legal precedent, offering clearer guidance for other fixed-yield crypto products that operate similarly to Finder Earn. It suggests that if a product‚Äôs returns are fixed and independent of the performance of underlying managed assets, it might not be classified as a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô under current law, potentially fostering more innovation in the sector. Q4: Does this mean Finder Earn is completely unregulated? A4: No. While it‚Äôs not classified as a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô under the specific terms ASIC argued, Finder.com, like any business, is still subject to general consumer protection laws and other applicable regulations. However, it does not fall under the stringent licensing and disclosure requirements typically applied to managed investment schemes. Q5: What should consumers consider when using products like Finder Earn? A5: Consumers should always conduct thorough due diligence. Understand that even if a product isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòfinancial product‚Äô under specific acts, it still carries risks, including counterparty risk (the risk that the company might fail). Always read terms and conditions, assess the company‚Äôs reputation, and consider diversifying your investments. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the so-called ‚ÄúTrump trade,‚Äù with the president-elect‚Äôs positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $115,675, beginning a bearish trend to $107,777. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $118.5K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its ‚Äúhalving‚Äù events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we‚Äôll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491.

Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of ‚ÄúBitcoin bubble‚Äù in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October‚Äôs Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare

2025-07-24T10:00:39,"Dogecoin Retests Crucial Support Following 8.6% Drop ‚Äì Here Are The Levels To Watch","Dogecoin (DOGE) has retraced alongside the rest of the market to retest a crucial level as support. Some analysts suggest that holding its current price range would set the stage for reclaiming the next key area. Related Reading: PENGU Leads Top Memecoin List Amid 20% Daily Surge ‚Äì What‚Äôs Behind The Rally? Dogecoin Retests Breakout Levels On Wednesday, Dogecoin momentum saw a momentary pause as Bitcoin and most of the market‚Äôs rally slowed down. The leading memecoin has recorded a massive run over the past week, increasing over 25% in the last seven days. At the start of the month, DOGE recovered from the June pullback and climbed to the $0.20 level for the first time since May. After reclaiming this crucial level mid-July, the cryptocurrency consolidated around this area, building a base before resuming its bullish run last Wednesday. Over the weekend, Dogecoin broke out of the $0.23-$0.24 resistance, soaring past the May highs to hit the $0.28 area on Monday. The token near this level on Tuesday, hovering between the $0.26-$0.27 price range. However, today‚Äôs pullback saw the memecoin drop approximately 9% in the daily timeframe and retest its breakout level around the $0.23 mark. Despite the correction, crypto analyst Kaleo affirmed that ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not stacking Dogecoin on the retest of this breakout, you‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù The analyst highlighted that the token is repeating its Q4 2024 performance, when it retested its breakout level as support before starting the explosive rise to its multi-year high of $0.48. Amid the retracement, Ali Martinez also asserted that DOGE is retesting the neckline of its double bottom pattern, situated around the $0.25 mark. To the analyst, ‚ÄúThis is a key support zone that could offer a solid entry point before the next leg up.‚Äù Notably, he previously suggested that as long as the token holds this area as support, a rally toward the $0.33-$0.40 is likely, adding that the next major resistance barrier is at $0.36. DOGE Weekly And Monthly To Determine Next Move Rekt Capital noted that Dogecoin has successfully retested its multi-year technical uptrend as support, which enabled its rally to the upside. He explained that price is currently ‚Äúpressing beyond its pre-halving highs,‚Äù around the $0.22 level. A monthly close above this area would position Dogecoin price for a post-breakout retest of this level as support in August. The analyst highlighted that DOGE‚Äôs Pre-Bitcoin halving levels are confluent with the neckline of the double bottom pattern recorded in the Weekly chart. Rekt Capital explained that ‚Äúany dips on the Weekly timeframe into the ~$0.22 region would figure a post-breakout retest attempt of the Double Bottom to fully confirm a breakout, whereas on the Monthly any dips would figure as a key technical milestone to finally turn Pre-Halving highs into new support.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Price On The Verge: Banks And State Buy To Push ETH Above $5,500? Nonetheless, Dogecoin‚Äôs re-challenge of the $0.27 resistance depends on the success of the ongoing retests, as it would signal that this area is weakening as a rejection point and making a reclaim more likely during the next attempt. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.24, a 54% increase in the monthly timeframe.
