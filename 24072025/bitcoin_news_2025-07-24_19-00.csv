2025-07-24T16:55:15,"Wallets Linked to Trump-Affiliated World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Add $36,767,736 Worth of Ethereum: Report","The Trump-affiliated decentralized finance (DeFi) project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has been on an Ethereum-buying spree. On-chain analyst Ai tells their 102,900 followers on the social media platform X that three WLFI addresses accumulated 10,013.54 Ethereum ( ETH ) in just six days. The trove was accumulated for approximately $35.98 million, with an average purchase price of $3,593 per ETH, according to the analyst. President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent financial disclosure with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics indicated he pocketed more than $57.3 million worth of income from World Liberty. Recently, however, a corporate entity linked to Trump and his family quietly slashed its equity stake in the DeFi platform.¬†The Trump-affiliated company DT Marks DEFI LLC previously owned a 60% stake in World Liberty. Fine print on the platform‚Äôs website now indicates DT Marks owns approximately 40% of the equity interests in WLF Holdco LLC, which holds the only membership interest in World Liberty Financial. World Liberty notes that WLF Holdco holds all the rights to net protocol revenues from the DeFi platform, except for net proceeds from the sale of WLFI tokens. The platform also notes that neither Trump nor any of his family members ‚Äúis an officer, director, or employee of WLF Holdco LLC or World Liberty Financial.‚Äù World Liberty launched the stablecoin USD1, which is designed to keep a 1:1 peg to the US dollar, in March.

2025-07-24T16:53:20,"Strategy raises equity sale to $2 billion, 4x its original fundraising goal","Strategy, the company run by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has boosted its preferred equity sale to $2 billion, four times the initial $500 million, according to Bloomberg. The company is moving ahead with the sale of its Series A Perpetual Stretch preferred shares , which will be priced at $90 each at noon on Thursday in New York. That‚Äôs a 10% discount from the face value of $100, and the shares will come with an initial 9% dividend, based on information shared ahead of the pricing. The move is part of Strategy‚Äôs broader push to raise cash as it continues buying more Bitcoin. This offering comes at a time when the company‚Äôs stock has surged 42.5% year-to-date, and is trading around $412.31 per share as of 10:58 a.m. Thursday, putting the company‚Äôs market value at $115 billion. Strategy taps Wall Street banks for expanded offering The offering is being managed by a group of banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis & Company, and TD Securities. The sale will include 5 million Stretch shares, a number confirmed by Bloomberg. These preferred shares are designed to sit above Strategy‚Äôs Strike and Stride series, as well as its common stock , but they‚Äôll rank below its Strife series and previous convertible bonds. What makes this latest offering different from Strategy‚Äôs older preferred shares is the dividend structure. The Stretch shares will pay cumulative dividends, and the rate isn‚Äôt fixed. The company will have the right to raise the dividend by any amount each month or cut it by no more than 0.25% per year plus any fall in the one-month SOFR rate. This gives Strategy the ability to adjust payouts depending on short-term interest movements. Bitcoin purchases remain the end goal The cash raised from this $2 billion sale is headed straight into Bitcoin. Strategy has confirmed that proceeds will be used to increase its crypto holdings, which currently stand at 607,770 coins, worth about $72.4 billion, based on prices listed on the company‚Äôs website. Saylor began buying Bitcoin in late 2020, using a mix of common equity, preferred shares, and debt. That same method is still being used, and dozens of companies have since followed the same approach. But none have gone as far as Strategy, which still holds more Bitcoin than any other public company. Even BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which controls around $86 billion in Bitcoin, is behind Strategy in direct holdings. Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal remains tied to its supply cap of 21 million coins, a hard limit coded into the network. Features like the quadrennial halving events, which cut block rewards for miners every four years, have helped support its scarcity narrative. The final Bitcoin isn‚Äôt expected to be mined until 2140. Strategy‚Äôs stock price has risen by more than 3,500% since Saylor first pushed the company into Bitcoin. Over the same period, Bitcoin itself climbed about 1,100%, while the S&P 500 only managed a 120% gain. Every part of this capital raise, the expanded share count, the dividend structure, the adjusted pricing, and the use of proceeds, shows that Strategy‚Äôs approach hasn‚Äôt changed. The company is using the same aggressive formula: raise capital, buy Bitcoin, and hold.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $187 (-1%) Market Cap $105.45 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $10.73 Billion Circulating Supply 538.04 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $191 24-hour Low $185 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $153.91 200-Day SMA $163.72 Price Prediction $412.15¬†(118.42%) F & G Index 34.79¬†(fear) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 14-Day RSI 83.82 Solana price analysis: SOL attempts a recovery above $190 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows volatility around $190 Resistance for SOL is at $200 Support for SOL/USD is at $185 The price analysis of Solana for July 24 shows that SOL failed to climb past $190, resulting in a volatility around $187. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL faces minor bearish pressure Solana despite crossing past the $190 resistance found it difficult to cross past $200 as the bullish momentum was stretched thin. The technical suggested a trend correction that resulted in the rapid decline observed today. Currently the price has fallen to $187 but is yet to find a support at the level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 64.26, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising bearish pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market as SOL falls back to $185. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady rise as the bulls aimed to hold above the $190 price level. However, the recent crash suggests a retracement back to the $185 region suggesting consolidation at the level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at -1.95, with the indicator showing rising bearish momentum with recent candles. This suggests that SOL is yet to find a support at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) fell to 48, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downwards direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $180 level.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour charts indicates minor resistance around $203. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $185, SOL can be expected to fall to $180, a key level that needs to be defended for the bullish rally to continue towards $240. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana, despite crossing past the $180 resistance, found it difficult to cross past $200 as the bullish momentum was stretched thin. The technicals suggested a trend correction that resulted in the rapid decline observed today. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana‚Äôs forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-07-24T16:22:22,"ATOM Surges 7% After Sharp Plunge to $4.47 Support Level","After a heavy bout of selling pressure during the early hours of July 24, ATOM demonstrated impressive resilience, rebounding from an intraday low of $4.47 to close the session at $4.77. The 7% swing within 24 hours‚Äîdefined by a peak at $4.82 and a low at $4.47‚Äîwas supported by heavy volume exceeding 2.28 million units, signaling strong interest at the lower boundary. The rapid absorption of sell-side pressure and the subsequent recovery reflect a robust technical foundation, with $4.47 now emerging as a key support level to watch. Zooming into the final hour of trading, ATOM managed a further display of bullish resolve. It opened the hour at $4.69 and mounted a sustained rally, briefly breaching the $4.80 resistance zone on volume exceeding 77,000 units. While that push higher was met with fast distribution near the top, leading to a late-session dip back to $4.74, the token still notched a 1% gain for the hour. The pattern underscores opportunistic profit-taking near resistance but doesn't negate the constructive tone built from the morning recovery. ATOM‚Äôs strong showing comes at a time when broader market sentiment is shifting. After a week that many dubbed ‚Äúaltcoin season‚Äù with rampant gains across second-tier tokens, the tide appears to be turning. Several altcoins are now seeing pullbacks, weighed down by shifting risk appetite and the gravitational pull of BTC and ETH volatility. In that context, ATOM‚Äôs ability to hold higher ground and attract volume at key levels suggests it may be better positioned than peers to weather this cooling phase in the altcoin cycle. Technical Indicators Highlight Key Levels Overall trading range of $0.33 representing 7% fluctuation between $4.82 maximum and $4.47 minimum. Strong volume support established at $4.47 level with trading exceeding 2.28 million units. Critical resistance threshold identified at $4.80 with elevated volume exceeding 77,000 units. Recovery momentum from $4.47 low to $4.77 close indicating buyer absorption of selling pressure. Late-session profit-taking activity near resistance levels while maintaining bullish trajectory.

2025-07-24T16:22:21,"Ether Holds Firm as Analysts See Continued Outperformance Over Bitcoin","Ethereum‚Äôs native token, Ether (ETH), remains in a strong uptrend despite a recent 9% pullback from its seven-month peak. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that ETH has bounced back to reclaim the $3,600 level after a brief dip to $3,500 during early Asian trading hours on Thursday. This rebound has sparked optimism among market analysts and on-chain data providers, who believe Ether‚Äôs long-term bullish momentum is intact. Lower Selling Pressure Signals Strength One key factor supporting Ether‚Äôs continued strength is the ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio. According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs latest Weekly Crypto Report, this ratio remains low compared to Bitcoin, indicating that ETH is facing relatively less selling pressure. ‚ÄúLower ETH/BTC exchange inflow ratio indicates lower selling pressure for ETH,‚Äù CryptoQuant noted. ‚ÄúThis continues to be a bullish signal for ETH relative to Bitcoin, potentially supporting further upside in the ETH/BTC pair.‚Äù The ratio had previously hit a five-year low in May, highlighting the reduced amount of ETH being sent to exchanges compared to BTC. Although it has since edged higher, it remains well below the red zone that typically signals increased selling activity. Investors Increasing Exposure to Ether Another supportive metric is the ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio, which has surged from 0.02 in May to 0.12 currently. CryptoQuant interprets this as a sign that investors are increasingly allocating more funds to ETH relative to Bitcoin. This shift in investment patterns indicates ‚Äúincreasing demand for ETH at the margin,‚Äù potentially reinforcing Ether‚Äôs price resilience and long-term outperformance. Spot Ethereum ETFs Attract Strong Inflows Spot Ethereum ETFs also showed robust performance recently. On Wednesday, the funds posted their seventh-best day for inflows since launching, pulling in $332.2 million in a single day. In stark contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows totaling $285.2 million over a three-day period. In total, Ethereum spot ETFs have accumulated nearly $8.7 million in net inflows and now manage over $16.6 billion in assets. This consistent inflow demonstrates rising investor confidence in ETH and its future potential. Key ETH Price Levels to Watch On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has outlined important Ether price levels based on its cost basis model, which includes realized prices and market means. To the downside, strong support sits in the $2,000‚Äì$3,000 range, with specific levels at $2,100 (realized price), $2,500 (true market mean), and $3,000 (active realized price). ‚ÄúThis price range would serve as an important level of support in the event that the price corrects back toward it,‚Äù Glassnode wrote. To the upside, the primary resistance level is at $4,500, which is one standard deviation above Ether‚Äôs active realized price. This level has historically marked significant market resistance during periods of euphoria, including the March 2024 peak and the 2020‚Äì2021 cycle. ‚ÄúBreakouts above this threshold tend to coincide with heightened market euphoria and unsustainable market structure,‚Äù Glassnode added. ‚ÄúAs such, $4,500 can be identified as a critical level to watch on the upside, especially if Ethereum‚Äôs uptrend continues and speculative froth builds further.‚Äù Outlook Despite the recent dip, ETH appears well-positioned for continued growth, especially relative to Bitcoin. Low selling pressure, rising investor exposure, strong ETF inflows, and favorable technical support levels all point to a resilient outlook for Ethereum. If momentum persists, analysts believe ETH may test the $4,500 resistance zone in the coming weeks.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/ether-holds-firm-as-analysts-see-continued-outperformance-over-bitcoin/,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-07-24T16:10:50,"SharpLink Gaming Stakes $1.33B Ethereum, Leads Public Firms ‚Äì Will Others Follow?","SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the top public company holding Ethereum, with 360,807 ETH valued at approximately $1.33 billion, according to the latest data from analytics platform CoinGecko. The firm reports that over 95% of this ETH is actively staked or deployed via liquid staking platforms, forming the foundation of SharpLink‚Äôs treasury strategy. By turning its ETH holdings into a yield-generating reserve, the company is positioning Ethereum as a long-term cornerstone of its balance sheet. Never stop stacking $ETH pic.twitter.com/BU97GnmNIl ‚Äî SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) July 23, 2025 Close behind is BitMine Immersion, a crypto mining company with 300,657 ETH currently worth around $1.11 billion. Chaired by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMine plans to eventually control 5% of all Ethereum in circulation, equating to a target of 6 million ETH. This ambition shows the company‚Äôs belief in Ethereum‚Äôs role as a digital commodity and financial infrastructure backbone, reports CoinGecko. On Wednesday, BitMine Immersion Technologies announced that its common stock is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The new listing is trading under the ticker symbol BMNR. Coinbase and Bit Digital Diversify Exposure Coinbase Global, Inc. ranks third with 137,300 ETH, translating to $507.34 million in value. Once the largest holder of ETH among public firms, Coinbase has been surpassed in scale but remains a major institutional holder. Its ETH exposure represents around 13.7% of all ETH held by publicly listed entities. Bit Digital, known primarily for Bitcoin mining, has also leaned heavily into Ethereum staking. With 120,306 ETH valued at $444.54 million, the company has redirected part of its mining and treasury operations to support Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake model, reports CoinGecko. Smaller Players Build Strategic Reserves BTCS Inc. has continued to deepen its Ethereum position, increasing its holdings to 55,788 ETH‚Äîworth $206.14 million‚Äîfollowing a recent 22,935 ETH acquisition. The company relies on its ETH holdings to power staking and node validation services, enhancing its role in blockchain infrastructure. GameSquare Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed media firm, holds 10,170 ETH and has doubled its digital asset authorization from $100 million to $250 million. The company is also developing a new NFT yield strategy, indicating further capital deployment into Ethereum-based ecosystems. Other companies rounding out the top 10 include Intchains Group (7,023 ETH), KR1, Exodus, and BTC Digital. These firms collectively hold just over 10,000 ETH and have shown relatively stable positions throughout 2025. Ethereum Gains Ground as a Treasury Asset According to the analysis, Ethereum‚Äôs growing role in public company treasuries reflects increasing confidence in its utility and store-of-value potential. As of July 2025, only twelve public companies report Ethereum holdings, collectively holding 1,002,666 ETH‚Äîworth $3.70 billion. That figure represents just 0.83% of the total ETH supply, but momentum is building. Volatility has impacted valuations, with ETH rebounding from a low near $1,383 in April 2025 to $3,700 by late July. This price recovery has pushed SharpLink‚Äôs unrealized gains to 29% and BitMine‚Äôs to 13.7%. While gains vary by entry price, all top 10 holders are currently in profit. Still, over two-thirds of all publicly disclosed ETH remains concentrated in just two companies: SharpLink and Bitmine. Despite its limited corporate penetration compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum is gradually making its way into more boardroom strategies‚Äîand its influence is expanding.

2025-07-24T16:00:46,"US Government Bitcoin Reserves Still Intact: 198,000 BTC Remain Untouched","Rumors suggesting the US government had secretly sold off a large portion of its Bitcoin reserves were swiftly denied yesterday after new on-chain data emerged. Arkham Intelligence, a US-based blockchain analytics firm and public data platform, published updated figures confirming that the US Government still holds at least 198,000 BTC, currently valued at approximately $23.5 billion. These Bitcoin reserves are distributed across multiple addresses managed by various government agencies, including the US Marshals Service (USMS), FBI, DOJ, DEA, and US Attorney‚Äôs Offices. Despite claims¬†of a major selloff, none of these holdings have moved in the last four months, indicating that the government continues to hold its Bitcoin stash intact. The rumors, which circulated widely on social media, were largely triggered by a misinterpretation of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) response from the USMS, which cited holdings of just 28,988 BTC. However, that number represents only a portion of the total reserves, not the entirety. Breakdown Of US Government Bitcoin Holdings According to data from Arkham Intelligence, a significant portion of the US Government‚Äôs 198,000 BTC holdings‚Äîworth approximately $23.5 billion‚Äîoriginates from two major historical seizures: the Bitfinex hack and the Silk Road investigation. The largest single source is the 2022 seizure from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather ‚ÄòRazzlekhan‚Äô Morgan, who were arrested six years after the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Authorities seized 94,000 BTC from the couple, with additional recoveries bringing the total to 114,599 BTC, now worth $13.65 billion. These funds were originally stolen from Bitfinex customers and, pending legal proceedings, may be returned to victims through restitution. Another major contributor is the seizure of 69,369 BTC (currently $8.26 billion) from ‚ÄòIndividual X‚Äô in 2020. This person was believed to have exploited a vulnerability to access Silk Road funds years after the darknet marketplace was shut down. The US Government took possession of the BTC after ‚ÄòIndividual X‚Äô voluntarily forfeited the assets in a landmark case. Arkham also identified other sources of BTC held by US authorities, including smaller seizures from criminal operations and forfeitures resulting from legal settlements. These holdings are spread across wallets linked to agencies such as the US Marshals Service, FBI, and DOJ. This transparency debunks recent rumors about government sell-offs and provides clarity to the public. While the bulk of the seized BTC remains dormant, market participants are closely watching for signs of movement, given the significant potential market impact if liquidated. For now, however, all of these funds remain untouched, offering a buffer of reassurance as Bitcoin hovers near its all-time highs. Price Analysis: Consolidation Persists Between Key Technical Levels Bitcoin continues to trade within a narrow range between $115,724 and $122,077, as shown in the 4-hour chart. This sideways movement follows the strong rally earlier in July that pushed BTC toward new all-time highs. Since then, the price has failed to break above the $122,077 resistance, while buyers have managed to defend the $115,724 support multiple times. The chart also shows that BTC is hovering around the 50-period simple moving average (SMA) at $118,412, slightly above the 100-SMA ($116,614) and the 200-SMA ($111,678), which continue to slope upward‚Äîa signal that the macro trend remains bullish. However, declining volume during consolidation reflects indecision in the market. A breakout above $122,077 could trigger renewed momentum toward the next psychological level at $125,000. On the downside, losing the $115,724 support may lead to a deeper retracement, with the 100-SMA and 200-SMA acting as dynamic support zones.

2025-07-24T16:00:23,"This Ethereum Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern Looks Similar To 2019-2020, Here‚Äôs What Happened Last Time","Crypto analyst Crypto Bullet has alluded to a technical pattern for Ethereum, which mirrors its 2019/2020 price action. Based on the similarities, the analyst gave a breakdown of what to expect from ETH in the coming months. Ethereum Shows Descending Broadening Pattern In an X post, Crypto Bullet stated that Ethereum has shown an impressive recovery and is now starting to resemble a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern. He further noted that this pattern is almost identical to the one which ETH had between 2019 and 2020. The analyst added that the picture looks very bullish right now. Between 2019 and 2020, when this pattern emerged, the altcoin rallied from around $180 to $700 in just six months. Related Reading: Ethereum Maxi Compares Bitcoin To Outdated Landlines, Reveals Why ETH Is Better Further commenting on the current Ethereum price action, Crypto Bullet revealed that the altcoin is testing the resistance at around $3,700 for the third time. He believes that ETH will eventually break out from this range. However, the analyst warned that there may be a 10 to 15% pullback around that area before that. Meanwhile, Crypto Bullet assured that Ethereum will rally hard once it breaks out from this formidable resistance. He predicts that this breakout will lead to a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH, meaning the altcoin is likely to reach $4,900 on the next uptrend. The analyst also stated that the cycle top target for ETH is between $8,000 and $10,000. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that Ethereum can reach $10,000 before this market cycle ends. In an X post, he stated that the euphoria stage will start when ETH breaks a new all-time high (ATH). He indicated that the break above ATH will spark a rally to between $7,000 and $10,000. Once that happens, the analyst believes that a massive bear market will ensue. ETH Is Yet To Enter The Banana Zone In an X post, crypto analyst Ted stated that Ethereum is yet to enter the banana zone. He noted that right now, the altcoin is going through a correction after pulling a 70% rally from its April 2025 lows. The analyst further opined that there will be some sideways accumulation before ETH breaks above $4,100.
