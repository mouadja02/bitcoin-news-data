2025-07-24T09:59:07,"Crypto Crash Wipes Out $700M as ETH and XRP Lead Long Squeeze Liquidations","The post Crypto Crash Wipes Out $700M as ETH and XRP Lead Long Squeeze Liquidations appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The recent dip in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana isn’t being driven by new bearish bets. Instead, it’s mostly due to what’s called a long squeeze, a market event where bullish traders are forced to exit their positions, often causing sharp price drops. What is a Long Squeeze and Why is It Happening Now? A long squeeze happens when traders who expected prices to go up had used leverage to open bullish positions but then exit those positions as prices start falling. This causes further price drops, not because people are turning bearish, but because leveraged bets are being unwound. This is exactly what played out on Thursday. Bitcoin slipped nearly 1% after failing to stay above $120,000. Ethereum dropped 3%, Solana fell 8%, and XRP led the losses with a 13% decline. The overall crypto market fell 6.8% in the last 24 hours. But this pullback wasn’t fueled by traders turning bearish. Instead, over $700 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours, especially in ETH and XRP. A sudden 1.57% spike in Bitcoin dominance after a 9-day slump surprised the market and triggered liquidations across altcoins. 1/ Over $700M in leveraged longs were liquidated in 24h ETH and XRP were the main culprits The real reason though is $BTC.D closing up +1.57% after a 9-day downtrend This spike shocked the market, triggering liquidations across alts BTC held up well and this looks like a… pic.twitter.com/l9uSZ3e58M — Aaron Dishner (@MooninPapa) July 24, 2025 Open Interest Drops Confirm Longs Are Being Closed Key futures data support this view. Open interest, which shows the number of active contracts, has dropped across the board. XRP’s futures open interest fell more than 6% over the past two days. Solana dropped 5%, Ethereum 2%, and Bitcoin 1.5%, according to data from Velo. If new short (bearish) positions were causing the drop, open interest would have risen, not fallen. At the same time, funding rates remain positive, suggesting the majority of remaining traders continue to expect upward moves. If bearish sentiment were taking over, funding would flip negative, so this drop in open interest is a sign of longs closing out positions, not fresh shorts entering. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Planning to Retire With Bitcoin? Here’s How Much You’ll Need in 96 Countries , Why This Isn’t All Bad News Though prices are down, the long squeeze is often seen as a healthy reset. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market maintains a healthy mood, with sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed index sitting at a neutral-to-bullish 67/100. This suggests that while profit-taking is normal, long-term optimism remains intact, and a durable recovery may be forthcoming once leveraged positions are cleared. It removes overly optimistic and over-leveraged bets from the market, potentially making the setup more stable for future moves. Since there’s no clear rise in bearish sentiment or short selling, it shows the pullback is more technical than emotional. In short, crypto prices may have dropped, but it doesn’t mean the bulls have given up. It could just be the market clearing out some of the froth before trying to move higher again. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The recent drop was due to a long squeeze, not bearish bets, as overleveraged traders exited bullish positions. How much was liquidated during the crypto dip? Over $700 million in long positions were liquidated in 24 hours, mainly in Ethereum and XRP. Does falling open interest mean bearish sentiment? No, falling open interest shows longs are being closed, not that new shorts are entering the market. Is the crypto market still bullish despite the drop?

A broad market correction is currently underway, against the backdrop of $737 million worth of liquidations and signs of fading retail enthusiasm. Data from CoinGlass shows that at the start of Thursday’s Asian market session, more than 243,000 traders were liquidated, totaling over $737 million in value. 85.3% of the liquidations were long positions, forcing the overly bullish positions among retail traders out of the market. 24-hour crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass. Ethereum traders were the biggest liquidation losers heading into Thursday, having lost $198 million to the derivatives market. The asset was followed by XRP, BTC, and SOL, which counted $115, $84, and $58 million in liquidations, respectively. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, believes altcoins Ethereum, XRP, and Solana may now enter a short-term correction phase. Bitcoin enters consolidation phase after failing to break $124K barrier Bitcoin (BTC) briefly surged past $123,000 on July 14 to record a new all-time high. However, since the start of the business week, the asset began consolidating in the $116,000–$120,000 range, where it has been stuck for several days. Santiment’s on-chain social data suggests that retail sentiment has cooled significantly. During the June 22 Iran-U.S. airstrike news cycle, fear and uncertainty created what analysts dubbed an “optimal time to buy,” with social volume spiking around lower BTC price mentions. But following the new high on July 14, elevated mentions of $130K–$160K price levels indicate exuberance, often seen at market tops. Retail Bullish Sentiment chart. Source: Santiment Feed. By July 19, crowd sentiment had already begun to doubt further upside following the breach of May’s high. Still, if BTC closes above $120,000 on a daily basis, a renewed push toward the all-time high at $123,218 could follow. Ethereum lead rally but dropped push to ATH After hitting highs around $3,525 and testing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, Ethereum (ETH) was only slightly higher on Thursday. The broader uptrend, which began after bottoming out at $1,385 in April, has now paused. Tristan Teo, founder of Elfa AI, noted a rise in ask skew, suggesting a possible local reversal. Ryan McMillin of Merkle Tree Capital added that Ethereum’s pause is understandable after its extended run, though he cautioned that over 500,000 ETH remain queued for unstaking , which could unsettle ETF-related flows. XRP Upbit whale dump stifles price momentum Ripple’s XRP has experienced a 15% drop in the past 24 hours, sliding to $3.05 after a significant sell-off on South Korean exchange Upbit. According to analyst Dom, over 75 million XRP were offloaded in a single move, negatively impacting the token’s price due to shallow order books. Just days earlier, XRP had surged 92% from $1.95 to a seven-day high of $3.66. Technical indicators pointed to bullish continuation, with a 4-hour bull pennant targeting $4.20 and the weekly MACD flipping green for the first time since XRP’s 2024 bull run. A move above the 5.5% dominance threshold for XRP, which has acted as a cap for over 2,000 days, could unlock further upside. But for now, price action has turned defensive, and bulls will have to hold on to the $3.00 and $3.10 zone to avoid more losses. Solana tests $180 support after 7% 24h drop Solana (SOL) has fallen 7% over the last 24 hours, with its price hovering around $185 after peaking at $205 on Wednesday, according to CoinGecko. The altcoin recently broke above a medium-term falling trend and confirmed an inverse head and shoulders formation by breaching resistance at $156 and running straight to levels above $200. Analyst Trader Tardigrade noted a cup-and-handle pattern on Solana’s chart stretching back to 2021, in a recent post on X. The neckline of this long-term formation sits around $250. If breached, it would activate a pattern target between $4,800 and $6,000, more than 3,000% increase from current levels.

2025-07-24T09:30:18,"Japan Bitcoin Acquisition: Quantum Solutions’ Audacious Plan to Secure 3,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Japan Bitcoin Acquisition: Quantum Solutions’ Audacious Plan to Secure 3,000 BTC Japan Bitcoin acquisition is making headlines, and the latest news from Quantum Solutions is set to send ripples across the cryptocurrency world. Imagine a traditional, publicly listed company in Japan, known for its diverse business ventures, now setting its sights on accumulating a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This isn’t just a speculative gamble; it’s a strategic move that underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Quantum Solutions’ audacious plan to acquire up to 3,000 BTC within the next 12 months isn’t just a headline; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving role of digital assets in corporate treasury strategies. Why Are Companies Eyeing a Japan Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? The decision by companies like Quantum Solutions to embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset isn’t made lightly. It stems from a confluence of macroeconomic factors and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s unique properties. In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, traditional cash holdings are steadily losing their purchasing power. This erosion of value prompts corporations to seek alternative stores of value, and Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling candidate. Here are some key drivers behind this shift: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often touted as a digital equivalent to gold, offering a hedge against inflation. Companies are looking to protect their balance sheets from the depreciating value of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional investments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns in the long run. Technological Adoption: For technology-focused companies like Quantum Solutions, integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy aligns with their innovative ethos and signals a readiness to adapt to the future of finance. It positions them as pioneers in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Strategic Advantage: Early adoption can provide a competitive edge. Companies that hold Bitcoin might attract investors interested in digital assets and potentially benefit from future price appreciation, strengthening their financial position. Demand for Digital Gold: As institutional interest grows, Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” gains traction, making it an attractive asset for long-term holding. This strategic pivot reflects a broader recognition of Bitcoin’s maturity and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, moving beyond its early reputation as a niche speculative instrument. Is Japan Becoming a Hub for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Japan has always held a unique position in the cryptocurrency landscape. It was one of the first major economies to regulate cryptocurrencies, establishing a framework that has since evolved. This regulatory clarity, combined with a strong technological base, has fostered an environment where digital assets can thrive. The recent moves by Japanese listed companies suggest a burgeoning trend, positioning Japan as a significant player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Quantum Solutions is not an isolated case. Two other prominent Japanese listed corporations have already paved the way: Metaplanet: This financial technology company has made headlines with its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, openly embracing Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. They view Bitcoin as a superior alternative to traditional fiat currency for long-term value preservation. Remixpoint: Another listed entity, Remixpoint, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange among other businesses, has also integrated Bitcoin into its balance sheet. Their existing involvement in the crypto space makes this a natural extension of their operations. These examples illustrate a growing confidence among Japanese public companies in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its potential to strengthen corporate balance sheets. The cumulative effect of these Japan Bitcoin acquisition announcements could inspire more domestic firms to follow suit, creating a domino effect within the Japanese corporate sector. Quantum Solutions’ Bold Dive: What Does Their Japan Bitcoin Acquisition Plan Entail? Quantum Solutions’ announcement signals a definitive shift in their financial strategy. Their goal to hold up to 3,000 BTC within the next 12 months is ambitious and speaks volumes about their conviction in Bitcoin’s future. According to reports from CoinDesk JAPAN, the initial phase of this acquisition will involve purchasing approximately $10 million worth of BTC. Let’s break down the implications of this move: Significant Investment: A $10 million initial purchase is a substantial commitment for any company, especially one venturing into a relatively new asset class for its treasury. This indicates serious intent and a long-term vision. Staggered Acquisition: The plan to acquire up to 3,000 BTC over a year suggests a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This approach helps mitigate volatility risks by spreading purchases over time, rather than making a single large lump-sum investment. It demonstrates a measured, strategic approach to entering the market. Balance Sheet Impact: Holding such a significant amount of Bitcoin will materially impact Quantum Solutions’ balance sheet. While it introduces volatility, it also offers substantial upside potential if Bitcoin’s value appreciates. This move could redefine their financial risk profile and growth trajectory. Market Signal: Every corporate Bitcoin acquisition sends a strong signal to the market. It legitimizes Bitcoin further as a corporate asset and could encourage other Japanese and international companies to explore similar strategies. This bold step by Quantum Solutions is not just about accumulating digital assets; it’s about pioneering a new era of corporate finance in Japan, where traditional businesses embrace the decentralized future. What Are the Potential Benefits and Opportunities for Quantum Solutions? Embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset comes with a spectrum of potential advantages that extend beyond mere financial gains. For Quantum Solutions, this strategic Japan Bitcoin acquisition could unlock several doors, positioning them uniquely in the market. Enhanced Shareholder Value: If Bitcoin performs well, the appreciation of their holdings could significantly boost the company’s net asset value, potentially translating into higher share prices and increased shareholder wealth. Attracting New Investors: Companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet often appeal to a new class of investors – those keen on digital assets and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This can broaden their investor base and improve liquidity for their stock. Innovation and Brand Image: Taking such a forward-thinking stance on digital assets enhances Quantum Solutions’ reputation as an innovative and adaptive company. It signals a willingness to embrace cutting-edge financial technologies, which can be a significant brand differentiator. Hedging Against Economic Instability: In an uncertain global economic climate, Bitcoin can act as a robust hedge against currency devaluation and geopolitical risks, offering a form of financial resilience. Operational Synergies: While not explicitly stated, a deeper involvement with Bitcoin could open doors for Quantum Solutions to explore new business ventures within the blockchain and crypto space, creating new revenue streams or optimizing existing operations. The foresight demonstrated by Quantum Solutions could set a new benchmark for corporate treasury management in Japan, illustrating how traditional companies can strategically leverage emerging technologies for growth and stability. Navigating the Challenges: What Risks Does This Japan Bitcoin Acquisition Present? While the potential rewards of a corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks. Bitcoin’s notorious volatility is a primary concern, and companies venturing into this space must be prepared for significant price fluctuations. Key challenges include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can swing wildly, leading to substantial paper losses in short periods. This volatility can impact quarterly earnings reports and investor perception, even if the long-term outlook remains positive. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although Japan has a relatively clear regulatory framework, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in taxation, accounting standards, or outright bans in other jurisdictions could indirectly affect Bitcoin’s value or the company’s ability to manage its holdings. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures. Companies must implement advanced cold storage solutions and multi-signature protocols to protect their assets from hacking attempts and internal fraud. Accounting Treatment: In many jurisdictions, Bitcoin is treated as an intangible asset for accounting purposes, which means any impairment (a decrease in value below its cost basis) must be recognized, while gains are only recognized upon sale. This can lead to non-cash charges that impact reported earnings. Public and Investor Perception: While some investors applaud such moves, others might view them as overly risky or speculative, potentially leading to skepticism or a negative impact on the company’s stock performance if not properly communicated. Quantum Solutions, like Metaplanet and Remixpoint, will need to demonstrate sophisticated risk management and transparent communication strategies to navigate these complexities successfully. Their ability to do so will be crucial for the long-term success of their Japan Bitcoin acquisition . The Broader Impact: How Does This Affect the Crypto Market? The entry of more publicly listed companies into the Bitcoin treasury space, especially from a significant economy like Japan, has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. Each new corporate adoption strengthens Bitcoin’s legitimacy and contributes to its maturation as a global asset. Here’s how this trend can impact the market: Increased Institutional Demand: Every company that adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet represents a new source of consistent, long-term demand. This institutional buying power can absorb supply from the market, potentially leading to upward price pressure. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As companies move Bitcoin into cold storage for treasury purposes, it reduces the readily available supply on exchanges, contributing to a “supply shock” narrative, which often precedes price rallies. Mainstream Acceptance: When established companies like Quantum Solutions, Metaplanet, and Remixpoint embrace Bitcoin, it sends a powerful message to the broader financial world. It normalizes Bitcoin, making it more palatable for other corporations, institutional investors, and even retail investors who might have been hesitant before. Regulatory Pressure and Clarity: As more regulated entities hold Bitcoin, it creates greater pressure on governments and regulators worldwide to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem. Ecosystem Development: The growing need for secure custody solutions, specialized financial services, and reporting tools for corporate Bitcoin holdings will spur innovation and development within the crypto industry, creating a more robust infrastructure. The Japan Bitcoin acquisition trend is more than just individual company decisions; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role from a speculative digital currency to a foundational asset in the global financial landscape. This institutional embrace is a critical step towards its widespread adoption. A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future Quantum Solutions’ ambitious plan to acquire up to 3,000 BTC within a year is a landmark development, signaling a significant shift in corporate treasury strategies in Japan. Alongside pioneers like Metaplanet and Remixpoint, Quantum Solutions is demonstrating a clear vision for how traditional businesses can adapt and thrive in the rapidly evolving digital economy. This strategic pivot highlights Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a robust inflation hedge, a valuable diversification tool, and a symbol of technological foresight. While challenges such as market volatility and regulatory uncertainties persist, the proactive approach of these Japanese firms underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Their actions not only strengthen their own financial positions but also contribute significantly to the broader legitimization and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies globally. The cumulative effect of such corporate acquisitions is poised to reshape financial markets, paving the way for a more decentralized and resilient future. As more companies consider a similar Japan Bitcoin acquisition , the landscape of corporate finance is undoubtedly on the cusp of a transformative era. *** Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are Japanese companies like Quantum Solutions acquiring Bitcoin? Japanese companies are acquiring Bitcoin primarily to hedge against inflation, diversify their corporate treasuries beyond traditional fiat currencies, and position themselves as innovative leaders in the digital economy. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive “digital gold” asset for long-term value preservation, especially in an era of global economic uncertainty. Q2: What is Quantum Solutions’ specific Bitcoin acquisition strategy? Quantum Solutions plans to acquire up to 3,000 BTC within the next 12 months. Their initial phase involves purchasing approximately $10 million worth of Bitcoin. This suggests a likely dollar-cost averaging strategy, spreading purchases over time to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s price volatility. Q3: Are there significant risks associated with companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets? Yes, significant risks include Bitcoin’s high price volatility, which can lead to substantial paper losses and impact reported earnings. Other challenges involve evolving regulatory landscapes, the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect digital assets, and the complex accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies as intangible assets. Q4: How does the trend of corporate Bitcoin acquisition in Japan affect the broader cryptocurrency market? This trend significantly impacts the broader market by increasing institutional demand for Bitcoin, reducing available supply on exchanges, and enhancing Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a mainstream asset. It can encourage more companies globally to consider similar strategies, driving further adoption and potentially influencing price appreciation due to increased buying pressure. Q5: What other Japanese companies have adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy? Besides Quantum Solutions, two other notable Japanese listed corporations that have adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies are Metaplanet and Remixpoint. Metaplanet has been particularly vocal about its embrace of Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, while Remixpoint, already involved in the crypto exchange business, has also integrated Bitcoin into its balance sheet.

Here’s How Much You’ll Need in 96 Countries appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new Bitcoin retirement model is grabbing attention on Twitter and one thing is surprisingly clear: you might need far less BTC to retire than most people think. Posted by X user Sminston With , the analysis looks at how much Bitcoin someone would need to retire depending on their country, current age, and target retirement year, using real economic data, inflation trends, and a conservative BTC price model. We know you’re curious. Let’s dive in. A Different Way to Look at Retirement The charts cover 96 countries and ages 5 to 75, with retirement years ranging from 2025 to 2055. Instead of using fiat currency, the model assumes you’ll retire using only Bitcoin, and spend it steadily until age 100. It also factors in 7% annual fiat inflation and uses a power-law support line to estimate Bitcoin’s long-term value. That’s a technical way of saying the BTC price used here is realistic and not based on hype. If You’re Retiring in 2025, You’ll Need More BTC The sooner you retire, the more Bitcoin you’ll need. For those planning to retire this year , the study suggests most people in developed countries will need between 1 and 10 BTC. Countries like the U.S., Switzerland, and Luxembourg top the list for highest retirement cost in BTC terms. But that picture changes quickly as you shift the timeline forward. 2025 Retirement: pic.twitter.com/IzIerH3KLI — Sminston With (@sminston_with) July 23, 2025 The Longer You Wait, the Less BTC You’ll Need By 2035, most countries need less than 1 BTC for retirement. In many lower-cost nations, the number drops below 0.5 BTC. And by 2045 or 2055, the required amount falls even further. Here are some examples from the report for 2045 retirees: El Salvador : 0.023 to 0.13 BTC Portugal : 0.07 to 0.39 BTC Switzerland : 0.26 to 1.5 BTC That means even a small BTC holding today, under one coin, could go a long way in the future, especially if Bitcoin keeps gaining value and adoption. Your Path to Freedom Through Crypto This analysis isn’t financial advice but it offers a practical way to think about Bitcoin. If Bitcoin continues on its current path, one coin may actually be enough.

2025-07-24T09:20:44,"Ripple warns of rising XRP scams on YouTube","Ripple has raised the alarm over a fresh wave of XRP scams spreading rapidly on YouTube. In a recent post, the blockchain firm revealed that scammers have been hijacking existing YouTube accounts, altering them to appear as Ripple’s official handle. This is how scammers are pushing out fake giveaway schemes designed to dupe unsuspecting users. Such frauds tend to pick up when the market is running high with bullish sentiments. The digital assets market recorded massive rallies throughout July as Bitcoin (BTC) went on to print an all-time high above $123K. Meanwhile, the current pullback led the XRP price to drop by 12% over the last 24 hours. Ripple CEO issues scam alert Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, echoed the warning, saying, “Like clockwork, with success and market rallies, scammers ramp up their attacks, PLEASE BEWARE.” He urged users to stay alert and reiterated that neither he nor the company will ever ask for XRP to be sent for any reason. “We’ll keep reporting these. Please do the same,” he added. In the end, he suggested that “As always, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” The surge in scams arrives just as the XRP price posted a surge of more than 42% in the last 30 days. XRP went to breach the $3.6 mark last week, hinting at printing a new ATH before the rally dissolved. XRP is trading at an average price of $3.09 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed by 136% to stand at $16.66 billion. Source: Brad Garlinghouse’s X . Ripple is still dealing with the high-profile legal battle with the SEC. A proposed $50M settlement is on the table, with a filing deadline set for August 15. These developments have reignited public interest in XRP, giving scammers an opening to exploit FOMO and misinformation. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” sentiment in the market. However, the cumulative crypto market cap dropped by 2% over the last day to stand at $3.86 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 16% to hit $223 billion. Ripple reports AI-powered giveaway frauds Ripple has flagged a surge in fraudulent posts across YouTube, X, Facebook, and Discord. In a report, it has specifically called out scams that span from fake Elon Musk and then Joe Biden giveaway videos to deepfakes of Garlinghouse himself promising free XRP. Some use AI-generated voiceovers and deepfake video overlays. Others replicate real interviews and tack on scam wallet addresses. In some cases, scammers use Discord groups or fake job offers to funnel users toward malicious links or phishing sites. Ripple’s CTO recently flagged a fake 100 million XRP airdrop scam that had gained traction online. He warned that scammers were leveraging post-court-win hype, deepfake videos, and misleading visual overlays to con users. Many of these scams rely on fake urgency, urging viewers to “claim” XRP by sending funds to wallets controlled by fraudsters. According to TRM Labs, more than $9 billion was lost to crypto fraud schemes in 2022 alone. Imposter scams accounted for $2.3 billion in reported losses the same year. Between 2021 and 2023, social media–driven scams racked up an estimated $2.7 billion in consumer losses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a new blog post, Hayes predicts that in less than six months Bitcoin ( BTC ) will soar by more than 111% its current value, while Ethereum ( ETH ) will increase by more than 179% its current value. “My year-end targets: Bitcoin = $250,000. Ether = $10,000.” Hayes also says that Ethereum is primed for an explosive breakout, in part, due to growing adoption by traditional finance, adding that the current holdings of his family office, Maelstrom Fund, are heavily invested in the top altcoin by market cap. “It’s pretty simple: Maelstrom is fully invested. Because we are degens (degenerates), the shitcoin space offers amazing opportunities to outperform Bitcoin, the crypto reserve asset.

2025-07-24T09:10:23,"De-dollarization: BlackRock Unveils Profound Shift Towards Gold and Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld De-dollarization: BlackRock Unveils Profound Shift Towards Gold and Bitcoin De-dollarization , a concept once relegated to niche economic discussions, is now taking center stage in global finance. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has brought this fascinating trend into sharp focus, suggesting that a significant shift is underway. Imagine a world where central banks, traditionally anchored to the U.S. dollar, are actively seeking alternatives. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise; it’s a tangible movement, driven by evolving geopolitical landscapes and economic imperatives. BlackRock’s insights, shared via @solidintel_x on X, highlight that this drive towards de-dollarization is compelling central banks to diversify their reserves, not only into established safe havens like gold but also, remarkably, to begin considering nascent digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). This revelation sparks crucial questions about the future of global monetary systems and the emerging role of digital currencies in the portfolios of even the most conservative financial institutions. What Exactly is De-dollarization and Why is it Happening? The term de-dollarization refers to the process of reducing the reliance on the United States dollar as the dominant currency for international trade, finance, and reserve holdings. For decades, the dollar has held an unparalleled position as the world’s primary reserve currency, the medium for most international transactions, and the benchmark for commodity prices. This dominance has afforded the U.S. significant economic and geopolitical advantages, often termed the “exorbitant privilege.” However, several factors are now contributing to a gradual, yet persistent, push towards de-dollarization: Geopolitical Shifts: Recent geopolitical tensions and the weaponization of financial sanctions have prompted many nations to seek greater financial autonomy. Countries are wary of their foreign exchange reserves being frozen or their access to the global financial system being restricted, leading them to explore alternatives to dollar-denominated assets. Economic Diversification: The rise of new economic powers, particularly in Asia, has led to a natural desire for these nations to conduct trade in their own currencies or other non-dollar alternatives. This reflects a broader trend of a multipolar world economy. Inflation and Debt Concerns: Concerns over the U.S. national debt and inflationary pressures within the U.S. economy can also erode confidence in the dollar’s long-term stability, prompting central banks to look for more diverse and resilient reserve assets. Technological Advancements: The advent of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and blockchain technology offers new avenues for cross-border payments and reserve management that bypass traditional dollar-centric systems. This multifaceted pressure indicates that de-dollarization is not merely a fleeting trend but a fundamental recalibration of global financial power dynamics. Why Are Central Banks Actively Diversifying Their Reserves? Central banks are the custodians of a nation’s financial stability, managing its currency, controlling inflation, and crucially, maintaining foreign exchange reserves. These reserves are vital for various purposes, including: Purpose of Reserves Explanation Currency Stability To intervene in foreign exchange markets to support or stabilize the domestic currency. Debt Repayment To meet international obligations, such as repaying foreign debts. Import Financing To pay for essential imports, especially during times of economic stress. Crisis Buffer To act as a buffer against economic shocks or financial crises. Given these critical functions, the composition of reserves is a strategic decision. The move towards diversification is a proactive measure by central banks to enhance the resilience and security of their national wealth. Relying too heavily on a single currency, even one as dominant as the U.S. dollar, introduces concentrated risk. By spreading their holdings across multiple currencies and asset classes, central banks aim to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations, inflation in specific economies, and geopolitical vulnerabilities. This strategic shift is a direct response to the increasing momentum of de-dollarization , as nations seek to safeguard their economic sovereignty and ensure long-term stability in an unpredictable global environment. Gold: The Enduring Safe Haven in a De-dollarizing World For millennia, gold has served as the ultimate store of value, a tangible asset that transcends national currencies and political boundaries. In the context of de-dollarization , its appeal is more pronounced than ever. Central banks globally have been accumulating gold at a significant pace, reaching record levels of purchases in recent years. This isn’t merely a nostalgic return to an old standard; it’s a calculated strategic move for several compelling reasons: Inflation Hedge: Gold traditionally performs well during periods of high inflation, preserving purchasing power when fiat currencies might be losing value. Geopolitical Neutrality: Unlike sovereign bonds or currencies, gold is not tied to any single government or economy, making it a neutral asset less susceptible to political influence or sanctions. Tangible Asset: In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the physical nature of gold offers a sense of security and finality that digital assets cannot yet fully replicate for central banks. Historical Precedent: Gold has proven its resilience through countless economic cycles, wars, and crises, providing a track record of stability that few other assets can match. The increasing allocation to gold by central banks underscores a fundamental distrust in purely fiat systems and a desire for assets that exist outside the direct control of any single nation. It represents a tangible step in the broader trend of de-dollarization , providing a foundational layer of security and diversification for national reserves. Bitcoin: The Digital Frontier in the Age of De-dollarization While gold represents the traditional response to concerns about currency stability, BlackRock’s mention of Bitcoin in the same breath as gold signals a potentially revolutionary shift in central bank thinking. For years, Bitcoin was largely dismissed by mainstream financial institutions, viewed as too volatile, unregulated, and speculative for serious consideration. However, as the world grapples with the implications of de-dollarization , Bitcoin’s unique properties are starting to gain attention, even from conservative entities like central banks: Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single government or entity controls it. This makes it immune to the kind of political manipulation or sanctions that affect traditional fiat currencies. Scarcity: With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, offering a stark contrast to fiat currencies that can be printed infinitely. This scarcity could appeal to central banks concerned about the long-term debasement of traditional currencies. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering a truly global and permissionless transfer mechanism. Transparency and Auditability: Every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is publicly recorded and verifiable, offering a level of transparency that traditional financial systems often lack. While significant hurdles remain – including extreme price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for robust custodial solutions – the very fact that BlackRock, a titan of traditional finance, suggests central banks are “considering” Bitcoin is a monumental development. It hints at a future where digital assets play a more integral role in global reserve management, further accelerating the trajectory of de-dollarization . BlackRock’s Perspective: A Catalyst for Global Financial Evolution? When BlackRock, managing trillions in assets, speaks, the financial world listens. Their commentary on de-dollarization and the emerging role of gold and Bitcoin is not merely an observation; it can act as a significant catalyst. BlackRock’s foray into the crypto space, particularly with their spot Bitcoin ETF application and subsequent launch, signals a strong belief in the asset class’s long-term viability and institutional adoption potential. Their recent statements reinforce this conviction. BlackRock’s perspective suggests that: Institutional Acceptance is Growing: Their acknowledgement of Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset lends immense credibility to the cryptocurrency, potentially paving the way for other major financial institutions to follow suit. A Pragmatic Approach: BlackRock is known for its data-driven and pragmatic investment strategies. Their assessment of de-dollarization and the resulting diversification indicates a calculated response to evolving global economic realities, rather than mere speculation. Shaping the Narrative: By publicly discussing Bitcoin in the context of central bank reserves, BlackRock helps to normalize the idea, shifting it from a fringe asset to a legitimate contender in the eyes of traditional finance and sovereign wealth managers. This influential endorsement could significantly accelerate the pace at which central banks, and indeed other institutional investors, begin to seriously evaluate and potentially integrate digital assets into their strategic frameworks, furthering the ongoing trend of de-dollarization . Benefits and Challenges of This Profound Shift The pivot by central banks towards assets like gold and potentially Bitcoin in response to de-dollarization presents a complex array of benefits and challenges. Understanding these facets is crucial for appreciating the full scope of this global financial evolution. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Reserve Resilience: Diversifying away from a single dominant currency reduces exposure to the economic and political risks of one nation, making national reserves more robust. Increased Financial Sovereignty: Nations gain greater control over their financial assets, reducing vulnerability to foreign sanctions or economic pressures. Inflation Protection: Assets like gold, and potentially Bitcoin, offer a hedge against inflation, preserving the purchasing power of national wealth over time. Modernization of Reserve Management: Exploring digital assets pushes central banks to innovate and adapt to new financial technologies, potentially leading to more efficient and secure reserve systems. Significant Challenges: Volatility Concerns (especially Bitcoin): Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a major hurdle for central banks, which prioritize stability and capital preservation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of a clear and consistent global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies poses significant risks and complexities for official adoption. Custodial Risks: Securing large quantities of digital assets requires highly sophisticated and secure custodial solutions, an area still evolving for institutional-grade needs. Liquidity Issues: While Bitcoin’s market cap is growing, its liquidity for multi-billion dollar central bank transactions might still be a concern compared to established markets like U.S. Treasuries. Loss of Influence for the Dollar: For the U.S., de-dollarization could lead to a reduction in its “exorbitant privilege,” impacting its ability to finance deficits and exert global financial influence. Navigating these benefits and challenges will require careful strategic planning, robust risk management, and a willingness to embrace new paradigms in global finance as de-dollarization continues its trajectory. Actionable Insights for Investors and Policy Makers The ongoing trend of de-dollarization and central bank diversification has significant implications for various stakeholders. Understanding these shifts can help both individual investors and policymakers make informed decisions. For Individual Investors: Consider Diversification: Just as central banks are diversifying, individual investors might consider a more diversified portfolio that includes traditional safe havens like gold and potentially a small, well-researched allocation to digital assets like Bitcoin, understanding their inherent risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic trends, geopolitical developments, and central bank policies. These factors will increasingly influence currency values and asset performance. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin, if adopted by central banks, would be a very long-term play. Short-term volatility will remain. For Policymakers and Governments: Strategic Reserve Management: Governments must re-evaluate their reserve strategies to ensure resilience against global economic shocks and geopolitical pressures. This includes exploring a wider range of asset classes. Regulatory Clarity: For nations considering digital assets, developing clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks is paramount to fostering trust and mitigating risks. Foster Domestic Currency Use: Promote the use of local currencies in international trade and bilateral agreements to reduce reliance on foreign currencies. The insights from BlackRock underline a crucial juncture in global finance. The prudent management of this shift, whether by central banks adjusting their reserve composition or by individuals adapting their investment strategies, will define economic resilience in the years to come, profoundly influenced by the dynamics of de-dollarization . The landscape of global finance is undeniably undergoing a profound transformation. BlackRock’s compelling insights underscore that de-dollarization is not a distant threat but a present reality, compelling central banks worldwide to strategically reassess their reserve holdings. This shift is clearly favoring timeless assets like gold, which continues to prove its mettle as a reliable store of value. More strikingly, the very notion that central banks are even beginning to “consider” Bitcoin signals a remarkable evolution in how traditional finance views digital assets. This dual approach—embracing both the ancient and the nascent—reflects a pragmatic desire for diversification and resilience in an increasingly multipolar world. While challenges persist, particularly concerning Bitcoin’s volatility and regulatory landscape, the momentum towards a more diversified global reserve system appears irreversible. The implications are vast, promising a future where economic power is more distributed, and the very definition of “sound money” continues to expand beyond conventional boundaries. This era of profound financial recalibration is upon us, and its unfolding will shape the economic destiny of nations for generations to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is de-dollarization? A1: De-dollarization is the process by which countries and central banks reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar as the primary currency for international trade, finance, and foreign exchange reserves. It involves diversifying into other currencies or alternative assets. Q2: Why are central banks considering Bitcoin alongside gold? A2: Central banks are primarily looking to diversify their reserves due to geopolitical tensions, economic instability, and a desire for greater financial autonomy. Gold serves as a traditional safe haven, while Bitcoin, with its decentralized and scarce nature, is emerging as a potential digital alternative that is immune to state control, making it attractive in a de-dollarizing world despite its volatility. Q3: What role does BlackRock play in this discussion? A3: BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, holds significant influence in global finance. Their public statements and actions, such as applying for and launching a spot Bitcoin ETF, lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as an institutional asset. Their insights on de-dollarization and central bank interest in Bitcoin can accelerate the adoption and legitimization of digital assets among traditional financial entities. Q4: What are the main challenges for central banks adopting Bitcoin? A4: Key challenges include Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility, which conflicts with central banks’ need for stability; the lack of a clear and consistent global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies; and the complexities associated with secure custody solutions for large digital asset holdings. Q5: How does de-dollarization impact the average person? A5: While the direct impact might not be immediately apparent, de-dollarization can influence currency exchange rates, inflation, and the stability of global trade. For investors, it may highlight the importance of diversified portfolios that consider both traditional and emerging alternative assets to hedge against shifts in global economic power. Q6: Is de-dollarization a new phenomenon? A6: While the term “de-dollarization” has gained prominence recently, the concept of nations seeking to reduce reliance on a single dominant currency has historical precedents. However, the current geopolitical and technological landscape, combined with the rise of digital assets, makes the present wave of de-dollarization distinct and potentially more impactful.

2025-07-24T09:00:35,"Binance Pulls Ahead In Altcoin Boom, Takes Lion’s Share Of Volume","On-chain data shows the altcoin volume saw an explosion following Bitcoin’s recent high and Binance accounted for the largest part of it. Binance Altcoin Spot Trading Volume Saw A Significant Jump Recently In a dashboard release , on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about how spot trading volume in the cryptocurrency sector changed following BTC’s all-time high (ATH) . Spot trading volume here naturally refers to the total amount of a given asset or group of assets that’s becoming involved in trading activities on the centralized spot exchanges. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the metric for Bitcoin: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot trading volume observed a huge increase as the asset’s price set its ATH, indicating that traders ramped up their activity. Volume grew proportionally between Binance and the rest of the exchanges during this uptick in activity, but a shift followed in the days after the ATH: volume dropped on the other exchanges while it held up relatively well on Binance. This meant that the dominance of the platform rose. “Binance’s share of spot trading volume grew from 39% the previous day to the all-time high, to 48% the next day of the all-time high,” notes CryptoQuant. The platform’s dominance has remained strong since, though overall volume has declined on both it and the rest of the platforms. While BTC spot trading volume may have cooled off, the other side of the cryptocurrency sector, made up of the altcoins, has thrived. As is visible in the chart, the altcoin spot trading volume also jumped across Binance and the rest of the platforms when BTC set its ATH, but unlike the number one digital asset, the alts didn’t follow up with a notable decline in activity. This trend has accompanied a divergence between the prices of BTC and the others. Assets like Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have shot up, while Bitcoin has moved sideways. Just like in the case of BTC, Binance witnessed its altcoin spot trading volume grow in the days after the price ATH. “Binance dominated Altcoin spot trading volumes the days after BTC reached its all-time high, with the exchange’s share standing as high as 49% on July 18,” says the analytics firm. Bitcoin Price Bitcoin has shown no signs of a move in either direction as its price is still trading around the $118,000 mark.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ahead-altcoin-boom-lions-share-of-volume/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO","Altcoin News|Altcoin Boom|Altcoin Season|altcoins|alts|binance|Binance Volume",cryptocompare
