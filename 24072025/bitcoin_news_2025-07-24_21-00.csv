2025-07-24T18:45:07,"Police Issue Warning on Spread of Fake ‚ÄòFraud Department‚Äô Scammers as One Victim Loses $15,000 to Scheme: Report","Scammers are reportedly posing as bank fraud investigators to steal money from unsuspecting victims. According to WPLG Local 10, the Broward Sheriff‚Äôs Office (BSO) in Florida has issued a warning about the scheme and is urging the public to be vigilant amid rising cases of bank-related phone scams. WPLG reports that the BSO Pompano Beach District has already received more than a dozen complaints from residents who were tricked into handing out thousands of dollars to the scammers. Deputies say that one victim lost $15,000 to the scheme. A couple was also tricked into giving up their debit cards and personal identification numbers (PINs), resulting in more than $9,000 in fraudulent charges. The bad actors typically contact their prospective victims, pretending to work for the fraud department of the victim‚Äôs bank. The scammers then claim there are suspicious activities on the victim‚Äôs account that require immediate action to protect the funds. They then tell the victims to withdraw large sums of money or hand over their debit cards and PINs. In some cases, the scammer arranges for an Uber to pick up the money or the debit card, instructing the victim to place the envelope containing these items in the backseat and not speak to the driver. The police say that legitimate banks will not tell their clients to withdraw money and send it through a ride-share service, nor will they ask to hand over debit cards and PINs to a third party.

Two days ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave an ‚Äú accelerated ‚Äù approval of Bitwise‚Äôs proposal to convert BITW to a spot ETF. ‚ÄúPursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‚ÄòExchange Act‚Äô) and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, NYSE Arca, Inc. (‚ÄòNYSE Arca‚Äô or ‚ÄòExchange‚Äô) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄòCommission‚Äô) a proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1 (‚ÄòProposal‚Äô), to amend NYSE Arca Rule 8.500-E (Trust Units) and to list and trade shares (‚ÄòShares‚Äô) of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (‚ÄòTrust‚Äô) under amended NYSE Arca Rule 8.500-E (Trust Units). The Proposal was subject to notice and comment. This order approves the Proposal on an accelerated basis.‚Äù Then, in a separate letter dated on the same day, the SEC informed Bitwise of its plan to pause, or ‚Äú stay ‚Äú, the accelerated approval. ‚ÄúThis letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission‚Äôs Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the Commission will review the delegated action. In accordance with Rule 431(e), the July 22, 2025 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise.‚Äù Experts speculate that the SEC might be putting the ETF approval plans on pause while it aims to establish standards across different crypto ETFs.

2025-07-24T18:20:03,"BlackRock‚Äôs ETH ETF becomes third-fastest ETF to hit $10B","BlackRock‚Äôs U.S.-listed Ethereum ETF is now among the fastest-growing funds in history. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas disclosed this, noting that BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has passed $10 billion in assets. According to Balchunas , ETHA is the third-fastest ETF to hit the $10 billion mark, coming behind two spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC. It took ETHA 251 days to hit that mark, compared to 34 days for IBIT and 53 days for FBTC. Interestingly, $5 billion of the assets under management (AUM) for ETHA entered in just ten days in what Balchunas described as ‚ÄúETF assets equivalent of a God candle,‚Äù a term used by analysts to describe a massive increase in price of tokens. With the move, ETHA has been in the top 5 ETFs for netflows for the past month and week. This highlights the drastic change in ETH‚Äôs fortunes. While Bitcoin spot ETFs dominated investor attention in the first half of the year, recent market activity shows investors are warming up to the ETFs of the second-largest cryptocurrency. The ETF‚Äôs breakthrough comes as Ethereum‚Äôs market sentiment improves. Prices have risen recently, with ETH gaining more than 50% in the past week and approximately 105% since mid-May. On the other hand, Bitcoin has only seen a 24% increase in the same period in the last 30 days. Ethereum ETFs continue with consecutive inflows Meanwhile, the performance of BlackRock ETHA has spilled over to other ETH ETF products. The products now have 14 days of consecutive inflows starting from July 3, during which the products pulled in around $4 billion in assets under management. The period also saw ETH ETFs set new records for daily inflows, with the products pulling in $726.74 million on July 16, marking the largest daily inflow since their debut. The second largest and third largest happened within this period, with $602 million on July 17 and $533.8 million on July 222. While ETH ETFs are commanding inflows, Bitcoin ETFs have been struggling in the past few days, with three consecutive days of outflows this week. Although the outflows are relatively minimal, they highlight changes in market sentiment towards ETH ETFs and the underlying asset itself. ETH sees surge above $3,700 after recent pullbacks Meanwhile, the consistent positive flow for ETH ETFs has had a positive impact on ETH itself, with the token gaining more than 4% in the last 24 hours. This marks a reversal of recent pullbacks for the token after it fell as low as $3,500 following the rally that took it past $3,800. With its recent gains, ETH is back above $3,700 after over $41 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours. It has also increased ETH‚Äôs dominance to 11.52%, even though Bitcoin is back to over 60% dominance. The asset price ratio versus Bitcoin increased 2.65% in the past day as well, showing that it is outperforming the flagship asset. Interestingly, institutional interest is not the only driver of ETH price; the network is also seeing a surge in on-chain activity. According to Growthepie data, Ethereum mainnet added $500 million in stablecoins on July 23, and its daily transaction count recently hit 24.69 million, an all-time high. All this is happening with the ten-year anniversary of the Ethereum network being only a few days away, and many expect more milestones for the network in the coming days.

The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to build momentum this week, trading between $116,000 and $120,000. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, with the price hovering around $119,000. Block Joins S&P 500 Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Block joined the S&P 500 index on Wednesday. Block is the third public company with Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to join the global benchmark. The company currently holds $8,584 BTC , worth around $1 billion at current prices. Block shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have risen 14% since it announced it would join the S&P 500. The S&P 500 tracks the largest publicly-listed US companies, including Tesla and Coinbase. Genius Group Boosts Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings Singapore-based AI edtech firm Genius Group purchased 20 BTC last week, boosting its total holdings to 200 BTC . The acquisition is part of the company‚Äôs strategy to build a 10,000 BTC reserve. According to a statement issued by the company, Genius Group acquired 20 BTC at an average price of $106,812 per coin. With a purchase price of $2.14 million, the company has already made a profit of $216,000 on its investment. The acquisition is part of a series of Bitcoin purchases by the company. Genius Group purchased 20 BTC on July 2 and another 28 BTC on July 8. Another acquisition of 32 BTC followed on July 13, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. The company‚Äôs acquisitions have doubled its Bitcoin stash to 200 BTC . Genius Group plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and to 10,000 BTC within the next two years. The company added that the passage of the GENIUS Act will help speed up its blockchain-based education initiatives. Genius Group also plans to apply for a permitted payment stablecoin issuer (PPSI) license under the new US rules. It will also apply for a separate license for a non-bank digital asset service provider. (DASP). UK Firm Sets National Record For Bitcoin Treasury Raises London-based artificial intelligence company Satsuma Technology raised 100 million British pounds ($135 million) for its Bitcoin treasury, setting a national record. The company stated in an announcement that it had ‚Äúsuccessfully closed the book on the raise materially in excess‚Äù of the $135 million target. If Satsuma uses the entire amount to purchase Bitcoin, it would become the second-largest holder of the asset in the UK behind The Smarter Web Company, which holds 1,600 BTC , worth around $190 million. Satsuma Technology raised the funds through a secured convertible loan note offering. Fortified Securities was the lead broker for non-US investors, while Dawson James Securities was the mandated broker for US-based investors. Satsuma Technology Chairman Matt Lodge stated, ‚ÄúThe funding will enable us to both accelerate the growth of our business operations as well as position us at the forefront of the Bitcoin community.‚Äù CEO Henry Elder added, ‚ÄúThis successful capital raise marks a pivotal moment, not just for Satsuma, but for the London market.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to build momentum as it continues to trade between $116,000 and $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded sideways all week as markets wait for a catalyst to dictate price action. Edul Patel, co-founder and CEO of Mudrex, stated, ‚ÄúWith major events like the FOMC meeting, US Treasury‚Äôs borrowing plans, and Trump‚Äôs tariff proposals ahead of us, July‚Äôs last days could shape market sentiment for the rest of the year.‚Äù Meanwhile, some analysts predict that BTC is due for a massive short squeeze, as Bitcoin dominance surges to 62%. Market data shows the price dropping to local lows, while data from CoinGlass confirms a buildup of overhead liquidity above the spot price. Such liquidity clusters have a magnet effect, and late entrants are often punished by quick moves up or down. Popular trader and investor Mister Crypto stated, ‚ÄúBitcoin liquidity is piling up on the topside. A massive short squeeze is inevitable!‚Äù Another trader stated that a short squeeze was the obvious next step, stating, ‚Äú $BTC is still stuck within this range. Lots of positions on both sides now. Eyes on those liquidity clusters below $115K & $120K. Would assume price wants to take both of those out at some point.‚Äù BTC has mostly stayed around $118,000-$119,000 this week as the crypto market capitalization reaches record levels. However, traders and analysts believe the real test for the asset will come during the last week of July as macroeconomic policy events collide with an intense legal battle over President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Felix Juavin, host of Forward Guidance, stated on X, ‚ÄúThe last few days of July will set the stage for markets for the rest of the year, imo. FOMC meeting where dovish dissents are looking very likely. QRA meeting where we will get a look at how willing Bessent is going to be to try to weaponize treasury issuance for the first time since being chair. Tariff letter deadlines. The Supreme Court will begin deliberating on whether tariffs via executive order are legal or not. No big edge on either side right now personally, will just react once we get clarity. Stay frosty.‚Äù BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, racing past $120,000 and reaching a new all-time high of $123,091. It lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $119,716. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as BTC plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before recovering to reclaim $117,000 and settling at $117,682, ultimately falling 1.70%. It recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.82% and settling at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 1,03%, dropping to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240. The price raced to an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $117,402, ultimately registering a marginal increase.

Commenting on the development, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, wrote, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about an ETF industry that‚Äôs been around for over 3 decades & has nearly 4,400 products.

Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC followed closely behind at 54 days. The growing interest in ETHA indicates continued appetite for regulated crypto investment vehicles, especially as the ETF industry adapts to the presence of digital assets. Ethereum, which accounts for roughly one-third of Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap, is now showing that it can attract institutional interest on a similar scale, albeit at a different pace. Ethereum ETFs Surge With $726M Daily High, Total Holdings Near $20B The surge comes amid broader momentum for Ethereum-based funds, which have seen increasing inflows since receiving final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2024. The nine U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, and have since recorded $8.32 billion in total net inflows . While Bitcoin ETFs still dominate the market with over $54 billion in total inflows, Ethereum funds are now gaining traction. On July 16, Ethereum ETFs logged their highest daily inflow to date of $726.74 million. That was followed by $602 million on July 17 and $533.87 million on July 23‚Äî marking the third-highest single-day inflow on record . That same day, Ethereum ETF holdings hit an all-time high of $19.85 billion in total assets. BlackRock has consistently led the pack in flows.

While market sentiment remains bullish, the proximity to this structural ceiling raises the possibility of increased volatility and consolidation. Analyst Highlights Technical Headwinds Facing Bitcoin Rally Despite recent bullish momentum, Bitcoin has yet to break through a key resistance level on the long-term power law chart. According to Alphractal‚Äôs post on X, these trendlines have historically mapped support and resistance with impressive precision, while effectively guiding BTC price movements over the years.

Here‚Äôs What the Data Shows To confirm a sustained bull run, BTC must decisively break above the $122,000 level, which is currently acting as the ceiling on the long-term model.¬†The BTC Long-Term Power Law is a powerful yet underappreciated indicator in the crypto space that offers a unique perspective on the long-term price behavior. This model utilizes a logarithmic scale on both price and time. This format is rarely used in traditional markets but is particularly suited for assets with exponential growth trajectories, such as BTC. By applying linear regression to log-log data, it generates smooth predictive trend lines that help provide a macro perspective on price evolution. Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $108,000 by the year 2033, says Joao_wedson, the creator of the Long-Term Power Law model. Such a move would violate the model historical trend. Furthermore, Alphractal notes that this tool is a must-watch for long-term investors aiming to position themselves strategically in the crypto market. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Peak Within Six Months In an X post, analyst Colin Talks Crypto stated that it feels like Bitcoin might be roughly six months away from reaching the market top. Despite the ongoing price rally, he pointed out that sentiment remains surprisingly low, which is a key factor in his outlook.

The technical indicators are overwhelmingly bullish, which suggests that there is still room for the price to continue its ascent. The recent breakout on BTC Monthly Candle highlights sustained momentum, while the Crypto Bull & Bear Indicator (CBBI) remains relatively underheated. This suggests that the market is not yet overextended and could continue its upward trajectory. Additionally, the global M2 money supply continues its upward trajectory, while injecting liquidity into the financial system that can fuel asset price gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has reached new all-time highs, while reflecting positive investor confidence and risk appetite that often extends into the crypto markets. The Government and corporate BTC treasuries have barely even begun to take shape. Colin mentioned that the hype around institutional adoption is still on the horizon as we approach the market top.
