2025-07-07T17:50:30,"Canaan’s Astounding 1,484 BTC Holdings: A Bitcoin Mining Powerhouse Emerges","BitcoinWorld Canaan’s Astounding 1,484 BTC Holdings: A Bitcoin Mining Powerhouse Emerges In the dynamic world of digital assets, few announcements resonate as strongly as those demonstrating a company’s unwavering commitment to the core principles of cryptocurrency. Recently, Canaan (CAN), a prominent Nasdaq-listed Chinese entity known both as a crypto mining equipment manufacturer and a dedicated mining company, made headlines with its impressive operational update. Despite facing typical industry hurdles, Canaan reported mining 88 BTC in June, bringing its total Bitcoin Holdings to a staggering 1,484 BTC as of June 30. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement about financial resilience and a strategic long-term vision in the realm of Canaan Bitcoin Mining . Canaan Bitcoin Mining: Navigating Challenges, Demonstrating Resilience The journey of Bitcoin mining is rarely without its bumps, and Canaan’s June performance is a testament to its operational robustness. The company successfully mined 88 BTC during the month, a commendable feat considering the inherent volatility and external factors that can impact mining operations. PR Newswire highlighted that this achievement came despite experiencing weather-related disruptions and necessary maintenance activities. These challenges, common in the energy-intensive crypto mining industry , often lead to temporary shutdowns or reduced efficiency. Operational Resilience: Mining 88 BTC amidst disruptions showcases Canaan’s ability to maintain high operational uptime and efficiency, even when faced with adverse conditions. This speaks volumes about their infrastructure and management capabilities. Strategic Planning: The continuous output suggests a well-planned and executed mining strategy, focusing on maximizing production even during periods of external pressure. Industry Context: In an industry where profitability can fluctuate with Bitcoin’s price and energy costs, consistent mining output is a key indicator of a company’s underlying strength. Unpacking Canaan’s Bitcoin Holdings: A Strategic Accumulation Perhaps even more compelling than its monthly mining output is Canaan’s record-breaking Bitcoin Holdings . As of June 30, the company held an impressive 1,484 BTC. This figure is not merely a reflection of past mining success but a deliberate strategic choice to accumulate Bitcoin. For a publicly traded company, holding such a significant amount of a volatile asset like Bitcoin signals profound confidence in its long-term value proposition. What does this accumulation strategy signify? Financial Strength: A substantial Bitcoin treasury provides a robust asset base, enhancing the company’s financial stability and acting as a hedge against fiat currency inflation. Long-Term Vision: By choosing to hold rather than immediately sell mined BTC, Canaan demonstrates a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price appreciation and its role in the global financial landscape. Market Confidence: This strategy can instill confidence among investors, signaling that the company believes in the very asset it helps to create. It aligns Canaan’s interests directly with the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This approach differentiates Canaan from some other mining operations that might liquidate a larger portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover operational expenses or for immediate profits. Canaan’s emphasis on BTC Accumulation Strategy positions it uniquely within the market. The Broader Crypto Mining Industry Landscape: A Dual Role Player Canaan’s position in the market is unique because it operates on two crucial fronts within the crypto mining industry . Firstly, it is a leading Mining Equipment Manufacturer , producing high-performance ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners that are essential for efficient Bitcoin mining. Secondly, it is a self-mining company, deploying its own hardware to generate Bitcoin. This dual role offers several strategic advantages: Synergy and Feedback Loop: As a manufacturer, Canaan gains invaluable real-world data and feedback from its own mining operations, allowing it to continuously refine and improve its mining equipment.

The broader industry is characterized by intense competition, rising energy costs, and the ongoing challenge of finding sustainable and affordable power sources. Companies like Canaan, with their integrated approach, are better positioned to navigate these complexities. What Does This BTC Accumulation Strategy Mean for Investors? For investors eyeing the cryptocurrency space, Canaan’s aggressive BTC Accumulation Strategy presents an interesting proposition. It suggests that the company’s financial health is not solely dependent on the fluctuating demand for mining hardware but also on the appreciation of its significant Bitcoin treasury. This strategy can be viewed as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, potentially offering investors exposure to both the industrial side of crypto and direct Bitcoin price movements through their equity. However, it also introduces a degree of volatility tied to Bitcoin’s price swings. While higher Bitcoin prices boost the value of Canaan’s holdings, a significant downturn could impact its balance sheet. This dual exposure requires investors to understand both the operational aspects of a mining company and the inherent risks of holding a volatile digital asset. Conclusion: Canaan’s Strong Position in the Digital Frontier Canaan’s latest operational report paints a clear picture of a company with robust operational capabilities and a forward-thinking financial strategy. Mining 88 BTC in June despite disruptions and accumulating a record 1,484 BTC in Bitcoin Holdings underscores its commitment to the digital asset space. As both a leading Mining Equipment Manufacturer and a significant player in Canaan Bitcoin Mining , the company is strategically positioned to thrive within the evolving crypto mining industry .

2025-07-07T17:40:30,"Genius Group Bitcoin: A Bold Leap to 10,000 BTC in Two Years","BitcoinWorld Genius Group Bitcoin: A Bold Leap to 10,000 BTC in Two Years Are you keeping an eye on the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management? The world of finance is witnessing a seismic shift, and companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets to fortify their balance sheets. In a truly captivating move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency and traditional investment sectors, Genius Group (NYSE American: GNS) has announced an audacious increase in its Genius Group Bitcoin treasury goal. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a tenfold leap, from an initial 1,000 BTC to a staggering 10,000 BTC, with an ambitious timeline of just 12 to 24 months. For anyone interested in the convergence of corporate strategy and digital assets, this development is nothing short of fascinating. Understanding the Bold Leap in GNS Bitcoin Strategy What exactly does it mean for a publicly traded company like Genius Group to target such a significant amount of Bitcoin? It signals a profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a strategic asset. Genius Group, known for its entrepreneurial education ecosystem, is now making headlines for its forward-thinking approach to its balance sheet. The decision to escalate their GNS Bitcoin target is a testament to their belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. According to a GlobeNewswire press release, the company aims to achieve this monumental goal through a mix of diverse funding strategies. This isn’t merely about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into the core financial planning of a dynamic enterprise. This strategic pivot reflects a growing trend among innovative companies to diversify their treasury holdings beyond fiat currencies and traditional investments. The Genius Behind Their Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Genius Group isn’t just accumulating Bitcoin; they are actively managing their holdings to generate returns. Since resuming Bitcoin purchases in May, the company has reported an impressive 74% BTC Yield . This figure is particularly striking and highlights a sophisticated approach to digital asset management that goes beyond simple HODLing (holding on for dear life). How might a company achieve such a significant yield on its Bitcoin holdings? There are several methods within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) ecosystems: Staking: Participating in proof-of-stake networks (though Bitcoin itself is proof-of-work, wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) can be staked on other chains). Lending: Lending Bitcoin to exchanges or DeFi protocols for interest. Yield Farming: Providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges in exchange for fees and governance tokens. Covered Calls/Derivatives: Using options strategies to generate income from existing Bitcoin holdings. Strategic Trading: Actively managing a portion of their holdings to capitalize on market movements, though this carries higher risk. Genius Group’s ability to generate a 74% yield suggests a proactive and intelligent Bitcoin Treasury Strategy . This isn’t just about passive accumulation; it’s about maximizing the utility and profitability of their digital assets, potentially turning their treasury into an active profit center. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: A Macro Trend Genius Group’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a significant indicator of a broader macro trend: the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, setting a precedent for others to follow. These early adopters have often cited reasons such as: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate capital from the eroding effects of inflation. Store of Value: Recognizing Bitcoin as a digital gold, a reliable store of value in an uncertain economic climate. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their treasury portfolio. Innovation & Future-Proofing: Embracing emerging technologies and positioning themselves at the forefront of financial innovation. The decision by Genius Group to significantly increase its Corporate Bitcoin Holdings underscores a growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class. It suggests that companies are moving beyond speculative interest and are instead integrating Bitcoin into their long-term financial architecture. What This Means for Shareholders: Bitcoin Per Share One of the key aspects highlighted by Genius Group is their plan to continue growing both their total Bitcoin holdings and, crucially, their Bitcoin per share for shareholders. This concept of ‘Bitcoin per share’ is an innovative metric that directly ties the company’s digital asset accumulation to shareholder value. It implies that as Genius Group’s Bitcoin reserves grow, the intrinsic value attributed to each share could also increase, offering a unique form of exposure to the digital asset market for their investors. For shareholders, this could mean: Enhanced Value Proposition: Shares become indirectly backed by a growing amount of a high-potential asset. Inflation Protection: Shareholders gain an indirect hedge against currency debasement. Attracting New Investors: Crypto-savvy investors might be drawn to GNS due to its explicit Bitcoin strategy. Potential for Capital Appreciation: As Bitcoin’s value potentially rises, so too could the value of the company’s shares. This strategy aligns Genius Group with a forward-looking vision, appealing to a new generation of investors who understand the transformative potential of digital assets. Challenges and Considerations While the move is certainly bold and potentially rewarding, it’s essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which could impact the company’s balance sheet reporting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance challenges. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or loss. Public Perception: Some traditional investors might still view Bitcoin as a risky asset, potentially affecting stock performance. However, Genius Group’s decision to pursue a yield-generating strategy suggests they are actively managing these risks and leveraging their expertise to navigate the complexities of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Visionary Leap for Genius Group Genius Group’s decision to raise its Bitcoin treasury target to an astounding 10,000 BTC within two years marks a pivotal moment in corporate finance. It’s a powerful declaration of confidence in Bitcoin’s future and a testament to the company’s innovative spirit. By combining aggressive accumulation with smart yield-generating strategies, Genius Group is not only building a robust digital asset treasury but also setting a new benchmark for how publicly traded companies can integrate cryptocurrencies into their core financial operations. This ambitious move positions Genius Group as a trailblazer, demonstrating a profound understanding of the evolving global financial landscape and a commitment to delivering unique value to its shareholders through strategic Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and an impressive BTC Yield .

2025-07-07T17:30:29,"Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target","Bitcoin is currently on the path to holding a strong footing above $109,000 after reclaiming the $108,000 price level in the past seven days. Notably, Bitcoin’s price has gained more than $3,000 over the past week, with bullish momentum building steadily across the broader crypto market. Bitcoin is once again flirting with all-time highs, and popular crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader recently shared a technical analysis on social media that claims Bitcoin has now entered its third parabolic phase. His chart places Bitcoin right on track for another historic climb to crazy price targets even in 2025. Bitcoin Following Familiar Price Schedule According to Merlijn’s analysis, Bitcoin’s current market structure is mimicking its past two parabolic rallies that took place in 2017 and 2021. Just like in previous cycles, Bitcoin’s current price cycle has moved through a prolonged consolidation phase and gradually grinded upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline The next thing now is a vertical breakout. A weekly chart that followed his post on the social media platform X highlighted this trend with three red bowl-shaped curves, each leading into a green “Parabolic Phase” box that represents the final leg of each bull run. The price action so far in 2024 and 2025 has continued to trace this same path. The curve that began forming after the 2022 bottom is now tilting upward sharply. Interestingly, Bitcoin bounced cleanly off the lower arc during its April crash to $74,000, just as it did in 2016 and 2020 before launching into new all-time highs. Crypto analyst Merlijn believes this rebound is the strongest indication yet that the final breakout phase is approaching. No Second Chances: Here’s The Price Target According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current price structure on the weekly chart has never failed in previous cycles. However, anyone waiting on the sidelines may miss the move entirely. “Bitcoin bounced off the parabolic curve support, momentum is building, and if history rhymes with the biggest burst of the move, this parabolic phase does not give second chances,” he explained. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish The most interesting part of Merlijn’s forecast is the price target itself. Based on the chart he shared, the green parabolic zone for 2025 extends as high as $335,000, representing more than a 205% rally from current levels. The mid-region of the box is around $150,000, making even the conservative price target significantly higher than Bitcoin’s current price. This prediction is based on the magnitude of previous parabolic runs, which saw Bitcoin increase by over 2,000% in 2017 and more than 1,300% from its 2020 lows to its 2021 peak. If the third phase delivers a similar rally, the path to $335,000 may not be far-fetched. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,850, having reached an intraday high of $109,574.

2025-07-07T17:21:07,"Unexpected Developments in Solana Spot ETFs – Dates for Potential SEC Approval Begin to Clarify","The approval process for the spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) may accelerate beyond expectations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked potential issuers to resubmit revised S-1s by the end of July, responding to comments. Two sources close to the matter confirmed this development. While the SEC technically has until October 10 to approve or reject such a fund, the Commission is reportedly looking to speed up the process and approve one or more funds well before that date. One of the reasons behind this move is the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF (SSK), which was automatically approved last week. Since the SSK fund is considered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it is automatically approved unless the SEC intervenes. SSK, which started trading last week, became the first Solana staking fund on the market and gained a significant first-mover advantage over other potential Solana ETFs. The SEC previously approved spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously in order not to give an advantage to a single product in similar cases. Related News: Elon Musk Founded His Own Political Party in the US - What Does This Mean for Bitcoin (BTC) and How Will It Affect It? “I think the SEC is feeling pressure to approve these ETFs sooner rather than later because of the Rex Shares product that was approved last week,” said a source familiar with the matter. The SEC sent its first official communication to potential issuers in June, instructing them to include language on staking and in-kind trading in their filings. This was the first step in signaling that the SEC had formally begun the process for Solana ETFs. With this development, a much earlier date for approval of the spot Solana ETFs, rather than October, is possible.

2025-07-07T17:20:30,"DDC Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Move: Boosting Holdings to 368 BTC Signals Strategic Shift","BitcoinWorld DDC Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Move: Boosting Holdings to 368 BTC Signals Strategic Shift In a significant move that echoes a growing trend in the corporate world, NYSE-listed e-commerce giant DDC Enterprise has once again made headlines, substantially increasing its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision not only bolsters their digital asset portfolio but also sends a clear signal about the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management. The company’s actions spotlight a powerful shift towards integrating Bitcoin as a core financial asset, sparking conversations across the global business community about the future of corporate finance. What’s Behind DDC Enterprise’s Significant Bitcoin Accumulation? DDC Enterprise’s latest acquisition of 230 more Bitcoin at an average price of $90,764 per BTC has propelled its total holdings to an impressive 368 BTC. This recent purchase, reported by Business Wire, builds on their existing Bitcoin treasury strategy, first initiated in mid-June. The company highlighted a remarkable 48.3% yield increase since their previous acquisition, underscoring a calculated approach to integrating Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a deliberate shift towards a new financial paradigm for the enterprise, demonstrating a long-term conviction in the digital asset’s value proposition. The continued accumulation by DDC Enterprise Bitcoin holdings signifies a deeper integration into their corporate balance sheet, reflecting confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a future-proof asset. Why Are Companies Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The question on many minds is, why are established companies like DDC Enterprise increasingly turning to Bitcoin for their treasury reserves? The motivations are multi-faceted, reflecting a blend of financial prudence and forward-thinking strategy: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply asset. Its scarcity, capped at 21 million coins, makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has shown significant long-term growth. Companies view it as a high-growth asset that can enhance overall treasury returns, especially compared to traditional low-yield instruments. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin diversifies a company’s balance sheet away from solely fiat-denominated assets. This can reduce overall portfolio risk and provide exposure to a rapidly expanding digital economy. Attracting Innovation: Embracing digital assets can signal a company’s innovative spirit, potentially attracting tech-savvy talent, investors, and customers who align with the digital transformation narrative. Accessibility and Liquidity: With improving institutional infrastructure, acquiring and managing significant Bitcoin holdings has become more accessible and liquid for large corporations. However, this strategy is not without its challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin requires a strong risk management framework. Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions also poses a hurdle, as do the complexities of secure custody and accounting for digital assets. A robust Bitcoin treasury strategy must meticulously address these considerations to mitigate potential downsides. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? DDC Enterprise’s move is part of a larger narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption that has gained considerable momentum in recent years. While MicroStrategy remains the poster child for this trend, having amassed over 200,000 BTC, numerous other public and private companies are following suit, indicating a burgeoning movement in the financial world. MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, demonstrating a long-term conviction despite market fluctuations. Their consistent acquisitions have set a precedent for other publicly traded companies. Tesla: Elon Musk’s Tesla famously added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, albeit with some subsequent sales, highlighting both the potential and the practical considerations for large corporations. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s Block has also made significant Bitcoin purchases, reflecting a commitment to the cryptocurrency as a foundational technology and a key part of their financial services offerings. Other Notable Players: Companies across various sectors, from gaming to financial services, are exploring or actively integrating Bitcoin into their financial operations, viewing it as a strategic asset. This increasing institutional Bitcoin interest is often seen as a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. As more established entities commit capital, it lends credibility and stability to the asset class, potentially paving the way for even wider mainstream acceptance. The ‘domino effect’ suggests that as more companies succeed with their corporate Bitcoin adoption strategy, others will feel compelled to explore similar avenues to remain competitive and innovative in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Navigating the Landscape: Insights for Institutional Bitcoin Investors For any institution considering following DDC Enterprise’s path and delving into institutional Bitcoin investments, careful planning and due diligence are paramount. This isn’t a decision to be taken lightly, but rather one that requires a robust understanding of the digital asset space and its unique characteristics. Risk Assessment and Management: Develop a comprehensive risk management strategy that accounts for Bitcoin’s price volatility, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory shifts. This includes setting clear parameters for allocation and potential hedging strategies. Secure Custody Solutions: Partnering with reputable institutional-grade custodians is crucial for safeguarding significant Bitcoin holdings. Solutions range from multi-signature cold storage to regulated trust companies, ensuring the highest level of security. Accounting and Reporting: Understand the complex accounting implications of holding Bitcoin, which can vary by jurisdiction. Work with specialized auditors and legal counsel to ensure compliance with financial reporting standards and transparent reporting. Long-Term Vision: Corporate Bitcoin adoption is often driven by a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. A short-term trading mindset is generally not suited for treasury management. Board and Stakeholder Education: Educate key stakeholders, including board members and investors, on the rationale behind the Bitcoin treasury strategy, its potential benefits, and associated risks to ensure alignment and support for the initiative. These steps are critical for any company looking to successfully integrate Bitcoin into its balance sheet, moving beyond speculative interest to a foundational treasury asset and navigating the complexities of institutional Bitcoin investment effectively. What Do Increasing Crypto Corporate Holdings Mean for the Market? The growing trend of crypto corporate holdings, exemplified by DDC Enterprise’s expanding portfolio, carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It suggests a fundamental shift in how corporations view digital assets, moving them from niche investments to legitimate treasury components and influencing market dynamics. Increased Market Stability: Large corporate holdings tend to be long-term, reducing the available supply on exchanges and potentially contributing to price stability by absorbing selling pressure from short-term traders. Enhanced Legitimacy: When established, regulated companies like DDC Enterprise allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it confers a new level of legitimacy and trust on the asset class, making it more palatable for other institutional investors and the general public. Broader Ecosystem Development: The demand from corporations for secure custody, sophisticated trading tools, and clear regulatory frameworks drives innovation and development within the crypto infrastructure, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Mainstream Acceptance: As more companies hold Bitcoin, it normalizes its presence in financial discussions and transactions, accelerating its path towards mainstream acceptance as a global reserve asset. This trajectory points towards a future where Bitcoin is not just an alternative investment but a standard component of well-diversified corporate balance sheets. DDC Enterprise’s proactive stance is a testament to this evolving financial landscape, showcasing the profound impact increasing crypto corporate holdings can have on the market’s maturity and acceptance. DDC Enterprise’s bold decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 368 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the future of corporate treasury management. By embracing Bitcoin, companies like DDC Enterprise are not only seeking to enhance returns and hedge against inflation but are also positioning themselves at the forefront of a global financial revolution. This growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption underscores a paradigm shift, signaling a future where digital assets play a central role in the financial strategies of leading enterprises worldwide. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the pioneering spirit of companies like DDC Enterprise will undoubtedly inspire others to explore the transformative potential of Bitcoin.

2025-07-07T17:16:15,"TON’s staking-for-visa claim rejected by UAE in rare joint statement","Three words from UAE regulators—“no formal approval”—torpedoed TON’s viral staking-for-visa proposition. The foundation insists it was merely testing the waters, but critics see another case of crypto jumping the gun. On July 7, the TON Foundation scrambled to clarify its role in an unauthorized golden visa initiative after UAE authorities issued a rare joint statement disavowing any involvement. The controversy began on July 5 when a since-deleted X post claimed that staking $100,000 worth of Toncoin ( TON ) could fast-track applicants to a 10-year UAE residency, a pitch that quickly caught fire across crypto circles, even drawing cautious interest from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. By July 6, however, regulators from the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority, and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority had publicly shut down the idea, emphasizing that no such program exists. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON.,” the foundation wrote. You might also like: TRUMP hops to Tron, deepening ties between MAGA memecoins and Justin Sun Behind TON’s retreat: what the foundation what TON said—and what it didn’t The TON Foundation’s attempt to distance itself from the unauthorized golden visa announcement raised more questions than it answered. While the foundation called the initiative “exploratory,” that explanation raised eyebrows, especially when it cited working with a mystery “licensed partner” in blockchain infrastructure. They never named names or explained how this would actually meet the UAE’s notoriously strict crypto regulations – pretty big questions to leave unanswered. In its July 7 statement, the TON Foundation stressed the initiative was in “early stages” and would comply with all laws—a tacit admission it had jumped the gun. The pledge to communicate more “transparently” going forward rang hollow to critics, who noted how crypto projects increasingly push into real-world territory with premature or false claims, often without securing regulatory buy-in. One of the most high-profile skeptics was Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Based in the UAE himself, CZ briefly entertained the idea when it first surfaced, suggesting BNB Chain could explore a similar route if it proved legitimate. this is real, bnb should do the same — Rich (chill/acc) (@iwantlamboape) July 6, 2025 But within 24 hours of calling the rumored visa program “awesome,” CZ dismissed it as “aggressive and misleading marketing”—a stark reminder that even industry leaders can mistake hype for substance. FWIW. If this article is true (common sense says it is), then it's just aggressive/misleading marketing. DYOR. You can pay $1k (in most major cryptos) to an agent to submit an application for a golden visa. No guarantees, but if you are worth your salt, there is a high chance… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) July 7, 2025 Whether TON’s misstep will spur meaningful change in how the industry vets and announces collaborations remains to be seen.

2025-07-07T17:03:14,"Without Operational Alpha, Bitcoin Treasury Company Premiums Will Collapse","Listed companies are rapidly transforming into bitcoin treasury vehicles, raising capital to buy BTC and hold it on their balance sheets. With bitcoin increasingly seen as a potential global reserve asset, gaining institutional traction and strong price expectations, this trend might seem sound. But there’s a problem: most of these companies have acquisition plans without a business plan. Why buy at a premium when you can buy bitcoin directly? Almost any investor can buy bitcoin directly, either spot or via ETFs. So why invest through a listed company trading at a significant premium to the net asset value (NAV) of its bitcoin? The short answer is: you shouldn’t, unless the company has a clear strategy for putting its bBitcoin to work in a way investors can't easily replicate. Holding BTC must serve an operational purpose. Otherwise, the company should return the capital and let shareholders buy bitcoin on their own terms. Bitcoin Yield ≠ Business Model To justify premiums, some analysts now use the concept of bitcoin yield , the percentage increase in BTC per share over time. While it’s an interesting KPI to track, it doesn’t justify a premium to NAV on its own. Yes, if a company issues equity at a premium above NAV and buys more BTC, it can increase BTC per share. But if an investor’s goal is to gain the maximum bitcoin exposure per dollar invested, investors should just buy BTC directly. Leveraged long with limited upside To speed up their acquisitions, many treasury companies raise capital through various types of convertible debt. The result is a leveraged long position in bitcoin, with full downside exposure and limited upside. This structure is exactly why creditors have been eager to underwrite such instruments. If bitcoin falls, creditors get repaid in USD, while the company may be forced to sell its BTC holdings to cover the debt. If bitcoin rises, creditors convert their debt into shares at a discount and sell them to capture the upside above the conversion price. That’s upside that would otherwise belong to shareholders. As an investor choosing between buying into a leveraged bBitcoin equity company or simply taking on leverage against your own BTC, you have to ask: Is the reduced upside worth avoiding the work of doing it yourself? If the company also trades at a substantial premium to its underlying bitcoin and lacks any operational plan beyond buying and holding BTC, the answer is likely no. The same applies to other simple risk-taking strategies, such as lending out BTC in exchange for interest; they introduce risk, but do little to justify the premium. A business plan, not just a BTC plan This doesn’t mean all bitcoin treasury companies should trade at or below NAV. But a premium requires more than a funding and acquisition strategy, it requires a business strategy. A strong bitcoin balance sheet can serve as a powerful foundation for an operational business. In finance, balance sheets are the basis for lending, trading, structuring and more, and some of the current nBitcoin treasury companies will likely emerge as financial giants of the future. Brokerage, liquidity provision, collateralized lending and structured products are all examples of operational models that can scale, generate revenue, and justify premium valuations. By contrast, simply raising funds to chase ""bitcoin yield"" is not a business plan. If a pure play treasury company doesn't develop an operational plan, its premium will collapse, and it may eventually be acquired by a firm that does know how to put bitcoin to work. Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. To beat BTC, companies must do more than just buy and hold it. They must figure out how to build a Bitcoin-based business.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/07/without-operational-alpha-bitcoin-treasury-company-premiums-will-collapse,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T17:03:08,"Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Holdings With New $239M Purchase","Japanese investment company Metaplanet has taken another big step in its Bitcoin (BTC) strategy. In a recent X post , the firm revealed it had purchased an additional 2,205 BTC, worth about $238.7 million. This new purchase has pushed Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings to 15,555 BTC. This move reflects both the company’s ongoing commitment to Bitcoin and a growing trend among institutional investors. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off, Sees Revenue Jumps in Q2 The latest acquisition, bought at an average price of $108,237 per coin, places Metaplanet as the fifth-largest publicly listed company holding the top coin. Meanwhile, U.S.-based software intelligence firm Strategy is topping the list, now owning more than 597,000 BTC. Metaplanet’s focus on building its business around the flagship crypto has shown strong financial results. In Q2 2025, the company reported revenue of nearly 1.1 billion Japanese yen, equal to about $7.6 million. This figure represents a 42.4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. The company states that its goal is to develop a business model that is long-lasting, easily scalable, and efficient to manage, utilizing Bitcoin as its financial foundation. This recent revenue growth indicates that its plan is gaining momentum and attracting attention from both investors and the broader financial market. Metaplanet Sets Ambitious Bitcoin Goal In June, Metaplanet updated its long-term goal for its crypto holdings. The company now aims to own over 210,000 BTC by the end of the year 2027. This is a major target and signals the company’s strong belief in the future value and importance of the digital coin in the global financial system. If Metaplanet reaches this goal, it would become one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. This would place it in a very strong position within the fast-growing world of digital assets. Metaplanet’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy reflects a broader growing trend. Many companies are increasingly treating the top coin not just as an investment, but as a strategic asset. Earlier today, Semsler Scientific purchased 187 BTC for approximately $ 20 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 4,636. Firms like Tether-backed Twenty-First, GameStop, and Trump Media are also among the new entrants following this trend. Market Reaction and Stock Performance Following this news, Metaplanet stock dipped by 1.8% while the market remained open, according to Yahoo Finance data. Despite the slight drop, the company’s share price has performed very well over the past several months. In the past month, Metaplanet’s stock has gone up by almost 14% and has jumped by 339% since the start of the year. This substantial rise indicates that investors are confident in Metaplanet’s focus on Bitcoin. It also means they trust the company to grow and handle its investments carefully.

2025-07-07T17:00:28,"Ethereum To Outperform Bitcoin: Buy Before Mid-August, Analyst Warns","A crypto market expert has predicted that Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin, is about to flip the script on Bitcoin (BTC), the number one cryptocurrency. According to the forecast, ETH could significantly outperform BTC in this bull cycle—but the opportunity won’t last long. The analyst warns that the key window to buy in is before mid-August, when Ethereum could start showing real strength in the market . Ethereum To Overtake Bitcoin By Mid-August Experienced crypto analyst Polaris_xbt presented a macro analysis of the ETH/BTC chart on a recent X (formerly Twitter) post , suggesting that Ethereum is on the verge of a major reversal that could see it overtake Bitcoin once again . Drawing from historical price cycles and on-chain volume patterns, the expert highlights that Ethereum tends to lag behind Bitcoin in performance following a market bottom, but eventually catches up with explosive upside. This pattern has repeated in past cycles, with Ethereum beginning to outperform Bitcoin two months after its 2017 bottom and four months after the 2019 low. The current ETH/BTC cycle shows a much slower and extended downtrend that has lasted several years, culminating in a Rounded Bottom formation . Based on the analyst’s chart, Ethereum appears to have established a macro low at a key support zone between 0.01789 and 0.02326 BTC, following a 120-day consolidation period. This mirrors the 125-day lag observed in 2019 before the ETH/BTC breakout began. Polaris_xbt has identified August 17, 2025, as the end of a key speculative window, indicating that this cycle is similarly delayed, and an altcoin outperformance, led by Ethereum , is likely to begin shortly afterward. The analyst chart points to a macro control level at 0.03116 BTC as a critical region, with higher resistance zones mapped out at 0.05372 and 0.08148. These areas represent potential upside targets if Ethereum resumes its historical trend of outpacing Bitcoin during the latter stages of each market cycle. With the chart structure showing a break from the long-term downtrend , the setup strongly supports an accumulation at current levels. Polaris_xbt warns that the next five weeks represent a rare opportunity to buy ETH at a significant discount ahead of the projected shift in market dynamics. ETH-BTC Reversal Timing Sparks Debate Polaris_xbt’s optimistic ETH/BTC forecast has sparked debate within the crypto community, with some analysts questioning whether the pair’s momentum will shift this year at all. One community member suggested the bullish conditions of the ETH/BTC ratio might not play out completely until 2026–an outlook that appears to contradict the cycle structure observed since the inception of the crypto market. In response, Polaris_xbt acknowledged the uncertainty but maintained confidence in a mid-2025 recovery. He expects a potential Double Bottom pattern to form during the summer months, after which the ETH/BTC pair could begin a steady upward trajectory. The analyst added that the key milestone remains the mid-range level around 0.03116 on the chart, which acts as both a macro resistance and psychological pivot point.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-to-outperform-bitcoin/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Ethereum|Double Bottom Pattern|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ETH-BTC|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Polaris_xbt",cryptocompare

Bloomberg reports that the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) uses software, subpoenas and spreadsheets to identify and go after criminals behind fraudulent crypto scams, including pig butchering operations that offer fake investments to victims. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the GIOC has already seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the last 10 years. The Secret Service itself is already one of the world’s biggest crypto custodians after leading crackdowns on digital currencies such as Liberty Reserve and E-Gold in the 1990s. A team led by lawyer Kali Smith, who directs the Secret Service’s cryptocurrency strategy, is conducting workshops in different countries to train law enforcers and prosecutors to uncover digital crimes. The agency provides the training for free and is particularly interested in jurisdictions where criminals take advantage of weak oversight or residency-for-sale programs. Smith says fraudsters have several misconceptions about cryptocurrencies. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case.” The Secret Service has also partnered with Coinbase and other industry insiders like stablecoin issuer Tether, which provided assistance in recent cases with trace analysis and wallet freezes. Fraud involving cryptocurrencies now accounts for the majority of internet crime losses in the US. Last year, Americans reported $9.3 billion in crypto-related scams or more than half of the reported $16.6 billion.

2025-07-07T16:51:51,"ICP Rebounds From Intraday Lows as Support at $4.80 Holds Firm","Internet Computer (ICP) exhibited notable resilience over the past 24 hours, weathering a volatile trading session shaped by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. After falling to $4.78, the token rebounded to nearly $4.85 , ultimately settling at $4.7771, down 0.98% on the day. ICP has respected its key support level at $4.80, which was tested and confirmed multiple times throughout the session, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. This level has become a critical pivot zone for traders eyeing potential upside if broader sentiment continues to improve. Macro factors remain influential across the crypto landscape. While geopolitical tensions have unsettled markets, bitcoin's return to $109,000 during the Asian morning sparked volume increases across multiple assets, including ICP, despite relative price stability. ICP’s ability to bounce from support while absorbing intraday volatility could signal traders' growing confidence. Technical Analysis Highlights ICP traded in a 2.54% range, with prices fluctuating between $4.78 and $4.90 from July 6 at 15:00 UTC to July 7 at 14:00 UTC. Strong resistance at $4.90 was tested twice during evening hours on July 6. Support at $4.80 was validated by repeated bounces and acted as a launch point for upward moves. Between 13:05–14:04 UTC on July 7, ICP rallied 0.62%, from $4.81 to $4.84, confirming bullish momentum. Price consolidated between 13:05–13:20 before a breakout began at 13:21 UTC. A sharp rally between 13:57–13:59 lifted ICP to $4.85, marking a nearly 2% jump. Volume surged during 13:41–13:43 (66,623 ICP) and again at 13:57–13:58 (14,170 ICP), suggesting possible institutional buy-ins.

2025-07-07T16:50:50,"Strategy to raise $4.2b via STRD stock sale to fund new Bitcoin purchases","Bitcoin giant Strategy is preparing to make a massive $4.2 billion Bitcoin purchase, funded with more stock sales. After taking a brief pause in purchases, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is preparing for another massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy. On Monday, July 7, the Bitcoin investment firm announced a $4.2 billion at-the-market stock offering. The company is selling a 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, trading on Nasdaq under the ticker STRD. The stock pays a 10% dividend, has priority over other stocks in liquidations, and has no fixed maturity rate. You might also like: Strategy introduced a new perpetual called Stride (STRD). Some call it genius, others say it has ‘Ponzi vibes’ Strategy will sell these shares over a period of time, at their market price. This is typically done to avoid a large supply shock that could tank the stock’s price. The proceeds of the sales will go toward buying Bitcoin, paying dividends on other preferred shares, and funding its operations. $4.2B sale comes after Strategy’s Bitcoin hiatus The latest purchase comes after a brief hiatus in the weekly reporting period from June 30 and July 9. This was the first week in which Strategy made no Bitcoin purchases since early April, briefly pausing its aggressive BTC accumulation. The last time that Strategy raised capital was on June 10 this year in an underwritten public offering . At the time, the company raised $979.7 million from direct investments from investment banks. These banks bought shares upfront and then sold them to the public. You might also like: 91% chance MSTR enters S&P 500 — and Bitcoin becomes an index asset by proxy So far, Strategy has amassed $64.4 billion worth of Bitcoin, or 597,325 BTC. This accumulation brought $22 billion in unrealized profits, as this BTC was bought for a total of $42.4 billion. The total amount of Strategy’s BTC tokens now makes up nearly 3% of the total supply, making it by far the largest corporate holder. Still, its leveraged Bitcoin purchases are causing some concerns over sustainability, especially if Bitcoin’s price falls substantially.

2025-07-07T16:39:09,"Bitcoin fails to break $109K, but bullish setups hint at a breakout ahead","Bitcoin bulls opened the week with a renewed push toward all-time highs, fuelled by fresh macro optimism. However, the rally lost steam just below the $109,000 resistance band. During today’s Asian trading session, the market saw sharp volatility as the total crypto market cap briefly surged to $3.45 trillion before retreating to $3.343 trillion by late evening. Bullish cues from the US drove the broader upswing, keeping market sentiment firmly in “greed” territory with the crypto fear and greed index held at 73, up 7 points in the past 24 hours. For altcoins, however, the momentum faltered, with most major tokens slipping into the red after surrendering their early-day gains. Why did Bitcoin go up? Bitcoin rallied to an intraday high of $109,574, less than 2% away from its all-time high of $111,814, buoyed by a wave of positive macroeconomic developments out of the United States. Gains were fuelled by renewed risk appetite after US President Donald Trump announced a delay in the next round of tariffs until August 1. The unexpected move offered markets a temporary reprieve from trade war escalation fears, lifting sentiment across global equities and crypto markets alike. Adding to the bullish momentum was Trump’s signing of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” on July 4. While analysts warn the plan could add as much as $7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, Bitcoin proponents see the ballooning deficit as a tailwind for hard assets. The latest surge also came as Bitcoin closed last week with its highest-ever weekly candle, extending a broader uptrend that has built steadily since mid-June. Traders say the July 7 rally was partly driven by short covering and fresh inflows from investors positioning for a breakout. Meanwhile, political tensions in the US have added a fresh twist. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, once seen as a close Trump ally, publicly criticised the president over the soaring national debt, which now exceeds $35 trillion and is set to grow further under the new fiscal package. Musk warned that the current pace of borrowing could bankrupt the country, echoing broader concerns about inflation and long-term economic stability. Further, Musk also disclosed that his newly established America Party would embrace Bitcoin. These remarks have greatly inflated retail enthusiasm and appeared to strike a chord with crypto-leaning voter blocs who expect the “Musk effect” to help push Bitcoin to new all-time highs. Will Bitcoin go up? After failing to break past the $109,000 resistance, Bitcoin receded 1.24% to $108,406 at press time. A closer look at Binance’s BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap shows a dense cluster of liquidation levels and resting sell orders between $109,000 and $110,000, creating a significant barrier for further upside. Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap. Source: Coinglass. These zones, often referred to as liquidity traps, tend to attract price action before reversing direction, as leveraged positions are forcefully closed. This high-density liquidation band likely contributed to the pullback, with market makers and large players using the zone to offload or hedge positions. The sharp rejection aligns with what traders call a “liquidity sweep,” where the price briefly tests resistance to trigger stops before retreating. On the downside, Bitcoin appears to be holding above immediate support at the $108,000 mark, where the heatmap shows a moderate buildup of bid liquidity. If this level fails to hold, the next key support lies near $106,500, followed by a stronger base around $105,000. To regain momentum, Bitcoin would need a strong push through the $109,500–$110,000 zone, which could open the path toward retesting the $111,814 all-time high. Until then, range-bound trading and profit-taking near resistance may continue to define short-term price action. Expectations remain high that Bitcoin could break new ground this week, with attention now shifting to two key catalysts, Wednesday’s US trade tariff deadline and the start of “Crypto Week” in Washington. According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Bitcoin could set a new all-time high this week or next, with the rationale being post–July 4 seasonality trends, which “tend to be bullish.” Further, he added that markets may have largely shrugged off tariff-related risks so far. On top of that, Wednesday, July 9, marks the end of a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs between the US and its trade partners. Commenting on the development, analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said that if tariffs are postponed, traders may view this as a sign of hesitation to escalate trade tensions, and such a move would boost overall risk appetite. Among other signs, traders are also watching Bitcoin’s historical price patterns for further cues. Pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC has historically set its high or low for the month within the first 12 days more than 80% of the time. Daan Crypto Trades @DaanCrypto · Follow $BTC Sets its high or low of the month within its first 12 days over 80% of the time.It then usually proceeds to trend in the other direction for a sizeable 20%+ move from that high or low.Last month was an exception as the month remained relatively stable with small moves. 1:31 am · 7 Jul 2025 266 Reply Copy link Read 75 replies That level is often followed by a move of 20% or more in the opposite direction. With Bitcoin currently hovering near its monthly high, the setup is ripe for a strong continuation if resistance breaks. Adding to bullish signals, technical indicators are also flashing breakout potential. Notably, Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands are tighter than they’ve been in over a year on the three-day timeframe, according to market analyst Crypto Rover, which positions the benchmark crypto for a major upside rally. Crypto Rover @rovercrc · Follow Bitcoin Bollinger Bands are tighter than they’ve been in over a year.BIG PUMP INCOMING! 1:33 pm · 6 Jul 2025 247 Reply Copy link Read 92 replies The last time this was spotted on the charts was in February 2024, Bitcoin surged 75% in just over a month, from around $42,000 to its then-record high of $74,000. If history repeats, Rover believes a decisive breakout could propel BTC toward $190,000, even though traders remain cautious of short-term volatility. Among other historical trends, Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio is currently at 2.23, which is comfortably above its 365-day simple moving average of 2.15, according to CryptoQuant. Historically, Bitcoin uptrends tend to remain intact as long as the MVRV stays above that moving average, veteran analyst Burakkesmeci explained in a recent analysis. Altcoin market recap The total altcoin market fell 1.5% over the past 24 hours to $1.25 trillion at the time of writing. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, declined by nearly 1% over the past day to $2,540. Other major altcoins posted mixed results during the same period, with XRP (XRP) rising 2.5%, while Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) recorded more modest gains of approximately 0.5%. In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Sui both fell by 1%, reflecting continued volatility and a lack of unified directional momentum across the altcoin sector. Celestia (TIA), SPX6900 (SPX), and Stellar (XLM) provided the strongest resistance among the top 99 altcoins during the broader market downturn, holding modest gains of 5.1%, 4.9%, and 4.1%, respectively. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Celestia: TIA’s gains today can be largely attributed to improving market sentiment following a bullish breakout from a falling wedge pattern, an early technical indicator often associated with potential trend reversals. SPX6900: While no specific catalyst could be identified for SPX’s gains at the time of writing, the rally was likely driven by investor hype surrounding the meme coin’s strong year-to-date performance, which stands at nearly 350%. Stellar: Though no immediate trigger was apparent for XLM’s rally, it likely followed a shift in investor sentiment driven by increased user engagement, with weekly transactions rising 11% and active addresses up 10%, according to Nansen. Further, the total stablecoin supply on Stellar reached a record high of $667 million today, while, according to data from DefiLama, the total value locked on the Stellar network has also increased for the fifth consecutive month.

2025-07-07T16:34:22,"Rate Cut Hopes & Tariff News Propel Bitcoin Toward ATH","Bitcoin is back in the headlines, and this time not just crypto investors are sitting up and taking notice. Hot news from Washington and speculation from the Federal Reserve have investors and traders holding their breath as the world's biggest cryptocurrency toys with a new all-time high. Last week, the US Treasury shocked everyone with the news: the much-feared new round of tariffs on imported foreign goods would be delayed until August 1. For global markets, that was a welcome relief. For Bitcoin, it was rocket fuel. The delay assuaged worries about an economic jolt to the system, prompting traders to flock to riskier assets—like BTC. Adding to the upbeat mood, several Fed officials also signaled that interest rate cuts were in the offing as soon as this September. Goldman Sachs took it a step further and predicted three cuts by year-end, based on the rationale that both inflation has eased and the labor market is moderating. For Bitcoin, which survives on macro turmoil and the prospect of cheaper funds, this was the kind of news bulls wanted to hear. Bitcoin wasted little time to respond. Over the weekend and through Monday, it spiked above $109,000, a new weekly high, and was close in sight of its all-time record $111,814 set just weeks earlier. Traders are placing wagers openly now that BTC will move above the $110,000 barrier in days. Date BTC Price Catalyst July 6, 2025 $109,200+ Tariff delay, Fed optimism May 22, 2025 $111,814 (ATH) Previous record high What the Markets Are Really Saying The rolling swap market—a favorite playground for professionals—suggests funding rates near zero. This means the market is balanced, with bulls and bears not getting too excited. But 71% of funding periods remain positive, a subtle signal there is a tendency to go long. Option traders aren't panicking, either. The 25 Delta Skew, one of the main measures of sentiment, has cooled down, and implied volatility is at record lows. Translation: the market expects smooth sailing, but experience-karmic traders know that still waters can hide sudden storms. Order-Book Depth Spot and futures volumes are lower, which is to be expected in summer. Underneath, however, lies a thick layer of buy orders just beneath $109K—a safety net that might turn into a springboard in a jiffy if momentum takes off. What Traders and Social Media Are Saying Crypto is not charts and graphs—it's hype, emotion, and narratives that individuals share with each other. This week, Crypto X and trading boards have been in a frenzy: “Tariff delay + dovish Fed = rocket fuel for BTC. $110K in sight!” — @CryptoMacro “Bitcoin’s order book is stacked with bids just below $109K. If we break $110K, look for fireworks.” — @OrderFlowBTC “Markets shrugged off tariff fears. All eyes on Fed and CPI next week. BTC ATH soon?” — @MacroTrader Key Info to Watch Any reversal or intensification of US trade policy can flip sentiment in a flash. The next Federal Reserve meeting and inflation data will be key. If the Fed implements a dovish shift, another bout of buying will be in the cards. Watch funding rates and options skew for signs of early warning for exhaustion or fresh momentum. A recent spike in spot or futures volume can indicate a breakout—or reversal—is imminent. The Takeaway Bitcoin's recent rally is a textbook example of how human psychology and international news can interact to move markets. With a tariff break and the promise of decreasing interest rates, traders are going all in on a new high. But as always in crypto, the only thing that's certain is volatility—and the next act could be just as exciting as the previous one.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9832/rate-cut-hopes-and-tariff-news-propel-bitcoin-toward-ath,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Crypto.com offers copy-trading for funds and politicians The crypto, trading, and fintech app picked a total of 11 prominent investors in the stock space, selected for their experience or social media influence. The copy-trading feature is also available for the portfolios of Jensen Huang, Bill Gates, Brad Gerstner, David Tepper, Dan Meuser, Paul Singer, Dan Crenshaw, and Josh Gottheimer. The investment baskets are based on each investor whale’s publicly disclosed portfolio. Crypto.com bases its stock selection on 13F filings when copying funds, required of all investors with over $100M in assets. The stock picks of politicians are based on Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK), which requires members of Congress and other officials to report personal securities trades above $1,000 within 45 days. The basket allocations may lag behind the exact actions, and Crypto.com will report as early as possible. Each investor’s approach differs, targeting varied types of stocks and different trades.

The trading will involve actual stock ownership and not tokenized shares. Crypto.com targets US persons The whale baskets will be available to US persons, and the shares will be provided by FINRA-registered Foris Capital US LLC. Complex trading strategies such as options and short trading will not be part of the direct copying. The app may lag in reporting all portfolio stocks and not reflect complex strategies, private deals, or other decisions. The portfolios will lag for up to 45 days, based on official reporting requirements, at which time there may be material changes to the whale baskets. The new feature will target retail investors, who can allocate as little as $50. The purchase can be funded both from the fiat or crypto reserves on the Crypto.com app. Crypto.com does not charge any commission on stock basket purchases or a subscription fee. The basket orders will be placed as Market orders denominated in US dollars. For payments in crypto, traders will have their assets sold for dollars, and then the proceeds will be used to make a stock order. The market for baskets will queue up orders outside market open hours based on the US stock market schedule. Traders can also choose to sell percentages or dollar amounts from each basket, though they must wait for the completion of the previous order before opening up a new trade. Users will also be notified of changes in the whale portfolios, and can choose to retain their previous allocation or buy the changed portfolio using the app’s tool to edit the holdings.

2025-07-07T16:20:33,"Bitcoin Acquisition: Strategy’s Bold $4.2B Move","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: Strategy’s Bold $4.2B Move In a move that has sent ripples across both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world, Strategy has unveiled an ambitious plan to bolster its digital asset holdings. The company announced an at-the-market (ATM) program designed to raise a staggering $4.2 billion. This significant capital infusion isn’t just for general operations; a substantial portion is earmarked for a crucial purpose: a continued Bitcoin acquisition spree. This bold declaration underscores Strategy’s unwavering commitment to its digital asset-centric vision, setting a new precedent for corporate treasury management in the age of digital currency. What Exactly is Strategy’s $4.2 Billion ATM Program All About? At its core, an at-the-market (ATM) program is a flexible method for a company to issue new shares of its stock directly into the open market over a period of time, typically at prevailing market prices. Unlike a traditional fixed-price offering, an ATM program allows a company to raise capital incrementally, capitalizing on favorable market conditions and minimizing market disruption. Strategy’s specific announcement details an ATM program to sell up to $4.2 billion of its 10% Series A Perpetual STRD Preferred Stock. This isn’t common stock, but a different class of equity with specific characteristics: Preferred Stock: This type of stock typically pays a fixed dividend and has priority over common stock for dividend payments and asset distribution in case of liquidation. Perpetual: This means the stock has no maturity date, essentially remaining outstanding indefinitely. 10% Series A STRD: This indicates a specific series of preferred stock with a 10% dividend rate, making it an attractive income-generating asset for investors. The proceeds from this massive offering are designated for a range of general corporate purposes, including working capital, dividend payments, and most notably, further Bitcoin acquisition . This strategic allocation highlights the company’s dual focus: maintaining operational stability while aggressively pursuing its digital asset investment thesis. Why is This a Cornerstone of Strategy’s Corporate Strategy for Bitcoin? Strategy has long been a vocal proponent and a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Its CEO has consistently articulated a vision where Bitcoin serves as a superior treasury reserve asset, offering a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. This latest $4.2 billion ATM program is not an isolated event but a continuation and amplification of this established corporate strategy . Several factors underpin this aggressive stance: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion, many corporations are seeking alternatives to traditional cash holdings, which can depreciate in value. Bitcoin, with its finite supply, is viewed by Strategy as a robust inflation hedge. Long-Term Value Appreciation: The company believes in Bitcoin’s potential for significant long-term capital appreciation, positioning it as a growth asset on its balance sheet. First-Mover Advantage: By being an early and significant institutional holder of Bitcoin, Strategy aims to capitalize on potential future mainstream adoption and market maturation. Shareholder Value: The company argues that holding Bitcoin ultimately enhances shareholder value by optimizing its balance sheet and providing exposure to a rapidly evolving asset class. This program signals a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s future, moving beyond initial exploratory purchases to a systematic, large-scale funding mechanism for digital asset accumulation. It’s a clear statement that Bitcoin isn’t just an experiment for Strategy; it’s a fundamental pillar of its financial future. How Will This Initiative Impact Bitcoin Funding and the Broader Crypto Landscape? The sheer scale of Strategy’s $4.2 billion ATM program has significant implications for both its own Bitcoin funding capabilities and the wider cryptocurrency market. When a major public company announces such a large-scale intention to buy Bitcoin, it can: Impact Area Description Market Demand & Price A consistent buyer like Strategy, with billions to deploy, adds significant buying pressure to the Bitcoin market. This sustained demand could provide price support or even contribute to upward price movements over time. Institutional Validation Strategy’s continued commitment, especially with such a large funding mechanism, serves as a powerful validation for other corporations considering Bitcoin for their treasuries. It normalizes the idea of Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset. Liquidity Dynamics While $4.2 billion is a large sum, the ATM program’s gradual nature means the Bitcoin purchases will likely be spread out, minimizing sudden shocks to market liquidity. However, it signifies a sustained drain on available supply. Investor Sentiment The news can boost investor confidence in Bitcoin, especially among those who look to institutional adoption as a key growth driver. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin’s growing maturity. This initiative solidifies Strategy’s position as a bellwether for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Its actions are closely watched by other companies and investors alike, making this ATM program a critical development for the entire digital asset ecosystem. What Role Does Preferred Stock Play in Fueling Strategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Ambitions? The choice to issue preferred stock rather than common stock or debt for this significant capital raise is a deliberate financial decision that aligns with Strategy’s long-term objectives for Bitcoin acquisition . Here’s why preferred stock is a strategic choice for this purpose: Less Dilution of Common Shareholders: Unlike common stock, preferred stock typically does not carry voting rights. This means that Strategy can raise substantial capital without diluting the control or voting power of its existing common shareholders, which is often a priority for management. Stable Capital Source: The perpetual nature of the preferred stock provides a long-term, stable source of capital for Strategy. This stability is crucial for funding a long-term asset accumulation strategy like Bitcoin, which can be volatile in the short term. Fixed Dividend Obligation: While preferred stock comes with a fixed dividend payment (in this case, 10%), this predictable cost can be easier to manage than fluctuating interest payments on certain types of debt, or the pressure to generate immediate returns that might come with equity. Attractive to Income Investors: The 10% dividend rate makes this preferred stock attractive to investors seeking regular income, broadening the pool of potential investors beyond those solely focused on growth stocks. This can facilitate easier and more efficient capital raising. Balance Sheet Flexibility: Raising capital through preferred stock allows Strategy to maintain flexibility in its debt covenants and avoid taking on additional debt, which could impact its credit rating or future borrowing capacity. This approach allows Strategy to fuel its Bitcoin strategy while managing its capital structure prudently, balancing the desire for digital asset exposure with traditional financial considerations. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While Strategy’s bold move presents significant opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges that the company will need to navigate carefully: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. While Strategy is a long-term holder, significant downward movements could impact the perceived value of its holdings and potentially lead to mark-to-market losses on its balance sheet, affecting investor sentiment. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the holding, accounting, or tax treatment of Bitcoin, posing potential risks for corporate treasuries. Execution Risk of ATM Program: While flexible, an ATM program’s success depends on market demand for the preferred stock. If demand wanes, Strategy might not be able to raise the full $4.2 billion as quickly or efficiently as desired. Public Perception and Shareholder Scrutiny: Not all investors agree with a Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy. Strategy will continue to face scrutiny and potential criticism from shareholders who prefer a more traditional treasury approach. Despite these challenges, the opportunity for Strategy to position itself at the forefront of digital asset adoption and potentially unlock significant long-term value remains a powerful driver behind this strategic financial maneuver. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? For investors, Strategy’s $4.2 billion ATM program and its explicit focus on Bitcoin acquisition offer several key insights: For Strategy Stockholders: Understand that you are investing in a company with a strong conviction in Bitcoin. Your investment is now more directly tied to the performance of Bitcoin. The issuance of preferred stock, while less dilutive to common shares than a common stock offering, introduces a fixed dividend obligation for the company. For Bitcoin Investors: This news reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. Strategy’s consistent buying provides a fundamental demand floor, potentially mitigating extreme downside volatility in the long run. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as a treasury asset. Broader Market Implications: Watch for other companies to potentially follow Strategy’s lead. As the regulatory environment clarifies and the benefits become more apparent, more corporations might consider similar Bitcoin funding strategies for their balance sheets. Due Diligence is Key: Whether you’re considering Strategy’s stock or Bitcoin itself, thorough research into the company’s financials, its Bitcoin strategy, and the broader crypto market trends is crucial. This move highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space, creating new avenues for investment and corporate strategy. Strategy’s decision to launch a $4.2 billion ATM program specifically to fund its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition strategy is nothing short of groundbreaking. It’s a powerful affirmation of the company’s conviction in Bitcoin as a foundational asset for its future. By leveraging preferred stock , Strategy is executing a sophisticated corporate strategy that aims to secure significant capital for digital asset accumulation while managing its financial structure prudently. This initiative is set to significantly impact its own Bitcoin funding capabilities and serves as a major indicator of increasing institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency market. As the financial world continues to evolve, Strategy remains a key player to watch, pioneering new approaches to corporate treasury management in the digital age. This bold move underscores the transformative potential of digital assets and their growing role in the global economy.

2025-07-07T16:15:52,"The Coming Crypto Tax Bomb","Crypto taxpayers are in for a rude awakening. We’re 16+ years into Bitcoin, yet taxpayers and CPAs still pretend that tax guidance remains unclear or even nonexistent. The IRS is gearing up for a historic wave of compliance audits targeting the crypto space, and taxpayers have no idea what they’re in for. Last year, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2024-28, fundamentally changing how crypto should be tracked from a tax perspective. Providing crystal clear guidance, safe harbors for taxpayers to get compliant, and deadlines to migrate by. The rules are clear, the expectations set, with the IRS quietly positioning itself to issue a wave of compliance audits for those still with their head in the sand. The reckoning is already beginning as we’re seeing an unprecedented amount of 6174, 6174-A, and 6173 letters being sent out by the IRS. Typically, this time of the year is quiet. But for the past several weeks, our phone has been ringing non-stop from taxpayers receiving these notices from the IRS demanding they get compliant “or else.” And it’s not just us – crypto tax firms across the board are reporting the same activity, indicating the IRS knows taxpayers have casually engaged in crypto tax evasion, and they are here to collect what they’ve failed to collect for the past decade. Strategically pairing Rev-Proc 24-28 with the release of the new Form 1099-DA, the IRS is positioned to blindside taxpayers and CPAs who have neglected getting compliant. The 2025 tax year will be pivotal as the IRS now has an abundance of ammunition to use in audits. Gone are the days where taxpayers could defer to defenses like “well, the guidance was unclear, so I just did my best.” The IRS has been explicit, the guidance is clear, and the penalties for non-compliance have been outlined, yet taxpayers and CPAs still assume we’re in the Wild West. On top of this, Form 1099-DAs will be issued to both taxpayers and the IRS alike by brokers, but there’s a major catch: the form won’t include cost basis for the 2025 tax year, and will almost certainly include incorrect cost basis for years after. That means when you transfer assets into an exchange and later sell them, the sale gets reported — but the exchange has no idea what you originally paid. In the absence of that information, the form defaults to showing a $0 cost basis. To the IRS or a traditional CPA, it looks like pure profit. Say you buy 1 ETH for $2,200, move it to Coinbase, and sell it for $2,500. If Coinbase doesn’t have the cost basis, the form shows a $2,500 gain. Your actual gain was $300 — but unless you’ve tracked that basis yourself, the IRS won’t know. And they’ll assume the worst. A widespread problem This isn’t a one-off scenario. It’s going to affect hundreds of thousands of taxpayers. If those inflated gains go uncorrected, they’ll either result in unnecessary tax owed or trigger an audit. And many CPAs won’t catch it, because most still aren’t equipped to handle crypto properly. They don’t understand how wallets work. They confuse transfers with sales. They miss staking rewards and DeFi activity entirely. Clients think their CPA is on top of it. CPAs assume the 1099 is accurate. No one’s double-checking. That’s where things go wrong. And that’s exactly what the IRS is counting on. The old defense — that the guidance wasn’t clear — doesn’t hold up anymore. The IRS has been direct. The expectations are spelled out. The time to fix things is NOW, before an enforcement letter is received. Crypto isn’t some edge case anymore. Tens of millions of Americans have bought, sold, staked, lent, or transferred digital assets. Most have done a poor job keeping records. Some haven’t even tried. The result is a tax system full of underreported gains, misclassified income, inconsistent filings, and the taxman looking for revenge. The most common mistakes aren’t complex. Transfers between wallets are flagged as sales. Assets appear on exchanges with no cost basis attached. Staking rewards and airdrops go unreported. DeFi activity is missing entirely. And year after year, taxpayers and professionals rely on CSV exports that were never designed for tax reporting in the first place. These aren’t edge cases. They’re pervasive amongst crypto investors. And at scale, they add up to a compliance problem the IRS is now fully equipped to pursue. This is no longer about gray areas or technicalities. It’s about a growing mismatch between how taxpayers think crypto taxes work — and how the IRS now expects them to be handled. That gap is where the risk lives, and with the established guidance, the IRS won’t be pulling any punches.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/07/the-coming-crypto-tax-bomb,"REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BTC|ETH","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T16:10:55,"MicroStrategy’s Unprecedented Bitcoin Holdings: A Bold Strategic Pause","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy’s Unprecedented Bitcoin Holdings: A Bold Strategic Pause In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, few entities have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts quite like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). The software intelligence firm has become synonymous with Bitcoin, pioneering a corporate treasury strategy that has seen it accumulate a staggering amount of the digital asset. Recently, however, a notable development has emerged: a temporary halt in its relentless Bitcoin acquisition drive. This strategic pause, disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has sparked conversations across the market. What does it signify for the future of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings and the broader corporate adoption landscape? Understanding MicroStrategy’s Astounding Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy’s journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020, spearheaded by its then-CEO, Michael Saylor, who famously declared Bitcoin to be a superior store of value. Since then, the company has consistently added BTC to its balance sheet, turning itself into the largest publicly traded corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. The latest SEC filing reveals that between June 30 and July 6, MicroStrategy paused its Bitcoin purchases, marking the first such break since April. As of its last disclosure, MicroStrategy’s portfolio boasts an incredible 597,325 BTC . Valued at an astonishing $65 billion , these holdings represent a significant portion of the company’s overall market capitalization and a powerful bet on the future of digital assets. The average purchase price for this colossal stash stands at approximately $70,982 per BTC . This strategic accumulation has positioned MicroStrategy to realize substantial unrealized gains, currently estimated at a remarkable $22.6 billion , underscoring the success of its audacious strategy. This immense accumulation has transformed MicroStrategy into a de facto Bitcoin ETF for many investors, offering exposure to the leading cryptocurrency through traditional equity markets. The sheer scale of their holdings makes any move by the company, including a pause in acquisitions, a subject of intense scrutiny and analysis within the crypto community. Bitcoin Purchases Pause: A Strategic Reassessment or Opportunity? The recent Bitcoin purchases pause by MicroStrategy is a notable event, given their consistent buying pattern over the past few years. While the duration of this specific pause was short (June 30 to July 6), it invites speculation about the company’s current strategic outlook. Is this a momentary lull, a tactical adjustment, or does it hint at a broader reassessment of their acquisition pace? Several factors could contribute to such a decision: Market Valuation: With Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, the company might be evaluating optimal entry points. Pausing could indicate a belief that current prices are not ideal for large-scale accumulation, or simply a period of market observation. Capital Allocation: MicroStrategy might be re-evaluating its capital allocation strategies. While Bitcoin remains central, other operational needs or investment opportunities could momentarily take precedence. Funding Mechanisms: As The Block reported, the firm has been utilizing preferred stock sales to fund future acquisitions. These sales are complex financial instruments, and the timing of their execution, along with the availability of capital, could influence the pace of BTC purchases. A pause might be a logistical outcome of these funding cycles. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, particularly in the U.S., could also play a role in strategic decisions. Companies are increasingly mindful of compliance and potential shifts in policy. It’s important to note that a brief pause does not necessarily signal a change in MicroStrategy’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin. Instead, it could be a testament to a disciplined and measured approach to their investment strategy, ensuring that acquisitions align with broader financial objectives and market conditions. MSTR Bitcoin Strategy: Funding Future Growth and Acquisitions A crucial aspect of MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has been its innovative funding approach. Unlike many corporations that might use free cash flow, MicroStrategy has frequently resorted to issuing convertible notes and, more recently, preferred stock sales to finance its MSTR Bitcoin strategy . This method allows the company to raise significant capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases without diluting its common stock shareholders directly through equity issuance for every buy. The use of preferred stock sales, as highlighted by The Block, is a sophisticated financial maneuver. Preferred stock typically offers a fixed dividend payment and has priority over common stock in claims on assets and earnings. For MicroStrategy, it provides a means to access substantial capital from institutional investors who are comfortable with the company’s unique Bitcoin-centric business model. This strategy allows them to continue accumulating Bitcoin even during periods where operational cash flow might not suffice for their ambitious acquisition targets. This funding mechanism demonstrates MicroStrategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin vision, showcasing a willingness to leverage various financial tools to expand its digital asset treasury. It also highlights the market’s appetite for exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded entity, even if it involves complex financial instruments. The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s pioneering stance has had a ripple effect, influencing the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . By demonstrating a viable and, thus far, highly profitable strategy for integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury, MicroStrategy has provided a blueprint and a case study for other companies contemplating similar moves. While many corporations remain cautious, MSTR’s success has undeniably opened conversations in boardrooms worldwide. Benefits for Corporations Considering Bitcoin: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against fiat currency inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can diversify a corporate treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and appeal to a tech-savvy investor base. Potential for Appreciation: The long-term growth potential of Bitcoin offers significant upside for early adopters. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant concern, posing risks to balance sheets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear regulatory frameworks in many jurisdictions creates legal and compliance challenges. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to potential impairment charges if its value drops. Security Risks: Managing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust cybersecurity measures. Despite these challenges, MicroStrategy’s enduring commitment and the substantial unrealized gains on its holdings serve as a powerful testament to the potential rewards of a bold corporate Bitcoin strategy. MSTR Stock Performance: A Proxy for Bitcoin’s Trajectory Over the years, MicroStrategy’s stock has become intricately linked with the price movements of Bitcoin. For many investors, purchasing MSTR stock performance is akin to gaining indirect exposure to Bitcoin, without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This correlation means that MSTR’s share price often mirrors Bitcoin’s trajectory, amplifying both its highs and lows. When Bitcoin rallies, MSTR stock tends to surge, often outperforming Bitcoin itself due due to the company’s leveraged bet on the asset. Conversely, during Bitcoin downturns, MSTR can experience sharper declines. This dynamic makes MSTR a highly volatile, yet potentially rewarding, investment for those bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The company’s strategy has undeniably transformed its identity from a business intelligence software firm into a leading corporate vehicle for Bitcoin investment. This transformation is reflected in its shareholder base, which increasingly includes investors primarily interested in its crypto exposure rather than its core software business. Conclusion: A Pioneering Path Forward MicroStrategy’s recent pause in Bitcoin purchases, while brief, offers a glimpse into the strategic considerations of a company that has uniquely tied its fortunes to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. With its massive holdings of 597,325 BTC and substantial unrealized gains, MicroStrategy continues to stand as a testament to the potential of a bold, conviction-driven corporate treasury strategy in the digital age. The firm’s reliance on preferred stock sales to fund its acquisitions underscores its innovative approach to capital markets and its unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As the landscape of corporate finance evolves, MicroStrategy’s journey serves as a compelling case study, not just for Bitcoin enthusiasts, but for any company considering how digital assets might fit into their future financial strategies. Whether this pause is a mere blip or a signal of a nuanced shift, MicroStrategy remains a key player to watch in the ongoing narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption.

2025-07-07T16:10:34,"Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Explodes Out of Falling Wedge Pattern – $1 PEPE Next Target?","The Pepe price has risen by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $0.00001007 coming as the crypto market as a whole loses 2% today. PEPE is now up by 2% in a week and by 13% in a fortnight, although it remains down by 12% in a month and up by only 9% in the past year. These are underwhelming percentages, yet Pepe’s fortunes may be about to change, with the coin’s price breaking out of a falling wedge pattern in the past couple of days. Given previous appearances of falling wedges, the coin could be on the brink of a breakout, while the long-term Pepe price prediction continues to look bullish. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Explodes Out of Falling Wedge Pattern – $1 PEPE Next Target? If we look at PEPE’s chart below, we see that the coin enjoyed a big rally the last time it broke through a falling wedge. Meanwhile, it appears to be about halfway through a similar climb, implying that it still has someway left to go before it stops rising. Source: TradingView As we can see above, PEPE’s current breakout should take it somewhere close to the $0.0000110 region, which is where it peaked after its last breakout earlier this month. However, it’s not certain that it will make it this far, if only because its indicators are beginning to sink, indicating a loss of momentum. Its relative strength index (yellow) has declined from 70 yesterday to almost 50 today, and it could drop lower. Looking at the bigger picture, PEPE’s trading volume today is $764 million, which is well below where it was in November and December, as well as in May. It’s also lower than it was at various points before November of last year, indicating that demand isn’t as high as it could be. A newly created wallet withdrew 500.6B $PEPE ($5.2M) from #Binance in the past 30 minutes. https://t.co/ogmsSs1kEK pic.twitter.com/VIzmERhaWQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 17, 2025 However, the past month has seen some whales accumulate PEPE, a sign that it remains a favored meme token among larger traders. It’s ability to rise to new levels – such as $0.00001150 – will depend on the wider market’s trajectory, with the mood still uncertain in the face of the US delaying an upcoming tariff deadline to August 1 . This provides time for the US to sign positive trade deals with various other economies, although it also extends the period of uncertainty that has prevailed ever since February. Assuming that positive developments do emerge, the Pepe price could therefore reach $0.00001150 by the end of August, and $0.000030 by the end of the year. Bitcoin Bull Raises $8.3 Million in Final Hours Before Launch: Biggest Coin of the Week? A pessimist might argue that Pepe is a meme token on the decline, and that if a trader wants to secure some quick market-beating gains, they should probably look elsewhere. This means looking at newer meme coins such as SPX6900, Pudgy Penguins, and more, and it also means looking at presale tokens, which can often rally big when their sales end. One token whose sale is about to end is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now raised just over $8.3 million. $BTCBULL claim goes live 7th July, 2PM UTC. Don’t miss the charge. https://t.co/N1kqrY0bow pic.twitter.com/2mxOI6Qwsw — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 30, 2025 The BTCBULL presale will end in only a few hours, so latecomers should act very quickly if they want to join. Bitcoin Bull has won over thousands of converts, largely by virtue of its deflationary tokenomics, which it has linked to Bitcoin’s price action. With a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, it will conduct token burns whenever Bitcoin (BTC) itself reaches a new price milestone, beginning with $125,000. This will repeat with every additional $25,000, while Bitcoin Bull will also host Bitcoin airdrops whenever BTC adds another $50,000 to its price for the first time. This could make BTCBULL a very profitable token to hold, with holders also able to stake the token for passive income. As noted above, the coin’s sale will end very soon, but you can still join it by going to the Bitcoin Bull website . BTCBULL costs $0.002585, although the success of its sale suggests that this could rise much higher once it lists.

2025-07-07T16:04:49,"CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in $9b deal","CoreWeave, a Nasdaq-listed artificial intelligence and cloud solutions provider, has announced its acquisition of Core Scientific, a top cryptocurrency mining data center, in a deal worth approximately $9 billion. The CoreWeave team revealed in a press release on July 7, 2025 that the companies have signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition, with the deal set for an all-stock transaction. It’s the latest development in CoreWeave’s quest to acquire the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining company, with the first attempt of $1 billion rebuffed in June 2024. If the deal sails through as expected in the fourth quarter, CoreWeave will offer Core Scientific shareholders 0.1235 newly-issued CoreWeave shares for each Core Scientific stock. The acquisition is thus expected to close at a total equity value of $9 billion. You might also like: Strategy hits pause on Bitcoin binge after $14b Q2 windfall Deal to close in Q4 Pending regulatory approval and a green light from Core Scientific stockholders, CoreWeave plans to leverage Core Scientific’s infrastructure to further its AI and high-performance computing solutions. Michael Intrator, chief executive officer and board chair of CoreWeave, said the move will allow the company to scale its workloads more efficiently. “Verticalizing the ownership of Core Scientific’s high-performance data center infrastructure enables CoreWeave to significantly enhance operating efficiency and de-risk our future expansion, solidifying our growth trajectory,” Intrator added. “Owning this foundational layer of our platform will enhance our performance and expertise as we continue helping customers unleash AI’s full potential.” CoreWeave also sees other strategic advantages in the acquisition, including improved operational efficiency, financing flexibility, and a reduced cost of capital. Core Scientific’s infrastructure will further bolster CoreWeave’s operational expertise. Financially, CoreWeave expects the acquisition to reduce its future lease expenses by over $10 billion over the next decade. Additionally, the Core Scientific platform will contribute approximately 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity to CoreWeave’s network. Reports that the AI and cloud company was looking to make a second bid emerged at the of last month. Notably, the companies have worked together, with a $1.2 billion expansion effort in Texas one of their collaborations. “As our longstanding partner, CoreWeave has experienced firsthand the operational excellence we deliver and the value of the services we provide,” said Adam Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of Core Scientific. Core Scientific stockholders will account for less than 10% of the combined company ownership, CoreWeave noted.

The price jump is part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The presale and pre-launch phases have helped the project reach significant fundraising milestones. Husky Inu recently crossed the $800,000 mark and has raised a total of $813,896. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) started the week with its latest price jump, rising from $0.00018578 to $0.00018632. The price jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which officially began on April 1, immediately after the presale ended. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community, allowing it to continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, with the HINU token price rising every two days. This strategy has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross the $800,000 milestone. The dynamic pricing strategy has helped the project raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community. Husky Inu (HINU) Crosses $810,000 Milestone Husky Inu (HINU) adopted a highly dynamic pricing strategy once the pre-launch phase started. This allowed the project to raise funds more effectively. The pricing strategy allows the project to increase the price of the HINU token every two days, enabling it to raise funds while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering the project’s growing community. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. Crypto Market Starts Crucial Week In The Red Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a crucial week with President Trump’s tariff deadline looming and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. President Trump’s tariff deadline is likely the most important catalyst for BTC. The 90-day pause expires on July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with several countries, including China and the UK. However, Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea may revert to the tariffs announced in April. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are also scheduled for release on Wednesday and could act as another decisive catalyst for BTC. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $108,488. Ethereum (ETH) lost momentum after briefly rising to $2,600, and is down nearly 1%, trading around $2,535. However, Ripple (XRP) has rebounded and is up over 3%, trading around $2.34. Solana (SOL) has held above $150 despite selling pressure, and is trading around $151. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 1%, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down nearly 2%, trading around $0.0000116. Chainlink (LINK), Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases.
