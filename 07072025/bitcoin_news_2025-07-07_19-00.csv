2025-07-07T16:55:40,"U.S. Secret Service Launches New Crypto Fraud Crackdown Campaign Amid Nearly $400,000,000 Scam Epidemic: Report","The U.S. Secret Service is reportedly launching a new campaign against crypto scams with a new team that specializes in digital financial crimes. Bloomberg reports that the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) uses software, subpoenas and spreadsheets to identify and go after criminals behind fraudulent crypto scams, including pig butchering operations that offer fake investments to victims. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the GIOC has already seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the last 10 years. The Secret Service itself is already one of the world’s biggest crypto custodians after leading crackdowns on digital currencies such as Liberty Reserve and E-Gold in the 1990s. A team led by lawyer Kali Smith, who directs the Secret Service’s cryptocurrency strategy, is conducting workshops in different countries to train law enforcers and prosecutors to uncover digital crimes. The agency provides the training for free and is particularly interested in jurisdictions where criminals take advantage of weak oversight or residency-for-sale programs. Smith says fraudsters have several misconceptions about cryptocurrencies. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case.” The Secret Service has also partnered with Coinbase and other industry insiders like stablecoin issuer Tether, which provided assistance in recent cases with trace analysis and wallet freezes. Fraud involving cryptocurrencies now accounts for the majority of internet crime losses in the US. Last year, Americans reported $9.3 billion in crypto-related scams or more than half of the reported $16.6 billion.

Следует осознавать, что альтернативные ссылки сохраняют все опции и интерфейс оригинального сайта, включая доступ к личному кабинету и возможность пополнения счета.

Период ответа поддержки саппорта изменяется в зависимости от игорного заведения, но значительная часть стремятся давать ответ на вопросы за 24 часа. Помимо этого стоит заметить существование категории FAQ на веб-ресурсе игорного заведения, где размещены ответы на часто задаваемые вопросы. Данное может сберечь часы и быстро устранить типичные затруднения без контакта с техподдержкой. Некоторые игровые клубы предлагают непрерывную поддержку, что в частности существенно для геймеров из многочисленных временных зон. Степень сервиса возможно изменяться, следовательно желательно выбирать игорный дом с положительными отзывами о службе поддержки.

After taking a brief pause in purchases, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is preparing for another massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy. On Monday, July 7, the Bitcoin investment firm announced a $4.2 billion at-the-market stock offering. The company is selling a 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, trading on Nasdaq under the ticker STRD. The stock pays a 10% dividend, has priority over other stocks in liquidations, and has no fixed maturity rate. You might also like: Strategy introduced a new perpetual called Stride (STRD). Some call it genius, others say it has ‘Ponzi vibes’ Strategy will sell these shares over a period of time, at their market price. This is typically done to avoid a large supply shock that could tank the stock’s price. The proceeds of the sales will go toward buying Bitcoin, paying dividends on other preferred shares, and funding its operations. $4.2B sale comes after Strategy’s Bitcoin hiatus The latest purchase comes after a brief hiatus in the weekly reporting period from June 30 and July 9. This was the first week in which Strategy made no Bitcoin purchases since early April, briefly pausing its aggressive BTC accumulation. The last time that Strategy raised capital was on June 10 this year in an underwritten public offering . At the time, the company raised $979.7 million from direct investments from investment banks. These banks bought shares upfront and then sold them to the public. You might also like: 91% chance MSTR enters S&P 500 — and Bitcoin becomes an index asset by proxy So far, Strategy has amassed $64.4 billion worth of Bitcoin, or 597,325 BTC. This accumulation brought $22 billion in unrealized profits, as this BTC was bought for a total of $42.4 billion. The total amount of Strategy’s BTC tokens now makes up nearly 3% of the total supply, making it by far the largest corporate holder. Still, its leveraged Bitcoin purchases are causing some concerns over sustainability, especially if Bitcoin’s price falls substantially.

2025-07-07T16:34:22,"Rate Cut Hopes & Tariff News Propel Bitcoin Toward ATH","Bitcoin is back in the headlines, and this time not just crypto investors are sitting up and taking notice. Hot news from Washington and speculation from the Federal Reserve have investors and traders holding their breath as the world's biggest cryptocurrency toys with a new all-time high. Last week, the US Treasury shocked everyone with the news: the much-feared new round of tariffs on imported foreign goods would be delayed until August 1. For global markets, that was a welcome relief. For Bitcoin, it was rocket fuel. The delay assuaged worries about an economic jolt to the system, prompting traders to flock to riskier assets—like BTC. Adding to the upbeat mood, several Fed officials also signaled that interest rate cuts were in the offing as soon as this September. Goldman Sachs took it a step further and predicted three cuts by year-end, based on the rationale that both inflation has eased and the labor market is moderating. For Bitcoin, which survives on macro turmoil and the prospect of cheaper funds, this was the kind of news bulls wanted to hear. Bitcoin wasted little time to respond. Over the weekend and through Monday, it spiked above $109,000, a new weekly high, and was close in sight of its all-time record $111,814 set just weeks earlier. Traders are placing wagers openly now that BTC will move above the $110,000 barrier in days. Date BTC Price Catalyst July 6, 2025 $109,200+ Tariff delay, Fed optimism May 22, 2025 $111,814 (ATH) Previous record high What the Markets Are Really Saying The rolling swap market—a favorite playground for professionals—suggests funding rates near zero. This means the market is balanced, with bulls and bears not getting too excited. But 71% of funding periods remain positive, a subtle signal there is a tendency to go long. Option traders aren't panicking, either. The 25 Delta Skew, one of the main measures of sentiment, has cooled down, and implied volatility is at record lows. Translation: the market expects smooth sailing, but experience-karmic traders know that still waters can hide sudden storms. Order-Book Depth Spot and futures volumes are lower, which is to be expected in summer. Underneath, however, lies a thick layer of buy orders just beneath $109K—a safety net that might turn into a springboard in a jiffy if momentum takes off. What Traders and Social Media Are Saying Crypto is not charts and graphs—it's hype, emotion, and narratives that individuals share with each other. This week, Crypto X and trading boards have been in a frenzy: “Tariff delay + dovish Fed = rocket fuel for BTC. $110K in sight!” — @CryptoMacro “Bitcoin’s order book is stacked with bids just below $109K. If we break $110K, look for fireworks.” — @OrderFlowBTC “Markets shrugged off tariff fears. All eyes on Fed and CPI next week. BTC ATH soon?” — @MacroTrader Key Info to Watch Any reversal or intensification of US trade policy can flip sentiment in a flash. The next Federal Reserve meeting and inflation data will be key. If the Fed implements a dovish shift, another bout of buying will be in the cards. Watch funding rates and options skew for signs of early warning for exhaustion or fresh momentum. A recent spike in spot or futures volume can indicate a breakout—or reversal—is imminent. The Takeaway Bitcoin's recent rally is a textbook example of how human psychology and international news can interact to move markets. With a tariff break and the promise of decreasing interest rates, traders are going all in on a new high. But as always in crypto, the only thing that's certain is volatility—and the next act could be just as exciting as the previous one.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9832/rate-cut-hopes-and-tariff-news-propel-bitcoin-toward-ath,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Lets users mirror trades of top investors like Buffett, Pelosi, and Ackman with just $50 and no subscription fees. pic.twitter.com/FCVVi4WKeM — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) July 7, 2025 App users will be able to directly follow prominent investors and whales, including Warren Buffett, Nancy Pelosi, Dan Meuser, Bill Ackman, and others. Crypto.com offers copy-trading for funds and politicians The crypto, trading, and fintech app picked a total of 11 prominent investors in the stock space, selected for their experience or social media influence. The copy-trading feature is also available for the portfolios of Jensen Huang, Bill Gates, Brad Gerstner, David Tepper, Dan Meuser, Paul Singer, Dan Crenshaw, and Josh Gottheimer. The investment baskets are based on each investor whale’s publicly disclosed portfolio. Crypto.com bases its stock selection on 13F filings when copying funds, required of all investors with over $100M in assets. The stock picks of politicians are based on Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK), which requires members of Congress and other officials to report personal securities trades above $1,000 within 45 days. The basket allocations may lag behind the exact actions, and Crypto.com will report as early as possible. Each investor’s approach differs, targeting varied types of stocks and different trades. Traders in the app will be protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Crypto.com will allow onboarding through both fiat and cryptocurrencies. The trading will involve actual stock ownership and not tokenized shares. Crypto.com targets US persons The whale baskets will be available to US persons, and the shares will be provided by FINRA-registered Foris Capital US LLC. Complex trading strategies such as options and short trading will not be part of the direct copying. The app may lag in reporting all portfolio stocks and not reflect complex strategies, private deals, or other decisions. The portfolios will lag for up to 45 days, based on official reporting requirements, at which time there may be material changes to the whale baskets. The new feature will target retail investors, who can allocate as little as $50. The purchase can be funded both from the fiat or crypto reserves on the Crypto.com app. Crypto.com does not charge any commission on stock basket purchases or a subscription fee. The basket orders will be placed as Market orders denominated in US dollars. For payments in crypto, traders will have their assets sold for dollars, and then the proceeds will be used to make a stock order. The market for baskets will queue up orders outside market open hours based on the US stock market schedule. Traders can also choose to sell percentages or dollar amounts from each basket, though they must wait for the completion of the previous order before opening up a new trade. Users will also be notified of changes in the whale portfolios, and can choose to retain their previous allocation or buy the changed portfolio using the app’s tool to edit the holdings.

Accordingly, Mercado Bitcoin, as the largest crypto platform in Latin America, has chosen XRP Ledger among many alternatives in its digitalization journey. Mercado Bitcoin has announced plans to tokenize an additional $200 million worth of stocks and bonds on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). “This project is one of the largest RWA initiatives on XRP Ledger by a Latin American company. We estimate the RWA market will grow to $19 trillion by 2033.” It was stated that the high transaction speed, low cost structure, and built-in tokenization capabilities offered by XRPL make it an ideal option for companies and such projects.

2025-07-07T16:20:33,"Bitcoin Acquisition: Strategy’s Bold $4.2B Move","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: Strategy’s Bold $4.2B Move In a move that has sent ripples across both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world, Strategy has unveiled an ambitious plan to bolster its digital asset holdings. The company announced an at-the-market (ATM) program designed to raise a staggering $4.2 billion. This significant capital infusion isn’t just for general operations; a substantial portion is earmarked for a crucial purpose: a continued Bitcoin acquisition spree. This bold declaration underscores Strategy’s unwavering commitment to its digital asset-centric vision, setting a new precedent for corporate treasury management in the age of digital currency. What Exactly is Strategy’s $4.2 Billion ATM Program All About? At its core, an at-the-market (ATM) program is a flexible method for a company to issue new shares of its stock directly into the open market over a period of time, typically at prevailing market prices. Unlike a traditional fixed-price offering, an ATM program allows a company to raise capital incrementally, capitalizing on favorable market conditions and minimizing market disruption. Strategy’s specific announcement details an ATM program to sell up to $4.2 billion of its 10% Series A Perpetual STRD Preferred Stock. This isn’t common stock, but a different class of equity with specific characteristics: Preferred Stock: This type of stock typically pays a fixed dividend and has priority over common stock for dividend payments and asset distribution in case of liquidation. Perpetual: This means the stock has no maturity date, essentially remaining outstanding indefinitely. 10% Series A STRD: This indicates a specific series of preferred stock with a 10% dividend rate, making it an attractive income-generating asset for investors. The proceeds from this massive offering are designated for a range of general corporate purposes, including working capital, dividend payments, and most notably, further Bitcoin acquisition . This strategic allocation highlights the company’s dual focus: maintaining operational stability while aggressively pursuing its digital asset investment thesis. Why is This a Cornerstone of Strategy’s Corporate Strategy for Bitcoin? Strategy has long been a vocal proponent and a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Its CEO has consistently articulated a vision where Bitcoin serves as a superior treasury reserve asset, offering a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. This latest $4.2 billion ATM program is not an isolated event but a continuation and amplification of this established corporate strategy . Several factors underpin this aggressive stance: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion, many corporations are seeking alternatives to traditional cash holdings, which can depreciate in value. Bitcoin, with its finite supply, is viewed by Strategy as a robust inflation hedge. Long-Term Value Appreciation: The company believes in Bitcoin’s potential for significant long-term capital appreciation, positioning it as a growth asset on its balance sheet. First-Mover Advantage: By being an early and significant institutional holder of Bitcoin, Strategy aims to capitalize on potential future mainstream adoption and market maturation. Shareholder Value: The company argues that holding Bitcoin ultimately enhances shareholder value by optimizing its balance sheet and providing exposure to a rapidly evolving asset class. This program signals a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s future, moving beyond initial exploratory purchases to a systematic, large-scale funding mechanism for digital asset accumulation. It’s a clear statement that Bitcoin isn’t just an experiment for Strategy; it’s a fundamental pillar of its financial future. How Will This Initiative Impact Bitcoin Funding and the Broader Crypto Landscape? The sheer scale of Strategy’s $4.2 billion ATM program has significant implications for both its own Bitcoin funding capabilities and the wider cryptocurrency market. When a major public company announces such a large-scale intention to buy Bitcoin, it can: Impact Area Description Market Demand & Price A consistent buyer like Strategy, with billions to deploy, adds significant buying pressure to the Bitcoin market. This sustained demand could provide price support or even contribute to upward price movements over time. Institutional Validation Strategy’s continued commitment, especially with such a large funding mechanism, serves as a powerful validation for other corporations considering Bitcoin for their treasuries. It normalizes the idea of Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset. Liquidity Dynamics While $4.2 billion is a large sum, the ATM program’s gradual nature means the Bitcoin purchases will likely be spread out, minimizing sudden shocks to market liquidity. However, it signifies a sustained drain on available supply. Investor Sentiment The news can boost investor confidence in Bitcoin, especially among those who look to institutional adoption as a key growth driver. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin’s growing maturity. This initiative solidifies Strategy’s position as a bellwether for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Its actions are closely watched by other companies and investors alike, making this ATM program a critical development for the entire digital asset ecosystem. What Role Does Preferred Stock Play in Fueling Strategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Ambitions? The choice to issue preferred stock rather than common stock or debt for this significant capital raise is a deliberate financial decision that aligns with Strategy’s long-term objectives for Bitcoin acquisition . Here’s why preferred stock is a strategic choice for this purpose: Less Dilution of Common Shareholders: Unlike common stock, preferred stock typically does not carry voting rights. This means that Strategy can raise substantial capital without diluting the control or voting power of its existing common shareholders, which is often a priority for management. Stable Capital Source: The perpetual nature of the preferred stock provides a long-term, stable source of capital for Strategy. This stability is crucial for funding a long-term asset accumulation strategy like Bitcoin, which can be volatile in the short term. Fixed Dividend Obligation: While preferred stock comes with a fixed dividend payment (in this case, 10%), this predictable cost can be easier to manage than fluctuating interest payments on certain types of debt, or the pressure to generate immediate returns that might come with equity. Attractive to Income Investors: The 10% dividend rate makes this preferred stock attractive to investors seeking regular income, broadening the pool of potential investors beyond those solely focused on growth stocks. This can facilitate easier and more efficient capital raising. Balance Sheet Flexibility: Raising capital through preferred stock allows Strategy to maintain flexibility in its debt covenants and avoid taking on additional debt, which could impact its credit rating or future borrowing capacity. This approach allows Strategy to fuel its Bitcoin strategy while managing its capital structure prudently, balancing the desire for digital asset exposure with traditional financial considerations. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While Strategy’s bold move presents significant opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges that the company will need to navigate carefully: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. While Strategy is a long-term holder, significant downward movements could impact the perceived value of its holdings and potentially lead to mark-to-market losses on its balance sheet, affecting investor sentiment. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the holding, accounting, or tax treatment of Bitcoin, posing potential risks for corporate treasuries. Execution Risk of ATM Program: While flexible, an ATM program’s success depends on market demand for the preferred stock. If demand wanes, Strategy might not be able to raise the full $4.2 billion as quickly or efficiently as desired. Public Perception and Shareholder Scrutiny: Not all investors agree with a Bitcoin-heavy corporate strategy. Strategy will continue to face scrutiny and potential criticism from shareholders who prefer a more traditional treasury approach. Despite these challenges, the opportunity for Strategy to position itself at the forefront of digital asset adoption and potentially unlock significant long-term value remains a powerful driver behind this strategic financial maneuver. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? For investors, Strategy’s $4.2 billion ATM program and its explicit focus on Bitcoin acquisition offer several key insights: For Strategy Stockholders: Understand that you are investing in a company with a strong conviction in Bitcoin. Your investment is now more directly tied to the performance of Bitcoin. The issuance of preferred stock, while less dilutive to common shares than a common stock offering, introduces a fixed dividend obligation for the company. For Bitcoin Investors: This news reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. Strategy’s consistent buying provides a fundamental demand floor, potentially mitigating extreme downside volatility in the long run. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as a treasury asset. Broader Market Implications: Watch for other companies to potentially follow Strategy’s lead. As the regulatory environment clarifies and the benefits become more apparent, more corporations might consider similar Bitcoin funding strategies for their balance sheets. Due Diligence is Key: Whether you’re considering Strategy’s stock or Bitcoin itself, thorough research into the company’s financials, its Bitcoin strategy, and the broader crypto market trends is crucial. This move highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space, creating new avenues for investment and corporate strategy. Strategy’s decision to launch a $4.2 billion ATM program specifically to fund its ongoing Bitcoin acquisition strategy is nothing short of groundbreaking. It’s a powerful affirmation of the company’s conviction in Bitcoin as a foundational asset for its future. By leveraging preferred stock , Strategy is executing a sophisticated corporate strategy that aims to secure significant capital for digital asset accumulation while managing its financial structure prudently. This initiative is set to significantly impact its own Bitcoin funding capabilities and serves as a major indicator of increasing institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency market. As the financial world continues to evolve, Strategy remains a key player to watch, pioneering new approaches to corporate treasury management in the digital age. This bold move underscores the transformative potential of digital assets and their growing role in the global economy.

2025-07-07T16:10:55,"MicroStrategy’s Unprecedented Bitcoin Holdings: A Bold Strategic Pause","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy’s Unprecedented Bitcoin Holdings: A Bold Strategic Pause In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, few entities have captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts quite like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). The software intelligence firm has become synonymous with Bitcoin, pioneering a corporate treasury strategy that has seen it accumulate a staggering amount of the digital asset. Recently, however, a notable development has emerged: a temporary halt in its relentless Bitcoin acquisition drive. This strategic pause, disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has sparked conversations across the market. What does it signify for the future of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings and the broader corporate adoption landscape? Understanding MicroStrategy’s Astounding Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy’s journey into Bitcoin began in August 2020, spearheaded by its then-CEO, Michael Saylor, who famously declared Bitcoin to be a superior store of value. Since then, the company has consistently added BTC to its balance sheet, turning itself into the largest publicly traded corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. The latest SEC filing reveals that between June 30 and July 6, MicroStrategy paused its Bitcoin purchases, marking the first such break since April. As of its last disclosure, MicroStrategy’s portfolio boasts an incredible 597,325 BTC . Valued at an astonishing $65 billion , these holdings represent a significant portion of the company’s overall market capitalization and a powerful bet on the future of digital assets. The average purchase price for this colossal stash stands at approximately $70,982 per BTC . This strategic accumulation has positioned MicroStrategy to realize substantial unrealized gains, currently estimated at a remarkable $22.6 billion , underscoring the success of its audacious strategy. This immense accumulation has transformed MicroStrategy into a de facto Bitcoin ETF for many investors, offering exposure to the leading cryptocurrency through traditional equity markets. The sheer scale of their holdings makes any move by the company, including a pause in acquisitions, a subject of intense scrutiny and analysis within the crypto community. Bitcoin Purchases Pause: A Strategic Reassessment or Opportunity? The recent Bitcoin purchases pause by MicroStrategy is a notable event, given their consistent buying pattern over the past few years. While the duration of this specific pause was short (June 30 to July 6), it invites speculation about the company’s current strategic outlook. Is this a momentary lull, a tactical adjustment, or does it hint at a broader reassessment of their acquisition pace? Several factors could contribute to such a decision: Market Valuation: With Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, the company might be evaluating optimal entry points. Pausing could indicate a belief that current prices are not ideal for large-scale accumulation, or simply a period of market observation. Capital Allocation: MicroStrategy might be re-evaluating its capital allocation strategies. While Bitcoin remains central, other operational needs or investment opportunities could momentarily take precedence. Funding Mechanisms: As The Block reported, the firm has been utilizing preferred stock sales to fund future acquisitions. These sales are complex financial instruments, and the timing of their execution, along with the availability of capital, could influence the pace of BTC purchases. A pause might be a logistical outcome of these funding cycles. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, particularly in the U.S., could also play a role in strategic decisions. Companies are increasingly mindful of compliance and potential shifts in policy. It’s important to note that a brief pause does not necessarily signal a change in MicroStrategy’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin. Instead, it could be a testament to a disciplined and measured approach to their investment strategy, ensuring that acquisitions align with broader financial objectives and market conditions. MSTR Bitcoin Strategy: Funding Future Growth and Acquisitions A crucial aspect of MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has been its innovative funding approach. Unlike many corporations that might use free cash flow, MicroStrategy has frequently resorted to issuing convertible notes and, more recently, preferred stock sales to finance its MSTR Bitcoin strategy . This method allows the company to raise significant capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases without diluting its common stock shareholders directly through equity issuance for every buy. The use of preferred stock sales, as highlighted by The Block, is a sophisticated financial maneuver. Preferred stock typically offers a fixed dividend payment and has priority over common stock in claims on assets and earnings. For MicroStrategy, it provides a means to access substantial capital from institutional investors who are comfortable with the company’s unique Bitcoin-centric business model. This strategy allows them to continue accumulating Bitcoin even during periods where operational cash flow might not suffice for their ambitious acquisition targets. This funding mechanism demonstrates MicroStrategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin vision, showcasing a willingness to leverage various financial tools to expand its digital asset treasury. It also highlights the market’s appetite for exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded entity, even if it involves complex financial instruments. The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s pioneering stance has had a ripple effect, influencing the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . By demonstrating a viable and, thus far, highly profitable strategy for integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury, MicroStrategy has provided a blueprint and a case study for other companies contemplating similar moves. While many corporations remain cautious, MSTR’s success has undeniably opened conversations in boardrooms worldwide. Benefits for Corporations Considering Bitcoin: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against fiat currency inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can diversify a corporate treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and appeal to a tech-savvy investor base. Potential for Appreciation: The long-term growth potential of Bitcoin offers significant upside for early adopters. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant concern, posing risks to balance sheets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear regulatory frameworks in many jurisdictions creates legal and compliance challenges. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to potential impairment charges if its value drops. Security Risks: Managing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust cybersecurity measures. Despite these challenges, MicroStrategy’s enduring commitment and the substantial unrealized gains on its holdings serve as a powerful testament to the potential rewards of a bold corporate Bitcoin strategy. MSTR Stock Performance: A Proxy for Bitcoin’s Trajectory Over the years, MicroStrategy’s stock has become intricately linked with the price movements of Bitcoin. For many investors, purchasing MSTR stock performance is akin to gaining indirect exposure to Bitcoin, without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This correlation means that MSTR’s share price often mirrors Bitcoin’s trajectory, amplifying both its highs and lows. When Bitcoin rallies, MSTR stock tends to surge, often outperforming Bitcoin itself due due to the company’s leveraged bet on the asset. Conversely, during Bitcoin downturns, MSTR can experience sharper declines. This dynamic makes MSTR a highly volatile, yet potentially rewarding, investment for those bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The company’s strategy has undeniably transformed its identity from a business intelligence software firm into a leading corporate vehicle for Bitcoin investment. This transformation is reflected in its shareholder base, which increasingly includes investors primarily interested in its crypto exposure rather than its core software business. Conclusion: A Pioneering Path Forward MicroStrategy’s recent pause in Bitcoin purchases, while brief, offers a glimpse into the strategic considerations of a company that has uniquely tied its fortunes to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. With its massive holdings of 597,325 BTC and substantial unrealized gains, MicroStrategy continues to stand as a testament to the potential of a bold, conviction-driven corporate treasury strategy in the digital age. The firm’s reliance on preferred stock sales to fund its acquisitions underscores its innovative approach to capital markets and its unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As the landscape of corporate finance evolves, MicroStrategy’s journey serves as a compelling case study, not just for Bitcoin enthusiasts, but for any company considering how digital assets might fit into their future financial strategies. Whether this pause is a mere blip or a signal of a nuanced shift, MicroStrategy remains a key player to watch in the ongoing narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption.

2025-07-07T16:10:34,"Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Explodes Out of Falling Wedge Pattern – $1 PEPE Next Target?","The Pepe price has risen by 3.5% in the past 24 hours, with its move to $0.00001007 coming as the crypto market as a whole loses 2% today. PEPE is now up by 2% in a week and by 13% in a fortnight, although it remains down by 12% in a month and up by only 9% in the past year. These are underwhelming percentages, yet Pepe’s fortunes may be about to change, with the coin’s price breaking out of a falling wedge pattern in the past couple of days. Given previous appearances of falling wedges, the coin could be on the brink of a breakout, while the long-term Pepe price prediction continues to look bullish. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Explodes Out of Falling Wedge Pattern – $1 PEPE Next Target? If we look at PEPE’s chart below, we see that the coin enjoyed a big rally the last time it broke through a falling wedge. Meanwhile, it appears to be about halfway through a similar climb, implying that it still has someway left to go before it stops rising. Source: TradingView As we can see above, PEPE’s current breakout should take it somewhere close to the $0.0000110 region, which is where it peaked after its last breakout earlier this month. However, it’s not certain that it will make it this far, if only because its indicators are beginning to sink, indicating a loss of momentum. Its relative strength index (yellow) has declined from 70 yesterday to almost 50 today, and it could drop lower. Looking at the bigger picture, PEPE’s trading volume today is $764 million, which is well below where it was in November and December, as well as in May. It’s also lower than it was at various points before November of last year, indicating that demand isn’t as high as it could be. A newly created wallet withdrew 500.6B $PEPE ($5.2M) from #Binance in the past 30 minutes. https://t.co/ogmsSs1kEK pic.twitter.com/VIzmERhaWQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 17, 2025 However, the past month has seen some whales accumulate PEPE, a sign that it remains a favored meme token among larger traders. It’s ability to rise to new levels – such as $0.00001150 – will depend on the wider market’s trajectory, with the mood still uncertain in the face of the US delaying an upcoming tariff deadline to August 1 . This provides time for the US to sign positive trade deals with various other economies, although it also extends the period of uncertainty that has prevailed ever since February. Assuming that positive developments do emerge, the Pepe price could therefore reach $0.00001150 by the end of August, and $0.000030 by the end of the year. Bitcoin Bull Raises $8.3 Million in Final Hours Before Launch: Biggest Coin of the Week? A pessimist might argue that Pepe is a meme token on the decline, and that if a trader wants to secure some quick market-beating gains, they should probably look elsewhere. This means looking at newer meme coins such as SPX6900, Pudgy Penguins, and more, and it also means looking at presale tokens, which can often rally big when their sales end. One token whose sale is about to end is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now raised just over $8.3 million. $BTCBULL claim goes live 7th July, 2PM UTC. Don’t miss the charge. https://t.co/N1kqrY0bow pic.twitter.com/2mxOI6Qwsw — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 30, 2025 The BTCBULL presale will end in only a few hours, so latecomers should act very quickly if they want to join. Bitcoin Bull has won over thousands of converts, largely by virtue of its deflationary tokenomics, which it has linked to Bitcoin’s price action. With a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, it will conduct token burns whenever Bitcoin (BTC) itself reaches a new price milestone, beginning with $125,000. This will repeat with every additional $25,000, while Bitcoin Bull will also host Bitcoin airdrops whenever BTC adds another $50,000 to its price for the first time. This could make BTCBULL a very profitable token to hold, with holders also able to stake the token for passive income. As noted above, the coin’s sale will end very soon, but you can still join it by going to the Bitcoin Bull website . BTCBULL costs $0.002585, although the success of its sale suggests that this could rise much higher once it lists.

The CoreWeave team revealed in a press release on July 7, 2025 that the companies have signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition, with the deal set for an all-stock transaction. It’s the latest development in CoreWeave’s quest to acquire the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining company, with the first attempt of $1 billion rebuffed in June 2024. If the deal sails through as expected in the fourth quarter, CoreWeave will offer Core Scientific shareholders 0.1235 newly-issued CoreWeave shares for each Core Scientific stock. The acquisition is thus expected to close at a total equity value of $9 billion.

Michael Intrator, chief executive officer and board chair of CoreWeave, said the move will allow the company to scale its workloads more efficiently. “Verticalizing the ownership of Core Scientific’s high-performance data center infrastructure enables CoreWeave to significantly enhance operating efficiency and de-risk our future expansion, solidifying our growth trajectory,” Intrator added. “Owning this foundational layer of our platform will enhance our performance and expertise as we continue helping customers unleash AI’s full potential.” CoreWeave also sees other strategic advantages in the acquisition, including improved operational efficiency, financing flexibility, and a reduced cost of capital. Core Scientific’s infrastructure will further bolster CoreWeave’s operational expertise. Financially, CoreWeave expects the acquisition to reduce its future lease expenses by over $10 billion over the next decade. Additionally, the Core Scientific platform will contribute approximately 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity to CoreWeave’s network. Reports that the AI and cloud company was looking to make a second bid emerged at the of last month. Notably, the companies have worked together, with a $1.2 billion expansion effort in Texas one of their collaborations. “As our longstanding partner, CoreWeave has experienced firsthand the operational excellence we deliver and the value of the services we provide,” said Adam Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of Core Scientific. Core Scientific stockholders will account for less than 10% of the combined company ownership, CoreWeave noted.

2025-07-07T16:00:18,"Bitcoin Treasury: Murano Global’s Bold Move Signals Future Corporate Strategy","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: Murano Global’s Bold Move Signals Future Corporate Strategy In a fascinating development that underscores the accelerating shift towards digital assets, real estate developer Murano Global Investments (NASDAQ: MRNO) has announced a groundbreaking decision: the integration of a Bitcoin treasury strategy into its core corporate operations. This move isn’t just a fleeting headline; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of corporate finance and the increasing embrace of Bitcoin as a legitimate, strategic asset. For anyone tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, Murano’s initial purchase of 21 BTC, with plans to expand its holdings through operating cash flows and capital markets, signifies a profound endorsement of Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Murano Global’s Strategic Embrace of Institutional Bitcoin Murano Global Investments, a prominent player in the real estate sector, is not merely dabbling in cryptocurrency; it’s embedding it into its financial framework. This strategic decision positions Murano as one of the pioneering companies in its industry to formally adopt institutional Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The company’s rationale, as reported by Cointelegraph, centers on leveraging its robust financial health to diversify and potentially enhance its balance sheet. What does this mean in practical terms? Initial Acquisition: Murano has already acquired 21 BTC, signaling a concrete commitment. Funding Mechanism: Future acquisitions will be funded through a combination of operating cash flows, demonstrating confidence in their ongoing business performance, and capital markets, indicating a willingness to tap into broader financial resources. Long-Term Vision: This isn’t a speculative trade; it’s a long-term treasury strategy, suggesting a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring role as a store of value. This move by Murano Global is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin beyond individual investors and into the realm of corporate treasuries. It highlights a proactive approach to managing corporate assets in an increasingly digital and inflationary global economy. Why Companies Are Adopting a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy The trend of companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets isn’t new, but it is gaining significant momentum. Murano Global’s decision falls within a broader pattern where businesses are exploring alternative asset classes to protect and grow their capital. A robust corporate Bitcoin strategy offers several compelling advantages: Inflation Hedge and Store of Value In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin is decentralized and not subject to the monetary policies of any single government, offering a unique form of financial sovereignty. Diversification of Treasury Assets Relying solely on cash or traditional bonds can expose companies to specific risks. Bitcoin provides an uncorrelated asset that can help diversify a corporate treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk while offering exposure to a high-growth technological innovation. Potential for Appreciation Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term appreciation. Companies like Murano might view a portion of their treasury in BTC as a strategic investment with substantial upside potential, especially as global adoption continues to accelerate. Technological Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and its willingness to adapt to emerging financial technologies. For a real estate developer like Murano, this could also be a way to appeal to a new generation of tech-savvy investors and clients. Accessibility and Liquidity The Bitcoin market is global, operates 24/7, and boasts immense liquidity, making it relatively easy for large institutions to enter and exit positions when necessary. This accessibility is a key factor for corporate treasury management. Precedents and the Broader Crypto Adoption Landscape Murano Global is joining a growing list of public and private companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which pioneered the crypto adoption movement for corporate treasuries, holding tens of thousands of BTC. Other notable examples include: Tesla: Briefly held significant Bitcoin, later selling a portion. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s company has invested in Bitcoin and continues to integrate it into its services. Marathon Digital Holdings: A Bitcoin mining company that holds a substantial amount of BTC on its balance sheet. These examples illustrate that the concept of a Bitcoin treasury is not an isolated phenomenon but a burgeoning trend among forward-thinking corporations. The real estate sector, traditionally conservative, seeing a player like Murano make such a move, speaks volumes about Bitcoin’s maturing perception as a legitimate financial asset.

While the benefits are clear, adopting a corporate Bitcoin strategy is not without its challenges. Companies like Murano must carefully navigate several critical considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of treasury holdings. This requires a strong conviction and long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legal and operational aspects of holding digital assets. Security Risks: Storing Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and robust cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks and theft. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex, and tax implications vary by jurisdiction, requiring expert financial and legal advice. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, some stakeholders might still view Bitcoin as a risky or speculative asset, potentially impacting investor relations. Murano Global’s decision suggests they have weighed these risks against the potential rewards and have a robust framework in place to manage them. Their phased approach to expanding holdings indicates a cautious yet confident strategy. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Crypto Adoption For other companies contemplating a similar move, Murano’s strategy offers valuable lessons. Here are some actionable insights: Start Small and Scale: Like Murano’s initial 21 BTC purchase, a phased approach allows for learning and adaptation without undue risk. Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the technology, market dynamics, regulatory environment, and security best practices. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define the purpose of holding Bitcoin (e.g., inflation hedge, growth asset), allocation limits, and risk management protocols. Engage Experts: Consult with legal, accounting, and cybersecurity professionals experienced in digital assets. Educate Stakeholders: Ensure boards, investors, and employees understand the rationale and risks involved. Prioritize Security: Implement institutional-grade custody solutions and internal security protocols. The journey into digital asset treasuries requires foresight and meticulous planning, but the potential long-term benefits for businesses can be substantial. The Future is Digital: Murano’s Bold Step Paves the Way Murano Global Investments’ embrace of a Bitcoin treasury strategy is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a significant indicator of Bitcoin’s growing maturity and its increasing role in mainstream corporate finance. As a real estate developer, Murano operates in an industry that relies heavily on stable long-term assets and capital preservation. Their decision to allocate capital to Bitcoin underscores a belief in its potential to serve these very purposes in the digital age. This move is likely to inspire other companies, not just in real estate but across various sectors, to re-evaluate their traditional treasury management practices. The narrative is shifting from ‘if’ companies will adopt digital assets to ‘when’ and ‘how.’ Murano Global is not just building properties; they are helping to build the foundation for a new era of corporate financial strategy, where digital assets like Bitcoin play a crucial, integral role.

On the candle side, higher lows are visible at $2,506, $2,512, $2,540, and $2,560, which shows buyers are stepping in a little earlier on each dip. Examining simple indicators, Bankr noted that the 20-hour moving average is approximately $2,565, with the price sitting just above it — a mildly positive sign. The 50-hour moving average is around $2,538 and still shows a sloping upward trend bias, while candles stay above $2,540. For momentum, a quick RSI-style check shows ETH touched overbought during the $2,598 spike, then cooled to neutral (50–55), which leaves room for another leg higher. As for key levels, Bankr outlined support at $2,550 (recent pivot), $2,510 (volume shelf), and $2,480 (weekly floor). On the resistance side, levels to watch include $2,590–$2,600 (last high) and $2,625 (March swing high). News Impact And Game Plan While Ethereum surges, a stronger-than-expected US jobs report typically acts as a headwind, since it implies the Fed will likely stay on hold. However, Bankr noted that crypto appears to be shrugging it off, thanks to a solid risk appetite that’s keeping momentum intact despite the macro pressure. Related Reading: Ethereum Indecision Masks A Bullish Setup – Here’s Why BTC Holds The Key On the political front, Bankr highlighted that next week’s US “Crypto Week” in Congress, combined with the administration’s pro-crypto stance, is lifting sentiment. Traders are now positioning ahead of potential developments, including clearer regulatory direction and ETH-related ETF chatter, both of which are helping boost confidence. In terms of sector dynamics, Bankr pointed to ongoing institutional accumulation from players like Metaplanet. Additionally, Bankr mentioned the recent USDC burn, which reflects responsible supply management and supports a more constructive backdrop for Ethereum. Outlining a flexible approach, Bankr points to the accumulation of dips, placing laddered limit buys at $2,555, $2,535, and $2,505 in case of a sharp shakeout. For a breakout trade, if ETH closes an hourly candle above $2,600, look to enter or add with a short-term target at $2,625–$2,650, and place a stop just under $2,580. As a protective exit, if ETH drifts below $2,510 on rising volume, momentum likely shifts, cutting exposure or using a stop around $2,495 can help limit drawdowns. For profit-taking, Bankr suggests trimming partial positions at $2,590 and again near $2,625, while leaving a runner in case a summer rally extends toward $2,700.

2025-07-07T15:57:11,"BNB Holds Near $660 as Traders Weigh Breakout Potential","BNB Chain’s native token (BNB) held steady near $660, shifting in a narrow band of less than 1% over the past 24 hours. The lack of volatility underscores a pattern of consolidation. BNB is trading at $659.61, down just 0.5% for the day, with buyers stepping in repeatedly around $659.45. Sellers, meanwhile, blocked advances beyond $664.38, a price ceiling that traders are eyeing as a potential launchpad for a breakout if macroeconomic pressures ease, according to according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On-chain data points to mixed sentiment among traders. Funding rates, the fees paid between traders in perpetual futures markets, have slipped lower, a signal that traders are hedging rather than chasing after bitcoin’s recent rally above $109,000. Corporate adoption is nevertheless growing, with Nasdaq-listed chip market Nano Labs recently acquiring about $50 million worth of BNB as part of its plan to own as much as 10% of the cryptocurrency’s global supply.

2025-07-07T15:53:54,"Kevin O’Leary: U.S. Must Learn From Bitcoin Miners to Win ‘AI Wars’","In the race for AI supremacy, North America is now learning important lessons from the bitcoin (BTC) mining industry about building large-scale infrastructure close to sustainable energy sources, according to serial entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary. “It all comes down to power,” said “Sharktank” star O’Leary in an interview. “Whether you’re talking about an AI data center or you’re talking about bitcoin mining. And now we are seeing that very often these projects are a bit of both.” A serendipitous overlap between bitcoin mining operations and AI data center requirements has become an area of focus for Washington, D.C. policymakers, and it’s driving institutional investors to swoop on the best situations, O’Leary said. For instance, New York state, which initially lacked the right policy to move forward despite its abundance of hydro power off the grid in Niagara Falls, is now “trying to get its mojo back” when it comes to bitcoin mining and AI, according to O’Leary. “I think some states, like New York and others, have figured out these are high-paying jobs at the cutting edge of two new regulated industries, AI and bitcoin mining and crypto. And they feel that somehow they've missed out,” he said. These days, more desirable options are in places like West Virginia, North Dakota, Mississippi, and Texas, said O’Leary, who is a backer of Bitzero , a green energy bitcoin mining and data center company with operations in North America, Norway and Finland. “Alberta, Canada is a good example because they have an abundance of low-cost, stranded natural gas,” he said. Profit squeeze The bitcoin miners were forced to diversify their business into AI and cloud computing as the recent halving has cut the mining rewards by half, squeezing their profit margin in an already super competitive market. Companies such as Core Scientific (CORZ) have brought the intersection of mining and AI into the mainstream, and other miners such as Hive Digital (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) have pivoted large amounts of their data centers into AI to diversify their revenue. The marriage of bitcoin mining and hosting AI computing in data centers became an easy way to accomplish this diversification, as the miners are already tapping into the massive amount of electricity needed to support the rapidly increasing data center demands of AI. (A single ChatGPT query requires 2.9 watt-hours of electricity, compared with 0.3 watt-hours for a Google search, according to the International Energy Agency .) Mega-wattage bitcoin mining operations are typically situated close to abundant energy supplies with industrial-scale power generation connectivity infrastructure already built and running. This makes retrofitting bitcoin mines with AI-powering graphics processing units ( GPU s) a potentially attractive proposition — though AI data centers require much more infrastructure . 'Foolish' tariff war O’Leary says he’s optimistic when he speaks to policymakers about powering the AI boom, namechecking U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. O’Leary, who is Canadian, says Smith caught the attention of the bitcoin mining and AI data center industry when she revealed the province has 200 trillion cubic feet of gas at its fingertips. This is why a tariff war between the U.S. and Canada is “foolish,” O’Leary said, pointing out that China is preparing for the “AI wars” by setting up new coal-burning electrical plants on a weekly basis. “We’re not just talking about bitcoin mining, this is about the competitiveness of nations,” O’Leary said. “We’ve got to bring all this back home, but our biggest problem is power. There's no more power on the domestic grid. Nada. And so, if you want a gigawatt in any state, forget about it. You have to figure out a way to build that power yourself from natural gas or nuclear power or something else.” Read more: AI Is Here, but That Doesn't Mean Bitcoin Miners Are Finished",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/07/kevin-o-leary-u-s-must-learn-from-bitcoin-miners-to-win-ai-wars,"BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|ASIA|MARKET","Policy|AI|Kevin O'Leary|Bitcoin Mining|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T15:42:49,"No Monday Buy, but Strategy Reports $14B Bitcoin Gain","On a day when several major corporate buyers added to their Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries, Strategy stood pat on its signature Monday announcement. However, the business intelligence giant made up for the pause with some staggering financial news: it raked in more than $14 billion in unrealized gains in the second quarter of 2025. The $14 Billion Quarter According to Strategy’s latest Form 8-K , filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 7, the carrying value of the company’s Bitcoin stash had ballooned to $64.36 billion as of June 30, 2025. Importantly, the quarter ended with the number one cryptocurrency trading around $107,751 on Strategy’s principal market, the Coinbase exchange, resulting in a $14.05 billion fair value increase. However, this paper gain also triggered a $4.04 billion deferred tax expense. The Michael Saylor-helmed firm detailed the sheer scale of its Bitcoin acquisition during Q2 2025 in the filing, picking up 69,140 BTC for approximately $6.77 billion, at an average price of $97,906 per Bitcoin. The company funded this aggressive buying through complex capital markets activity, including net proceeds of $6.8 billion raised via “at-the-market” (ATM) equity offering programs as well as a registered offering of its STRD preferred stock that bagged $979.7 million net. At the same time, Strategy carries significant leverage, reporting about $8.24 billion in outstanding debt as of June 30, alongside $3.4 billion in preferred stock, which have pushed its annual interest and dividend obligations past $350 million. The company also struck a note of caution, stressing that future profitability hinges on Bitcoin’s price and acknowledging potential liquidity risks if forced to sell its BTC to meet obligations during market downturns. Imitators Ramp Up Buying Sprees While Strategy’s Q2 buying spree was monumental, with the last being a $531 million outlay on 4,980 BTC, pushing its total holding to 597,325 BTC, its absence from the market this Monday was notable. Per the 8-K, between June 30 and July 6, Strategy acquired “0” Bitcoin. This breaks its well-established pattern of consistent purchases, often announced on Mondays. The company confirmed its various ATM programs had ample remaining capacity, running into the billions, suggesting funding wasn’t the immediate constraint. Meanwhile, other firms that have taken up the Strategy playbook took advantage of the OG’s absence to increase their holdings. Tokyo-based Metaplanet snagged 2,205 BTC for around $238.7 million, bringing its stash to 15,555 BTC. The Smarter Web Company also announced a 226.42 BTC purchase as part of its “10-Year Plan,” while The Blockchain Group scooped up 116 BTC for nearly €11 million, taking its holdings to 1,904 BTC.

2025-07-07T15:30:57,"Iris Energy Surges: Record Revenue and Monumental AI Cloud Expansion in June","BitcoinWorld Iris Energy Surges: Record Revenue and Monumental AI Cloud Expansion in June The cryptocurrency world is constantly buzzing with innovation and growth, but every now and then, a company truly stands out. Iris Energy (NASDAQ: IREN), a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining sector, has just reported a June performance that’s nothing short of phenomenal. With record-breaking revenue and significant strides in its ambitious AI Cloud expansion , IREN is not just participating in the digital revolution—it’s leading the charge. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about strategic vision and execution in a rapidly evolving landscape, highlighting the immense potential within the digital asset economy. Iris Energy’s Record-Breaking June Performance Iris Energy has truly outdone itself in June, marking a period of unprecedented financial success. The company announced a staggering monthly revenue of $68 million , a figure that sets a new benchmark for their operations. This impressive top-line growth was accompanied by a robust hardware profit of $51 million , showcasing efficient management and strong operational margins. While electricity costs amounted to $16 million , the net profitability underscores IREN’s ability to navigate the volatile energy market effectively while scaling its operations. These financial milestones are a testament to Iris Energy’s operational excellence and strategic foresight, solidifying its position as a powerhouse in the digital asset space. Let’s break down the key financial highlights: Total Revenue: $68 million (Record high) Hardware Profit: $51 million Electricity Costs: $16 million This remarkable performance indicates not just a strong market but also Iris Energy’s enhanced capacity and optimized mining strategies paying dividends. It’s a clear signal of their growing influence and profitability within the competitive Bitcoin mining industry. Powering Up: The Ascent of a Bitcoin Mining Company What does it take for a leading Bitcoin mining company to achieve such scale? For Iris Energy, it’s a combination of aggressive expansion and strategic infrastructure development. In June, IREN successfully hit its ambitious target of 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second) hashrate . This isn’t just a number; it represents a colossal amount of computational power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network and validating transactions. To support this immense hashrate, the company boasts a substantial data center capacity of 810 MW (Megawatts) . This significant infrastructure allows IREN to deploy and operate a vast fleet of mining equipment, ensuring high efficiency and competitive advantage. Achieving 50 EH/s places Iris Energy among the elite in the global Bitcoin mining landscape. It signifies not only their commitment to scaling but also their operational prowess in managing large-scale energy consumption and hardware deployment. This expansion directly translates into increased potential for Bitcoin block rewards and transaction fees, fueling their revenue growth and strengthening their market position. As a premier Bitcoin mining company , IREN’s commitment to expanding its operational footprint is evident. Beyond Mining: IREN’s Bold AI Cloud Expansion While its roots are firmly in Bitcoin mining, Iris Energy is strategically diversifying its portfolio by making significant inroads into the burgeoning AI market. The company’s AI Cloud expansion is a prime example of this forward-thinking approach. In June, IREN substantially boosted its AI capabilities by adding approximately 2,400 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs . This addition brings their total count of powerful NVIDIA GPUs to an impressive 4,300 . NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs are at the forefront of AI computing, designed to handle the most demanding machine learning and deep learning workloads. Why is this significant? The demand for high-performance computing power for AI applications is skyrocketing across industries, from scientific research to enterprise solutions. By leveraging its existing data center infrastructure and power capacity, Iris Energy is uniquely positioned to offer scalable and efficient AI computing services. This strategic pivot allows them to tap into a new, high-growth revenue stream, reducing their sole reliance on Bitcoin price fluctuations and diversifying their business model. This move transforms IREN from purely a mining entity into a comprehensive digital infrastructure provider, making their AI Cloud expansion a critical strategic move. Key aspects of IREN’s AI Cloud strategy: Strategic Diversification: Reduces reliance on Bitcoin mining alone. High-Demand Market: Taps into the rapidly growing AI computing sector. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure: Utilizes current data center and power capabilities. Cutting-Edge Hardware: Deployment of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for superior performance. Reaching New Heights: Understanding Crypto Hashrate Milestones The concept of crypto hashrate is fundamental to understanding the operational scale of companies like Iris Energy. Hashrate represents the total combined computational power being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin. A higher hashrate indicates greater security for the network and, for miners, a higher probability of solving blocks and earning rewards. Iris Energy’s achievement of 50 EH/s is a significant milestone that places them among the largest contributors to Bitcoin’s network security, showcasing their impressive crypto hashrate capabilities. This substantial increase in hashrate is a direct result of their ongoing deployment of high-efficiency mining rigs and the expansion of their data center facilities. It underscores a strategic commitment to growth and market dominance in the Bitcoin mining sector. Furthermore, a higher hashrate often translates into improved operational efficiency and lower per-unit mining costs over time, enhancing the company’s profitability and competitive edge. How does a higher hashrate benefit a mining company? Increased Block Rewards: A larger share of the network hashrate means a higher chance of solving a block and earning Bitcoin rewards. Enhanced Network Security: Contributing more hashrate helps secure the Bitcoin network against attacks. Operational Scale: Indicates significant investment and capability in large-scale infrastructure. Competitive Advantage: Positions the company as a leader in the mining industry. Driving Growth: The Significance of Digital Asset Revenue Beyond the operational achievements, the financial backbone of Iris Energy’s success lies in its impressive digital asset revenue . The record $68 million monthly revenue isn’t just a number; it reflects the culmination of efficient mining operations, strategic capital deployment, and perhaps the early fruits of their AI cloud initiatives. This revenue stream is critical for funding ongoing expansion, technological upgrades, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet in a capital-intensive industry. Furthermore, Iris Energy’s strategic financial moves in June also contributed to its robust position. The company’s $550 million convertible notes offering was oversubscribed , a clear indicator of strong investor confidence in their growth trajectory and diversified business model. An oversubscribed offering suggests that demand from investors exceeded the available notes, allowing the company to secure capital on favorable terms. This capital infusion is crucial for further expanding both their Bitcoin mining operations and accelerating their AI Cloud development. Another pivotal development was Iris Energy’s completion of its transition to U.S. domestic issuer status . This move simplifies regulatory compliance, potentially lowers administrative costs, and broadens the company’s access to U.S. capital markets. It also enhances transparency and appeal to a wider range of institutional investors, further advancing their initiatives in AI customer acquisition and broader financing efforts, all contributing to their robust digital asset revenue streams. Iris Energy’s June report paints a vivid picture of a company firing on all cylinders. From achieving record-breaking revenue and hardware profit to hitting its ambitious 50 EH/s crypto hashrate target, IREN is solidifying its dominance as a leading Bitcoin mining company . More impressively, its bold and rapid AI Cloud expansion with a massive deployment of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs signals a strategic diversification that positions the company for long-term growth beyond traditional crypto mining. Coupled with an oversubscribed convertible notes offering and a smooth transition to U.S. domestic issuer status, Iris Energy is demonstrating not just operational prowess but also astute financial management and strategic foresight. As the digital economy continues to evolve, IREN’s integrated approach to digital infrastructure, encompassing both Bitcoin mining and AI computing, makes it a compelling entity to watch in the coming years. Their recent achievements underscore a powerful trajectory towards becoming a leading provider of high-performance computing solutions and generating significant digital asset revenue .

2025-07-07T15:17:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Starts Crucial Week In The Red, Slips Below $109,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in bearish territory despite early gains. The flagship cryptocurrency started positively, rising to an intraday high of $109,726 before losing momentum and dropping to its current level. BTC is down 0.48%, trading around $108,698. Analysts believe BTC is on the verge of a big move, with its Bollinger Bands reaching a critical point that could suggest a breakout is imminent. MetaPlanet Purchases 2,205 BTC To Take Total Holdings Past 15,000 Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has completed the acquisition of an additional 2,205 BTC , taking its total holdings to 15,555 BTC . The firm made its latest purchase at an average price of 15.64 million yen per Bitcoin for a total price of 34.49 billion yen ($213 million). The purchase pushes Metaplanet’s aggregate Bitcoin investment to 225.82 billion yen ($1.38 billion), with a blended average purchase price of 14.52 million yen per BTC . The company reported a BTC yield of 95.6% for the quarter ending June 30 and reported a 309% yield during the previous quarter. BTC Yield reflects the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share. Metaplanet’s latest purchase is its largest single-day purchase since it began its Bitcoin strategy. The firm redeemed 6 billion yen worth of bonds issued last June, using the proceeds to complete its latest acquisition. Metaplanet has consistently used this approach, raising capital and converting it into Bitcoin . Bitcoin Whale Not Selling After Record Transfer Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham has said that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved last week does not seem to be heading for a sell-off. Arkham believes that the transfers may be the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which offers improved security and lower fees. “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin. Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses.” Bitcoin (BTC) Heads Into Crucial Week Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a range for most of last week, despite drops to $105,400 and a brief move past $110,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency heads into a crucial week with President Trump’s tariff deadline looming, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. President Trump’s tariff deadline is likely the most important catalyst for Bitcoin and the broader market. The 90-day pause expires on July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with several countries, including China and the UK. However, Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea may revert to the tariffs announced in April. A return of retaliatory tariffs could be bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC had plunged to a low of $74,000 after Trump’s Liberation Day speech before bouncing back when he announced the 90-day pause. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are also scheduled for release on Wednesday and could act as another decisive catalyst for BTC . The minutes are expected to provide more information about the previous meeting, where the Fed left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The minutes will also shed light on when the Fed could cut interest rates. A rate cut will be bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market. However, the odds of a rate cut have reduced due to strong nonfarm payrolls data. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp decline during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum despite starting the week in positive territory, rising to an intraday high of $109,726 before quickly losing momentum. BTC fell to a low of $107,340 on Friday but recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising nearly 1% on Sunday and settling at $109,229. However, selling pressure has returned during the ongoing session, with the price at $108,332. Despite the decline, analysts believe BTC is positioned for a recovery, based on the position of the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands are used to assess momentum and volatility within a certain range. One analyst pointed out that the bands were at their tightest point in nearly a year, suggesting that a big push upwards could be imminent. “Bitcoin Bollinger Bands are tighter than they’ve been in over a year. BIG PUMP INCOMING!” BTC surged 75% between February and March 2024 after breaking above the upper Bollinger Band boundary. Other analysts were quick to spot the emerging pattern, with analyst Cantonese Cat stating, “Bollinger band is tighter than it’s been for over a year. Bigger move coming.” Analysts believe the bull trend is intact despite multiple rejections around $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has registered consistent institutional demand through ETF inflows and treasury companies. Additionally, a cup-and-handle pattern in higher timeframes indicates a potential breakout towards $200,000. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 0.14% on Friday and 0.20% on Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 to $105,742. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845, but not before reaching an intraday high of $109,792. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097. Price action turned positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday, reclaiming $109,000 and settling at $109,229. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 1% at $108,397. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

From a holding of 24,434 ETH as of the end of March , Bit Digital now has approximately 100,603 ETH ($189.2 million) making it one of the largest corporate ETH holders, the company said on Monday . Bit Digital revealed its plans to focus solely on ETH staking last month, in a move that wasn't entirely unexpected given the more challenging environment bitcoin miners have experienced since last year's halving . Ether staking is the process of locking up ETH to help secure the network in return for rewards. Stakers validate transactions and create new blocks to earn a passive income. The quadrennial halving event sees the reward for adding new blocks Bitcoin network reduced by 50%, taking a considerable bite out of miners' revenue stream, notwithstanding a rally in BTC's price. BTBT shares were higher by 26% on Monday to $3.71.

2025-07-07T15:09:17,"SEC Sets July Deadline for Solana ETF Refilings, Clearing Path for Pre-October Approval","The road to a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be much shorter than expected. The Securities and Exchange Commission asked prospective issuers to respond to comments and re-file amended S-1 documents before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. Technically, the SEC has until October 10 to approve or deny such a fund, but it seems want to accelerate the process and approve one or more of the funds way ahead of that deadline, one of the individuals said. The reason could be the recent approval of the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF (SSK) which the Commission had no choice but to green-light as it falls under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore received automatic approval unless stopped by the SEC. SSK started trading last week , becoming the first Solana staking fund on the market, giving it a first-mover advantage over the potential remaining Solana ETFs. This is something that the SEC has previously attempted to prevent, which is why it approved several spot ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) ETFs at the same time. “I think that the SEC has some pressure to approve these quicker than waiting all the way to October, especially with that Rex Shares product that got approved last week,” one person familiar with the matter said. In June, the Commission asked issuers to amend their S-1 filings for their requested Solana ETFs and to include language for in-kind redemption and creations as well as staking, which was the first official communication from the SEC regarding those potential products. The spot Solana ETFs would be the third kind of spot crypto funds on the U.S. market after the approval of the spot ether and bitcoin funds. Other outstanding applications include funds tracking the price of XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC), among others.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/07/sec-sets-july-deadline-for-solana-etf-refilings-clearing-path-for-pre-october-approval,"SOL|REGULATION|BTC|DOGE|LTC","Policy|Solana|Top Stories|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T15:00:30,"Digital Asset Working Group Unveils Pivotal Crypto Policy Report by July 22","BitcoinWorld Digital Asset Working Group Unveils Pivotal Crypto Policy Report by July 22 The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation! A significant moment is on the horizon for the digital asset space, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Working Group is poised to release its inaugural major crypto policy report by July 22. This isn’t just another government document; it’s a collaborative masterpiece from key agencies like the Treasury, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Its release is expected to bring much-needed clarity and direction to the rapidly evolving crypto sector. For anyone invested in, or simply curious about, the future of digital currencies, this report could be a game-changer. Understanding the Digital Asset Working Group and Its Mandate So, what exactly is the Digital Asset Working Group , and why is its work so important? Formed under the previous administration, this group brings together various federal agencies to tackle the complex challenges and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Their primary mandate is to foster innovation while simultaneously protecting consumers and ensuring financial stability within the digital asset ecosystem. This involves: Identifying Gaps: Pinpointing areas where existing regulations fall short or create undue burdens for crypto businesses. Proposing Solutions: Developing legislative and regulatory frameworks that can adapt to new technologies. Ensuring Competitiveness: Helping the U.S. maintain its leadership in financial innovation. The upcoming report isn’t just theoretical; it’s expected to outline concrete proposals that could shape how crypto businesses operate, how investors trade, and how digital assets are integrated into the broader financial system. It’s a testament to the growing recognition of crypto’s impact on the global economy. What to Expect from the Crucial Crypto Policy Report ? While the full details of the upcoming Crypto Policy Report remain under wraps, speculation is rife about its potential contents. This report is a culmination of extensive research and discussions among some of the most influential financial regulators in the U.S. Here are some of the key areas it’s expected to touch upon: Regulatory Clarity: Providing clear guidelines on which digital assets fall under the purview of the SEC (as securities) or the CFTC (as commodities), and how existing laws apply. Consumer Protection: Recommendations for safeguarding investors from fraud, manipulation, and market volatility. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Strengthening frameworks to prevent illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. Innovation & Competitiveness: Balancing regulatory oversight with the need to foster technological advancement and maintain the U.S.’s competitive edge in the global digital economy. The report’s findings will be pivotal for both established crypto firms and burgeoning startups, potentially setting a precedent for how other nations approach their own crypto regulatory frameworks. The Intriguing Possibility of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of the most intriguing rumors circulating around the report’s content, as highlighted by Crypto in America, is the potential recommendation for creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This concept, while still speculative, could have profound implications. Imagine the U.S. government holding a significant amount of Bitcoin as a national asset, similar to how countries hold gold or foreign currencies. The potential benefits and challenges are numerous: Potential Benefits: Economic Stability: Diversifying national reserves beyond traditional assets, potentially hedging against inflation or currency devaluation. Geopolitical Influence: Enhancing the U.S.’s position in the global digital economy and potentially influencing international crypto standards. Market Confidence: A government endorsement of Bitcoin could significantly boost institutional and retail confidence in the asset. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price volatility could pose risks to national reserves. Acquisition & Storage: The logistics of acquiring and securely storing a large volume of Bitcoin would be complex. Public Perception: Gaining public and political consensus for such a novel approach could be difficult. While a strategic Bitcoin reserve remains a speculative point, its inclusion in discussions underscores the growing seriousness with which digital assets are being considered at the highest levels of government. Ensuring Fair Crypto Banking Access : A Game Changer? Another critical area the report is expected to address is ensuring crypto firms have fair access to banking services from the Federal Reserve. This has been a persistent pain point for the industry. Many traditional banks remain hesitant to serve crypto businesses due to perceived risks, regulatory uncertainty, and compliance burdens. This often forces legitimate crypto companies to operate without adequate banking infrastructure, hindering their growth and stability. Why is this important? Legitimacy & Growth: Access to banking services legitimizes crypto businesses, enabling them to process transactions, manage payrolls, and secure loans like any other industry. Reduced Risk: Pushing crypto firms to the fringes of the financial system can ironically increase risks, as they may resort to less regulated or transparent methods. Level Playing Field: Fair access ensures that innovative crypto startups can compete on an equal footing with traditional financial institutions. Recommendations from the report could include clear guidelines for banks on how to onboard and serve crypto clients, or even direct pathways for certain crypto entities to access Federal Reserve master accounts. Such a move would be a monumental step towards integrating the crypto sector into mainstream finance, fostering a more robust and secure ecosystem for all participants. Navigating the Future of US Crypto Regulation The release of this report marks a significant milestone in the journey towards comprehensive US Crypto Regulation . It signifies a proactive approach from the government to not only understand but also shape the future of digital assets. For investors, businesses, and developers in the crypto space, this means: Increased Clarity: Less ambiguity around legal and operational requirements, potentially reducing compliance costs and fostering innovation. Enhanced Stability: A more regulated environment could lead to greater market stability and reduced instances of fraud, attracting more institutional capital. Global Leadership: A clear and effective regulatory framework could solidify the U.S.’s position as a leader in digital finance. However, navigating these new regulations will require diligence. Businesses will need to adapt their operations, and investors will need to stay informed about changes that could impact their portfolios. The report is likely to be a starting point, with further legislative actions and regulatory updates following in its wake. In conclusion, the impending release of the Digital Asset Working Group’s first Crypto Policy Report by July 22 is a moment of profound significance for the entire digital asset landscape. From potential recommendations for a strategic Bitcoin reserve to ensuring fair crypto banking access , this document is set to lay down the foundational elements for future US Crypto Regulation . It promises to bring much-needed clarity, foster innovation, and integrate the vibrant world of digital assets more deeply into the traditional financial system. As the crypto industry matures, such concerted efforts from policymakers are not just welcome, but absolutely essential for sustainable growth and widespread adoption.

The collaboration enables users to deposit their BTC on Sui and mint tBTC, potentially adding over $500 million worth of bitcoin liquidity to the Sui network. It means users can deploy their BTC in the Sui-based DeFi to generate additional yield while seamlessly using tBTC across the ecosystem. ""tBTC is expected to bring a massive amount of Bitcoin liquidity to Sui, creating a bridge that truly matters—not just for institutions but for everyday people who love Bitcoin,” Adeniyi Abiodun, co-founder and chief product officer at Mysten Labs, the original contributors to Sui, said in the announcement shared exclusively with CoinDesk. “This new integration opens another door to accessible, sovereign BTCfi participation,” Abiodun added. BTCFi represents a full spectrum of decentralized finance applications built to work with bitcoin, aiming to enhance the cryptocurrency's appeal beyond the store-of-value narrative. Nearly 600 BTC, worth over $65 million, have been bridged to the Sui ecosystem since February, and BTC-backed assets account for more than 10% of the total value locked (TVL) in the SUI ecosystem. At press time, cryptocurrencies worth $1.83 billion were locked in the Sui-based DeFi, according to data source DeFiLlama. ""Bitcoin was designed to be used, not locked away,” Callan Sarre, co-founder at Threshold Labs, said. “With tBTC coming on Sui, we’re combining the security of threshold cryptography with a high-throughput network to create a new standard for Bitcoin utility.” Home to tBTC, Threshold Network is a decentralized protocol that combines cryptography and blockchain infrastructure to provide secure and trust-minimized access to bitcoin DeFi. As of writing, tBTC had a market cap of over $570 million, with a circulating supply of 5,265 coins, according to data source Coingecko.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/07/threshold-s-bitcoin-backed-tbtc-debuts-on-sui-unlocking-usd500m-in-liquidity,"BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|SUI","Markets|Bitcoin|Sui|Markets|Blockchain|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T14:58:02,"PEPE coin fails to hold above 100‑day SMA despite market resurgence","The recent attempt by PEPE coin to reclaim higher ground has faltered, as the meme coin fails to sustain momentum above its 100-day simple moving average (SMA), despite broader optimism in the crypto market. Notably, PEPE’s inability to maintain its push above key resistance comes despite Bitcoin (BTC) recording a fresh all-time high weekly close above $109,000, lifting overall market sentiment and fuelling rallies across select meme coins. Short-lived breakout above key resistance On Monday, PEPE briefly surged past its 100-day SMA, which stood near the $0.00001009 level, sparking initial hopes of a trend reversal. Although the price action hinted at a bullish continuation, sellers quickly overwhelmed the move, sending PEPE back down to hover around $0.00000992 just hours later. This rejection marked the continuation of a broader sideways movement, as PEPE remained trapped between the $0.00000990 support floor and resistance near $0.00001020. The price structure over the past two weeks has taken the shape of a horizontal channel, with both lower and upper boundaries repeatedly tested but not convincingly breached. Adding to the bearish pressure, whale wallets have continued distributing significant volumes of PEPE to exchanges, further clouding the near-term outlook. According to on-chain data , one notable transaction saw 500 billion PEPE tokens worth approximately $3.85 million transferred to Binance, hinting at potential liquidation or strategic unloading by large holders. Technical analysis points to indecision Despite PEPE’s bounce from recent lows, technical indicators have offered mixed signals, reflecting the coin’s fragile position in a volatile market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 44.3, suggesting a neutral momentum as the coin straddled the line between oversold and recovery zones. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed early signs of a bullish crossover, with the signal and MACD lines rising toward the zero mark, yet still operating in negative territory. A rising MACD histogram added to short-term optimism, implying that buying pressure may be slowly rebuilding beneath the surface. Nevertheless, these signals are not yet conclusive, and traders remain cautious as PEPE struggles to close decisively above key technical levels. Anticipated triangle breakout now faces tough resistance Over the weekend, the PEPE coin staged a recovery and broke out of a descending triangle pattern that had formed from the May 23 and June 10 highs, with base support at $0.00000900. The pattern breakout initially sparked optimism among bulls, especially after PEPE gained over 3.4% on Sunday and continued inching higher into Monday. However, the rally faced immediate resistance near $0.00001037, a level that has repeatedly capped upside attempts since mid-June. A confirmed close above this point could open the door for a move toward $0.00001196, the May 17 low, and potentially $0.00001362, the June high. But without strong volume support and clearer momentum signals, PEPE’s price remains vulnerable to retracements and consolidation. The PEPE coin derivatives market is flashing tentative optimism The derivatives market has reflected a modest increase in optimism, as Open Interest (OI) climbed by 2.25% to $533.63 million in the past 24 hours. Moreover, the OI-weighted funding rate flipped from negative to positive, moving from -0.0052% on Sunday to +0.0052% by Monday, indicating a growing willingness among traders to pay premiums for long positions. PEPE OI-Weighted Funding Rate | Source: Coinglass This shift suggests that speculative sentiment may be turning more bullish, though the sustainability of that enthusiasm remains uncertain. Traders are now watching for a decisive close above $0.00001037, which could confirm PEPE’s readiness for an extended breakout rally. Until then, downside risks remain prominent, especially if the coin fails to hold above the $0.00000990 zone and re-tests the $0.00000900 support base.
