2025-07-07T20:57:16,"CoinShares: Crypto Funds Maintain Inflows Above $1 Billion Per Week","Cryptocurrency funds attracted $1.04 billion from June 28 to July 4. The value of assets under management (AUM) reached a record $188 billion, according to a report by CoinShares. The trend of investment inflows into crypto funds has continued for the twelfth consecutive week since April. The trading volume for the reporting period was $16.3 billion, remaining roughly in line with the average weekly figure since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin-based investment products attracted $790 million in early July, which is less than the previous three weeks when inflows averaged $1.5 billion. The slowdown in inflows points to growing caution among investors as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high, according to CoinShares analysts. Ethereum products recorded their eleventh consecutive week of investment growth, raising $226 million at the beginning of July. On average, over the past seven days, inflows amounted to 1.6% of AUM, significantly higher than Bitcoin's 0.8%. According to the report's authors, this indicates a noticeable shift in investor sentiment in favor of the second-largest cryptocurrency. From June 28 to July 4, investments in Solana and Sui-related instruments totaled $21.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Analysts noted that Solana saw its highest investment inflows in the past 69 weeks. By region, the U.S. led with inflows of $1 billion, followed by Germany ($38.5 million) and Switzerland ($33.7 million). Canada and Brazil saw outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9836/coin-shares-crypto-funds-maintain-inflows-above-1-billion-per-week,"BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|ETH|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

They Are Following Closely”","Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson and his CEO, the analytics firm Alphractal, made remarkable assessments regarding the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. Wedson provided important data on correlation changes in the market and the future of altcoins. Joao Wedson stated in his statement that altcoins have started to follow Bitcoin's footsteps again. Stating that the correlation between XRP and BTC decreased by 10% from 0.79% to 0.70%, Wedson stated that Solana's (SOL) correlation increased from 0.53% to 0.75%. Wedson said, “ETH and THETA stand out as the altcoins with the highest correlation with Bitcoin. This means that they closely follow BTC's movements.” Wedson also said that 1,400 altcoins that were active in the market no longer exist. The analyst, who interpreted this situation as a positive development, said, “This is excellent news. Because only the most durable projects survive. This makes the market stronger. The more secure, fast and solving a real problem a crypto project is, the more valuable it is.” Related News: BREAKING: SEC Issues Update on Fidelity Solana Spot ETF Alphractal, an analytics company led by Joao Wedson, announced that Bitcoin has entered a new phase of discovery in terms of on-chain metrics. The company stated, “The SOPR Trend Signal is rising for the third time in this bull cycle. This is a never-before-seen situation.” The metric is used to analyze periods when investors are selling at a profit. “What’s unique about this signal is that it reflects market trends through on-chain behavior. If the blue line goes below the orange line, it could be a bearish signal.

The service is available on the bank's mobile app for all adult customers. The launch was preceded by the submission of an application to the National Securities Market Commission in March 2025. The bank independently holds client assets and does not engage third-party custodians. Users perform transactions themselves. BBVA does not provide investment advice. ”We want to make it easier for our retail customers in Spain to invest in crypto assets with a simple solution on their cell phones,” said BBVA's head of retail banking in Spain, Gonzalo Rodriguez. The service is compliant with the European MiCA regulation. BBVA previously launched similar services in Switzerland and Turkey through a subsidiary—in 2021 and 2023, respectively. Spain is the third market where the bank has launched this service, and the first where it is targeted directly at retail customers. Head of digital assets Francisco Maroto said BBVA will continue to develop business in this area. The bank plans to add new cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and real-world tokenized assets (RWA), such as bonds and ETFs, in the future. Other Major Banks Integrating Crypto Services BBVA is not alone in embracing digital assets. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered have also integrated cryptocurrency services, offering trading, custody, and blockchain-based solutions to their clients. This growing trend reflects the increasing demand for regulated crypto access within traditional banking, signaling a shift in the financial industry toward broader digital asset adoption.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9835/bbva-opens-access-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-for-retail-clients,"BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T20:30:38,"Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know","The liquidity engine that has supported risk assets, including Bitcoin, since the beginning of 2025 is now shifting into reverse. According to macro analyst Tomas (@TomasOnMarkets), the six-month upswing in Federal Reserve liquidity has ended, and a potentially destabilizing wave of debt issuance by the US Treasury is about to begin. In a post published on X late Sunday, Tomas warned: “ Federal Reserve Liquidity set to fall… The Fed liquidity upswing that began on January 1 2025 is now over.” Bitcoin Enters Danger Zone The catalyst behind this reversal is the recent $5 trillion debt ceiling increase passed by Congress last week. That legislative decision gives the Treasury Department the green light to aggressively rebuild its cash balance at the Federal Reserve—known as the Treasury General Account (TGA)—which had been intentionally drained to inject liquidity into the system during the first half of the year. “The US Government had previously been draining the Treasury General Account (liquidity injection). But a new debt ceiling agreement was reached last week ($5 trillion raise). This means the Government will start to flood the market with new debt to ‘refill’ the TGA (liquidity drain),” Tomas wrote. He emphasized that the refill target is currently set at $850 billion, up from recent levels around $350 billion, implying roughly $500 billion in liquidity will be removed from the system in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Back To ‘Very Bullish’ — What This Means The implications for Bitcoin are stark. Risk assets have historically benefited from rising dollar liquidity—particularly in the context of elevated ETF inflows, corporate adoption, and a weakening US dollar. But that backdrop is now shifting. As Tomas put it, “All else being equal, this TGA rebuild process should be bullish for the US dollar.” A strengthening dollar, when coupled with falling bank reserves, is generally a bearish environment for Bitcoin. The pressure on liquidity won’t necessarily come all at once, but the mechanics are clear. Treasury will issue large volumes of new short-term debt—primarily T-bills—to finance the TGA refill. This issuance will compete with other dollar-denominated assets for funding, draining cash out of banks and money markets. Tomas notes that this dynamic could be softened if money market funds rotate their cash out of the Fed’s Overnight Reverse Repo Facility, which still holds about $214 billion. “It’s possible that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could lower the target level, meaning less of a refill,” he adds. “I’d expect we may see a lot of T-bill issuance, which could tempt some of the remaining $214bn left in the Reverse Repo to leave the facility (liquidity injection) and lessen any negative impact of the TGA refill.” Still, even with some reallocation from RRP, Tomas expects the overall effect to reduce reserve balances—bank reserves as a percentage of GDP are likely to fall below 10%, he estimates. While this is not as dire as the 7% level reached in 2019 (which triggered the repo crisis), it represents a sharp tightening compared to the first half of this year. “There could be some funding stress around the end of September (end-of-quarter),” Tomas cautioned. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Is A Trap—Analyst Predicts Pain Before $160,000 Surge Bitcoin’s performance has coincided with the exact window Tomas outlines as a liquidity upswing. As documented, Bitcoin’s price has closely tracked the direction of aggregate G5 central bank balance sheets and the level of US bank reserves. When those reserves shrink—especially in the face of stronger Treasury issuance and a rebounding dollar—Bitcoin has historically struggled to sustain upside momentum. This concern is compounded by Tomas’s warning that speculative short positioning against the dollar has reached extremes. “Back in January, I was shouting about a fall in the dollar. Now everybody and their mothers are bearish on the dollar, and positioning is massively short across the board. It’s time for, at the very least, an upward correction/consolidation for the US dollar, in my opinion.” Such a reversal in the dollar would mark a critical macro headwind for Bitcoin. The 90-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin and the US Dollar Index (DXY) remains firmly negative. In environments where the dollar strengthens—especially when driven by tightening liquidity—Bitcoin has rarely outperformed. The next several weeks will be critical. If Treasury proceeds with aggressive issuance and market participants demand higher yields, liquidity could tighten faster than anticipated. While Tomas does leave open the possibility that Secretary Bessent may adjust the TGA target downward, the baseline scenario remains a $500 billion net liquidity drain—directly reversing the conditions that allowed Bitcoin to surge. At press time, BTC traded at $108,148.

2025-07-07T20:30:08,"What is the Latest Situation for Bitcoin (BTC)? Where Are the Option Data Pointing?","Cryptocurrency analysis company QCP Capital published an important analysis of Bitcoin's performance and the general mood in the market last weekend in its latest evaluation report. Bitcoin held its price over the long holiday weekend before reaching a new all-time weekly close, reaching as high as $109,700 during low-volume trading on Sunday, according to the report. This rise came despite the transfer of around $8.5 billion worth of BTC by eight old Bitcoin wallets that went into action on Saturday. It was reported that $4.3 billion worth of BTC was sold in the middle of the week, and the price was around $108,000 at the time. QCP Capital said that these large-scale “bearish” transactions were largely ignored by the market, while “bullish” scenarios found strong buyers. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market It was stated that TON's “Golden Visa” rumors, which were denied by the United Arab Emirates authorities, and Elon Musk's criticism of fiat money, along with his announcement of a new political formation called “The American Party”, also contributed to the rise in the market. QCP Capital also noted that large investors such as Metaplanet and Strategy continued to make strategic purchases throughout the weekend. However, due to new sell orders from these large wallets, the price could get stuck in the current range and implied volatility could drop to record lows. However, it is stated that a new increase in volatility may occur if the $ 110,000 resistance level is clearly broken. It is observed that institutional investors are showing interest in September term $ 130,000 call options and continue to maintain $ 115,000/140,000 call spread positions. According to QCP Capital, this situation points to a structurally optimistic picture for the third quarter of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T20:10:00,"ApeCoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will APE recover?","Key takeaways: Our ApeCoin price predictions anticipate a high of $1.59 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6053 Market cap $456M Trading volume $21.02 Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.6177 24-hour low $0.6028 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 7.08% 50-day SMA $0.6589 200-day SMA $0.6789 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) APE price analysis At the time of writing (July 7), APE’s price dropped by 1.08% in one week and dropped by 0.69% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.60. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume fell by 41.26% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. It started recovering last month as it rose above $0.65. The MACD histogram shows that the price is experiencing little momentum. The William Alligator trendlines show little price volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s bear run as it dropped below $0.65. It registered continuous bearish candles in the last 12 hours. At current levels, it registers little volatility and momentum.

APE price analysis shows the market had little momentum in the last few days. It should move sideways in the short term. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction July 2025 The APE July price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $0.79, with an average of $0.69.

The bank is revamping its private banking arm in preparation to serve its richest customers who are looking to spread their money around the world to protect their wealth, the Wall Street Journal reports . JPMorgan’s service requires a minimum balance of $10 million from clients and caters to investors who no longer want all of their wealth to just sit in their main country of residence. In addition, investors are reportedly becoming more concerned about the war in the Middle East, as well as America’s trade war against other markets, prompting a migration of wealth. Says Mary Erdoes, head of JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management unit, “Our clients have always been multi-jurisdictional but now their assets are too, and that’s becoming ever more so with how the world is changing.” JPMorgan recently appointed David Frame to head the private bank, which is a new role within the firm. Frame noted that sports teams are one of the high-flying investments that the super rich are currently looking to park their wealth, and when Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck asked JPMorgan to find buyers for the NBA team, the bank contacted roughly 186 different clients around the world to solicit interest. “The wealthier you get, the more you feel you’re a citizen of the world… If that doesn’t happen with the first generation of a family, it starts to happen with the second and the third. There are borders for sports teams, but it doesn’t feel that way when it comes to the wealthy who are investing in them.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The US government is seeking to seize $40,000 in USDT. Half of that sum has already been collected from a Binance account under the name of Ehiremen Aigbokhan with an address in Nigeria. The U.S. Secret Service is reportedly launching a new campaign against crypto scams with a new team that specializes in digital financial crimes. Bloomberg reports that the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) uses software, subpoenas and spreadsheets to identify and go after criminals behind fraudulent crypto scams, including pig butchering operations that offer fake investments to victims. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the GIOC has already seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the last 10 years.

2025-07-07T19:53:52,"Calamos unveils ‘Protected Bitcoin’ strategy for institutional investors","Investment firm Calamos has unveiled a new investment strategy aimed at limiting Bitcoin’s downside potential. Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming increasingly attractive to institutions, but many still view it as too risky. In response, on June 7, global investment firm Calamos introduced its “protected Bitcoin” strategy , designed to limit both the downside and the upside of Bitcoin exposure. The firm noted that although Bitcoin has reached a $2 trillion valuation, institutional investors remain concerned about its volatility. As a result, most allocate just 1–2% of their portfolios to BTC to avoid outsized risk exposure. Calamos has structured its strategy to offer some upside participation while managing risk by combining Bitcoin futures with U.S. Treasuries. Specifically, the firm purchases zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds maturing at the end of the year.

Simultaneously, Calamos buys call options on the Bitcoin Index to capture potential gains. To fund these, the firm also sells out-of-the-money call options, effectively capping the upside between 25% and 60%. Calamos risk-reward tiers | Source: Calamos Each risk-return tier is benchmarked to familiar asset classes. The 100% protected Bitcoin tier mirrors the risk profile of Treasuries, offering capital preservation with virtually no downside risk. The second tier is comparable to gold or alternative assets, while the third tier aligns with equities in terms of expected returns and volatility. Calamos believes this structured approach could enhance Bitcoin’s appeal relative to traditional assets. However, timing remains critical. Traders must hold positions to maturity to benefit from the downside protection; early exits could result in loss of principal. While rare, another risk includes potential sovereign debt default, which the firm notes is highly unlikely.

2025-07-07T19:50:31,"Bit Digital has gone all-ETH by selling all of its Bitcoin to acquire 100,603 ETH","Bit Digital has gone all-ETH after selling all of its Bitcoin. The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from BTC and acquired over 100,000 Ethereum, making it one of the largest corporate ETH treasuries. Bit Digital revealed its plans to focus solely on ETH staking last month. From a holding of 24,434 ETH as of the end of March, Bit Digital now has approximately 100,603 ETH worth approximately $254 million. Sam Tabar, Chief Executive Officer of Bit Digital said, “Bit Digital is aligning itself with Ethereum’s long-term potential and positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets. We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” This is not a first. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, dumped $561 million in Bitcoin holdings and reallocated the capital straight into Ethereum last month. THIS COMPANY SOLD ALL OF THEIR BTC AND BOUGHT $200M OF ETH Bit Digital just acquired $192.9M ETH after raising ~$172M from a public offering, and selling their entire holdings of BTC, worth ~$28M. Bit Digital now holds a total of $254.8 Million of ETH. pic.twitter.com/nV3P9vhZU8 — Arkham (@arkham) July 7, 2025 The possible gains and the risks. Sam Tabar asserts that, “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system. Ethereum’s programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.” This move might offer a model for other mining companies. They can make money with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake method by locking up ETH to support network security. The returns are usually between 4% and 6.5% per year. This is a great option for traditional mining, which needs a lot of money. However, while Bitcoin miners can use different hedging techniques, staking Ethereum is directly exposed to changes in the price of Ethereum on the market. A big drop in the value of Ethereum could be very bad for the company’s finances, even if the staking rates are high. This method increases both the possible gains and the risks. Meanwhile, different markets initially had different reactions to Bit Digital’s news. The company’s stock price went down and hit a low point of $1.86. It then started to rise again after the company announced its strategy shift and sold 150 million shares. Ethereum has turned into a hot commodity for governments too’ According to recent reports, the United States government has deposited $218k ETH to Coinbase. According to analysts, the change in price projects investors’ uncertainty on whether the shift will work and if it will be financially viable in the long run. Ethereum vs Bitcoin mining Bit Digital’s move wasn’t entirely unexpected given the more challenging environment Bitcoin miners have experienced since last year’s halving. The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This reduction has led to significant declines in revenue and gross profits for miners. According to JPMorgan, average mining revenues have dropped by 46% since the halving, and gross profits have fallen by 57%. Also, BTC mining burns through electricity, and the miner must constantly upgrade hardware. On the other hand, Ethereum staking gives you steady returns with way less overhead. BTCS CEO Charles Allen states, “Ethereum staking, by contrast, offers cleaner economics — yield without the expensive energy costs and rapidly depreciating assets.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bit-digital-goes-full-on-eth-dumps-btc-stash/,"ETH|BTC|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News|BTC|ETH",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T19:30:53,"Jack Dorsey releases details of his p2p messaging app Bitchat","The co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, announced the launch of a new decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app named Bitchat. The application is currently available on Apple’s beta‐testing service TestFlight. On Sunday evening, Dorsey shared Bitchat’s whitepaper along with a TestFlight link for anyone interested in trying the app. He said his weekend project was to learn about “bluetooth mesh networks, relays and store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things.” Bitchat works without the internet Bitchat’s whitepaper states that the application doesn’t rely on internet infrastructure. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks, which provide ephemeral, encrypted communication. This setup ensures the application stays operational even during internet blackouts or censorship. When somebody sends a message to another user, the message is end-to-end encrypted and it stays in the device memory. No data is saved on a server. Also, using the app doesn’t require a phone number or an email address. This makes Bitchat more private compared to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp that rely on Meta’s data servers. Since Bitchat relies on BLE mesh networks, each device acts as both a client and a server. Nearby devices (within 30 meters) form clusters. When a device from one cluster comes into the range of a device from another cluster, they act as a bridge, linking the two groups. This allows messages to hop from cluster to cluster until they reach their intended recipient. The whitepaper further dives into the messaging app’s architecture, protocols, and safety mechanisms. Source: Jack Dorsey via X. How does Bitchat enhance privacy? Bitchat injects dummy messages at random intervals of 30–120 seconds and it adds 50–500 milliseconds delays to real transmissions. This makes it statistically impossible for anyone to distinguish genuine messages or correlate timing with user activity. Messages do not stay in the device’s memory forever. The decentralized app saves any message for 12 hours for regular peers while the time for favorite peers is indefinite. So even if somebody gains access to a device, they can’t trawl through years of old conversations. Bitchat has no metadata leaks since there’s no centralized servers or a service provider who can see your messages or who you’re talking to. Instead, each node only examines a TTL (time-to-live) counter and a message ID. Nodes do not keep any record of who sent the message, who will get it, or when it was sent—just enough data to know when to stop forwarding. Bitchat provides uninterruptible communication channels in situations like protests or disaster areas where the internet may be down, overloaded, or actively blocked. Besides founding Twitter and building Bitchat today, Jack Dorsey co-founded and led Block (formerly Square). He backed decentralized social protocols such as Bluesky and Nostr. In recent years Dorsey drove the development of Web5 and other decentralized applications while advocating for Bitcoin adoption.

2025-07-07T19:28:55,"a16z generative ai","Hippocratic AI raises $141M to staff hospitals with clinical AI agents Story Partners with Stability AI to Empower Open-Source Innovation for Creators and Developers Meanwhile, Kristina Dulaney, RN, PMH-C, the founder of Cherished Mom, an organization dedicated to solving maternal mental health challenges, helped to create an AI agent that’s focused on helping new mothers navigate such problems with postpartum mental health assessments and depression screening. The startup was initially focused on creating generative AI chatbots to support clinicians and other healthcare professionals, but has since switched its focus to patients themselves. Its most advanced models take advantage of the latest developments in AI agents, which are a form of AI that can perform more complex tasks while working unsupervised. Despite rapid advancements in AI, creators in open-source ecosystems face significant challenges in monetizing derivative works and securing proper attribution. Story, the global intellectual property blockchain, has announced its integration with Stability AI’s state-of-the-art models to revolutionize open-source AI development. This collaboration enables creators, developers, and artists to capture the value they contribute to the AI ecosystem by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure proper attribution, tracking, and monetization of creative works generated through AI. Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z, is investing in AI and biotech to lead the way in innovation. Your vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE. In a statement, Raspberry AI said the funding would be used to accelerate its product development and add top engineering, sales and marketing talent to its team. But with U.S. companies raising and/or spending record sums on new AI infrastructure that many experts have noted depreciate rapidly (due to hardware/chip and software advancements), the question remains which vision of the future will win out in the end to become the dominant AI provider for the world. Or maybe it will always be a multiplicity of models each with a smaller market share? That’s followed by more extensive evaluations and safety assessments by an extensive network of more than 6,000 nurses and 300 doctors, who will confirm that it passes all required safety tests. Once the AI agent is up and running, the clinicians who created it will be able to claim a share of the revenue it generates from the startup’s customers. Currently the technology is being used by Under Armour, MCM Worldwide, Gruppo Teddy and Li & Fung to create and iterate apparel, footwear and accessories styles. The company’s existing investors Greycroft, Correlation Ventures and MVP Ventures also joined in the round, along with notable angel investors, including Gokul Rajaram and Ken Pilot. Clearly, even as he espouses a commitment to open source AI, Zuck is not convinced that DeepSeek’s approach of optimizing for efficiency while leveraging far fewer GPUs than major labs is the right one for Meta, or for the future of AI. Raspberry AI secures 24 million US dollars in funding round Story is the world’s intellectual property blockchain, transforming IP into networks that transcend mediums and platforms, unleashing global creativity and liquidity. By integrating Stability AI’s advanced models, Story is taking a significant step toward building a fair and sustainable internet for creators and developers in the age of generative AI. Hippocratic AI said it’s necessary to have clinicians onboard because they have, over the course of their careers, developed deep expertise in their respective fields, as well as the practical insights to help cure specific medical conditions and the clinical workflows involved. Investing in Raspberry AI – Andreessen Horowitz Investing in Raspberry AI. Posted: Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:00:00 GMT [ source ] Story aims to bridge this gap by combining Stability AI’s cutting-edge technology with blockchain’s ability to secure digital property rights. For example, creators could register unique styles or voices as intellectual property on Story with transparent usage terms. This would enable others to train and fine-tune AI models using this IP, ensuring that all contributors in the creative chain benefit when outputs are monetized. One click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said Hippocratic AI is bringing two of the leading technology trends to the healthcare industry, namely no-code or low-code software development and AI agents. The launch is a bold step forward in healthcare innovation, giving clinicians the opportunity to participate in the design of AI agents that can address various aspects of patient care. It says clinicians can create an AI agent prototype that specializes in their area of focus in less than 30 minutes, and around three to four hours to develop one that can be tested. Shah said the last nine months since the company’s previous $50 million funding round have seen it make tremendous progress. During that time, it has received its first U.S. patents, fully evaluated and verified the safety of its first AI healthcare agents, and signed contracts with 23 health systems, payers and pharma clients. For instance, one of its AI agents is specialized in chronic care management, medication checks and post-discharge follow-up regarding specific conditions such as kidney failure and congestive heart failure. The healthcare-focused artificial intelligence startup Hippocratic AI Inc. said today it has closed on a $141 million Series B funding round that brings its total amount raised to more than $278 million. “This round of financing will accelerate the development and deployment of the Hippocratic generative AI-driven super staffing and continue our quest to make healthcare abundance a reality,” he promised. Raspberry AI, the generative AI platform for fashion creatives, has secured 24 million US dollars in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Today, we’re going in-depth on blockchain innovation with Robert Roose, an entrepreneur who’s on a mission to fix today’s broken monetary system. Hippocratic AI’s early customers include Arkos Health Inc., Belong Health Inc., Cincinnati Children’s, Fraser Health Authority (Canada), GuideHealth, Honor Health, Deca Dental Management, LLC, OhioHealth, WellSpan Health and other well-known healthcare systems and hospitals. By incorporating this wisdom into its AI agents, it’s making them safer and improving patient outcomes, it said. Crucially, any agent created using its platform will undergo extensive safety training by both the creator and Hippocratic AI’s own staff. Every clinician will have access to a dashboard to track their AI agent’s performance and use and receive feedback for further development. All these indicate the commitment a16z has in shaping the future of technology and healthcare through strategic investments. Both platforms use Stability AI’s models to bring creators’ visions to life and Story’s blockchain technology to enable provenance and attribution throughout the creative process. These real-world applications highlight how creators can safeguard their intellectual property while thriving in a shared creative economy. Raspberry AI offers brands and manufacturing creative teams technology solutions, which can help accelerate each stage of the fashion product development cycle to increase speed to market and profitability while reducing costs. Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z, is one of the leading AI investors and targets only innovative startups. They participated in the round that funded Anysphere on January 14, 2025, with a total sum of $105 million for an AI coding tool known as Cursor, whose valuation has reached $2.5 billion. Onyxcoin (XCN) Market Trends and Ozak AI’s Contribution to AI-Driven Blockchain In order to ensure its AI agents can do their jobs safely, Hippocratic AI says it only works with licensed clinicians to develop them, taking steps to verify their qualifications and experience first. Once clinicians have built their agents, they’ll be submitted to the startup for an initial round of testing. Through the Hippocratic AI Agent App Store, healthcare organizations and hospitals will be able to access a range of specialized AI agents for different aspects of medical care. The startup was co-founded by Chief Executive Officer and serial entrepreneur Munjal Shah and a group of physicians, hospital administrators, healthcare professionals and AI researchers from organizations including El Camino Health LLC, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University, Microsoft Corp., Google and Nvidia Corp. PIP Labs, an initial core contributor to the Story Network, is backed by investors including a16z crypto, Endeavor, and Polychain. Co-founded by a serial entrepreneur with a $440M exit and DeepMind’s youngest PM, PIP Labs boasts a veteran founding executive team with expertise in consumer tech, generative AI, and Web3 infrastructure. The startup has also created other AI agents for tasks like pre- and post-surgery wound care, extreme heat wave preparation, home health checks, diabetes screening and education, and many more besides. The startup said its AI Agent creators include Dr. Vanessa Dorismond MD, MA, MAS, a distinguished obstetrician and gynecologist at El Camino Women’s Medical Group and Teal Health, who helped to create an AI agent that’s focused on cervical cancer check-ins and enhancing patient education. According to the startup, the objective of these AI agents is to try and solve the massive shortage of trained nurses, social workers and nutritionists in the healthcare industry, both in the U.S. and globally. TechBullion The same day, a16z also led a Series A investment in Slingshot AI, which has raised a total of $40 million to create a foundation model for psychology. Those investments highlight the commitment of the group to using AI to address important issues and are also focusing on how AI can improve different industries, including healthcare and consumer services. In general, a16z is committed to supporting AI innovations that could have a profound impact on society. We are thrilled to see our models used in Story’s blockchain technology to ensure proper attribution and reward contributors,” said Scott Trowbridge, Vice President of Stability AI. Others include Kacie Spencer, DNP, RN, the chief nursing officer at Adtalem Global Education Inc., who has more than 20 years of experience in emergency nursing and clinical education. Her AI agent is focused on patient education for the proper installation of child car seats. It participated in an Anysphere round that had the company raising $105 million on January 14, 2025, when it pushed the valuation up to $2.5 billion. Beyond this, it has also released a $500 million Biotech Ecosystem Venture Fund with Eli Lilly to place a focus on health technologies, but with the aspect of innovative applications. On the same day, they led a Series A investment in Slingshot AI, a company that’s developing advanced generative AI technology for mental health. Additionally, a16z invested in Raspberry AI to bring generative AI to the front of fashion design and production. In December 2024, they envisioned a future in which AI was used aggressively in nearly all sectors.

Core Scientific shares were 18% lower, trading around $14.75 at publication time. CoreWeave stock was down 5%. While the deal offers CoreWeave strategic benefits, cutting over $10 billion in lease obligations and unlocking more than $500 million in annual cost savings by 2027, KBW views it as an opportunistic move, capitalizing on CRWV’s 295% post-IPO rally, the bank said in a report on Monday. ""While we view this as an opportunistic attempt by CRWV to capitalize on recent stock appreciation, the reaction signals disappointment and potential disagreement to the deal terms,"" wrote analyst Bill Papanastasiou. Under the terms of the agreement, Core Scientific shareholders will receive 0.1235 CoreWeave shares for each share held, valuing the business at around $9 billion. The deal requires approval from Core Scientific shareholders and is expected to close in Q4 2025. Core Scientific shareholders may push back on the terms of the deal, the analyst noted, given the unchanged asset base since CRWV’s first failed bid and lack of a cash component. The ""shareholder vote may see friction."" Still, with no competing offer expected, the deal is likely to proceed, the report said. KBW has an ""outperform"" rating on Core Scientific shares with a $19 price target. Rival Wall Street firm Bernstein noted the drop in the Core Scientific share price after the deal was announced and said ""shareholders were probably expecting a higher valuation,"" and ""investors were disappointed with an all stock deal.""

2025-07-07T19:00:41,"Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350","Ethereum is approaching a pivotal moment as it pushes to reclaim the $2,600 level, aiming to break free from weeks of sideways action. After trading within a tight range since early May, ETH is now testing the upper boundary of its consolidation zone, a move that could mark the start of a new bullish phase for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Market participants are closely watching this level, as a successful breakout above $2,600 would likely attract momentum buyers and confirm renewed strength across the altcoin sector. However, the breakout is far from guaranteed. If bulls fail to sustain this move, Ethereum could face renewed selling pressure, with price potentially revisiting lower support zones. According to Coinglass data, liquidity clusters are clearly defined at $2,800 and $2,350. These levels will likely act as magnets in the coming days, depending on how Ethereum responds to current resistance. A clean break toward $2,800 would confirm bullish intent and broader altcoin surges, while a rejection could reinforce bearish sentiment. Ethereum’s Next Move Could Ignite Altseason Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but bullish momentum is quietly building. Ethereum, the leader of the altcoin market, has been consolidating in a well-defined range between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. This prolonged sideways action has kept much of the altcoin sector in a state of indecision. Now, traders and analysts agree: Ethereum must break out to lead the next major move. Market analyst Ted Pillows identifies two key liquidity levels for ETH: $2,800 on the upside and $2,350 on the downside. These zones represent the most likely destinations for price in the short term, depending on which side of the range breaks first. If Ethereum pushes above $2,800 with strength, it would likely trigger renewed risk appetite and a broad-based altcoin rally. On the other hand, a breakdown below $2,350 could lead to deeper corrections across the board. So far, bulls have defended the $2,500 level well, and growing open interest suggests that investors are positioning for an expansion. A decisive breakout in either direction will resolve weeks of consolidation and determine the short-term trend. Until then, Ethereum remains the gatekeeper of altcoin momentum—its next move could define the path for the entire market. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Resistance Amid Range-Bound Structure Ethereum is currently trading at $2,563, hovering just below the $2,600 mark, a level that has acted as short-term resistance throughout June and early July. As shown in the 12-hour chart, ETH has been trapped in a horizontal consolidation structure between $2,400 and $2,700, with multiple failed attempts to break either side convincingly. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs), which is a positive signal for bulls. The 100 SMA at $2,532 and the 200 SMA at $2,206 have offered strong dynamic support during recent pullbacks, reinforcing the current uptrend structure. Volume remains moderate, suggesting that market participants are waiting for a clear breakout before entering with conviction. A decisive close above $2,600 would open the door for a move toward $2,800, where large liquidity clusters have been identified by Coinglass. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook However, failure to maintain this short-term momentum could push ETH back toward the $2,400 support zone.

Metaplanet bought the Bitcoin for an average purchase price of around $108,237 per BTC for a total spend of $238.7 million as it continues its aggressive acquisition spree. Metaplanet’s latest investment brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately $1.69 billion based on current market prices, securing its position as Asia’s most audacious corporate Bitcoin adopter.

(@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 According to data tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the Tokyo-listed investment company now ranks as the fifth biggest corporate holder of the world’s largest crypto after recently overtaking Tesla , CleanSpark, and Galaxy Digital . Metaplanet is only trailing behind large crypto firms, such as MARA, Riot, and Strategy. Metaplanet, which rebranded in 2024 from a hotel and technology firm to a dedicated Bitcoin treasury, recently announced that it is looking to accumulate 210,000 BTC, or about 1% of the 21 million supply, by 2027 as it aims to become one of the world’s largest Bitcoin Treasury companies. The firm’s latest BTC buy comes at a time when more companies are looking to invest in the benchmark crypto, partly as a way of boosting their share prices. Over 142 publicly traded firms hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as of publication time. They have raked up a combined $92 billion of the alpha crypto, with Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy’s stockpile roughly two-thirds of that amount. Strategy currently holds over $64 billion worth of Bitcoin .

2025-07-07T18:45:43,"Goldman Sachs Flips Bearish on US Treasury Yields, Forecasts Fed Rate Cuts Sooner Than Expected: Report","Market strategists at banking giant Goldman Sachs have reportedly lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. In a report seen by Bloomberg , analysts, including George Cole, say that they’re lowering their end-of-year targets for yields and are revising their expectations for Fed cuts in 2025. The analysts say that they see the two and 10-year yields ending 2025 at 3.45% and 4.20%, respectively, dropping from their initial call of 3.85% and 4.50%. Meanwhile, Goldman’s economists originally believed that the Fed would only achieve one rate cut near the end of the year, but are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. Even though strong labor numbers challenged the analysts’ forecast, the Goldman analysts are standing firm on their call, noting that the strong data was distorted by the outsized figure of government hiring and a decline in the labor participation rate. “A benign path to lower short-term rates can dilute a potential source of additional fiscal risk premia and improve the economic appeal [of owning Treasuries.] We see scope for deeper cuts to support lower yields than previously envisioned.” The Financial Times reports that $11 billion in long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt have been dumped in just three months. The Q2 2025 sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off happening back in the second quarter of 2022. Source: The Financial Times PGIM’s top fixed-income strategist, Robert Tipp, says the shift shows investors are wary of rising inflation and increasing government debt. “It’s a volatile environment, with inflation still above target and heavy government supply as far as the eye can see. This is driving a skittishness about the long end of the yield curve, and a general uneasiness.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 The so-called America Party was formed out of a public rift between Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’, which Musk has called a “disgusting abomination,” claiming it would erode millions of jobs in the US and cause “immense strategic harm” to the nation. This particular bill is estimated to add a whopping $3.3 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade. Musk questioned Trump’s rationale for forming the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an extra-governmental agency that sought to reduce the US national debt, if he was going to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars. Musk’s Relationship With Crypto Musk’s relationship with cryptocurrencies is well-documented, with SpaceX and Tesla both holding BTC on their corporate treasuries. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in early 2021, making it one of the first publicly listed companies to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The EV maker currently holds 11,509 BTC , worth approximately $1.2 billion, making it the eighth-largest publicly traded company to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. Bitcoin OG Adam Back recently suggested that Musk should buy 1 million in BTC to “front-run the US government and the Trump family” in their ongoing feud. While Musk already owns some Bitcoin, Back believes that the eccentric centibillionaire’s current allocation is too low for his enormous net worth. The X owner has also been a Dogecoin evangelist over the years. His obsession with shitposting helped boost the biggest and oldest meme coin to a top 10 cryptocurrency. Interestingly, Musk even called himself the “ Dogefather ” ahead of a “Saturday Night Live” skit about the cryptocurrency back in 2021 — sending the coin’s price rocketing higher. DOGE would jump to its current record high price of $0.73 at this time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-asserts-fiat-is-hopeless-confirms-his-new-america-party-will-embrace-bitcoin/,"BTC|FIAT|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

In a new YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen tells his 904,000 subscribers that a Bitcoin price dip below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) on the weekly timeframe may mark the end of the bull cycle based on historic precedent. “ So long as the 50-week SMA holds, the structure of the mark remains intact. A weekly close below that would call things into question… In this case, we have an indicator that should tell us that the cycle is over whenever we get these weekly closes below the 50-week moving average. It hasn’t happened yet. Now, where is the 50-week SMA? Right now, it’s at around $86,000. It’s between $85,000 and $86,000.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also says that Bitcoin may test the 50-week SMA in the third quarter of 2025 but hold it as support, indicating the bull cycle may continue. “The argument in this case is that as long as we’re above that [50-week SMA], then the structure of the market, the integrity of the cycle, is intact.

2025-07-07T18:17:54,"XRP Proponent Claims Ripple Is a U.S. Government Agency, Shares Proofs","A provocative theory shared by XRP proponent Edo Farina has stirred debate in the crypto space. According to Farina, Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP token, may not be just a private fintech enterprise but a possible extension of U.S. intelligence infrastructure. He supports this claim by highlighting corporate trademark histories, overlapping personnel, and early domain registrations tied to Ripple Communications and OpenCoin. A Trademark Trail from 1991 The foundation of Farina’s argument lies in trademark records. “Ripple Communications, Inc.” was incorporated in Nevada on March 21, 1991—17 years before Bitcoin’s white paper. Public records show that Ripple Labs , Inc., the entity known today for developing XRP, currently holds the trademark originally belonging to Ripple Communications. That trademark was transferred through OpenCoin, Inc.—Ripple Labs’ former name before rebranding. This raises an immediate question: why would a crypto startup inherit trademarks and branding from a 1991 telecom company? While the connection could appear coincidental, Farina insists it hints at a deeper institutional lineage. RIPPLE IS A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY. $XRP The truth behind @Ripple , INSA, and intelligence contractors , and why Ryan Fugger is the key. Ryan Fugger claims the name “Ripple” came from a Grateful Dead song. But the real story? It traces back to U.S. intelligence ties, secret… pic.twitter.com/yyQTmBmD9q — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 7, 2025 Early Digital Footprints and INSA Overlap According to Farina, three key domains—RipplePay, RippleCom, and OpenCoin—were all launched in 2005, reportedly hosted under the same IP block. This was also the year the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) underwent reorganization. Farina suggests that this timeline convergence indicates the quiet development of a broader intelligence-linked fintech infrastructure. Supporting this idea is the involvement of Karen Nussle, listed as a principal at Ripple Communications. The uploaded image shows that she was also listed as a press contact at INSA, using an “@insaonline.org” email address. This strongly suggests a crossover between Ripple Communications and the U.S. intelligence policy space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Suzanne Heckenberg and the Disappearing Entity Another key figure cited is Suzanne Wilson Heckenberg, now President of INSA. According to INSA’s website, she served as Vice President of Marketing for Ripple Communications from September 2010 to October 2012. Her departure coincided with a significant transition: that same month, Ripple.com was acquired, and the Ripple Communications trademark changed hands, eventually ending up under Ripple Labs. After this point, Ripple Communications seemingly disappeared from public records. To Farina, the sequence is too aligned to ignore. He suggests Ripple Communications may have acted as a shell company or soft-launch vehicle for a government-aligned financial infrastructure, later consolidated under Ripple Labs. What Happened to Ryan Fugger? Farina also casts doubt on the official story surrounding Ryan Fugger, the original mind behind RipplePay . Fugger once claimed that the name “Ripple” was inspired by a Grateful Dead song. But if Ripple Communications predates his work by over a decade, and already held the trademark, Farina argues that Fugger’s explanation may have been a public narrative masking institutional involvement. Fugger’s quiet exit from the project only fuels further suspicion. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-07-07T18:15:52,"Ethereum Eyes 16.7M Gas Cap Under Vitalik Buterin’s New Proposal","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter have proposed a ceiling on how much gas a single transaction can use, and aim to tighten security while preserving efficiency as the protocol matures. The draft proposal, EIP-7983, sets a 16.77 million gas limit per transaction. Interestingly, this is a significant change from the current architecture, where a single transaction can consume an entire block’s gas allowance. Developers argue this open-ended design exposes Ethereum to denial-of-service (DoS) risks, inconsistent network load, and slower block verification, especially as the chain supports increasingly complex DeFi and zero-knowledge applications. EIP-7983 By introducing a hard cap, Buterin and Wahrstätter seek to enforce more predictable resource usage without significantly disrupting typical user activity, noting that most transactions currently fall well below the proposed threshold. Transactions of more than the 16.77 million gas cap would be rejected during validation. Such a move would ensure oversized transactions cannot enter blocks, while the block gas limit itself would remain adjustable by validators under existing consensus rules. The authors frame the move as part of a broader effort to simplify Ethereum’s base layer and improve network reliability, which essentially echoes Buterin’s recent calls to streamline protocol design inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist ethos. Easing zkVM Constraints Developers working on zkVMs and parallel execution engines have highlighted difficulties in handling transactions with unpredictable gas sizes. They believe a fixed ceiling could ease engineering constraints and allow better subdivision of workloads across threads. The cap is also expected to reduce the risk of any single transaction monopolizing block resources, thereby improving consistency in execution times and block propagation. While the proposed limit may require some large deployments to split transactions into smaller segments, it aligns with Ethereum’s longer-term goal of supporting modular and provable systems while maintaining user experience. EIP-7983 builds on the now-stagnant EIP-7825 but with a lower ceiling. The proposal is currently in draft status and is now open for community discussion as developers assess its practical impact on the network.

2025-07-07T18:06:08,"Strategy Pauses Bitcoin Buying, Focuses on New Funding Channels","Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, had paused its Bitcoin purchases between June 30 and July 6. As revealed in a new filing, this marks the first time the software intelligence firm has not added to its holdings since early April. Despite the pause, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy Holds Over $65B in Bitcoin As of July 6, Strategy holds 597,325 BTC, valued at over $65 billion. The average purchase price for these coins is approximately $70,982, with a total acquisition cost of around $42.4 billion. This puts the company’s unrealized profit at roughly $22.6 billion. Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings now represent about 2.8% of the total 21 million Bitcoin supply. The pause in Bitcoin purchases comes after a period of aggressive acquisitions. The Virginia-based company had bought 4,980 BTC for $531.9 million between June 23 and June 29. However, the pace has slowed in recent weeks. This comes as the firm shifted focus from selling common stock to offering perpetual preferred stock to raise capital . In late June, Strategy raised $6.8 billion through its at-the-market equity programs, which included sales of Class A common stock and various types of preferred shares. Strategy’s Long-Term Bitcoin Plan Expands, Draws Mixed Views The company’s capital raising efforts support a long-term plan called the “42/42” program, which aims to raise $84 billion for Bitcoin acquisitions by 2027. This is double the original target under the earlier “21/21” plan. To date, Strategy has raised billions by selling shares and convertible notes, with additional funds still available through its ongoing programs. Furthermore, the firm’s market value has reached $110 billion, which is significantly higher than the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. Some analysts believe this premium is justified due to the company’s strong equity-to-Bitcoin cycle. Others, however, have raised concerns about a possible negative feedback loop from overdependence on Bitcoin valuations. A recent class action lawsuit also claims that Strategy misled investors about its Bitcoin strategy. Quarterly Results Reflect Strong Bitcoin Gains Strategy recently released its second-quarter results. It reported an unrealized gain of $14.05 billion on its BTC holdings. During the second quarter, Strategy also entered into a loan agreement allowing it to borrow up to $31.1 million for capital purchases. Meanwhile, other companies like Metaplanet are adopting similar Bitcoin strategies . Tether-backed Twenty One, Trump Media, and GameStop are among other new entrants following this trend. Following this news, Strategy’s stock closed at $403.99, up by 0.4% on July 5. As of Monday morning, the shares dropped slightly in pre-market trading but are still up by over 34% this year.

2025-07-07T18:05:38,"Citibank Raises Price Target for One Tech Stock That’s in Global Race for AI Infrastructure: Report","Traders at Citi are building conviction for a “Magnificent 7” stock that they say is competing in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. The bank says that a major bump in the demand for AI infrastructure, especially sovereign governments looking to build national plants, is bullish for Nvidia (NVDA), Yahoo Finance reports . Say Citi analysts Atif Malik and Papa Syll, “We believe sovereign demand is already contributing up to billions of dollars in 2025 [and will rise more in 2026].” The analysts note that “essentially every sovereign deal” involves Nvidia, putting the company in a central position in the race for AI infrastructure. “Nvidia has line of sight to tens of gigawatts of sovereign and enterprise AI factory buildouts over the next few years.” Citi is forecasting a 5% growth in Nvidia’s revenue for fiscal year 2027, and 11% in 2028, and has currently raised its price target for NVDA to $190, a 20% rally from current prices. In a recent interview with CNBC, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that despite the tariff war and geopolitical uncertainty, retail investors had been using the trading platform to accumulate most of the classic favorites as before, one of which was NVDA. “And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years. So I would interpret it as retail is sort of moving on ahead investing.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-07T18:00:30,"Bit Digital’s Astounding Pivot: Why Ethereum Staking is the Future for This Crypto Miner","BitcoinWorld Bit Digital’s Astounding Pivot: Why Ethereum Staking is the Future for This Crypto Miner In a move that’s sending ripples through the cryptocurrency world, U.S. Bitcoin miner Bit Digital (Nasdaq: BTBT) has announced a significant strategic shift. The company recently sold 280 BTC, redirecting the proceeds to acquire additional Ethereum, boosting its ETH holdings to an impressive 100,603 ETH. This isn’t just a simple asset reallocation; it signals a fundamental change in Bit Digital’s operational focus, moving away from traditional Bitcoin mining towards the burgeoning world of Ethereum staking and reserves. What does this mean for the future of crypto mining, and why are companies like Bit Digital making such bold decisions? Bit Digital’s Astounding Strategic Pivot: Why the Shift? The news from Bit Digital isn’t just about selling one asset to buy another; it’s a clear indication of a long-term strategic re-evaluation. The company had previously signaled its intention to scale back its Bitcoin mining operations, a business historically defined by intense competition, significant energy consumption, and substantial hardware investment. Their new direction, as reported by Jin10.com, points squarely towards Ethereum staking and building up their ETH reserves. But what drives such a dramatic change for a company synonymous with Bitcoin mining? Several factors likely play into this pivot: Evolving Market Dynamics: The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly shifting. With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via The Merge, the entire ecosystem around ETH has changed, opening new avenues for revenue generation beyond energy-intensive mining. Operational Efficiency: Bitcoin mining is resource-heavy, requiring massive capital expenditure on ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and significant ongoing energy costs. Ethereum staking, on the other hand, offers a potentially more capital-efficient and environmentally friendly way to earn returns on digital assets. Revenue Stability: While mining rewards are subject to network difficulty and Bitcoin’s price volatility, staking can offer more predictable yields, providing a steadier income stream for companies looking to de-risk their operations. Future Growth Potential: Bit Digital may see greater long-term growth and stability in the Ethereum ecosystem, especially as its utility expands with various decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. From Pickaxe to Protocol: The Evolution of Bitcoin Mining For years, Bitcoin mining has been the bedrock of the crypto industry, a process essential for securing the network and validating transactions. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, and the first one to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain and earn newly minted Bitcoin. This Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has been incredibly robust, but it comes with its own set of challenges: Energy Consumption: PoW mining is notoriously energy-intensive, drawing criticism for its environmental impact. This has led to increasing regulatory scrutiny and public pressure. Hardware Dependency: Miners must constantly invest in the latest, most powerful mining rigs, which can be expensive and quickly become obsolete. Centralization Concerns: The sheer cost of entry can lead to mining operations becoming concentrated in the hands of a few large entities or pools, raising decentralization concerns. Price Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is directly tied to the price of BTC. Sharp market downturns can quickly turn profitable operations into loss-making ones. Bit Digital’s decision highlights a growing trend among some miners to explore alternatives or diversify their operations beyond pure PoW mining. This isn’t to say Bitcoin mining is dead, but rather that the industry is maturing, and companies are seeking more sustainable and diversified revenue models. Embracing the Future: The Promise of Ethereum Staking In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work, Ethereum has fully transitioned to Proof-of-Stake, a mechanism where participants (validators) ‘stake’ their ETH as collateral to validate transactions and secure the network. In return, they earn rewards. This is where Ethereum staking comes into play as a compelling alternative for companies like Bit Digital. Here’s why staking is gaining traction: Energy Efficiency: Staking consumes significantly less energy than mining, making it a more environmentally friendly option and aligning with growing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment trends. Passive Income: Stakers earn a yield on their locked ETH, providing a relatively stable and predictable source of income, unlike the more variable nature of mining rewards. Reduced Hardware Costs: Staking requires minimal hardware compared to mining, significantly reducing capital expenditure and ongoing maintenance costs. Network Security: Stakers are incentivized to act honestly, as malicious behavior can lead to their staked ETH being ‘slashed’ (penalized). Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin Mining (PoW) Ethereum Staking (PoS) Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Resource Requirement High energy, specialized hardware (ASICs) ETH capital, minimal hardware Environmental Impact High Low Revenue Source Block rewards (new BTC), transaction fees Staking rewards (ETH) Entry Barrier High (capital for hardware, energy access) Lower (32 ETH for solo, less for pools) Diversifying the Crypto Portfolio: What This Means for Bit Digital By selling a substantial portion of its Bitcoin and investing heavily in Ethereum, Bit Digital is fundamentally reshaping its crypto portfolio . This move isn’t just about switching one digital asset for another; it’s about altering the core business model from a capital-intensive, hardware-dependent operation to one focused on yield generation through asset management and validation services. For Bit Digital, this could mean: Improved Financial Metrics: Potentially higher profit margins due to lower operational costs, and more predictable revenue streams from staking rewards. Enhanced Risk Management: Diversifying away from a sole reliance on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty could cushion the company against market downturns specific to PoW mining. Strategic Positioning: Bit Digital positions itself as an early mover in the institutional Ethereum staking space, potentially attracting new investors interested in sustainable crypto operations. Asset Growth: With 100,603 ETH, Bit Digital has a significant base from which to generate substantial staking rewards, further growing its Ethereum holdings. This shift reflects a mature understanding of the evolving digital asset landscape and a proactive approach to adapting business strategies to new opportunities. Broader Implications for Digital Assets: A Shifting Landscape? Bit Digital’s pivot is not an isolated incident; it’s a strong signal within the broader world of digital assets . As the crypto industry matures, companies are increasingly looking for sustainable and diversified revenue models. Ethereum’s successful transition to Proof-of-Stake has opened up a new frontier for institutional participation, moving beyond just holding assets to actively participating in network security and earning yields. This trend could lead to several significant implications: Increased Institutional Staking: More traditional mining companies or even new players might follow Bit Digital’s lead, boosting the amount of ETH staked and further securing the Ethereum network. Environmental Focus: The emphasis on energy efficiency in PoS could put more pressure on PoW networks like Bitcoin to address their environmental footprint, potentially accelerating innovation in green mining solutions. Evolution of Crypto Business Models: We might see a proliferation of hybrid models, where companies engage in both traditional mining and staking, or even fully transition to staking-as-a-service providers. Investor Sentiment: This strategic shift could influence how investors view crypto companies, favoring those with more diversified, sustainable, and yield-generating operations. While Bitcoin mining remains a vital component of the crypto ecosystem, the rise of Ethereum staking presents a compelling alternative that many are beginning to explore seriously. Bit Digital is simply at the forefront of this potential paradigm shift. Challenges and Considerations for the Transition While the move to Ethereum staking offers numerous benefits, it’s not without its challenges. Bit Digital will need to navigate complexities such as: Smart Contract Risks: Staking often involves interacting with smart contracts, which, despite rigorous auditing, can carry inherent risks of bugs or vulnerabilities. Slashing Penalties: Validators on the Ethereum network can face penalties (slashing) if they behave maliciously or fail to meet their duties (e.g., prolonged downtime). This requires robust infrastructure and monitoring. Liquidity Management: Staked ETH is locked and may not be immediately accessible, requiring careful liquidity planning, although liquid staking solutions are emerging to mitigate this. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for staking services is still evolving, and companies must stay compliant with new rules. However, the potential rewards of a more stable, less capital-intensive, and environmentally friendlier revenue stream seem to outweigh these challenges for Bit Digital. Actionable Insights for Investors and Other Miners What can we learn from Bit Digital’s bold move? For Investors: Pay attention to how crypto companies are diversifying their revenue streams. Those embracing new, sustainable models like staking might offer more stable long-term growth. Evaluate a company’s entire crypto portfolio, not just its primary mining activity. For Other Miners: This is a wake-up call to explore alternative revenue generation. Consider diversifying your operations, investing in staking, or exploring other yield-generating opportunities within the crypto space. The future of crypto profitability might lie beyond pure PoW. For the Crypto Market: The increasing institutional adoption of staking strengthens the underlying networks and legitimizes these new forms of participation. It’s a sign of a maturing market. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Companies Bit Digital’s strategic pivot from extensive Bitcoin mining to a focus on Ethereum staking and reserves is a landmark decision. It highlights a growing recognition within the industry that sustainable, efficient, and diversified revenue streams are crucial for long-term success in the dynamic world of digital assets. This move not only redefines Bit Digital’s business model but also sets a precedent, signaling a potential broader shift in how crypto companies approach asset management and network participation. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, we can expect more players to explore innovative strategies that leverage the full potential of both established and emerging blockchain technologies.
