While we’ve seen some short-term softness, long-term conviction remains intact. The market is pausing—not panicking. Part of that pause stems from recent comments by Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , who said he’d welcome a major Bitcoin crash. Bitcoin Crash? That’s Exactly What ‘Poor Dad’ Kiyosaki Is Hoping For https://t.co/9Lp6mypiLq — Crypto Brothers (@LosKruptos) July 6, 2025 His reasoning? Buy more . Kiyosaki revealed he purchased BTC above $100,000 and plans to add again on any sharp drop. His price targets remain aggressive—$200,000 by year-end and $1 million within five years.

Institutions Stay Active as ETFs and Treasuries Grow Despite the near-term hesitation, institutional activity has picked up noticeably. Spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $769.6 million last week, according to SoSoValue. That marks four consecutive weeks of inflows, beginning mid-June. On the corporate side, Japan’s Metaplanet added 2,205 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total to 15,555 BTC.

Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a long-term treasury asset, and consistent accumulation by institutions continues to provide structural support against short-term volatility. Recent accumulation highlights: $769.6 million in spot BTC ETF inflows last week Metaplanet treasury now holds 15,555 BTC Blockchain Group added 116 BTC to its balance sheet The divergence between short-term sentiment and long-term capital is widening. The former is cautious, but the latter is steadily building exposure. Bitcoin Technical Outlook and Macro Pressures Technically, Bitcoin has slipped just below a short-term ascending trendline and the 50-period simple moving average around $108,641. It’s currently hovering near the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $108,482, with RSI neutral around 45. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC loses $108,482 on a closing basis, the following levels to watch are $107,836 and $107,202, which mark the 0.618 retracement. A recovery above $109,267 would bring $109,274 into focus and could signal a bullish continuation. Essential levels to monitor: Support: $108,482, $107,836, $107,202 Resistance: $109,267, $109,274 50-SMA: $108,641 In addition to technical analysis, geopolitical concerns are keeping markets on edge. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated that paused U.S. tariffs could resume on August 1. While not immediate, the uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bottom Line Robert Kiyosaki’s crash call may sound extreme, but it’s consistent with a growing long-term mindset. Institutional flows, ETF demand, and corporate treasury all point to one thing: the smart money is still buying. Whether Bitcoin revisits lower support or breaks above $110,000 again, the fundamentals remain strong. The narrative has shifted from speculation to structure, and that’s a sign of maturity. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised nearly $2 million in its public presale, with $1,980,292 out of a $2,452,414 target.

2025-07-07T13:50:12,"Coinsilium’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Bold Move in Digital Assets","BitcoinWorld Coinsilium’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Bold Move in Digital Assets In the dynamic world of digital assets, every move by a significant player sends ripples across the market. The recent announcement that UK-based Web3 investment firm Coinsilium has purchased an additional 14.9 BTC, bringing its total holdings to a remarkable 88.63 BTC, is more than just a transaction. It’s a strategic declaration of confidence in the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This latest acquisition, reported by @btcNLNico on X, underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking firms: a steadfast commitment to integrating digital assets into their core strategy. But what does this mean for Coinsilium, the market, and the evolving landscape of Web3? Coinsilium Bitcoin: What Does This Latest Acquisition Signify? Coinsilium, a company at the forefront of Web3 innovation, has consistently demonstrated a proactive approach to digital asset investment. Their latest purchase of 14.9 Coinsilium Bitcoin is not an isolated event but rather a continuation of a deliberate strategy to build a robust portfolio. For a firm specializing in Web3 technologies, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin is a testament to their belief in its foundational role within the decentralized economy. Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ serves as a primary store of value in the cryptocurrency space, making it a logical anchor for any serious digital asset investor. This incremental accumulation reflects a long-term perspective, suggesting that Coinsilium views Bitcoin not as a speculative short-term trade, but as a strategic reserve asset. By increasing their Coinsilium Bitcoin holdings, they are strengthening their balance sheet with an asset that has historically appreciated significantly over time, despite its volatility. It signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition and its potential to act as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. What Drives a Web3 Investment Firm to Accumulate BTC? The decision by a Web3 investment firm like Coinsilium to continually add to its Bitcoin reserves is rooted in several key factors that define the ethos and operational philosophy of the Web3 space. Unlike traditional investment firms, Web3 entities are deeply embedded in the decentralized internet, understanding its underlying technologies and potential disruptions. Belief in Decentralization: Bitcoin embodies the core principles of decentralization, which is fundamental to Web3. A firm committed to building the decentralized future naturally aligns with the most decentralized and secure cryptocurrency. Long-Term Value Proposition: Beyond short-term price movements, Bitcoin’s scarcity, global accessibility, and censorship resistance make it an attractive long-term asset. A Web3 investment firm often takes a generational view, seeing Bitcoin as a cornerstone of the future financial system. Strategic Treasury Management: For many companies, holding Bitcoin is becoming a form of treasury management, offering an alternative to traditional cash reserves that might be devalued by inflation. It’s a proactive way to preserve and potentially grow capital. Industry Leadership: By publicly accumulating Bitcoin, firms like Coinsilium set an example, signaling confidence to their peers, partners, and the broader market. It reinforces their position as pioneers in the Web3 domain. For a Web3 investment firm , Bitcoin isn’t just another asset; it’s a foundational element of the digital future they are actively helping to build. Why Are Growing Crypto Holdings So Significant? The increasing trend of companies like Coinsilium expanding their crypto holdings carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and the evolving financial landscape. When publicly traded companies, especially those with a focus on innovation, allocate a substantial portion of their treasury to digital assets, it sends a powerful message of legitimacy and maturation. Firstly, it boosts institutional confidence. As more corporate entities embrace Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it normalizes digital assets within traditional finance. This can encourage other corporations, institutional investors, and even sovereign wealth funds to consider similar strategies, potentially unlocking vast pools of capital for the crypto market. The 88.63 BTC held by Coinsilium, while not on the scale of a MicroStrategy, is a clear signal of their conviction and a testament to the viability of digital assets as part of a corporate balance sheet. Secondly, growing crypto holdings can impact market dynamics. Increased institutional demand reduces the circulating supply of Bitcoin available on exchanges, which, coupled with its fixed supply, can exert upward pressure on its price over the long term. This accumulation strategy reflects a belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to grow as adoption expands and its utility as a global, permissionless asset becomes more evident. Furthermore, it highlights a strategic shift in corporate finance. Companies are moving beyond traditional assets and exploring new avenues for capital preservation and growth in an increasingly digital world. This proactive approach to managing crypto holdings positions them to benefit from the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Bitcoin Accumulation: A Broader Market Trend? Coinsilium’s recent purchase is not an isolated incident but rather a microcosm of a much larger, ongoing trend: widespread Bitcoin accumulation by various entities. From publicly traded corporations to institutional funds and even nation-states, the appetite for Bitcoin as a strategic asset has grown considerably over the past few years. One of the most prominent examples is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC. This pioneering move inspired many others to consider similar strategies. While not every company will go to the same lengths, the idea of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or a growth asset has gained significant traction. Beyond individual corporations, the advent of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions has provided an easier, more regulated pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. These ETFs have seen substantial inflows, further indicating a broad-based institutional desire for Bitcoin accumulation without the complexities of direct custody. This trend suggests a maturing market where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative digital currency, but as a legitimate and essential component of a diversified investment portfolio. It underscores the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset with inherent value that can act as a safe haven during economic uncertainty and a powerful growth engine during periods of innovation. The continued Bitcoin accumulation by diverse players is a strong indicator of its long-term staying power and increasing mainstream acceptance. Coinsilium’s Digital Asset Strategy: What’s Their Long-Term Vision? The consistent increase in Coinsilium’s Bitcoin holdings provides a clear window into their overarching digital asset strategy . As a Web3 investment firm, their vision extends beyond mere trading; it encompasses active participation in and support for the foundational technologies that underpin the decentralized internet. Their strategy appears to be multi-faceted: Building a Strong Reserve: By accumulating Bitcoin, Coinsilium is building a robust and liquid reserve asset. This provides financial stability and flexibility, allowing them to pursue other strategic investments within the Web3 ecosystem. Strategic Investment in Web3 Projects: While Bitcoin forms the bedrock, Coinsilium’s primary focus remains on identifying and investing in promising Web3 projects, startups, and protocols. Their Bitcoin holdings provide the capital base to fund these ventures, from DeFi to NFTs, metaverse, and decentralized infrastructure. Long-Term Growth and Value Creation: Their digital asset strategy is geared towards long-term value creation. They are not chasing fleeting trends but rather investing in assets and technologies they believe will define the next generation of the internet. This includes not only direct asset purchases but also equity investments in Web3 companies. Mitigating Inflationary Risks: In an era of increasing global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, holding a non-sovereign, scarce asset like Bitcoin can be a crucial component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy to protect and grow capital. Coinsilium’s approach serves as a compelling example for other firms considering their entry into the digital asset space. It highlights the importance of a clear, well-defined strategy that balances foundational asset accumulation with targeted investments in emerging technologies. Their actions demonstrate a belief in the transformative power of Web3 and the integral role Bitcoin plays within it. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the benefits of holding Bitcoin are clear, firms like Coinsilium also navigate inherent challenges. Volatility remains a key concern, requiring a robust risk management framework. Regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, demanding vigilance and adaptability. Security of digital assets is paramount, necessitating sophisticated custody solutions. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. The potential for significant capital appreciation, the ability to participate in a rapidly expanding technological frontier, and the strategic advantage of being an early mover in Web3 are compelling incentives. Coinsilium’s continued investment signals a deep understanding of these dynamics. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on the Digital Future Coinsilium’s consistent and strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a powerful statement in the evolving narrative of institutional crypto adoption. Their latest purchase of 14.9 BTC, pushing their total holdings to 88.63 BTC, reinforces their position as a visionary Web3 investment firm . It underscores a clear digital asset strategy focused on long-term value and a profound belief in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational asset in the decentralized economy. This move is more than just an investment; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of finance and technology. As crypto holdings by corporations continue to grow, they pave the way for greater mainstream acceptance and integration of digital assets. Coinsilium is not just observing the future; they are actively investing in and shaping it, demonstrating that strategic foresight and a bold approach are key to thriving in the digital age.

The dramatic turnaround from its software business roots comes as the company simultaneously launched a $4.2 billion STRD preferred stock program to acquire additional Bitcoin. Biggest Bitcoin Gains, Yet Still Buying More The record quarterly gain is attributed to Bitcoin’s price recovery and the Strategy’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08 , effective January 1, 2025. Under the new accounting model, Strategy recognizes fair value changes in Bitcoin holdings as they occur rather than only recording impairment losses. The company incurred $4.04 billion in associated deferred tax expense and holds a $6.31 billion deferred tax liability. Additionally, Strategy announced its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock offering with an aggregate value up to $4.2 billion through an at-the-market program.

Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including additional Bitcoin acquisitions and working capital requirements. As of July 6, 2025, Strategy held 597,325 bitcoins with an aggregate purchase price of $42.40 billion and an average cost of $70,982 per bitcoin. Source: Saylor Tracker During Q2 2025, the company acquired 69,140 bitcoins at a total value of $6.77 billion, funded through multiple equity offerings, including $5.2 billion from common stock ATM programs and $979.7 million from the STRD offering. Capital Markets Activity Fuels Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Strategy received $6.8 billion in aggregate net proceeds from various financing transactions during Q2 2025. The capital raising included $163.1 million from the STRF ATM program, $446.9 million from the STRK ATM program, and $979.7 million from the STRD registered underwritten offering, which was completed on June 10. The company’s 2024 Common ATM program generated $2.4 billion in revenue before its termination, while the new 2025 Common ATM program contributed $2.9 billion. Approximately $18.1 billion of Class A common stock remains available for future issuance under the 2025 program, alongside $20.5 billion of STRK Stock and $1.9 billion of STRF Stock. Strategy’s preferred stock portfolio totals $3.4 billion in notional value with $315.9 million in annual dividends. The company maintains $8.213 billion in convertible notes outstanding, with conversion conditions met for Q3 2025 based on the 130% conversion price threshold. The maximum potential common shares from conversion total 24,439,825 shares. Source: Strategy Report Bitcoin market prices during Q2 ranged from $74,420.69 to $112,000.00, with quarter-end pricing at $107,751.68 on Coinbase. The volatility created substantial fair value fluctuations, contrasting with the $5.91 billion unrealized loss in Q1 2025.

The complaint mentioned the $5.9 billion unrealized loss disclosure in Q1 2025, which triggered an 8% decline in stock price and exposed volatility risks allegedly downplayed by management.

2025-07-07T13:42:10,"It's Time for Ethereum (ETH), Which Lags Behind Bitcoin, to Explode! Analyst Points to This Week!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), which has been lagging behind Bitcoin for a long time and has failed to meet expectations, now seems ready for a big explosion. At this point, one analyst said that the market is going to explode this week and chose Ethereum as the main target. Famous investor Eugene published a positive analysis about Ethereum and stated that he has high expectations for ETH. “A breakout is expected this week and I have chosen Ethereum as my base asset,” Eugene wrote in his analysis on his channel. Ethereum Becomes the Most Undervalued Asset! Eugene cited Ethereum’s low market cap, institutional investment, and correlation with Bitcoin as factors that will drive its growth and explosion. At this point, Eugene, who described Ethereum as the most undervalued asset this year, predicted that Ethereum would also rise when Bitcoin was strong, based on its correlation with Bitcoin, among other factors. “After Ethereum fell from $4,000 to $1,400 this year, no one outside of developers saw it as a major investment target. This means that from a long-term perspective, Ethereum is at its lowest value in the last three years.” However, Eugene stated that traditional finance interest will now shift to Ethereum, saying, “Ethereum will become an investment target for mainstream institutions and traditional financial institutions in the infrastructure and stablecoin sectors.” Bitcoin Could Upgrade Ethereum! Finally, Eugene stated that the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum will be a driving force for ETH, saying, “If Bitcoin exceeds $ 110,000, Ethereum is likely to enter a bull market. Ethereum rarely underperforms when Bitcoin is in an uptrend.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: It's Time for Ethereum (ETH), Which Lags Behind Bitcoin, to Explode!

This time around, the leading treasury company paused its weekly BTC purchases for the first time since early April. Strategy (MSTR) skipped its weekly BTC purchase, instead drawing attention to its Q2 gains. The company’s treasury accounted for $14B in total appreciation for Q2, as BTC recovered to over $109,000. Strategy paused its BTC purchases for the first time in three months, as part of its end-of-quarter adjustment period. For the past week, Strategy did not sell any common or preferred shares. | Source: Bitcoin Treasuries For the quarter ended June 30, Strategy achieved an unrealized gain of $14.06B, incurring a deferred tax expense of $4.04B. The company reported digital asset value of $64.36B. The latest S-8 filing , however, reveals the company paused its weekly purchases. For the last time, Strategy skipped its weekly purchase on April 7, continuing with renewed buying a week later. Until recently, Saylor’s firm did not seem to have any problems buying near the top. However, after a 12-week buying streak, demand for MSTR, STRK, and STRF started to stall, leading to smaller weekly purchases. The recent pause in buying new BTC may also be a normal operation for the company at the end of the quarter. After the latest skipped purchase, Strategy retains enough authorized stocks to buy up to 500K BTC, as its treasury-building may run up to the end of the decade. For now, the firm’s purchases remain viable, as BTC hovers at a relatively high range, with no significant cycle corrections. The market may have anticipated the skipped weekly purchase, leaving MSTR shares with limited change. MSTR traded above $402, recovering earlier losses. Strategy skips weekly BTC purchase The three-month streak for Strategy once again raised questions about its MSTR stock dilution and the issuance of its alternative convertible shares.

After accelerated buying from new corporate treasury firms, MSTR is facing competition in the demand for shares. Other stocks often outperform MSTR, though trading under less liquid conditions and with higher risk of volatility. The skipped weekly purchase coincides with a general boost in smaller additions to treasuries, including those of Metaplanet , The Blockchain Group, the Smart Web Company, and others. Even Semler Scientific added another 187 BTC in one of its sporadic purchases. Even without Saylor’s involvement, IBIT and other corporate buyers take thousands of BTC off the market.

Following this week’s BTC buying hiatus, Strategy announced a new at-the-market program for STRD. The new STRD ATM program intends to raise up to $4.2B over time, depending on market conditions. STRD may be sold and placed by agents and other methods deemed “at the market.” The STRD ATM program will supply funds for general corporate purposes, including new BTC acquisition, as well as for working capital.

2025-07-07T13:40:18,"BBVA Crypto: Spain’s Banking Giant Revolutionizes Retail Access to Bitcoin and Ethereum","BitcoinWorld BBVA Crypto: Spain’s Banking Giant Revolutionizes Retail Access to Bitcoin and Ethereum The financial world is constantly evolving, and a major shift is underway as traditional banking giants embrace the digital asset revolution. In a significant move that signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, Spanish banking powerhouse BBVA has officially opened its doors to the world of digital assets for its retail customers in Spain. This isn’t just another small step; it’s a bold leap, making it easier than ever for everyday individuals to engage with cryptocurrencies directly through their trusted bank. BBVA Crypto: Unlocking Digital Assets for Everyone BBVA, one of Europe’s largest financial institutions, has announced the launch of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading and custody services directly within its mobile banking application for retail customers in Spain. This strategic integration means that users no longer need to navigate complex external crypto exchanges. Instead, they can seamlessly buy, sell, and hold their digital assets right alongside their traditional banking products. The key differentiator here is BBVA’s commitment to self-custody, ensuring that the service is fully integrated within their digital banking platform and independent of third-party custodians. This approach aims to provide a higher level of security and convenience, leveraging the bank’s robust infrastructure and regulatory compliance. The BBVA crypto initiative underscores a pivotal moment for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. The Bitcoin Spain Revolution: What This Means for BTC Holders For years, acquiring Bitcoin in Spain often involved using specialized crypto platforms, which, while effective, sometimes presented a steeper learning curve for new users. BBVA’s new offering dramatically simplifies this process. Retail customers can now access Bitcoin (BTC) directly through an interface they already know and trust – their banking app. This move by a major institution like BBVA lends significant legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially encouraging a broader demographic of investors who might have previously been hesitant due to perceived complexities or security concerns. The ease of access provided by BBVA could significantly boost the number of Bitcoin holders in Spain, contributing to greater liquidity and mainstream acceptance of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This development truly marks a new chapter for Bitcoin Spain , making it more accessible than ever before. Ethereum Spain: Empowering the Smart Contract Ecosystem Beyond Bitcoin, BBVA’s inclusion of Ethereum (ETH) is equally impactful. Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and countless decentralized applications (dApps), represents a different facet of the crypto world. By offering ETH trading and custody, BBVA is not just providing access to a digital currency; it’s indirectly opening a gateway to the broader Web3 ecosystem for its Spanish clientele. This is particularly significant as the Ethereum network continues to evolve, with ongoing upgrades like the upcoming “Dencun” upgrade aiming to enhance scalability and efficiency. The ability for retail customers to easily acquire and hold Ethereum through a regulated banking channel could spur greater participation in the burgeoning DeFi space and foster innovation within the Ethereum Spain community. It signals a recognition of Ethereum’s foundational role in the future of digital finance. Crypto Banking Spain: A New Era of Financial Integration BBVA’s foray into crypto services for retail customers in Spain is part of a larger global trend where traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring and adopting digital assets. This shift is driven by growing client demand, the potential for new revenue streams, and the recognition of blockchain technology’s transformative power. For crypto banking Spain , this move by BBVA sets a precedent. While some banks have launched similar services for institutional clients, offering it directly to retail customers via a mobile app is a significant step towards mainstream integration. This development highlights a strategic pivot for banks, moving from a cautious, wait-and-see approach to actively participating in the digital asset market. It also poses questions about how other Spanish banks will respond, potentially leading to a competitive landscape that benefits consumers with more choices and innovative services. The integration of crypto within traditional banking frameworks aims to provide the best of both worlds: the innovation and potential of digital assets combined with the security and regulatory compliance of established financial institutions. Why Retail Crypto Trading Through Banks? Unpacking the Benefits and Challenges The decision by BBVA to offer retail crypto trading services directly through its banking app comes with a host of advantages for the everyday user, but also presents unique challenges that both the bank and its customers must navigate. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone considering entering the digital asset space via traditional financial institutions. Key Benefits for Customers: Simplified Access: For many, the traditional banking app is a familiar and trusted interface. Integrating crypto services here significantly lowers the barrier to entry, making it easier for new investors to buy, sell, and hold digital assets without needing to learn a new platform. Enhanced Security & Trust: Banks operate under stringent regulatory frameworks, offering robust cybersecurity measures, internal controls, and often deposit protection for traditional funds. This provides a layer of trust and perceived security that many independent crypto exchanges may not offer, reducing concerns about hacks or fraud. Convenience & Integration: Users can manage their traditional bank accounts and digital asset portfolios from a single, unified interface. This streamlines financial management, making it more convenient to monitor investments and move funds between fiat and crypto. Regulatory Compliance: Trading through a regulated bank means that transactions adhere to strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, providing a clearer, more legitimate pathway for crypto engagement within the established financial system. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Limited Asset Selection: Banks often start with a limited selection of highly liquid and well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This might not satisfy investors looking for exposure to a wider range of altcoins or emerging projects. Custody vs. Control: While banks offer custody, users might not have direct control over their private keys, which is a core tenet of the decentralized crypto ethos (“not your keys, not your crypto”). This means relying on the bank for asset security rather than self-custody. Fees and Pricing: Transaction fees and pricing models might differ from dedicated crypto exchanges. Users should carefully review these structures to ensure competitive rates. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite steps towards clarity, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Banks must continuously adapt to new rules, which can impact service offerings. User Education: While access is simplified, understanding the inherent volatility, market risks, and technological nuances of cryptocurrencies remains vital. Banks have a responsibility to provide comprehensive educational resources. Navigating these benefits and challenges will be key for both BBVA and its customers as they embark on this new financial journey, shaping the future of integrated financial services. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Digital Assets in Banking? BBVA’s pioneering step in Spain could serve as a blueprint for other European and global banks. As demand for digital assets continues to grow, more financial institutions are likely to follow suit, offering integrated crypto services. We might see an expansion of supported cryptocurrencies, the introduction of crypto-backed lending, or even seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, all within the familiar and secure environment of a banking app. The future of finance appears to be a hybrid model, where traditional banking infrastructure coexists and increasingly merges with the innovative capabilities of blockchain and digital assets. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Mainstream Crypto Adoption BBVA’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading and custody services for retail customers in Spain is more than just a new product offering; it’s a significant milestone in the journey towards mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. By bringing digital assets into the secure and regulated environment of traditional banking, BBVA is not only meeting growing consumer demand but also building trust and legitimacy for the entire crypto ecosystem. This move demystifies crypto, making it accessible to millions who might otherwise have remained on the sidelines. It heralds a new era where digital assets are no longer niche investments but an integrated part of everyday financial life, truly transforming how individuals interact with their money and the broader digital economy. This is a game-changer, setting a powerful precedent for the future of finance.

Moreover, companies like Metaplanet are actively accumulating Bitcoin, raising expectations for its price. On the Ethereum front, the fundamentals are strengthening, while Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL signals positive developments for XRP. As the week unfolds, all eyes will be on these cryptocurrencies to see if they can capitalize on the current momentum and regulatory environment. Bitcoin (BTC): Current Status : Holding just below $108500 and it is consolidating above a breakout point in a flag pattern. Recent Performance : Bitcoin’s price has risen by 3% over the last week and 8.5% over the last two weeks. It is currently down 1.91% from its 7-day high of $110,590. Market Sentiment: Bullish, driven by strong corporate and institutional demand and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Indicators like the daily RSI at 55, above the median line, CMF at 0.11, AO histogram rising, and MACD displaying bullish crossover suggest continued upward momentum.

Outlook : A move above $2,695 could spark upward momentum, potentially testing resistance at $2,872 or even reaching $2,800–$3,100. However, failure to break through $2,695 could lead to a retest of support levels around $2,455 or $2,185 to –$2,233.

2025-07-07T13:30:19,"Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling the Dominant Keywords in K-Community Last Week","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling the Dominant Keywords in K-Community Last Week South Korea’s cryptocurrency market is a vibrant and influential force in the global digital asset landscape. Often seen as a bellwether for retail sentiment and emerging narratives, understanding the pulse of the **Korean crypto trends** can offer invaluable insights for investors worldwide. Every week, the discussions and searches within the local community, often referred to as the K-Community, provide a fascinating snapshot of what’s capturing attention. This report delves into the most searched for and mentioned tokens within the K-Community of Bitcoin World between June 27 and July 3, offering a unique window into the minds of South Korean crypto enthusiasts. Unveiling the Pulse of **Korean Crypto Trends** The data from Bitcoin World’s K-Community offers a unique lens through which to observe the rapidly evolving interests of South Korean crypto investors. Unlike global averages, local sentiment can be heavily influenced by regional news, regulatory shifts, and even cultural phenomena. Analyzing both search volume and discussion mentions provides a holistic view of engagement, differentiating between passive interest and active conversation. Let’s break down what truly captivated the attention of the K-Community during this specific period. Decoding the **Top Crypto Keywords**: What K-Community is Searching For When it comes to pure curiosity and investigation, the search data reveals a compelling hierarchy of tokens. These are the assets that users actively sought more information about, indicating a high level of interest or potential anticipation. Here’s what the K-Community was searching for: Top 10 Searched Tokens Search Count XRP 61,982 SOL 18,097 ETH 16,929 BTC 13,720 SEI 12,658 ONDO 9,557 ARB 5,898 MOVE 5,707 BSV 4,127 STMX 4,089 The most striking observation from this list of **top crypto keywords** is the overwhelming dominance of XRP. With over 61,000 searches, it far outpaced every other token, signaling an intense level of interest. This could be attributed to ongoing legal developments surrounding Ripple, which often generate significant speculation and discussion among its dedicated investor base. Following XRP, Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) maintained strong positions, reflecting their status as major market players. The appearance of newer or niche tokens like SEI, ONDO (likely related to Real World Assets – RWA), and Arbitrum (ARB) suggests an active exploration of emerging narratives and Layer 2 solutions within the **Korean crypto trends** landscape. Beyond Searches: What **K-Community Crypto** Enthusiasts are Discussing? While searches indicate individual curiosity, mentions reflect collective conversation and shared sentiment. This list tells us which tokens are actively being discussed in forums, chat groups, and social media within the K-Community. Here’s what was being talked about: Top 10 Mentioned Tokens Mention Count BTC 1,263 ETH 665 XRP 349 SOL 277 TRUMP 144 SEI 111 MOODENG 75 STMX 75 ADA 50 APT 44 Interestingly, while XRP dominated searches, Bitcoin (BTC) took the top spot for mentions. This suggests that while people might be searching for specific information on altcoins, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of broader market discussions, serving as a benchmark and a constant topic for market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP also featured prominently, confirming their consistent relevance within the **K-Community crypto** discussions. The appearance of ‘TRUMP’ (likely a political meme coin) and ‘MOODENG’ highlights the speculative and often whimsical nature of some community discussions, showcasing how quickly new narratives can emerge and gain traction in the fast-paced crypto world. The inclusion of ADA (Cardano) and APT (Aptos) further diversifies the range of projects actively discussed by the community. A Closer Look: What Drives **XRP Price Analysis** in South Korea? XRP’s overwhelming lead in search volume in the K-Community is a phenomenon worth exploring. South Korea has historically shown a strong affinity for XRP, with a passionate and dedicated community of holders. This enthusiasm is often fueled by the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Every development, rumor, or court filing tends to spark a surge in interest, as investors hope for a favorable outcome that could significantly impact **XRP price analysis** and its future trajectory. The high search volume indicates that K-Community members are actively monitoring these developments, perhaps looking for entry or exit points, or simply staying informed about their preferred asset. This sustained interest suggests that XRP will continue to be a significant player in future **Korean crypto trends**. The Enduring Influence of **Bitcoin South Korea** While XRP captured the most searches, Bitcoin’s consistent top ranking in mentions reinforces its fundamental importance in the market. In **Bitcoin South Korea**, it serves not just as an investment asset but as the primary reference point for overall market health and direction. Discussions around Bitcoin often encompass broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and institutional adoption, making it a constant topic of conversation. South Korea has a sophisticated and regulated crypto market, and Bitcoin’s role as the digital gold is well-understood and frequently debated among investors, from seasoned traders to new entrants. Its stability, relative to altcoins, often makes it the focus of long-term investment strategies and general market sentiment analysis in the region. Actionable Insights and Market Dynamics Understanding these **Korean crypto trends** offers several actionable insights: Spotting Retail Interest: High search volumes, particularly for specific altcoins like XRP, can indicate strong retail interest and potential speculative activity. Identifying Core Narratives: The consistent discussion around BTC and ETH highlights their foundational role, while emerging tokens like SEI and ONDO point to evolving themes like Layer 2s and RWAs. Niche Market Influences: The presence of tokens like TRUMP and MOODENG underscores the impact of meme culture and community-driven narratives in specific regional markets. Regulatory Sensitivity: South Korea’s market is highly sensitive to regulatory news. Tokens frequently mentioned or searched might be those directly impacted by local policy discussions. However, investors should also be mindful of the challenges. The K-Community, like any retail-driven market, can be prone to volatility and hype cycles. While high interest can lead to price pumps, it also carries inherent risks. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider market fundamentals before making investment decisions. The weekly insights from Bitcoin World’s K-Community provide a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and often unique preferences of South Korean crypto enthusiasts. From XRP’s unparalleled search dominance driven by legal sagas to Bitcoin’s steadfast position as the market’s primary discussion point, these trends offer valuable context for understanding global crypto sentiment. By paying attention to these regional nuances, investors can gain a more comprehensive perspective on the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

2025-07-07T13:30:00,"Cold Calling Fraudsters Sentenced After £1.5M Crypto Scheme","The two men orchestrated a £1.5 million, or $2 million, crypto investment scam that defrauded at least 65 victims. Meanwhile, Brazil faced a major financial breach when a disgruntled employee of C&M Software sold login credentials for just $2,700. This then allowed hackers to steal nearly $140 million from central bank-linked accounts—some of which was laundered via crypto assets. In Sweden, the government is leveraging a new law that allows asset confiscation, including crypto, even without a formal conviction. The main goal of the law is to help curb organized crime, and has already led to the seizure of over $8.3 million in assets. Collectively, these cases prove that there is rising regulatory pressure and a growing emphasis on the role of crypto in financial crimes worldwide. UK FCA Cracks Down on Crypto Fraudsters Two men were sentenced to a combined 12 years in prison in the UK for operating a crypto scam that defrauded at least 65 victims out of more than £1.5 million ($2 million). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced on Friday that Raymondip Bedi received a prison sentence of five years and four months, while his co-conspirator, Patrick Mavanga, was handed six years and six months. The pair pleaded guilty in November of 2024 to a series of charges including conspiracy to defraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to breach UK financial regulations. According to the FCA, between February of 2017 and June of 2019, Bedi and Mavanga were part of a group that cold-called people and directed them to what appeared to be a legitimate investment website. These sites offered high returns on fake cryptocurrency consultancy services. The operation funneled money through several entities they controlled, including Astaria Group LLP, CCX Capital, and clones of authorized firms like Ian Buckley Financial Services and Capital Partners Group. The FCA described both men as “leading players” in the fraud, with Southwark Crown Court Judge Griffiths stating that they “conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.” Mavanga also pleaded guilty to possessing fake identification documents and was convicted of perverting the course of justice for deleting phone call recordings after Bedi’s arrest in March 2019. The FCA’s joint executive director of enforcement, Steve Smart, condemned their actions as a “callous scam” that “ruthlessly defrauded dozens of innocent victims.” A third defendant that was involved in the case is set to face retrial in September after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A fourth individual, Rowena Bedi, was acquitted of a money laundering charge. Millions Stolen in Brazil Central Bank Hack Cold calls are not the only crypto crimes plaguing the crypto community. C&M Software, the technology provider that connects Brazil’s Central Bank to various financial institutions, suffered a major security breach on Wednesday that led to the theft of approximately 800 million Brazilian reais, or $140 million. The funds were stolen from six institutions linked to the central bank after a C&M employee allegedly sold their login credentials to a hacker for just $2,700. This small but devastating lapse allowed the attacker to access reserve accounts and siphon off a massive amount of capital. The employee suspected of selling his login credentials (Source: Sao Paulo Globo ) Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported that the perpetrators laundered between $30 million and $40 million of the stolen funds by converting them into Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and USDT. These crypto assets were then funneled through Latin American exchanges and over-the-counter trading platforms, making the funds much harder to trace. This incident intensified concerns around the security vulnerabilities of centralized financial systems, particularly those that rely on single points of failure like user credentials and internal access controls. Telegram post by ZachXBT The breach also shed some light on the increasing threat landscape facing centralized software and infrastructure, especially in a digital era fueled by the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence. According to Chainalysis , hacks targeting centralized crypto exchanges surged in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, which attributed to cybercriminals focusing on platforms with large attack surfaces and valuable data troves. Eran Barak , CEO of Shielded Technologies and developer of the Midnight privacy-focused blockchain, shared some thoughts on the broader implications of such breaches. He explained that centralized systems offer massive return on investment for cybercriminals due to their concentration of sensitive information. In contrast, decentralized technologies like those using zero-knowledge proofs greatly reduce this appeal. By eliminating central data repositories, these systems force attackers to go after individual wallets, making attacks less rewarding and often not worth the effort. Overall, it is very clear that there is an urgent need for institutions to reconsider the risks of centralized architecture and adopt more resilient, decentralized alternatives. Sweden Targets Crypto Crime with New Asset Seizure Law Meanwhile, Sweden's Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer urged local enforcement agencies to intensify efforts aimed at seizing assets, including cryptocurrencies, under a recently implemented law that broadens the scope of confiscations. Speaking to financial publication Dagens industri, Strömmer said that authorities like the police, tax agency, and Swedish Enforcement Authority should focus more on cases likely to yield larger criminal proceeds like crypto holdings, real estate, and corporate assets. Since the law came into effect in November of 2024, the Swedish government reportedly seized over $8.3 million in criminal assets. Swedish Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer The law was introduced to combat rising violent crime, and it allows authorities to confiscate luxury items and large sums of money from people who may not necessarily be the subjects of a formal investigation. The legal shift is a major expansion in Sweden's asset forfeiture strategy. According to the Swedish government, the law allows authorities to seize assets with suspected criminal origins even without proof that a crime has been committed, provided the individual cannot reasonably explain the source of the wealth. For example, someone holding large bank balances or luxury goods without a verifiable income to support such possessions may have them confiscated. While the government hasn’t specified how much of the seized assets were in cryptocurrency, the focus on digital assets suggests an increasing recognition of crypto’s role in illicit finance. Some reports indicate controversial enforcement actions, like one case flagged by The Economist in which a woman had $137,000 in cash and a Rolex watch seized while passing through Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport. Authorities reported seizing approximately $1 million in goods during the law’s first week. (Source: Barron’s ) Additionally, Swedish lawmaker Rickard Nordin recently advocated for Sweden to keep seized Bitcoin as part of a national reserve. In April, he sent a letter to the finance minister recommending a strategy similar to the United States’ “budget-neutral” approach, which involves accumulating seized Bitcoin without selling it.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9829/cold-calling-fraudsters-sentenced-after-1-5-m-crypto-scheme,"REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T13:28:44,"Metaplanet & Blockchain Group Add $15M in Bitcoin Reserves","Two publicly listed Asian firms, Blockchain Group and Metaplanet, made headlines this week by collectively acquiring more than 340 BTC—valued in excess of $15 million—yet again solidifying the trend toward publicly listed companies adopting Bitcoin as a mainstream treasury asset. Inside the Latest Bitcoin Purchases Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed investment company, settled the purchase of 2,205 BTC for $238.7 million, raising its holding to 15,555 BTC and making it the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Though the acquisition this week was a larger broader-strategy, the company's steady accumulation—paid for by issuing bonds and stocks—has doubled its shareholders in three months. Paris-listed Blockchain Group revealed purchasing 116 BTC for €10.7 million ($11.5M), bringing its reserves to 1,904 BTC. Blockchain Group's return on BTC for 2025 stands at more than 1,300%, capturing the stunning rise in the value of Bitcoin in terms of share number. Blockchain Group's recent convertible notes and bond issuances have played a pivotal role in funding these purchases, with custody by leading digital asset infrastructure companies. Accounting Treatment and Treasury Strategy Both companies keep Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset, listing it as a non-current asset on their balance sheets. Acquisitions are funded proportionately with equity or debt issue, with proceeds used directly for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet operates a dedicated company-designed ”BTC Yield” to measure value added per share, distinguishing the impact of treasury actions from dilution of share. Blockchain Group tracks a similar yield, emphasizing the accretive contribution of Bitcoin to shareholder value. Company Latest BTC Buy Total BTC Holdings Funding Method BTC Yield (2025) Metaplanet 2,205 BTC 15,555 BTC Bonds, Stock Issuance 416.6% Blockchain Group 116 BTC 1,904 BTC Convertible Bonds 1,348.8% Why Corporate FOMO May Only Just Be Starting The corporate Bitcoin buying spree is not limited to these two firms. Public firms now hold over 725,000 BTC globally—a 135% increase year-on-year—led by Europe and Asia. Regulatory certainty, fears of inflation, and hedging against the risk of fiat are driving this action. Metaplanet and Blockchain Group's aggressive strategies are spurring other listed firms to follow suit, with numerous looking to make more BTC purchases in future quarters. Experts in the industry warn that although the trend is favorable to Bitcoin, smaller firms must manage risk extremely cautiously, especially if BTC prices grow unstable. Still, the momentum is in evidence that corporate FOMO for Bitcoin is only just getting underway. Scaling the Corporate Bitcoin Playbook As more and more corporations adopt Bitcoin in their treasuries, the competitive landscape for listed firms is altering rapidly. Institutional investors are looking more intensely at how digital assets can contribute to balance sheet health and optimize shareholder value. That is also driving fresh discussions around risk management, custody solutions, and regulation, as businesses seek to offset potential upside against good governance. The growing popularity in Europe and Asia could pave the way for broader acceptance worldwide, adding more pressure on North American businesses and companies globally to reconsider their own treasury behavior. With Bitcoin's finite supply and rising demand helping make corporate hoarding the next unavoidable trend for the next cycle of institutional investment, that trend is already gaining traction.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9830/metaplanet-and-blockchain-group-add-15-m-in-bitcoin-reserves,"BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T13:26:44,"Floki, SPX, Bonk Jump 10% as Meme Coin Mania Grows – Is TOKEN6900 Next?","Meme coin fever is back. Floki, Bonk, and SPX6900 have each bounced over 10% in the past 24 hours. A wave of retail energy and $BTC’s march toward a new all-time high have worked in the market’s favor. Bitcoin now sits above $109K and the total crypto market cap just cracked $3.36T. Elon Musk’s ‘America Party’ tweet also added a political spike to this week’s crypto march. With key indicators flashing bullish and altcoins reawakening, investors are hurrying to hoard low-cap altcoins before they explode. Read on to see why the TOKEN6900 presale could boom. Bonk, Floki, and SPX6900 Lead the Comeback At the forefront of the meme coin race are Bonk, Floki and SPX6900. Among meme coin heavyweights, Floki just broke out of its meme slumber, close to 8% in the last 24 hours. FLOKI is selling for $0.00008498 now, while the next resistance is lined up at $0.00009006. If it flips that level, the floodgates could open for a proper rally. SPX6900 is also flexing with over a 10% rise in market cap, now sitting at $1.25B. Volume exploded 115% to over $59M, while the price hit $1.34 after bouncing hard from last week’s dip. Bonk is wagging its tail too, up nearly 10% in the past day, and close to 60% on the weekly chart. Meme season is clearly picking up. As the trading volume ramps up, retail traders are on the hunt for low-cap gems with higher growth potential. The best meme coins today, like $DOGE, $SHIB, $FLOKI, and $BONK, boast large communities. But being largely saturated, they don’t have much width for expansion. That turns investors’ attention to newer alternatives. Is TOKEN6900 Next in Line? TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a top meme coin that is on the radar of strategic investors this week. It just broke the $220K milestone in its newly-launched presale. So, why TOKEN6900 among a crowd of new meme coins ? At the heart of $T6900’s growing virality is transparency. Unlike other altcoins, $T6900 doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not. It doesn’t promise utility. It doesn’t track inflation or earnings. It doesn’t even try to make sense. It just is . The self-proclaimed “Non-Corrupt Token” (NCT) is dedicated to traders who are done pretending. $T6900 is born from the same delusional meme juice that pumped SPX6900 into a multi-billion dollar cap . No charts. No roadmaps. Just vibes. And maybe that’s exactly what makes it next in line for an explosive pump. While $SPX tried to spoof the S&P 500 with memes, Token6900 doubles down with early-2000s internet brain rot and a dolphin mascot. It even has one more token in its supply than SPX6900. After all, more really is more. $T6900 Presale: The Next Price Surge is Only a Few Hours Away Most altcoins are busy faking fundamentals or slapping AI labels on nothing. That explains the growing popularity of TOKEN6900. It doesn’t even bother. Instead, it leans into the chaos, proudly flying the zero-utility flag. $T6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens, and 80% of that is made available to the public in its ongoing red-hot presale. The presale has left no room for dodgy VC allocations or shady unlock schedules. With a $5M hard cap target, it gives a fair shot to everyone who wants to join. Right now, $T6900 is priced at $0.006475. That will tick up to $0.007125 by the end of the presale sale. An optional staking rewards program is also already live for presale participants, offering over 200% APY at the time of writing. As the presale moves through new stages, the token price increases and the staking APY drops. Early birds not only get the meme, but also the juicier rewards. So, get in today by buying TOKEN6900 today to lock in the best price and catch the early staking train. SPX6900 pulled off +50,275,413% gains in under two years. Naturally, early buyers are eyeing the TOKEN6900 presale as the next possible rocket. But this is crypto. Always do your own research before plowing funds into any new crypto project.

2025-07-07T13:24:24,"Strategy hits pause on Bitcoin binge after $14b Q2 windfall","After amassing 2.8% of Bitcoin’s total supply, Strategy takes a brief hiatus, reporting zero BTC acquisitions for the first time in three months. Meanwhile, a $14 billion unrealized gain in Q2 proves the company’s treasury play works. According to a Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 7, Strategy made no Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases between June 30 and July 6, marking its first week without adding to its treasury since early April. The buying freeze comes just as the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm reported a staggering $14.05 billion unrealized gain on its digital asset holdings for Q2, offset by a $4.04 billion deferred tax expense. With 597,325 BTC now worth $64.4 billion at current prices, Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy has delivered a $22 billion paper profit on its $42.4 billion total investment.

The abrupt halt in Strategy’s relentless Bitcoin buying spree raises questions about what’s next for the company that now holds nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. While Michael Saylor’s quip about “some weeks you just need to HODL” played well on social media, the real story lies in the numbers. Some weeks you just need to HODL. pic.twitter.com/rVcFQkFoG0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 6, 2025 The $14 billion Q2 windfall underscores the success of Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy, but the pause suggests a moment of recalibration rather than retreat. The Form 8-K filing reveals more than just a week of inactivity. Strategy’s last Bitcoin purchase came on June 29, when it added 4,980 BTC for $531.9 million at an average price of $106,801 per coin. Since then, the company has held steady, even as Bitcoin’s price fluctuated between $105,000 and $110,000. Coming on the heels of a $14.05 billion unrealized gain, Strategy may be pausing to recalibrate its tax position or rebalance its funding sources, especially after exhausting much of its initial $42 billion capital raise plan. Notably, the firm incurred a $4.04 billion deferred tax expense tied to that fair value gain, and while unrealized gains don’t generate cash, tax liabilities do. Strategy’s acquisitions have been fueled by a mix of stock sales and debt offerings. In Q2 alone, the company raised $6.8 billion from at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock ($MSTR) and three perpetual preferred stock offerings: STRK, STRF, and STRD. These instruments, with dividend yields ranging from 8% to 10%, have allowed Strategy to tap into investor appetite for yield while avoiding outright dilution. But the funding model isn’t without risks. The company’s “42/42” plan, which is an expansion of its original $21 billion target, now aims to raise $84 billion by 2027 through equity and convertible notes. While this aggressive approach has worked so far, it leaves Strategy exposed to shifts in investor sentiment, particularly if Bitcoin’s price stagnates or declines.

2025-07-07T13:15:22,"Trump administration set to deliver first major crypto policy report","The White House is getting ready to release its first official crypto report after several months of internal work. According to a Monday release by Crypto in America, the report, ordered under a January executive directive from President Trump , is due by July 22. Expected to outline a broad strategy for digital asset regulation in the U.S., it will mark the administration’s first formal stance on how federal agencies should approach the crypto sector, covering both legislative and regulatory recommendations. The working group behind the report is co-led by U.S crypto czar David Sacks and Congressman Bo Hines, and includes senior officials from the Treasury Department, the SEC, the CFTC, and the Department of Commerce. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, the report added that the group has been meeting for months to coordinate a federal framework that aligns with Trump’s goal of cementing the United States as the world’s crypto capital. You might also like: Elon Musk’s new ‘America Party’ will embrace Bitcoin, claiming fiat to be ‘hopeless’ While contents of the report remain under wraps, early signals point to several key areas. One possible recommendation is the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, as proposed by Trump earlier this year. The group is also reportedly weighing how to ensure crypto firms have fair access to banking services, particularly with regard to the Federal Reserve’s role in granting access to payment infrastructures. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham reportedly described the ongoing deliberations as “productive and fruitful,” calling the upcoming report a potential roadmap for the administration’s crypto agenda. The expected July 22 release comes as Congress prepares to vote on a set of major crypto bills, including the GENIUS stablecoin Act and others covering market structure and central bank digital currencies. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee is also set to hold a hearing on crypto industry regulation later this week, featuring testimony from industry figures such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, and Paradigm General Partner Dan Robinson.

2025-07-07T13:14:47,"Crypto Price Analysis 7-7: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, LITECOIN: LTC, COSMOS: ATOM","The crypto market has started the new week on a bullish note, up nearly 2%at $3.38 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) , which was steady around $108,000 for most of the weekend, has bounced to reclaim $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $109,627 as buyers eye a move past $110,000. Analysts are optimistic of a new all-time high if BTC crosses key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) attempted to move past $2,600 early on Monday but was thwarted by upper-level resistance. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $2,577. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up 2.29%, trading around $2.27, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 3%. SOL spent most of the weekend below $150, but sentiment picked up late on Sunday, and the price moved to its current level of $152. Dogecoin (DOGE) has registered a substantial increase over the past 24 hours, up nearly 7%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 2.03%, trading around $0.587. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. DeFi, TradFi Convergence Could Occur Sooner Than Expected Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan Kinexys, believes the divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). Zaltsman made the comments speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025. She added that JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging on-chain assets, indicating a tipping point for blockchain adoption. “Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting.” JPMorgan has recently partnered with Chainlink to pilot a synchronized settlement technology, enabling the bank’s blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across multiple blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone an example of how banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets. Speaking about TradFi and DeFi, Zaltsman stated that artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance could disappear faster than expected thanks to improved infrastructure and cooperation. She pointed out that JPMorgan built its private blockchain a decade ago due to the lack of suitable options, adding that the situation was different today. “Thankfully, that’s not the case today. It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support. I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries.” Secret Service Seizes Nearly $400M In Crypto The US Secret Service has seized over $400 million in digital assets over the past decade, creating one of the largest crypto cold wallets. According to Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst, the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) tracked funds using open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and lots of patience. The Secret Service’s crypto stash, most of which is stored in a single cold wallet, is the result of several investigations into elaborate scams. Scammers have been targeting users by luring them into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms. Victims see initial profits before scammers disappear with all their deposits. Lam stated, “That’s how they do it. They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” $6.8 Billion Bitcoin Whale Not Selling Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham has said that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved last week does not seem to be heading for a sell-off. Arkham believes that the transfers may be the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which offers improved security and lower fees. “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin. Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) price action picked up late on Sunday, fueled by optimism around the upcoming “crypto week” in Washington. However, broader market sentiment remains cautious thanks to growing uncertainty about President Trump’s shifting stance on tariffs. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $107,340 on Friday before recovering over the weekend, with the price rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and move to $109,229. However, BTC finds itself back in the red during the ongoing session, marginally down, trading around $108,834. BTC and the broader crypto market enter a crucial week with two major catalysts set to dictate price action. The most important catalyst for BTC and the broader market will be the upcoming July 9 tariff deadline. The US has reached agreements with several trading partners. However, President Trump could revert to the high tariffs announced back in April. The return of retaliatory tariffs will likely be a bearish development for BTC and the broader markets. BTC had plunged to a low of $74,000 after Trump’s Liberation Day speech before bouncing back when he announced the 90-day pause. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are also scheduled for release on Wednesday and could act as another decisive catalyst for BTC. The minutes are expected to provide more information about the previous meeting, where the Fed left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The minutes will also shed light on when the Fed could cut interest rates. A rate cut will be bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market. However, the odds of a rate cut have reduced due to strong nonfarm payrolls data. Meanwhile,. Bitcoin dominance of the overall crypto market continued to grow, crossing 65% to reach its highest levels since early 2021.

This pattern sets $BTC and $SOL to targets of $230,000 and $4,390, respectively.” SOL reached an intraday high of $148 on Wednesday (June 25) before losing momentum and settling at $143.

As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17, having rallied nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the token is up 3.45%. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold For its July 31 price outlook, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for insight into how the asset might trade in the coming three weeks. ChatGPT predicts DOGE’s price ChatGPT expects Dogecoin to experience a modest recovery from its local support zone if the broader cryptocurrency market remains stable. It noted that Dogecoin has recently attracted buyers around $0.16–$0.17, suggesting a solid floor in that range. However, the AI model cautioned that the meme-coin market has lacked a major hype catalyst, such as a major Elon Musk tweet, to spark a sharp rally. Assuming Bitcoin ( BTC ) holds its current range above $100,000, ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin will drift higher by month’s end, with a base-case target range of $0.17 to $0.185. Its most likely closing price is estimated at around $0.178. ChatGPT Dogecoin price prediction. Source: ChatGPT In downside scenarios, it sees a bearish case near $0.165 if the broader crypto market weakens, while a strong meme-driven surge could push Dogecoin as high as $0.195. Grok’s DOGE price prediction On the other hand, Grok offered a slightly more bullish outlook, taking into account ongoing spot ETF speculation and broader market sentiment. Grok projects Dogecoin trading between $0.18 and $0.22, with a likely price of around $0.20 by the end of the month. The AI tool noted that while social media hype can quickly move Dogecoin’s price, downside risks remain. A drop below $0.155 could see it fall further to $0.14, while a bullish breakout above $0.18 might even carry it toward $0.25.

Bitcoin Will Win, Says Blockstream CEO Adam Back appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and one of the few people who directly communicated with Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is turning heads with his latest prediction: gold might crash, but Bitcoin is here to stay. His comments follow the resurfacing of reports about Psyche 16, an asteroid believed to contain a massive amount of gold worth around $700 quintillion. With Elon Musk also throwing support behind Bitcoin, the market is buzzing with renewed energy. Psyche 16: Could This Asteroid Sink Gold? Psyche 16 orbits between Mars and Jupiter and is rumored to hold enough gold to make every person on Earth a billionaire. But that kind of supply could flood the market and send gold prices crashing. Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, pointed this out on social media, emphasizing that Bitcoin doesn’t face this problem. Its supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflation or sudden market dilution. He also reminded the community that Bitcoin’s issuance is cut in half every four years, through a process called halving. The most recent halving happened on April 20, 2024, reducing mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. There is zero #Bitcoin on Psyche 16. https://t.co/VSiqDPX6ta — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 6, 2025 Adam Back replied to Mow’s post, explaining that if such a gold surplus were to hit the market, it would likely cause gold’s price to crash. In contrast, Bitcoin’s fixed and transparent supply model strengthens its position as a reliable store of value. Elon Musk: “Fiat is hopeless, so yes” to Bitcoin Tech billionaire Elon Musk recently energized the crypto community by endorsing Bitcoin. Responding to queries about his proposed “America Party,” aimed at curbing U.S. debt after Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” raised the debt ceiling by trillions, Musk accused fiat currency, stating, “Fiat is hopeless, so yes.” Bitcoin vs Gold: Which One Will Win? Gold has long been seen as a safe haven during uncertain times, but its value depends on controlled supply. With the threat of Psyche 16 flooding the market, that status could be challenged. In contrast, Bitcoin offers a deflationary model and complete transparency. With influential voices like Adam Back and Elon Musk rallying behind it, Bitcoin is being seen more than ever as a serious alternative to gold.

Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham recently spotlighted the re-mergence of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale, which moved roughly $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin across eight different wallets after 14 years of dormancy. Each of the wallets had originally received BTC between April and May 2011, back when Bitcoin was still trading below $1. The funds were split into various portions and transferred into eight new addresses, where they currently remain untouched. A single entity moved $8.6 BILLION of BTC from 8 addresses in the past day.

You might also like: Metaplanet inches closer to top 4 BTC corporate holders with fresh $238 million buy However, Arkham Intelligence added that the movement patterns suggest that the transfers were likely part of address upgrades, with the entity moving assets from outdated to newer wallet formats. This kind of shift is often done to improve security and reduce transaction fees, especially for wallets that have remained untouched for years. The total value of the BTC held across the wallets now sits slightly above $8.62 billion at current prices. Commenting on the whale’s resurgence and movement, 10x Research pointed to growing signs that Satoshi-era wallets like these are quietly offloading into rising Bitcoin ETF and institutional demand. According to their research, these early holders, often referred to as “OG whales,” have been gradually reducing their exposure since mid-2024. While the recently reactivated wallets haven’t sold,10x suggests they’re part of a broader shift beneath the surface that may help explain why Bitcoin’s upside has been capped, despite strong seasonal trends and ongoing accumulation by ETFs.

2025-07-07T13:06:09,"CoinShares: BTC loses favor, assets under management reach new all-time high on 12th week of inflows","Price gains over the past week boost total assets under management up to a new all-time high of $188 billion. CoinShares noted a shift in investor attitudes which favored Ethereum more than Bitcoin. In the past week, digital asset investment products saw $1.04 billion in global inflows, which marked the 12th consecutive week of inflows . According to CoinShares’ weekly report , the total net inflows have reached $16.3 billion, which aligns with the weekly average of 2025 so far. Not only that, price gains evident throughout the last week also pushed the AuM to a new all-time high of $188 billion from its previous $187.5 billion record. Although Bitcoin ( BTC ) still contributed the largest share of inflows, with $790 million last week, it marked a significant decline from the previous three weeks. Bitcoin held up an average of $1.5 billion in inflows within the past three weeks. However now it has dipped by nearly 50% this week alone. According to Head of CoinShares research, James Butterfill, noted that the slowdown in Bitcoin’s performance indicates that investors are growing cautious of betting their funds on the largest cryptocurrency by marketcap. “The moderation in inflows suggests that investors are becoming more cautious as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high price levels,” said Butterfill. Crypto flows recorded last week by asset type and provider | Source: CoinShares You might also like: CoinShares: Digital asset funds saw fourth week of inflows with $882m In fact, he noted that there has been a shift in investors’ attitude towards Ethereum ( ETH ), which recorded its 11th week of consecutive inflows with $226 million. According to the CoinShares report, weekly inflows from ETH throughout last week’s period amounted to 1.6% of the total assets under management. Butterfill observed that this rate was significantly higher than the 0.8% contributed by Bitcoin, which he believes is a sign that more investors are warming up towards Ethereum while keeping a safe distance from Bitcoin. From a regional standpoint, the United States still holds the largest share of inflows last week with $1 billion in inflows. Meanwhile, Germany and Switzerland also saw inflows with $38.5 million and $33.7 million respectively. On the other hand, Canada and Sweden experienced outflows amounting to $29.3 million and $19.2 million. Other regions such as Hong Kong and Brazil saw modest outflows of $3 million and $9.7 million.

The price action continues to respect the January all-time high of $109,590 as resistance, while drawing consistent support from the Short-Term Holder Realised Price (STH-RP) around $98,220–$99,474. Despite a recent rebound from sub-$100K levels, the broader trend has stalled, and the current market setup reflects a delicate equilibrium : profit-taking pressures have eased, but the lack of sustained momentum suggests buyers are also hesitant. Importantly, the market’s repeated defence of the rising STH-RP underscores continued structural strength. This key on-chain level has historically acted as a pivot for trend continuation, and its resilience in recent weeks indicates that bulls still hold control of the broader structure. The rising cost basis reflects ongoing accumulation, likely by institutional players via ETFs and corporate inflows offering a more durable foundation than in prior cycles. However, the lack of follow-through at the range highs, and recent drawdowns in aggregate open interest and whale holdings, highlight growing caution , particularly among experienced market participants. The US macroeconomic landscape is increasingly marked by signs of strain, with recent data underscoring a labour market losing momentum amid broader economic headwinds. June payrolls showed a headline gain of 147,000 jobs, yet nearly half stemmed from government hiring linked to seasonal factors, while private sector job creation weakened to its slowest pace in eight months. Sectors like manufacturing and wholesale trade shed jobs, and the overall drop in labour force participation masked the rise in long-term unemployment . Wage growth softened, the average workweek shrank, and aggregate hours worked fell, reflecting cautious employer sentiment and hinting at subdued consumer demand ahead. Manufacturing, too, remains under pressure; the ISM PMI stayed below the 50 mark for the fourth consecutive month, with businesses grappling with supply chain bottlenecks and trade uncertainty, further clouding prospects for a recovery. While job openings rose, largely in lower-wage leisure and hospitality roles, hiring lagged, exposing the fragile underpinnings of labor demand. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve appears set to hold rates steady in the near term, with markets eyeing potential easing toward year-end. In parallel, the cryptocurrency sector is capturing growing institutional interest, with developments that are in contrast with the tentative macroeconomic mood. The debut of the first Solana staking ETF, SSK, marked a milestone , drawing $33 million in volume on its first day and offering 5–7 percent staking yields, positioning Solana as a credible player in regulated capital markets. Similarly, corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies are accelerating: Spain’s Vanadi Coffee pivoted dramatically from its café business to amass Bitcoin holdings, aiming for €1 billion in BTC exposure, though there is concern about the company’s strategy given its overall financial fragility. Meanwhile, Tokyo-based Metaplanet has intensified its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, now holding a total of 15,555 BTC following its latest purchase of 2,205 BTC, with ambitions to reach 210,000 BTC by 2027 and solidify its role as Asia’s leading corporate Bitcoin holder. Together, these crypto moves highlight a growing divergence: while traditional markets wrestle with uncertainty, digital assets are increasingly seen as a vehicle for yield, treasury diversification, and inflation hedging — signalling shifting priorities in institutional capital deployment.

2025-07-07T13:00:58,"XLM Traders, Beware! Stellar’s Funding Rate Is Plummeting","Stellar Lumens hit a critical support level this week at $0.20, putting the token in a precarious spot. At that price, XLM sits 30% below its peak in May and 60% under its 2024 high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake’s Latest Track—Details Based on reports, bears have been piling on, pushing the funding rate into negative territory since early June. If that support gives way, traders warn XLM could slide toward $0.15, a drop of about 35%. Network Activity Up According to Artemis, operations on the Stellar network surged to 197 million in June. Stablecoin supply also reached a record $667 million. Over the past five months, the total value locked in real‑world asset tokenization grew to $487 million, helped by new offerings such as the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Market Fund. Those figures suggest healthy demand for on‑chain services and asset tokenization inside Stellar’s ecosystem. Funding Rates Down Funding rates in perpetual futures have been negative most days since May. That means more short positions than long ones, with short traders paying long traders to keep their bets in place. XLM’s funding rate hit its lowest point since June 30, pointing to rising bearish sentiment. When funding rates stay deep in the red, it often adds selling pressure as traders brace for steeper losses. The image above shows that XLM funding rates are down on most major exchanges, particularly for stablecoin-margined pairs, data from Coinalyze shows. On‑Chain Growth Clashes With Market Mood Nansen data shows the number of transactions rose by 11% over the last seven days to 182 million. Active addresses climbed 10% to 146,700 in the same span. Even so, price action has ignored these gains. XLM fell beneath its 50‑day and 100‑day Exponential Moving Averages, and momentum appears to favor sellers. Some market watchers suggest that deep negative funding could trigger a short squeeze, turning sentiment around if shorts rush to cover. Chart Patterns Warn Of Drop The daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, with $0.21 forming the lower trendline. That level also marked April’s lows when altcoins broadly sold off. XLM has slipped below the 60% Fibonacci Retracement zone, where many traders expect a bounce. A clean break under the triangle could unleash algorithm‑driven orders, sending price toward $0.15. Related Reading: Brazil’s Central Bank Hacked—$40M In Crypto Washed In Aftermath Meanwhile, Stellar’s fundamentals look solid, but technical signals remain bearish. Traders and holders should watch that $0.21 line. A strong rebound there could restore confidence in on‑chain strength. On the flip side, a slide through support may spark faster losses. Either way, XLM’s near‑term path hinges on that key level.

2025-07-07T12:56:46,"Bitcoin price outlook: $108k CME gap may trigger short-term pullback","Bitcoin remains stuck in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000. A CME futures gap at $108K adds pressure for a retrace as traders watch for a breakout backed by volume. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is consolidating between two major high time frame levels: $110,000 as range resistance and $100,169 as range support. A recent failed breakout to $111,960 followed by a quick re-entry into the range confirms a deviation, a classic hallmark of range-bound price action. Without strong volume, BTC is likely to continue oscillating within this zone. Traders are now focused on a CME futures gap at $108,300, which adds to the probability of a short-term retrace this week. Key technical points Range Resistance at $110K: Price rejected from this zone after a false breakout. Range Support at $100,169: Backed by a swing low at $98,200. CME Futures Gap at $108,300: Historically, 90% of CME gaps get filled, this one may attract price action soon. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin has been locked between $110,000 and $100,169 ever since the deviation above $111,960 failed to hold. This reaffirms the idea that BTC is currently in a rotational environment where failed breakouts and breakdowns are met with mean reversion. With no volume-backed conviction to push beyond the range, BTC continues to oscillate between these critical levels. You might also like: Russia’s biggest state-backed bank sees no use for CBDC, so why push ahead anyway? Currently, price is hovering around the range high near $110,000, which also aligns with the value area high on the volume profile. Unless BTC can close decisively above this level on strong volume, the structure favors continued consolidation or a move back toward range support. BTCCME (3D) Chart, Source: TradingView Of particular interest this week is the CME futures gap left open at $108,300 following Bitcoin’s weekend rally. Since CME Bitcoin futures don’t trade on weekends, the gap formed when markets reopened, a phenomenon with strong historical weight. Over 90% of these gaps get filled, often within days. This gives traders a technical target and increases the likelihood of a pullback in the near term, possibly toward that level. Unless the range is broken with decisive volume, this pattern of deviation and return is likely to persist. The $100,169 support zone remains crucial if price does begin to drop, especially if it follows a gap-fill move. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin is likely to continue range-bound this week unless a high-volume breakout occurs. A retrace toward $108,000 is probable due to the CME gap, with $100,000 remaining key support.

2025-07-07T12:48:37,"UK Treasury Targets Crypto Tax Evaders with £300 Fines Starting January 2026","The UK Treasury has unveiled a comprehensive crackdown on crypto tax evasion, introducing £300 fines for individuals who refuse to share personal details with crypto service providers starting January 2026. According to a Daily Mail report, the new Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will require holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and other digital currencies to share their tax reference numbers with crypto platforms or face penalties. Treasury officials project the initiative will close loopholes in crypto taxation and generate up to £315 million in additional revenue by April 2030. Source: PA Archive (The Standard) Exchequer Secretary James Murray emphasized that the initiative is part of a broader strategy to eliminate tax avoidance, stating that the rules will ensure “ tax dodgers have nowhere to hide ” and the government will be able to fund essential public services through improved compliance. Both crypto users and service providers will face financial penalties for non-compliance, creating a dual-layer enforcement mechanism that holds both parties accountable for every transaction. New Compliance Framework Puts Pressure on Platforms and Users Crypto service providers operating in the UK will bear significant responsibility under the new framework, as they are required to collect and verify customer tax information before facilitating any transactions. Platforms that fail to obtain accurate tax reference numbers or provide complete transaction records to HM Revenue and Customs will face their own financial penalties, which are currently not disclosed. The reporting requirements extend beyond simple trading activities to encompass staking rewards, DeFi yield farming, NFT transactions, and any other crypto-related income generation. Non-compliant individuals face penalties of £300 per instance, while service providers risk separate fines for failing to maintain accurate records or provide the required information to tax authorities. Source: Daily Mail ( From left to right; Treasury Parliamentary Secretary Emma Reynolds, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury James Murray, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq, and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Spencer Livermore ) Murray also described the framework as part of a broader effort to ensure “everyone pays their fair share,” positioning the crackdown as essential for maintaining public funding for nurses, police, and other vital services. Service providers will need to adapt their onboarding processes and customer management systems to accommodate the new data collection requirements, potentially increasing operational costs that could be passed to users. Global Momentum Builds Around Crypto Tax Enforcement Britain’s move is part of a worldwide trend toward stricter cryptocurrency tax compliance, with multiple jurisdictions implementing similar reporting frameworks designed to capture previously hidden digital asset profits. The European Union’s DAC8 directive , which takes effect in 2026, will require crypto platforms across all member states to share customer transaction data with tax authorities, creating a continent-wide information exchange network. European Parliament Supports DAC8 Crypto Tax Rule by an Overwhelming Margin Lawmakers in the European Parliament have expressed support for the eighth iteration of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8). #CryptoNews #EU https://t.co/pn02rJg4qM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 14, 2023 Recent data from Denmark reveals the scale of the challenge facing tax authorities, with over 90% of crypto traders failing to report gains despite mandatory exchange reporting requirements implemented in 2019. Nordic countries appear particularly aggressive in their approach, with Norway estimating that roughly 88% of crypto traders omitted gains in 2023, while Denmark is now considering a 42% tax on unrealized cryptocurrency gains . Thailand has taken the opposite approach, offering a five-year personal income tax exemption on crypto capital gains for transactions conducted through licensed platforms, seeking to attract international investment and establish itself as a digital asset hub. As it stands now, some jurisdictions are tightening enforcement, while others compete for crypto capital through favorable tax treatment. These approaches, however, create both opportunities and challenges for crypto investors, who may increasingly start to consider tax implications when choosing where to trade or establish residency.

2025-07-07T12:48:03,"Here’s How High XRP Will Go in 2025, According to 4 Top AI Tools","With XRP still stuck below major resistance and investor sentiment split, one researcher turned to artificial intelligence for a fresh perspective on XRP price prospects in 2025. Instead of relying on traditional analysts, leading AI tools, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok, were asked to predict how high XRP could climb by the end of 2025. While their responses leaned bullish, they came with conditions. Crypto Researcher Ripple Van Winkle called attention to the responses in a post on X.ChatGPT XRP Price PredictionSpecifically, ChatGPT presented three distinct scenarios depending on how events unfold for Ripple. In a conservative estimate, it predicts XRP will climb back to $3.80, matching its previous all-time high from 2018. A more moderate forecast predicts the token will be between $5 and $6, assuming Ripple secures key partnerships and continues to experience adoption. However, in the most aggressive scenario, XRP could rise as high as $10 to $15 if everything breaks in its favor.Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok Weigh InInterestingly, both Gemini and Perplexity provided similar outlooks, projecting XRP in the $5 to $10 range. Nonetheless, they emphasized that such growth is only possible if Ripple’s legal troubles are resolved and if an XRP spot ETF enters the market. It bears mentioning that Ripple and the SEC have already decided to drop the case, pending court approval.Meanwhile, Grok, the AI developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was more cautious. It projected a lower range between $1.80 and $5.81, with its most likely scenario falling between $3 and $4.50.https://twitter.com/RipBullWinkle/status/1941856566967201816Key Drivers Behind the PredictionsThe AIs identified three main forces that could push XRP higher this year. First is the outcome of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Both parties have agreed to dismiss their appeal. What's pending is the official settlement announcement. Market watchers believe this development could unlock institutional interest. Second is adoption, in terms of new partnerships and broader use of XRP in cross-border payment systems. Ripple has continued to pursue new alliances and acquisitions, which many believe will benefit XRP. Finally, the AI tools noted that the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the United States could serve as a major catalyst for the XRP price. This is because it would attract both retail and institutional capital. ETF inflows played a significant role in propelling Bitcoin's price in 2024.Bitcoin Influence on the Broader MarketAnother common theme across the AI predictions is the importance of Bitcoin’s trajectory. The chatbots noted that a strong post-halving bull run, combined with clearer pro-crypto U.S. policies, could lift the entire market, including XRP. In other words, XRP’s success will not exist in isolation but as part of a larger shift in market sentiment.While the outlooks were generally optimistic, all four AIs included a disclaimer that the projections were not financial advice. Specifically, they encouraged investors to do their research and remain cautious, even in the face of promising forecasts.

Recently, a crypto expert Jesse from Apex Crypto Consulting shared that the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit might be more than just a legal battle. Does Ripple Have Bigger Plans? According to him, Ripple is deeply connected to big players like central banks and the IMF and its bigger goal might be turning XRP into a global reserve currency, replacing systems like SWIFT . He also pointed out that Ripple has continued to rise without facing any pushback and it may be working with major financial powers behind the scenes. The expert says that the SEC lawsuit is a strategy to keep XRP’s price low while Ripple expands its global network. Bill Morgan Rejects “Staged Lawsuit” Theory However, legal expert Bill Morgan pushed back against the idea that the lawsuit was all part of a planned show. He said that he had never supported this theory, even though the two recent joint motions for indicative rulings were weak and unnecessarily delayed the lawsuit by around three months. I have never agreed with this theory even if the recent two weak joint motions for indicative rulings seemed to unnecessarily delay the end of the litigation by three months (and counting) on a hope and a prayer. https://t.co/mAt0QhDWMI — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) July 7, 2025 Although the delays are frustrating and there has been little progress, Morgan believes that this is not part of a hidden agenda. The comments also voiced similar thoughts toward the theory. X Users noted that it’s unrealistic to think Ripple would voluntarily enter a lawsuit, spend hundreds of millions on legal defense, and endure years of uncertainty, just to play out a plan behind the scenes. [post_titles_links postid=”479369″] They see the delays and motions as standard legal hurdles and argue that such a complex and costly lawsuit would not be staged merely to manipulate public perception or XRP’s price . There are also growing speculations in the community after Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto made a rare public appearance, just days before Ripple applied for a banking charter and a Fed master account. With both Ripple and the SEC moving to drop their appeals, some believe that a major behind-the-scenes move could be underway. Experts Say The Case is Not Over Yet The lawsuit continues with speculations across the crypto community. There were rumors that the case could finally end today. However, a legal expert clarified that these decisions take longer to finalize. This comes after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently revealed that the company is dropping its appeal to officially close this chapter. Attorney Fred Rispoli pointed out that Ripple’s quick move, just a day after Judge Torres’ ruling, suggests that it had already planned for this outcome, likely coordinating with the SEC to move forward smoothly. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why did the SEC sue Ripple Labs? The SEC sued Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that Ripple and its executives conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP to finance their business. The SEC argued that XRP, particularly institutional sales, constituted an “investment contract” under U.S. securities laws and should have been registered. What is the current outcome of the XRP lawsuit for Ripple and XRP’s status? The lawsuit is nearing its official close with a settlement agreement and appeals withdrawn by both sides. The key outcome, from Judge Analisa Torres’s August 2024 ruling, is that XRP itself is not a security for programmatic (retail) sales on exchanges, but Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP were deemed unregistered securities offerings. Ripple is expected to pay a $125 million civil penalty. Is XRP projected to reach $22 by 2026 if Ripple’s market cap hits $1.2 trillion? Some bullish analysts, like “Egrag Crypto,” project XRP could reach between $22 and $27 by 2026, citing historical price patterns. However, other predictions are more conservative, with ranges from $5.50 to $8.50 for 2026.

The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term.

2025-07-07T12:36:02,"Crypto Price Prediction 2025: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, LINK, AVAX, ARB, DOT, SOL","The cryptocurrency scene is developing as 2025 approaches, moving from institutional adoption to decentralized innovation. Market sentiment was improved by the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and ongoing spot-ETF inflows as retail investors continue to show interest in the crypto sector. With scaling, improvements, and staking mechanisms that are expected to propel it toward $7K–$10K, Ethereum maintains its leadership, aligning with many bullish crypto price predictions for 2025 that analysts are sharing.

Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction 7. Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction 8. Polkadot (DOT) price prediction 9.

In addition to highlighting important technical levels and offering chart insights for nine major cryptocurrencies, this article describes bullish and bearish scenarios as well, which will help you set your crypto expectations the right way in 2025. Now, let’s dive into the crypto price predictions of 2025 for some of the top cryptocurrencies. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction BTC 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish Scenario If ETF inflows and governmental adoption trends (such as the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve) continue to grow, Bitcoin ( BTC ) may reach $143K. As Bitcoin establishes itself as digital gold, institutional investors might increase demand, particularly if macroeconomic conditions continue to be inflationary. Bearish scenario If regulatory concerns or a worldwide economic collapse prevent Bitcoin from holding the $100K psychological barrier, it may retrace to $85K to $90K, hitting earlier all-time highs as support. Key Levels Support: $100K, $92K Resistance: $114K, $143K You might also like: Over $1b flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as macro sentiment improves 2. Ethereum (ETH) price prediction ETH 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Ethereum ( ETH ) may rise to $7K to $10K if it can scale through Layer-2 solutions and its staking enhancements work as planned. Approval of a spot ETH ETF would only hasten this trend. Bearish scenario ETH may stall between $2.5K and $3K if network congestion or scaling delays continue, with a $2K downside risk, with some crypto price predicitons for 2025 also aiming for $1800. Key Levels Support: $2.2K, $2.5K Resistance: $3.2K, $5K, $10K 3. Binance Coin (BNB) price prediction BNB 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario BNB ( B NB) cryptocurrency prediction for 2025 suggests that the token might reach $800–$1,000 if token burning continues, DEX adoption increases, and ecosystem resilience persists in the face of regulatory setbacks. Bearish scenario BNB may decline to $500–$600 as a result of ongoing regulatory concerns or a decline in exchange volume. Key Levels Support: $610, $550 Resistance: $693, $800, $1,000 4. Cardano (ADA) price prediction Cardano 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Crypto forecast 2025 for Cardano ( ADA ) suggests that the token may aim for $1.50 to $2.00 if enterprise integration and smart contract adoption pick up speed. Long-term investors continue to be drawn to its emphasis on scalability and academic rigor. Bearish scenario ADA may remain constrained in the $0.40–$0.70 range due to slow growth in the dApp ecosystem. Key Levels Support: $0.56, $0.68 Resistance: $1.23, $1.50 5. Chainlink (LINK) price prediction Chainlink 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario As demand for oracles in DeFi and real-world assets (RWAs) grows, Chainlink ( LINK ) could rally to $44–$50. Chainlink’s CCIP and partnerships with institutions are major catalysts. Bearish Scenario A shrinking DeFi sector could stall LINK’s growth, causing it to linger around $20–$25. Key Levels Support: $25, $20 Resistance: $36, $44 6. Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction Avax 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Avalanche ( AVAX ) is perfect for institutional and enterprise use cases because of its subnet design. An increase to $90–$100 is probable as adoption increases. Bearish scenario L1 competition or slowed developer activity may cause it to return to $20–$28. Key Levels Support: $20, $28 Resistance: $36, $90 7. Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction Arbitrum 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario If usage metrics and governance acceptance increase, the cryptocurrency outlook for Arbitrum ( ARB ), which has one of the highest TVLs among Layer-2s, might rise to $2.00 to $2.50. Bearish scenario If overall usage declines or other L2s do better, ARB may return to $0.75–$1.00. Key Levels Support: $0.80, $1.00 Resistance: $1.50, $2.00 8. Polkadot (DOT) price prediction DOT 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Polkadot ( DOT ) may reach $15–$20 due to cross-chain use cases, XCM enhancements, and parachain auctions. Bearish scenario The potential could be limited by weak user uptake, which would keep it below $10 and perhaps return to $5–$6. Key Levels Support: $6, $5 Resistance: $9, $15 9. Solana (SOL) price prediction SOL 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario With sustained network stability, Solana’s ( SOL ) rapid ecosystem growth—particularly in NFTs and gaming—could propel it past $200, and perhaps as high as $300. Bearish scenario In the event of another interruption or exploit, SOL might go back to $140–$160. Key Levels Support: $160, $140 Resistance: $185, $220, $300 The big picture In 2025, cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more incorporated into larger financial markets in response to institutional attitudes and macroeconomic trends: Inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs: A total of over $250 billion has entered these funds, stabilizing volatility and creating analogies to gold in conventional portfolios. By using confiscated Bitcoin to increase legitimacy, the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve project , which was established by executive order on March 6, 2025, has a favorable impact on Bitcoin’s role in sovereign asset allocation. Fed Policy & Inflation Outlook: Risk assets are favored by anticipated interest rate reductions and moderate inflation; Bitcoin and Ethereum have outpaced the S&P 500 in 2025 YTD (15% vs. 5%), capitalizing on this trend. Altseason Trigger: In the past, rallies in high-growth L1/L2 coins have been preceded by sustained BTC strength. Spiking BTC supremacy usually signals bullish runs in tokens such as DOT, AVAX, ARB, and LINK. To put it briefly, macro support—easing rates, positive U.S. policy, and ETF flows—is driving up cryptocurrency assets. This tendency might be reversed, though, by any change in Fed instructions, regulatory actions, or global unrest. You might also like: Analysis: Bitcoin could reach $120K in July amid BTC market maturity 1. What is the potential 2025 price of Bitcoin? Analysts’ salaries vary greatly, ranging from $120,000 to $200K, based on economic circumstances, ETF volume, and the halving cycle. While cautious models concentrate on $120K to $150K, Galaxy Digital and VanEck anticipate highs of $180K to $200K. However, it should be noted that not all 2025 crypto predictions may be true for Bitcoin, and you should do your research before investing in any token. 2. By the end of 2025, will Ethereum reach $10,000? According to top projections, $6K is fair during a bull market, with potential upside to $10K assuming both ETFs and Layer 2 provide steady capital flows. More affordable models have an ETH cap of $4.5K to $5.2K. However, long-term cryptocurrency predictions are dependent on macroeconomic events, so do your research before investing in any cryptocurrency. 3. What motivates altcoins like as ARB, DOT, and AVAX? TVL, development activity, governance updates, and cross-chain integrations are among the on-chain factors that have a significant impact on these tokens. The factors that drive upside—or lack thereof—are the expansion of TVL on Arbitrum, Polkadot’s parachain victories, and the use of Avalanche and Chainlink by enterprises.

2025-07-07T12:34:32,"BRICS, Fed, tariffs, and earnings: Market reports to watch this week","Markets are running high with record closes across the S&P and Nasdaq, but investors might have to wait. The week ahead is fully dominated by a mix of geopolitics, Federal Reserve policy signals, high-stakes trade decisions from the Trump administration, and corporate earnings. Investors are eyeing a packed agenda that includes Monday’s BRICS Summit, Amazon’s extended four-day Prime Day starting Tuesday, and two key macro moments on Wednesday. The week also features the release of the Fed’s June meeting minutes and the expiration of the 90-day moratorium on Trump’s “ Liberation Day ” tariffs. The Federal Reserve will dominate this week’s market agenda On Monday, BRICS leaders gather for a highly anticipated summit that could further solidify the bloc’s alternative financial ambitions. Their alignment may be exactly what US President Donald Trump is targeting. The upcoming tariff deadline is drawing particular scrutiny, and Trump is expected to finalize a new round of “reciprocal” duties by July 9. The implementation is set for August 1. While trade deals have been announced with the US, Vietnam, and China, several countries remain at risk. On Sunday, Trump threatened 10% extra tariffs on countries “aligned with anti-American BRICS policies”. Tuesday will see US Consumer Credit Data Insight into household debt and spending habits. This is a key signal for recession risk . On the other hand, Amazon’s Prime Day will also serve as a consumer sentiment litmus test. With this year’s event extended to four days, the retail giant is hoping to build on last year’s record-setting sales. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s June minutes will offer fresh insight into policymakers’ views as markets continue to recalibrate interest rate cuts. Last week’s US employment data revealed stronger-than-expected job growth in June. Meanwhile, private sector hiring was the weakest in eight months, and the average workweek shrank. This suggests that labor market momentum may be losing steam. Thursday’s US jobless claims and Tuesday’s consumer credit figures could influence sentiment. Europe flat ahead of tariff risks Equities surged last week as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs . S&P 500 stood at 6,279.35 while Nasdaq maintained 20,601. The Dow is hovering near its peak, still, analysts warn that the rally is increasingly fragile. However, European markets were muted Monday as investors braced for trade shockwaves from a looming tariff blitz. The STOXX 600 held flat at 541.15, with regional indexes split: Germany’s DAX edged higher, while the CAC 40, IBEX, and FTSE dipped slightly in early trading. Meanwhile, the US dollar remains under pressure near multi-year lows, with FX markets particularly sensitive to any trade headlines. Risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars have already dipped ahead of central bank decisions in those countries this week. The global digital assets market surged marginally to remain above the $3.36 trillion cap mark. Its 24-hour trading volume is at $92 billion. The biggest crypto , Bitcoin, is up by 3% over the last 30 days and is trading at an average price of $108,615 at press time.

2025-07-07T12:33:02,"Crypto Investment Products See $1 Billion Weekly Inflows Despite Volatility","Cryptocurrency investment vehicles continued to attract significant capital last week, even as the broader market faced price swings. CoinShares reported $1.04 billion in inflows into crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) for the week ending Friday. Bitcoin Still Dominates, But Interest in Ether Grows Bitcoin-related ETPs led the inflows, attracting $790 million, which represents 76% of the weekly total. While this is a strong showing, it marks a slowdown from the previous three weeks, where average weekly inflows hit $1.5 billion. CoinShares’ James Butterfill noted the decline may indicate investor caution as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high. Ethereum-related products also saw sustained interest, with $225 million in inflows. That makes it 11 consecutive weeks of gains for Ether ETPs. Butterfill highlighted that weekly inflows during this run averaged 1.6% of AUM—twice the rate of Bitcoin’s 0.8%—suggesting a shift in investor sentiment. BlackRock and the U.S. Lead the Charge BlackRock was the top issuer last week, attracting $436 million in new funds, or 42% of the total inflows. Regionally, the U.S. led with $1 billion in inflows, followed by Germany and Switzerland with $38.5 million and $33.7 million, respectively.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-investment-products-see-1-billion-weekly-inflows-despite-volatility/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

BBVA has fully integrated these cryptocurrency services within its proprietary mobile platform, operating independently without relying on external service providers or third-party custodial solutions. Breaking: Spain's major bank BBVA has rolled out trading and custody services for $BTC and $ETH directly in its mobile app for retail customers. Get ready for a surge of capital into the crypto market! pic.twitter.com/ccXoPsWOCf — Crypto Jessica (@CryptoJessXBT) July 7, 2025 The bank’s approach allows customers to execute transactions autonomously while maintaining that it does not offer investment advisory services. BBVA’s 4-Year Crypto Journey Reaches Spain According to an official release dated July 4, the cryptocurrency service launch stems from regulatory approval obtained through Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) in March 2025. Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 This licensing framework authorizes BBVA to provide cryptocurrency services to all customers who meet legal age requirements. “ Our objective is to simplify cryptocurrency investment for retail customers in Spain through an accessible and user-friendly digital platform available on their mobile devices ,” stated Gonzalo Rodríguez, BBVA’s head of retail banking for Spain. The service architecture ensures compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which establishes comprehensive standards for cryptocurrency-related services across EU member states. BBVA’s Spanish cryptocurrency initiative builds upon the success of its Swiss operations. In June 2021, BBVA Switzerland pioneered the bank’s cryptocurrency offerings by introducing Bitcoin custody and trading services for private banking clientele Spain's BBVA, with $782 billion of total assets, is launching a #bitcoin trading service for private clients in Switzerland, due to ""significant desire"" among investors. — Documenting ₿itcoin (@DocumentingBTC) June 18, 2021 The Swiss division has since diversified its cryptocurrency portfolio to encompass Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and AVAX, successfully attracting both institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Recent reports from June 18 indicate that BBVA has been recommending portfolio allocations of 3% to 7% in cryptocurrencies for its affluent clients. Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, indicated that the bank currently advises clients to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum investments , with plans to introduce additional cryptocurrencies later this year. “ A 3% portfolio allocation to cryptocurrency represents manageable risk exposure ,” Meyer explained. “ In a balanced portfolio structure, introducing 3% cryptocurrency allocation can enhance overall performance. “ Expanding Stablecoin Services See 9% of Spaniards Own Crypto, While 95% of EU Banks Stay Away Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, BBVA has incorporated USDC stablecoin services into its offerings. In September 2024, the bank extended its cryptocurrency custody and trading capabilities to include USD Coin for institutional and private banking clients in Switzerland. This expansion enables clients to trade, hold, or convert USDC into euros, dollars, or other currencies with near-instantaneous execution. The bank noted that investment fund managers and large corporations frequently utilize stablecoins like USDC to accelerate transactions across various cryptocurrency exchanges. Additionally, stablecoins serve as a hedge against cryptocurrency volatility by allowing investors to preserve asset value during market fluctuations. Despite approximately 95% of EU banks avoiding cryptocurrency services due to the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) cautious regulatory stance, Spain’s cryptocurrency market has demonstrated substantial growth. Europe's crypto regulation will be its biggest mistake since the dotcom era: – EU imposing MiCA – US embracing crypto – Major players leaving EU – $499B+ in crypto flowing through Eastern Europe Is crypto's future in Europe doomed? Here's the full breakdown: pic.twitter.com/mZIi79cru3 — Alessandro Palombo (@thealepalombo) December 16, 2024 A 2024 European Central Bank survey, published in January 2025, revealed that nearly 9% of Spanish citizens now hold digital assets , representing more than double the figure from 2022. Spain’s cryptocurrency adoption rate now equals that of France and Croatia within the Eurozone, though it remains below Slovenia’s 15% adoption rate and Greece’s 14% ownership levels. Between 2023 and 2024 alone, Spain received over $80 billion worth of cryptocurrency, making it the 5th largest European country with the most crypto value received.

2025-07-07T12:17:43,"Market Strategist Sets Timeline for $10 Trillion XRP Market Cap","A bold forecast from prominent X user and market strategist 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 is shaking up conversations across the crypto space: XRP could reach a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. According to the strategist, the future of finance isn’t about outdated comparisons to traditional systems; it’s about real utility at a scale the world has never seen before. XRP and the Rise of Utility-Based Valuation 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 argues that market participants must stop comparing crypto valuations to legacy systems that are quickly becoming obsolete. In his view, XRP isn’t just another digital asset; it’s a critical infrastructure layer for a new financial system , powering real-time, borderless payments. This vision is anchored in Ripple’s long-standing goal to build the Internet of Value, where money moves as quickly and seamlessly as data does today. Unlike many crypto assets that rely heavily on speculation, XRP has a clear utility: it serves as a bridge currency for fast, cost-effective cross-border settlements. This makes it uniquely positioned to address global liquidity demands, particularly as financial institutions and governments explore blockchain-based payment rails. XRP will hit a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Stop comparing market caps to old systems. This is utility-driven value on a scale humanity’s never seen. Bitcoin sits at $2T for just existing. Tell me… what problem is it solving today? Where’s the real utility? Or is it just… — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) July 6, 2025 Questioning Bitcoin’s Real-world Utility In making his case, 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 draws a sharp contrast between XRP and Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin commands a $2 trillion market cap essentially for existing, despite lacking direct utility in solving modern financial inefficiencies. “Tell me… what problem is it solving today?” he asks. While Bitcoin is often touted as digital gold, it is slow, expensive, and energy-intensive, limiting its functionality in daily finance or institutional operations. XRP, on the other hand, is already integrated into RippleNet and the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, which enables instant settlement between fiat currencies using XRP as a bridge. Its recent advancements, including the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, are only strengthening its real-world value proposition. Legal Clarity and Institutional Confidence Another key advantage of XRP is regulatory certainty. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets , removing a major cloud of uncertainty. This landmark decision gave Ripple the green light to scale its operations globally and attract institutional interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 With increasing partnerships across the banking sector, support for CBDC infrastructure, and expanding corridors for cross-border payments, XRP’s foundational role in future financial systems is becoming harder to ignore. A $10 Trillion Reality? While a $10 trillion market cap may seem ambitious through today’s lens , 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 urges the market to reconsider what’s possible when global finance becomes tokenized. The Internet of Value isn’t just a theory; it’s already unfolding. If XRP becomes the backbone of that system, its valuation will reflect global demand for fast, neutral, and scalable settlement infrastructure. The message is clear: the future of finance belongs to utility, and XRP may just be the asset leading the charge.
