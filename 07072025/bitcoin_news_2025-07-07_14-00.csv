In the past seven days, ETH has gained over 4.5% , and in just the last 24 hours, it’s jumped more than 2.3% . Now, whale activity and exchange data suggest something bigger may be coming. Ethereum Whales Make Bold Moves According to on-chain reports , a major Ethereum whale has withdrawn 6,989 ETH (worth around $17.5 million) from Binance over the past three weeks. Just recently, the same wallet removed 1,900 ETH, valued at nearly $4.86 million, from the exchange.This kind of large-scale withdrawal reduces exchange liquidity, and if demand surges while supply dips, it could lead to a supply shock—a classic recipe for a price rally. Ethereum Exchange Reserve Drops The latest data shows that Ethereum exchange reserves are steadily falling: Total exchange reserve now : 18,962,692 ETH On May 1 : 19,576,503 ETH Binance ETH reserve : 4,947,990 ETH This drop suggests more ETH is being moved to cold wallets or DeFi platforms—an indicator of long-term holding sentiment among investors. Ethereum Price Performance: Steady Climb ETH price on July 1 : $2,405.08 ETH price now : $2,562.97 7-day growth : 4.5% 24-hour surge : 2.3% For weeks, ETH has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700. A breakout above this range could confirm bullish momentum. [post_titles_links postid=”479395″] Ethereum Technicals: Bullish Signs in Play 50-day SMA : $2,532.12 100-day SMA : $2,211 200-day SMA : $2,492.99 RSI : 54.49 (neutral) The 50-day SMA is above the 100 and 200-day SMAs—indicating short- to mid-term bullish momentum. The neutral RSI means ETH still has room to grow without entering overbought territory. What’s Next for Ethereum? If the current whale accumulation trend continues and ETH breaks above $2,700, analysts expect a move toward $3,000 and possibly beyond. A shrinking exchange supply and bullish technicals could fuel that breakout.

2025-07-07T11:48:09,"Experienced Analyst Says ""A Big Rise Is Coming in Altcoins Even by the End of 2023"", Announces His Bitcoin Price Prediction!","Famous cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe claimed in his assessments on social media that a major rise is on the horizon in the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. According to Van de Poppe, the market is preparing for a bigger rally by the end of 2023. Van de Poppe said, “The Altcoin Season Index shows that a massive altcoin season is about to begin. Over the last 5 years, this index has bottomed every summer, especially in June. “Then we saw a strong rally in altcoins in the second half of the year,” he said. According to the analyst, we are currently in the middle of a bull market and global quantitative easing (QE) policies are expected to ease. According to the analyst, this could be a sign of a much bigger movement in the last quarter of 2023. Van de Poppe also made the following striking predictions for the Bitcoin price: Bitcoin in Q3: $150,000 Bitcoin in the fourth quarter: $250,000 The analyst also argued that the volatility in Bitcoin has decreased significantly, which is a sign of a major price movement. He noted that the M2 money supply is already increasing rapidly, and the possibility of an interest rate cut is quite close. Drawing attention to the valuations of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe said, “Due to macroeconomic conditions, the values of altcoins against BTC are at rock bottom. This shows that we are in the depression phase of the cycle. After this phase, the bull phase will begin.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Ives says that tech stocks will continue to surge as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution keeps moving along. “I think we’re just beginning this golden age for tech. And the reason I think tech stocks are up 10 to 15% in the second half of the year is because the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI, they’re just starting to play out. I mean, when you look across software, you look across semis, you look across the consumer report. And to me, that’s really the focus here – is that as the AI revolution plays out, that’s how I think you get to Nasdaq 22,000 or 23,000.” Ives goes on to note that he views price dips along the way up not as risky scenarios that should be avoided, but rather as opportunities for traders to get in the game. “I view those as opportunities. I mean my whole career, those are the opportunities, if you think the fundamental stories are playing out. And I think when it comes to tech, this is just starting. I think it’s a three-year tech bull market still ahead of us.” The Nasdaq Composite is at 20,601 points at time of writing, a 1.02% increase during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-07T11:30:18,"XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts","XRP’s market dominance may be on the verge of a historic breakout, with analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) suggesting the token could command as much as 30% of the entire crypto market cap in this cycle—representing a fivefold surge from current levels. 30% XRP Dominance? The bold projection stems from an emerging bullish structure on the XRP dominance chart, reinforced by a key technical signal: the three-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken its multi-year downtrend for the first time since XRP’s last local highs. This shift, visible on the attached chart, signals a significant change in market dynamics, potentially marking the beginning of a new accumulation-driven expansion. The analyst argues that XRP dominance has completed a textbook Wyckoff accumulation pattern. “We’ve pretty much completed a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, and I would argue we’re nearing the end of Phase D and about to enter Phase E,” they noted. According to the Wyckoff method, Phase E represents the breakout phase, where assets typically enter strong markup periods after prolonged accumulation. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen This interpretation is supported by a side-by-side comparison of the theoretical Wyckoff schematic overlaid directly on XRP dominance price action. The analyst specifically points to the recent “Last Point of Support” (LPS) as confirmation that XRP is transitioning toward breakout territory, having already completed the “Spring” phase—a final shakeout that traps late sellers before a sustained rally. “If that’s correct, we should see significant upside in XRP dominance,” the analyst continued, adding that the signal is particularly meaningful when viewed on the three-day timeframe, which filters out short-term noise and emphasizes broader cyclical trends. In terms of concrete targets, the analyst acknowledges that consensus among market participants remains modest, with many expecting a peak in XRP dominance around 14%. However, CryptoInsightUK argues this is a gross underestimation of potential upside in the event that XRP reclaims narrative leadership in the crypto space. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $9 In Euphoric Fifth Wave, Elliott Wave Analyst Predicts “I believe we could push as high as 20%. There’s even a possibility we reach broader capital inflows accompanying a Bitcoin breakout to new all-time highs. Many are calling for a top around 14% dominance, but I believe we could push as high as 20%,” the analyst wrote. “There’s even a possibility we reach 30%, though I’m personally targeting the 20% zone, which would represent a 5x increase in dominance from current levels.” XRP’s current market dominance sits below 6%, making the analyst’s 20–30% target not just ambitious but transformative. It would mark the first time since the early XRP rally days in 2017 that XRP commanded such a share of the crypto market. The broader context driving this thesis is the possibility of a liquidity-driven crypto cycle, catalyzed by Bitcoin achieving new highs and investor capital rotating into alternative assets. “If this coincides with Bitcoin breaking out to new all-time highs and broader capital flowing into the market, I believe we could witness a major price expansion for XRP—one that few are currently expecting,” the analyst added. At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.

2025-07-07T11:30:14,"Tariff Deadline Nears— Will it Renew Trade Tensions or be the Catalyst for Crypto Bull Run?","The post Tariff Deadline Nears— Will it Renew Trade Tensions or be the Catalyst for Crypto Bull Run? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The financial world is bracing for a pivotal moment on July 09, 2025, when the US’s temporary suspension of its new tariff regime expires. Initially dubbed ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump, carry implications far beyond traditional trade routes. Soon after the announcement, the crypto markets and the traditional markets were disrupted, causing a major drop. Now that the deadline is approaching, the question arises whether this deadline will reignite a global tariff war or it could unexpectedly serve as a bullish catalyst for the crypto market and Bitcoin price . Understanding the July 09 Deadline The July 09 deadline marks the end of a 90-day suspension on sweeping tariffs proposed by the US earlier in 2025. These tariffs were designed to punish countries with persistent trade imbalances or those seen as having unfair trade practices. The US government offered temporary relief in April, giving trade partners time to negotiate deals or face new levies. If the agreement is not reached by the deadline, the full weight of tariffs could take effect by early August, sparking fears of renewed global trade conflict. Market Sentiment: Calm Before the Storm? Interestingly, traditional markets have remained relatively stable in the lead-up to the July 09 deadline. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ have both shown resilience, while the U.S.Dollar Index (DXY) has slipped over 6% since April, which is believed to be the worst start to a year since 1973. Some analysts believe much of the tariff uncertainty is already priced into equities, though volatility is expected to spike if no trade resolutions are announced. Moreover, the safe-haven asset, Gold, has seen a rise in inflows, indicating that investors are preparing for a potential geopolitical fallout. Crypto Markets Reacting Ahead of Time Unlike traditional markets, the crypto markets appear to be thriving in this ocean of uncertainty. Bitcoin price has surged past $108,500, while Ethereum & other altcoins have posted significant gains. Several factors contribute to this bullish sentiment, including a weaker USD, decentralised hedge and rising market confidence. Therefore, the crypto markets are expected to face a short-term pullback if tensions escalate or if the countries reach out to make a deal, then the Bitcoin price is expected to experience a significant bullish push. Scenario Analysis: Three Possible Outcomes Firstly, if the US resumes tariffs without any new deals, global trade could deteriorate rapidly, stocks may plunge, inflation could spike, and crypto may initially fall in a risk-off panic. Besides, if the deadline is extended, which is expected to be more likely, risk appetite could return across all sectors. Stocks & crypto may rise if traders see this as a sign of market-friendly policy. On the other hand, if a comprehensive resolution is reached, it could lead to bullish sentiment across global markets. This may even cause a breakout, propelling the Bitcoin price towards new highs. Wrapping it Up! The July 09 tariff deadline is more than just a bureaucratic market, representing a turning point for the global economy and the evolving crypto ecosystem. Whether it triggers a new trade war or serves as a launchpad for crypto depends entirely on how global leaders navigate these final hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/tariff-deadline-nears-will-it-renew-trade-tensions-or-be-the-catalyst-for-crypto-bull-run/,"MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T11:26:50,"Expert Says XRP Could Be About to Explode Past Its Biggest Wall. Here’s Why","XRP is approaching one of the most critical levels in its recent trading history, and analysts say the outcome could define the next phase of its market cycle. According to crypto researcher Ripple Van Winkle, a breakout past $2.33 could unleash a major rally, and institutional investors are already paying close attention. A Crucial Technical Breakout Zone At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.26, marking a 1.84% increase in the past 24 hours. The asset is now pressing up against the $2.33 resistance level, which perfectly aligns with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator that often marks bullish reversals in long-term price trends. Top crypto analyst Steph has labeled $2.33 as the pivotal level for XRP . “Break it,” he said, “and bulls are eyeing $2.60 next.” This price region hasn’t been touched in months, and clearing it could set the stage for a swift move higher. BREAKING: XRP could be about to explode past its biggest wall in months. Almost no one is ready for what happens if $2.33 gets smashed. Here’s why the smart money is watching $XRP right now : — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) July 6, 2025 Ripple’s U.S. Banking License Ambition While technical indicators point to a possible breakout, there’s growing excitement around Ripple’s strategic push for a U.S. national banking charter . If approved, Ripple would become the first blockchain-based company to obtain such a license, granting it legitimacy and regulatory recognition that could massively benefit XRP’s adoption across the financial sector. This move would enable Ripple to offer banking services directly, bypassing intermediaries and strengthening XRP’s use case as a bridge asset between crypto and fiat ecosystems. XRP ETF Approval Odds Surge Another major catalyst is the rising possibility of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Ripple Van Winkle points out that Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to an approval, citing a more favorable regulatory climate and mounting pressure from major asset managers. An XRP ETF would represent a breakthrough for institutional involvement, offering traditional investors direct exposure to the asset through regulated financial products. If approved, this could bring billions in fresh capital into the XRP market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Chart Patterns Confirm Momentum From a technical standpoint, XRP/BTC has just broken out of a classic falling wedge pattern, a historically reliable bullish reversal signal. This formation suggests the downtrend has likely been exhausted and that buying momentum is beginning to build, especially as XRP strengthens against Bitcoin. This chart structure adds further weight to the case for an upward move, especially if $2.33 is breached in the coming days. Downside Risks and Key Support Levels Despite the bullish outlook, analysts caution that $2.33 remains a formidable barrier. If XRP fails to break through, strong support sits at $2.00, a level that has repeatedly held during pullbacks in recent months. However, with momentum across technical and fundamental fronts aligning, many believe XRP is on the verge of a breakout that could define the next major chapter of the crypto market. The Bottom Line Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. banking license, rising ETF approval odds, and powerful technical indicators are converging in real-time. Ripple Van Winkle and other experts say this may be XRP’s biggest breakout opportunity in months. If $2.33 is cleared, XRP could rapidly accelerate toward $2.60 and beyond, potentially leading the next wave of crypto gains. Few are prepared for what could come next. But the smart money is already watching—and waiting. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A series of macro events are set to unfold and how these events play out could impact both prices and regulations. A hawkish tone from policymakers could weigh on risk assets like Bitcoin, while dovish signals might give crypto markets a boost. July 8 – Consumer Credit Data Consumer credit data will be released on Tuesday, which will offer key insight into consumer confidence and economic sentiment. A lower-than-expected reading would mean growing caution among consumers. This shift in trend would push some investors toward Bitcoin. A hawkish read could strengthen the U.S. dollar and put pressure on Bitcoin, while a dovish tone may support crypto markets by boosting risk appetite. July 9 – FOMC Minutes All eyes are next on the FOMC minutes, which will be released this Wednesday. The minutes will offer insights into the central bank’s stance during its May meeting, where it chose to hold interest rates steady. With inflation still above the Fed’s 2% target, investors are eager to see whether the tone in the minutes leans hawkish, hinting at fewer rate cuts or if there is a change in plan. July 9 – Key Hearing by Senate Banking Committee The U.S. Senate Banking Committee will hold a key hearing on July 9 to decide if tokens like XRP should be classified as securities or commodities. The hearing will focus on a new bill that aims to clearly define which crypto tokens are securities (regulated by the SEC) and which are commodities (regulated by the CFTC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and experts from the Blockchain Association, Chainalysis, and Paradigm will also testify. This could also pave the way for altcoin ETFs later this year. July 9 – Digital Assets Tax Policy The U.S. House will hold a hearing this Wednesday to discuss how the U.S. can lead in the crypto space. Titled “ Making America the Crypto Capital of the World, ” the focus will be on creating a modern tax policy framework tailored for digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins. Fox Journalist Eleanor Terrett has recently shared that the crypto hearing is delayed as the House is out this week. A new date is yet to be announced. July 10 – Initial Jobless Claims Initial Jobless claims will be released on Thursday. The report shows how many people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time. Economists expect a slight uptick to 235,000, up from 233,000 the week before. If the claims rise, it may indicate a weakening labor market, boosting hopes for Fed rate cuts. This could boost bitcoin as well. But if claims drop, the dollar could get stronger and crypto might take a hit. “Crypto Week” Ahead Looking ahead to the next week, starting July 14, the U.S. House is all set to kick off the “Crypto Week.” Lawmakers will vote on three major crypto-related bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Act.

2025-07-07T11:15:16,"Trouble may be on the horizon as Bitcoin mempool runs close to historical lows","The Bitcoin blockchain is showing signs of declining user activity, despite the coin trading close to all-time highs. Bitcoin is changing hands slightly under $109,000, 2.7% less than its all-time high value, on an uptick of 7% from its 14-day lows, per Coingecko data. On Saturday, only around 5,000 transactions were waiting in the Bitcoin mempool, the virtual queue where unconfirmed transactions are held before being added to the blockchain by miners. At press time, the number had risen to 15,000, still a fraction of the 150,000 seen in late 2024 when BTC first crossed the $100,000 mark, according to Blockchain.com. Market fears low activity could become a permanent issue Last Saturday, podcaster and Bitcoin advocate Joel Valanzuela shared his sentiment on X that the drop in transactions signals a profound issue with actual network utility. “ Simply put, almost all of Bitcoin’s actual users have gone away.

Either the Bitcoin network goes bankrupt, undergoes major changes, or the asset becomes a completely custodial asset run by governments and institutions. ” Since March, mempool transaction counts have fluctuated between 3,000 and 30,000.

At… pic.twitter.com/Kbk3j1e8c1 — Joel Valenzuela (@TheDesertLynx) July 5, 2025 Joao Wedson, CEO of crypto analytics platform Alphractal, believes the low mempool numbers are due to a lack of retail participation. “ When mempool transactions begin to rise again, it’s a clear sign that retail is back, because the growing backlog reflects increased demand for using the network ,” Wedson asserted. Institutional inflow is not filling the gap In its report published on July 3, Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant found that spot demand for Bitcoin was weakening, even though large institutions continue to acquire BTC through ETFs and treasury allocations. The report mentioned that net Bitcoin demand contracted by roughly 895,000 BTC over the past 30 days, suggesting that buying from ETFs and companies like Strategy (MicroStrategy) is insufficient to offset declines. Data on the analysis shows that ETF purchases over a 30-day period have dropped from 86,000 BTC on December 7, 2024, to 71,000 BTC by May 18, 2025, and further down to 40,000 BTC currently, a 53% decline. Strategy’s buying spree also fell to 16,000 BTC in the past 30 days, a downtick of 90% from its peak of 171,000 BTC in December. CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Traders’ Behavior Dominance metric shows most market participants took profits after BTC reached $110,000 in late June. After the coin saw a pullback to $107,500, traders reportedly opened new short positions as BTC fell below $105,000, backing their bearish belief in the geopolitical differences between Israel and Iran. “ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of bitcoin demand, overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases,” the analysis read. “The acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies.” The slowdown could mean institutional demand may no longer be enough to support the current price levels. Large-scale buyers may be reassessing their accumulation strategies. The Bitcoin treasury game may not work for everybody Speaking in a recent interview with Bloomberg, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said he was uncertain how sustainable corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies are. Scaramucci stated that while companies are copying what Michael Saylor and Strategy have been doing to make BTC purchases, the trend may not continue. He added that Strategy may be an exception because of its diversified Bitcoin-related operations. “ Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now ,” Scaramucci continued, “ I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This investor, who has been liquidated many times before, seems to continue opening short positions until all of his collateral is melted. @qwatio, whose position had dropped to $43.68 million on July 3, recovered some of his position and added positions again as the Bitcoin price pulled back slightly.

2025-07-07T11:11:31,"Institutional Bitcoin Buying Loses Steam as Political Support Rises","Bitcoin is holding steady near $109,000 but is facing signs of weakening demand, with institutional purchases by firms like Strategy and ETF inflows slowing significantly in recent weeks. At the same time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has launched the America Party, a new political initiative that openly supports Bitcoin. While Musk’s backing gives the cryptocurrency fresh political visibility, analysts note that declining spot demand and limited retail participation continue to weigh on price performance. Bitcoin Hovers at $109K as Demand Weakens Despite Institutional Interest Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at approximately $109,451, marking a 0.8% rise over the past week and a 4.5% gain over the last month.. Yet, even with steady institutional interest and a favorable macro backdrop, the world’s largest digital asset remains stuck in a consolidation range, leaving many market watchers questioning what it will take to reignite a meaningful rally. Institutional Support Can't Offset Shrinking Spot Demand Despite prominent institutional moves — including Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) continuing to accumulate BTC, and sustained inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) — a new report from CryptoQuant reveals a stark disconnect between institutional buying and overall market demand. “ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of bitcoin demand, but overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases,” CryptoQuant noted. “The acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies.” The data is sobering. Over the past 30 days alone, demand for BTC has contracted by approximately 895,000 coins. That drop dwarfs the combined impact of institutional purchases, which have slowed significantly compared to their December highs. At the end of last year, ETFs absorbed 86,000 BTC and MSTR bought 171,000. In stark contrast, ETFs purchased just 40,000 BTC last month, while MSTR’s acquisitions fell to a mere 16,000 BTC. Perhaps even more telling than institutional flows is the state of Bitcoin’s mempool — the waiting room for unconfirmed transactions. At present, the mempool is nearly empty, a strong indicator that retail spot demand is drying up. This suggests that price action is being driven almost entirely by institutions, and with even those flows declining, the upward momentum for BTC appears increasingly unsustainable without fresh demand catalysts. Treasury Strategy Losing Its Shine? The Bitcoin treasury strategy, once a trending narrative with companies emulating Strategy’s aggressive approach, is also coming under scrutiny. Speaking to Bloomberg, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci warned that the replicative BTC-on-the-balance-sheet model is likely to fade. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” said Scaramucci. “So, you know, it will fade.” He clarified that Saylor’s case is unique due to the diversified nature of Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked financial products. However, for newer entrants trying to follow the same playbook, the outlook may not be as promising. “You have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies,” Scaramucci added, urging caution despite his bullishness on Bitcoin overall. Amid the subdued sentiment, Standard Chartered remains one of the few steadfast bulls in the room. The British multinational bank continues to project a $200,000 BTC price target, expressing confidence that the long-term fundamentals of the cryptocurrency remain intact despite current headwinds. This forecast hinges on a belief that regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic shifts — including a weakening dollar and growing de-dollarization — will eventually act as tailwinds for Bitcoin’s price. Looking Ahead: A Breakout or Breakdown? For now, however, Bitcoin is locked in a prolonged consolidation phase with no immediate catalyst in sight. The market appears to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for renewed retail enthusiasm or for a significant macro or technological event that could breathe life back into demand. If institutional purchases continue to slow, and retail remains largely absent, Bitcoin may struggle to maintain its current price level, let alone break past its all-time highs. Still, with the next Bitcoin halving less than a year away and global capital markets watching crypto more closely than ever, many believe that BTC’s quiet phase could be the calm before the next major storm. Elon Musk Forms “America Party” to Challenge US Political Duopoly — Confirms Support for Bitcoin Musk’s announcement came just days after a high-profile public feud with former ally Donald Trump over the recently passed $3.4 trillion “ Big, Beautiful Bill ” — a sweeping spending package Musk called a “disgusting abomination” for its impact on the federal deficit. Now, with the launch of the America Party, the SpaceX and Tesla CEO is calling for a reset of both the political and monetary systems — and Bitcoin is firmly in his vision for the future. “Fiat Is Hopeless”: Musk Pledges Support for Bitcoin The Tesla CEO confirmed the America Party’s pro-Bitcoin stance on Sunday in a reply to a user on X (formerly Twitter) who asked if his new political party would support the digital currency. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” Musk replied — a statement that reverberated through both political and crypto circles alike. The comment adds another layer to Musk’s long-running relationship with cryptocurrencies, which has included Tesla’s brief acceptance of Bitcoin for payments and Musk’s public support of Dogecoin. Now, it appears Bitcoin could be a core part of his vision for a new American political and financial future. In his Saturday announcement, Musk said the America Party was born from frustration with a political establishment he believes has become indistinguishable, especially when it comes to reckless spending. “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” According to Musk, the America Party’s strategy could involve targeting just two or three key Senate seats and up to ten House districts. That, he argues, would be enough to sway tight votes and force both parties to legislate in line with the public’s interests — especially given the razor-thin margins in Congress. Rift With Trump and Growing Political Fault Lines The America Party’s launch comes just a week after Trump signed the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill” into law — a move Musk vocally opposed. The bill’s $3.4 trillion spending plan sparked fury from fiscal conservatives and libertarians, many of whom saw Musk’s criticism as a call to action. Trump, for his part, dismissed Musk’s movement as a fantasy. “Musk has gone completely off the rails,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “A third party has never succeeded in the history of the US” But Musk is betting that history can change. In recent years, public disillusionment with the Republican and Democratic parties has grown, and a 2024 Gallup poll found that 62% of Americans believe a third party is needed. The America Party is already drawing attention from other prominent figures. Mark Cuban, outspoken entrepreneur and crypto investor, has reportedly shown interest. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and a longtime Bitcoin bull, is also said to be exploring involvement with Musk’s initiative. While the America Party has not yet filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), it has already launched an official website and begun attracting early supporters. Musk has not provided a formal platform, but early messaging suggests a strong emphasis on monetary reform, decentralization, and reducing federal bloat — themes that resonate deeply with Bitcoin’s ideological base. Bitcoin as a Political Symbol By backing Bitcoin, Musk is not just endorsing a currency — he’s signaling a rebellion against the traditional monetary system, which he argues is corrupted by inflation and centralized control. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, aligns with the America Party’s broader message of freedom from institutional excess and political graft. This move could attract a new class of crypto-native voters — especially younger Americans disillusioned by the status quo. With blockchain and financial sovereignty becoming increasingly politicized, the America Party could turn Bitcoin into a cornerstone of its identity — much like environmental issues were once adopted by the Green Party. Despite the buzz, political analysts remain skeptical of the America Party’s viability. Third-party efforts in the US have historically failed due to institutional roadblocks, voter polarization, and the winner-takes-all electoral system. Yet Musk’s reach is undeniably vast. With over 180 million followers on X and a loyal fanbase spanning tech, finance, and crypto, even a fringe third-party campaign could shape national conversations — particularly in battleground states where margins are slim. And if nothing else, Musk’s declaration of support for Bitcoin marks a pivotal moment in the political acceptance of digital assets. Bitcoin Politics Enters a New Era Elon Musk’s America Party may still be in its infancy, but its potential impact is already stirring debate in both political and financial arenas. With a core message of fiscal responsibility, decentralization, and freedom — underpinned by support for Bitcoin — Musk is planting a flag for a new kind of political and monetary future. Whether the America Party becomes a serious contender or simply a high-profile protest against the status quo, one thing is clear: Bitcoin is no longer just a financial asset — it’s becoming a political symbol.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9826/institutional-bitcoin-buying-loses-steam-as-political-support-rises,"BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|FIAT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T11:00:18,"Second largest Spanish bank to offer Bitcoin and Ether trading","The leading Spanish bank BBVA will offer direct in-app purchases for BTC and ETH, potentially spreading retail adoption to the Euro area. The bank’s mobile app will offer trading and custody services to all the bank’s users in the Euro area. The second-biggest Spanish bank BBVA will offer crypto trading directly from its mobile app. The bank will offer BTC and ETH trading, as well as custodial services to all its eligible customers. BBVA is working toward institutional crypto infrastructure, competing with native custodial services and other brokerages. BBVA secured the license to offer crypto trading back in March, and has finally implemented the new offers directly in its banking app. The shift in crypto offerings in Europe follows the recent growth in stablecoin usage , showing growing demand for crypto investments from the Euro area. Spanish BBVA to offer settlement and custody for crypto swaps The bank will offer its own native custody and settle all trades, not relying on external platforms. The bank is fully compliant with local regulations for offering crypto assets. The Spanish bank’s move follows the opposite trend in the UK, where banks are tightening their controls with plans to ban crypto swaps or access. “ We want to make it easier for our retail customers in Spain to invest in crypto-assets, through a simple and easy-to-access digital solution on their cell phone,” said Gonzalo Rodríguez, head of retail banking for Spain. “ Our goal is to support them as they explore digital assets, backed by the strength and security of a bank like BBVA.” The inclusion of crypto follows the general expansion of bank-related fintech apps. The industry is expected to reach $394B in 2025, as more banking services shift to automation and app-based tasks. BBVA expands to retail activity BBVA has already made forays in crypto trading, though limiting the offers to accredited investors and large-scale traders. The bank first offered crypto services in Switzerland in 2021, later branching into the Turkish market through its subsidiary Garanti BBVA. “ Following this launch in Spain, BBVA has added another country to its digital assets service, which was first introduced in Switzerland in 2021, followed by Turkey in 2023,” said Francisco Maroto, head of digital assets. Recently, the bank also recommended BTC to its accredited investors and wealthy clients. The bank has suggested a 7% portfolio allocation to crypto. BBVA’s mobile offer arrives at a time when retail buying of crypto has slowed down, displaced by large-scale deals to build corporate treasuries. Some retail buyers may go through ETFs or ETPs, depending on market availability. Direct mobile access appeals to newer cohorts of investors. The only obstacle to BBVA’s offer is the shift to third-party custody. The EU regulations have been stricter about self-custody wallet, requiring that all users declare and de-anonymize their wallets when interacting with brokerages. Crypto ownership is expanding in the Euro area, with an estimated penetration of over 30%. By the end of 2026, a total of 268.15M users are expected to own at least some crypto assets. Europe has been targeted by multiple existing exchanges securing MiCAR licenses, while the move by BBVA shows banks may be ready to enter the game and offer their own infrastructure.

2025-07-07T11:00:11,"Bitcoin Soars: The Blockchain Group’s Astounding 1348% Return on Crypto Investment","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Soars: The Blockchain Group’s Astounding 1348% Return on Crypto Investment In the dynamic world of digital assets, a significant move by a prominent French entity has once again turned heads. The Blockchain Group, a name synonymous with innovation in the blockchain space, recently announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a testament to a strategic vision that has yielded phenomenal returns, highlighting the growing confidence of corporations in the king of cryptocurrencies. Let’s dive deep into what this means for The Blockchain Group, the broader market, and what lessons can be drawn from their remarkable crypto investment journey. Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal: Why Corporations Are Doubling Down? Bitcoin , often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ continues to cement its position as a valuable asset in the global financial landscape. Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive option for companies looking to diversify their treasury reserves or simply capitalize on its long-term growth potential. The Blockchain Group’s latest acquisition of an additional 116 BTC, valued at approximately €10.7 million ($12.59 million), underscores this prevailing trend. This move isn’t isolated; it reflects a broader shift where more and more corporations are recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of a robust financial strategy. Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin offers a compelling alternative to traditional fiat currencies, whose purchasing power can erode over time. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins acts as a natural safeguard against inflationary pressures. Store of Value: Over its history, Bitcoin has demonstrated its capacity to retain and increase value over long periods, making it an appealing store of value, especially for companies with long-term financial horizons. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet can provide diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. The Blockchain Group’s Bold Move: A Deep Dive into Their Digital Asset Strategy The recent announcement from The Blockchain Group on X (formerly Twitter) wasn’t just about adding 116 BTC; it was about solidifying their position as a forward-thinking entity in the digital realm. This latest purchase brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,904 BTC. To put this into perspective, such a substantial holding places them among a growing list of public companies that have embraced Bitcoin as a treasury asset. What makes The Blockchain Group’s move particularly noteworthy is the incredible return on investment they have already achieved. With a year-to-date (YTD) return of 1,348.8%, their strategic foresight has clearly paid off. This figure is not just a number; it represents a profound understanding of the evolving financial landscape and a willingness to act decisively. Their digital asset strategy appears to be rooted in conviction and a long-term perspective on Bitcoin’s value proposition. This level of return speaks volumes about the potential of early and sustained adoption of digital assets. While past performance is not indicative of future results, it certainly provides a compelling case study for other corporations contemplating similar moves. Unpacking the Phenomenal Return: What Does 1,348.8% YTD Mean for Crypto Investment? A YTD return of 1,348.8% is nothing short of extraordinary in any investment class, let alone in the often-volatile world of cryptocurrencies. For those new to the term, Year-to-Date (YTD) return measures the percentage change in an investment’s value from the beginning of the current calendar year up to the present date. In The Blockchain Group’s case, it means that for every euro or dollar they invested in Bitcoin at the start of the year, it has grown by over thirteen times its initial value. This phenomenal success highlights several key aspects of crypto investment : Market Cycles and Timing: While it’s impossible to perfectly time the market, significant returns often come from entering during accumulation phases and holding through bull runs. The Blockchain Group’s existing holdings suggest a long-term commitment that has allowed them to ride the waves of Bitcoin’s market cycles. Conviction and Patience: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Achieving such returns requires not only an initial investment but also the conviction to hold through dips and the patience to wait for long-term growth. Understanding Fundamental Value: Companies that achieve such returns often have a deep understanding of the underlying technology and the fundamental value proposition of the assets they invest in, rather than just speculating on price movements. Such a return serves as a powerful beacon for other corporate treasuries, demonstrating the potential for substantial capital appreciation when a well-researched and executed digital asset strategy is put into place. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Implications of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is gaining momentum, and The Blockchain Group’s latest move only adds to this narrative. Pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, the concept of corporate Bitcoin holdings has evolved from a fringe idea to a mainstream treasury management consideration. This shift carries significant implications for both the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital economy. Benefits for Corporations: Enhanced Shareholder Value: A successful Bitcoin strategy can significantly boost a company’s financial performance and, consequently, shareholder value, as seen with The Blockchain Group. Innovation and Brand Image: Embracing digital assets can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers. Access to New Capital Markets: Companies with significant crypto holdings may find new avenues for financing or strategic partnerships within the digital asset ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, which introduces risk to a company’s balance sheet. Robust risk management frameworks are essential. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving, posing potential compliance challenges. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, often requiring companies to treat it as an intangible asset, subject to impairment losses. Despite these challenges, the increasing number of companies like The Blockchain Group making significant Bitcoin investments suggests that the perceived benefits are outweighing the risks for many. Crafting a Winning Digital Asset Strategy: Lessons from The Blockchain Group For businesses and investors contemplating their own foray into the world of cryptocurrencies, The Blockchain Group’s success story offers valuable insights into building a robust digital asset strategy . It’s not merely about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it thoughtfully into a broader financial and operational framework. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Due Diligence: Thorough research into the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory environment is paramount before making any significant investment. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its scarcity, and its network effects. Define Your Objectives: Clearly articulate why you are investing in digital assets. Is it for treasury diversification, capital appreciation, or to facilitate future operations in the Web3 space? Your objectives will guide your strategy. Long-Term Vision: The most significant returns in crypto often come to those with a long-term perspective. Short-term speculation is fraught with higher risks. The Blockchain Group’s consistent holdings indicate a long-term belief in Bitcoin. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management protocols. This includes understanding your risk tolerance, setting clear allocation limits, and potentially hedging strategies. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Continuous learning and staying updated on market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are crucial for adapting your strategy. The Blockchain Group’s journey serves as a powerful case study for how a well-executed strategy can transform a company’s financial outlook through the strategic adoption of digital assets. The Blockchain Group’s latest acquisition of 116 BTC and their staggering 1,348.8% YTD return stand as a powerful testament to the transformative potential of Bitcoin and a well-defined digital asset strategy. Their move not only reinforces the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption but also highlights the significant opportunities that await companies willing to embrace the future of finance. As the digital economy continues to mature, we can expect more entities to follow suit, further integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial operations and potentially reshaping how corporate treasuries are managed worldwide. The era of digital assets is not just coming; it is here, and companies like The Blockchain Group are leading the charge.

2025-07-07T11:00:04,"Bitcoin Historical Pattern Repeats: 30-Day Funding Rate Signals Uptrend Continuation","Bitcoin has been flirting with a breakout above its all-time high since last week, briefly pushing above the $110,000 level but failing to secure a firm close above it. Despite the pullbacks, bulls remain in control, with price action consistently defended above the $105,000 mark—a key support level now acting as a foundation for further upside. This resilient structure suggests that a bullish continuation could soon follow, especially if buying momentum returns in the days ahead. Top analyst Axel Adler shared a compelling signal from the 30-day percentile funding rate across major exchanges. According to his analysis, every time this metric dropped to the 50% level, it marked a local bottom . Each occurrence was followed by a significant trend reversal and resumption of the broader uptrend. As long as funding remains neutral and the price stays above $105K, Bitcoin appears primed for another leg higher. The breakout above all-time highs may just be a matter of time. Bitcoin Funding Rate Patterns Signal Strength Bitcoin is preparing for a major move as it continues to test the area just below its $112,000 all-time high. While bulls remain in control, the lack of follow-through above this critical level has fueled speculation about a possible pullback. Some analysts warn that if BTC fails to break into price discovery soon, it could trigger a sharp correction, potentially sending the price below the $100,000 mark. This growing uncertainty coincides with the broader market cooling off after months of volatility. Interestingly, US stocks are trading at all-time highs, and macroeconomic pressures have begun to ease following six months of instability. Inflation appears to be stabilizing, and investors are regaining confidence across risk-on assets. This shift supports Bitcoin’s bullish long-term thesis, but short-term risks remain in focus. Axel Adler offers a key insight that adds perspective to the current setup. He highlights a consistent pattern in the 30-day percentile funding rate across major exchanges. Each time the metric dropped near the 50% level—seen in September 2023, May 2024, September 2024, and April 2025—it marked a local bottom followed by a strong rally. The last instance in April 2025 preceded a surge to $112K. Currently, the percentile stands at 54%, indicating sustained bullish momentum. However, caution is warranted. If the metric rises toward the 80% level, it could indicate excessive leverage and foreshadow a correction. Until then, Bitcoin appears well-positioned, but its fate depends on whether bulls can finally push it into price discovery, or whether the hesitation opens the door to a larger retrace. BTC Consolidates Near Resistance: Breakout Looks Imminent Bitcoin continues to show resilience near its all-time highs, with the price currently trading around $108,790 on the 12-hour chart. The $109,300 level remains a stubborn resistance zone, having been tested multiple times since May but not yet convincingly broken. However, bulls have repeatedly defended the $103,600 support zone, which aligns with previous consolidation areas and psychological significance. This tight range, between $103,600 and $109,300, has formed a multi-week consolidation pattern, hinting at an imminent breakout. The 50 and 100 simple moving averages (SMAs), currently at $106,318 and $106,596, respectively, are trending upward and providing near-term support. The 200 SMA, located at $98,837, sits far below the current price and highlights the strength of the ongoing macro uptrend. Volume remains relatively neutral, with no signs yet of a major breakout or breakdown, though volatility has compressed slightly, often a precursor to larger moves. If Bitcoin breaks and holds above $109,300, it could quickly accelerate toward new highs and enter price discovery. On the other hand, failure to sustain this level might trigger another retest of $106,000 or even the $103,600 base support. With macro conditions stabilizing and bullish sentiment returning, the next few sessions may decide Bitcoin’s near-term direction.

BBVA, one of Spain’s largest banks, has officially launched Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody services for retail customers through its mobile app. This latest move expands its regulated digital asset offerings across the European Union.The launch follows a regulatory filing with Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) in March 2025. The new service is now available to all Spanish customers of legal age. It enables them to buy, sell, and store crypto assets directly within BBVA’s secure digital banking environment.Unlike many other banks that rely on external exchanges or third-party custodians, BBVA has fully integrated the crypto service into its existing app infrastructure. Customers can initiate crypto transactions independently, though the bank does not provide investment advice on these assets .BBVA Executive ReactsGonzalo Rodríguez, Head of Retail Banking for Spain, explained that BBVA aims to simplify access to crypto for everyday users: “Our goal is to give our retail clients in Spain a straightforward and convenient way to invest in digital currencies directly from their phones.” The offering aligns with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which establishes standardized legal requirements for crypto services across EU member states.Building on Earlier MomentumBBVA previously rolled out similar crypto trading and custody services for private banking clients in Switzerland in 2021 and later expanded to Turkey in 2023 through its subsidiary Garanti BBVA. The Spanish launch marks the bank’s third market for digital assets, but it is the first time BBVA is targeting retail customers directly in its home market.Francisco Maroto, Head of Digital Assets at BBVA, explained that with Spain now joining the bank’s digital assets lineup, BBVA is building on the success it has had in Switzerland and Turkey.He said the bank plans to continue expanding its crypto and tokenized offerings by adding new digital assets such as stablecoins, as well as tokenized versions of traditional investments like bonds and funds, aiming to deliver innovative solutions for its clients.For safeguarding customer assets, BBVA uses its proprietary custody infrastructure. The bank says this gives it complete control over security. It has also indicated plans to introduce additional crypto-assets and tokenized investment products in future updates to the service.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/07/bbva-launches-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-for-retail-customers-in-spain/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bbva-launches-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-for-retail-customers-in-spain,"TRADING|BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T10:50:56,"Bitcoin Boom: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Accumulation Reaches 1,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Boom: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Accumulation Reaches 1,000 BTC The world of finance is constantly evolving, and perhaps no asset has captured global attention quite like Bitcoin . While individual investors have long flocked to its promise, a seismic shift is underway: major corporations are now making significant forays into digital assets. This trend gained fresh momentum recently with a striking announcement from a UK-based tech innovator, signalling a powerful vote of confidence in the future of decentralized finance. The news isn’t just about another purchase; it’s about a strategic milestone that highlights the increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. The Smarter Web Company’s Bold Move: Reaching 1,000 BTC The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, recently made headlines with its latest substantial acquisition of Bitcoin . In a move that underscores their forward-thinking financial strategy, SWC announced via X that they had purchased an additional 226.42 BTC. This significant buy, valued at an impressive £17,871,846 (approximately $24.3 million), catapults their total Bitcoin holdings to a landmark 1,000 BTC. This round number isn’t just a milestone; it represents a formidable asset base, now valued at an estimated £78,228,156 (or $106.5 million), firmly positioning SWC as a notable player in the corporate crypto space. This latest acquisition isn’t an isolated incident but rather a continuation of SWC’s long-term vision to integrate digital assets into its financial framework. Their consistent accumulation demonstrates a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. For many in the traditional finance world, such moves by established companies are pivotal in bridging the gap between conventional investment strategies and the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. Here’s a quick look at the details of SWC’s recent acquisition: Amount Purchased: 226.42 BTC Purchase Price: £17,871,846 ($24.3 million) Total BTC Holdings: 1,000 BTC Total Value of Holdings: £78,228,156 ($106.5 million) Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin? Understanding Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Why are an increasing number of companies, from tech innovators like SWC to established giants, turning their gaze towards Bitcoin ? The phenomenon of institutional Bitcoin adoption is not a fleeting trend but a calculated strategic shift. For many corporate treasuries, the traditional approach of holding large cash reserves in an inflationary environment is becoming less appealing. Bitcoin offers a compelling alternative for several reasons: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, cash reserves held in fiat currencies tend to lose purchasing power over time. Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins) makes it a deflationary asset, positioning it as a potential hedge against inflation. Digital Gold: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with the precious metal, such as scarcity, divisibility, and portability. It serves as a decentralized, global, and permissionless store of value, independent of any single government or financial institution. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer portfolio diversification. Its relatively low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can help reduce overall portfolio risk and potentially enhance returns. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth. Companies are increasingly willing to tolerate short-term price fluctuations for the potential of substantial long-term appreciation. Forward-Thinking Strategy: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s progressive stance and adaptability to the evolving digital economy. It can attract talent, appeal to a tech-savvy customer base, and position the company at the forefront of financial innovation. Companies like MicroStrategy, Square (now Block), and even Tesla have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, paving the way and demonstrating the viability of such a strategy. Their bold moves have spurred discussions among boards and CFOs worldwide, leading to a deeper exploration of digital assets and accelerating the pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption across various sectors. Navigating the Landscape of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Unpacking Crypto Investments While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, holding a significant amount of a volatile asset like Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet isn’t without its complexities. For firms making substantial crypto investments , careful consideration must be given to several factors related to corporate Bitcoin holdings : Key Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically. Companies must have a clear strategy for managing this volatility, which might include dollar-cost averaging, setting clear buy/sell targets, or holding for the long term with no intention to trade short-term. Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to stay abreast of local and international regulations concerning digital asset ownership, taxation, and reporting. Security Protocols: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures. This includes using multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and engaging with specialized crypto custodians to mitigate the risk of hacks or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, as it is often treated as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life. This requires regular impairment testing, which can lead to non-cash charges against earnings if the price drops. Shareholder Perception: Companies must be prepared to communicate their crypto investments strategy clearly to shareholders, addressing concerns about risk while highlighting potential benefits. Companies engaging in significant crypto investments often implement robust risk management frameworks, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and engaging with specialized crypto custodians. They also work closely with legal and accounting professionals to navigate the evolving regulatory and financial reporting landscape. The move by the Smarter Web Company underscores that these challenges are manageable for businesses with a clear vision and robust operational frameworks. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Corporate Treasuries? Actionable Insights for Future Crypto Investments The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a legitimate corporate treasury asset is far from over. As companies like the Smarter Web Company continue to expand their corporate Bitcoin holdings , it sends a clear signal about the increasing confidence in digital assets. This growing trend suggests a future where Bitcoin , and potentially other cryptocurrencies, play a more central role in global finance. What does this mean for other businesses considering similar moves? Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Bitcoin: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the technology, market dynamics, and associated risks before making any crypto investments . Start Small and Scale Up: Begin with a manageable allocation to gain experience and build internal expertise before committing larger sums. Prioritize Security: Invest in top-tier security solutions and consider working with reputable third-party custodians. Seek Expert Advice: Engage with legal, tax, and financial advisors specializing in digital assets to ensure compliance and optimal strategy. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for holding Bitcoin (e.g., long-term store of value, inflation hedge, speculative asset) and stick to it. Communicate Transparently: Prepare to educate and inform stakeholders about your digital asset strategy. The strategic accumulation of Bitcoin by companies like SWC serves as a blueprint for others looking to diversify their treasury holdings and embrace the future of finance. As the digital asset market matures, the infrastructure supporting corporate participation, from custody solutions to regulatory clarity, is also improving, making such moves increasingly viable. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Towards a Digital Future The Smarter Web Company’s latest acquisition of 226.42 BTC, pushing their total holdings to a strategic 1,000 BTC, is more than just a financial transaction. It’s a powerful testament to the growing conviction among forward-thinking businesses regarding the long-term value and strategic importance of Bitcoin . This bold move highlights the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption and the transformative potential of crypto investments in redefining corporate treasury strategies. As the digital asset landscape matures, expect to see more companies following suit, recognizing Bitcoin not just as an alternative asset, but as a fundamental component of a diversified and resilient financial future. SWC’s commitment to corporate Bitcoin holdings is a clear indicator that the digital revolution is not just for individuals but for innovative enterprises ready to lead the charge.

2025-07-07T10:42:39,"Traders Bet Against Bitcoin Rally as Funding Rates Slide on Binance","Bitcoin’s price briefly rose above $109,000 early Monday, as tariff-related volatility fears eased. The Trump administration announced that tariffs would take effect on August 1, providing markets with much-needed breathing room. A key trend emerging amidst the current market conditions is the plunging funding rates. Market Mismatch In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed that funding rates on Binance are steadily declining even as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000-$110,000 range, which means that traders are increasingly opening short positions despite the ongoing rally. The drop in funding rates indicates that many market participants are betting against the current uptrend because they potentially perceive the rally as an opportunity to sell rather than accumulate. However, CryptoQuant stated that this mismatch between price action and market sentiment is creating conditions for short pressure to build, with traders who are betting on a decline facing growing risks of liquidation or forced margin calls. As Bitcoin continues to trade around $109,000, these shorts are gradually squeezed out of the market, which adds additional upward momentum that could fuel a self-reinforcing price surge. Given that Binance remains the largest exchange by trading volume, its funding rates often serve as a proxy for broader market sentiment, which makes this trend significant for traders monitoring potential catalysts for continued price increases. Upside Breakout Potential Last week, two 14-year-old Bitcoin wallets moved 20,000 BTC worth $2.18 billion in rare transactions, which surprised on-chain watchers tracking dormant “Satoshi-era” coins. Despite speculation around potential sell-offs or institutional activity, the market remained unfazed, and BTC’s price held firm above $108,000 after the transfers. The stable price action suggested that traders viewed the movement as a neutral event rather than an immediate sell pressure trigger. Following the market’s composed response, the spotlight is now on whether Bitcoin can build momentum for its next move. Meanwhile, John Bollinger, the inventor of the widely used Bollinger Bands indicator, noted that the leading cryptocurrency looks to be “setting up for an upside breakout,” as it continues consolidating near its all-time highs.

Recently, a significant development emerged from Russia that could redefine the landscape for digital asset miners globally. The Russian Energy Ministry is reportedly taking a bold step by creating a national database of crypto mining equipment. This move isn’t just about tracking hardware; it’s a strategic initiative designed to tackle unauthorized activities and, crucially, to significantly increase the nation’s tax revenue from the burgeoning crypto sector. For anyone involved in Crypto Mining Russia , this is a development that demands close attention. What is the Russian Crypto Regulation Initiative All About? At its core, this new initiative by the Russian Energy Ministry aims to bring transparency and accountability to the country’s crypto mining industry. For years, crypto mining has operated in a somewhat gray area, with varying degrees of official recognition and oversight. This new registry seeks to formalize the industry by creating a comprehensive national database that will track every piece of mining hardware used across the country. Think of it as a centralized inventory system for all mining rigs, from small-scale home operations to large industrial farms. Centralized Data: The registry will collect data on the type, location, and operational status of mining equipment. Official Recognition: It signals a shift towards acknowledging crypto mining as a legitimate, albeit regulated, economic activity. Inter-agency Collaboration: This isn’t just an Energy Ministry project; it’s expected to involve collaboration with tax authorities, law enforcement, and other relevant government bodies. Long-term Vision: This move is part of a broader trend of countries seeking to integrate digital assets into their existing financial and regulatory frameworks. Why a National Mining Registry ? The Goals Behind Russia’s Move The decision to establish a national registry isn’t arbitrary. It’s driven by several key objectives that address both economic and regulatory challenges. Russia, with its abundant and relatively cheap energy resources, has become a significant hub for crypto mining. However, this growth has also presented challenges related to energy consumption, environmental impact, and illicit activities. The primary goals of implementing a National Mining Registry include: Goal Description Expected Outcome Curbing Unauthorized Activities Identifying and penalizing illegal mining operations that bypass regulations, steal electricity, or are used for illicit purposes. Reduced energy theft, improved grid stability, decreased criminal activity related to crypto. Increasing Tax Revenue Bringing mining operations into the formal economy, ensuring they contribute taxes on their profits. Significant boost to state coffers, funding for public services. Energy Grid Management Monitoring and managing the substantial energy consumption of mining farms to prevent overloads and ensure stable power supply. More efficient energy distribution, fewer power outages caused by unregulated mining. Economic Development Creating a stable and predictable environment for legitimate mining businesses, encouraging investment and job creation. Attraction of foreign investment, growth of local tech industries. Boosting Crypto Tax Revenue : A Key Driver One of the most compelling reasons for Russia to implement this registry is the immense potential for increased Crypto Tax Revenue . As the value of cryptocurrencies has soared, so too have the profits generated by mining operations. However, without a clear mechanism to track and tax these activities, a significant portion of this potential revenue has remained untapped. The registry provides the necessary framework for tax authorities to identify miners, assess their operations, and ensure compliance with tax laws. This could involve various forms of taxation: Income Tax: On the profits generated from selling mined cryptocurrencies. Energy Tariffs: Potentially differentiated electricity tariffs for mining operations, or taxes on energy consumption. Equipment Import Duties: Taxes on the import of specialized mining hardware. By bringing these operations into the light, Russia aims to create a new, substantial income stream for the state budget, mirroring efforts seen in other nations exploring digital asset taxation. The Challenge of Unauthorized Crypto Mining in Russia The existence of a significant volume of Unauthorized Crypto Mining has been a persistent headache for Russian authorities. These operations often tap into the national grid illegally, leading to energy theft, power fluctuations, and even blackouts in certain regions. Furthermore, unregistered mining activities make it difficult for law enforcement to track potential illicit uses of cryptocurrencies, such as money laundering or funding illegal activities. The registry is envisioned as a powerful tool to combat these issues. By requiring all equipment to be registered, authorities can: Identify Illegal Connections: Cross-reference registered equipment with energy consumption data to spot anomalies. Track Malicious Actors: Link unregistered equipment to individuals or organizations engaged in illegal activities. Enhance National Security: Gain better oversight over a sector that could potentially be exploited by bad actors. This crackdown is not just about revenue; it’s about establishing state control and ensuring the integrity of critical infrastructure. Impact on Crypto Mining Russia : What Miners Need to Know For miners operating in Russia, this new registry will undoubtedly bring significant changes. While it introduces new compliance requirements, it also offers a pathway to legitimacy and potentially a more stable operating environment. Miners will need to: Register Their Equipment: This is the fundamental requirement, ensuring their operations are officially recognized. Comply with Tax Laws: Prepare to pay taxes on their mining profits, potentially requiring detailed record-keeping. Adhere to Energy Regulations: Ensure their power consumption is within legal limits and they are paying appropriate tariffs. Potentially Benefit from Stability: Legitimate miners might see reduced risks from raids or sudden operational shutdowns, as they will be operating within a recognized framework. The transition may be challenging for some, especially those who have operated off-grid, but it represents a maturation of the industry within Russia. It could lead to a more professionalized and transparent mining sector. Broader Implications: What Does This Mean for Global Crypto? Russia’s move is not isolated. It’s part of a global trend where governments are increasingly grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Countries like the United States, Canada, and various European nations are also exploring or implementing their own regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Russia’s approach, particularly its focus on a national equipment registry, could serve as a blueprint or a cautionary tale for other nations considering similar measures. It highlights a growing recognition that crypto mining, as a significant energy consumer and economic activity, cannot remain entirely unregulated. This trend suggests that: Regulation is Inevitable: More countries will likely follow suit, introducing various forms of oversight. Energy Consumption is a Key Concern: Governments are keen to manage the environmental and grid impact of mining. Taxation is a Priority: States are looking for new revenue streams from the crypto economy. The Russian experience will be closely watched by policymakers and crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Navigating the New Landscape: Actionable Insights for Miners For current and prospective crypto miners in Russia, adapting to this new regulatory environment is crucial for long-term success. Here are some actionable insights: Proactive Compliance: Don’t wait for enforcement. Begin understanding the registration process and gather necessary documentation now. Professional Consultation: Seek advice from legal and tax professionals specializing in crypto to ensure full compliance. Energy Efficiency: Invest in more energy-efficient mining hardware and optimize operations to manage costs under potentially new energy tariffs. Location Strategy: Consider areas within Russia that are officially designated or encouraged for mining, which might offer more favorable conditions or support. Advocacy and Engagement: Where possible, engage with industry associations or participate in discussions to voice concerns and contribute to shaping fair regulations. Embracing these changes can turn a potential challenge into an opportunity for legitimate growth. Conclusion: A New Era for Russian Crypto Mining The establishment of a national registry for crypto mining equipment marks a pivotal moment for Crypto Mining Russia . It signifies a clear shift towards greater governmental oversight, aimed at increasing tax revenue, combating unauthorized activities, and ensuring energy stability. While it presents new challenges for miners in terms of compliance and operational adjustments, it also paves the way for a more formalized, transparent, and potentially stable industry. This bold move by Russia will undoubtedly set a precedent and provide valuable lessons for other nations grappling with the complexities of regulating the rapidly expanding world of digital assets. The future of crypto mining in Russia is set to be more integrated with the traditional economy than ever before.

2025-07-07T10:33:08,"Last Year, a Pension Fund Invested in Bitcoin for the First Time in the UK: Today They Announced the Profit Rate They Made!","UK-based pension consultancy firm Cartwright has announced that the country’s first Defined Benefit (DB) pension fund has returned 60% in one year after allocating 3% of its portfolio to Bitcoin. Cartwright stated that with this important development, other institutional customers have also started to show interest in Bitcoin. The firm advised an unnamed British pension fund on Bitcoin investment in November 2024. The firm’s senior investment advisor Arash Nasri said in a statement that the initial response in the industry had been “surprisingly positive.” Following these developments, Cartwright has now published its first “Annual Bitcoin Assessment Report.” The purpose of this report is described as increasing Bitcoin awareness among institutional investors. When asked whether the fund would increase its Bitcoin allocation in the future, Nasri said: “If Bitcoin continues to provide the returns we expect, our real question will be ‘when should we reduce it?’” It was learned that the firm has started talks with other clients about similar investments. However, Nasri said that pension funds need to fully understand Bitcoin and take steps with a long-term perspective. Stating that Cartwright has a neutral position in this process, Nasri said, “We are not a firm that manages investments. We are independent advisors and have built up a serious knowledge base to understand the potential impacts of Bitcoin on individuals, companies, asset owners and governments. “It is our duty to investors to raise awareness in this area,” he said. However, adding that there are still some skeptics in the sector, Nasri stated that the argument that “Bitcoin’s price is too volatile” is frequently voiced, but this approach is disappointing, and added, “Our sector should be experts in portfolio management and position sizing. “This reluctance to understand a new form of money and technology is very thought-provoking,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T10:24:12,"Hyperliquid trader suffers five liquidations and loses $3.7M","A trader on the Hyperliquid platform known by the pseudonym Qwatio on X has suffered massive losses after repeatedly shorting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) during the recent market upswing. The trader was liquidated five times over the weekend alone, bringing the total number of liquidations to ten in the span of just a few days. According to crypto market activity tracker Lookonchain, Qwatio placed highly leveraged bets against BTC and ETH, which led to the loss of approximately $3.7 million in the last week. Data from CoinGlass shows a total of 387 BTC worth about $42.18 million and 2,990 ETH valued at $7.65 million were liquidated from Qwatio’s account. Once holding a balance of $16.28 million, the account is now just worth $610,000, recording a $15.67 million in realized losses. Hyperliquid trader makes losses after Q1 bull run The trader had opened $200 million worth of 50x leveraged short positions on BTC and ETH just hours before US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national crypto reserve in March. The market had seen the order as bullish, and pushed crypto markets alongside BTC to highs , triggering Qwatio’s early losses. They are also known for having held a large position in the Melania coin during its initial launch earlier in 2025. After losing thousands of dollars Qwatio continued shorting the two largest coins by market cap into the second quarter of the year. On July 4, after already being liquidated 10 times, the trader opened another short position against Bitcoin, betting 21 BTC valued at $2.3 million while the asset was trading at $109,135, just $2,000 down from its all-time high level. The coin has since dropped to $108,993, and Qwatio will be hoping it goes further down against the predictions of analysts, who have asserted that BTC is in a “weak positive” short-term market sentiment. Market wide short and long liquidations surge Qwatio’s losses took place against the backdrop of several liquidations in the crypto derivatives market. In the 24-hour period ending July 7, total liquidations across all major cryptocurrencies reached $184.16 million, according to CoinGlass. The numbers included $47.14 million in long positions and $137.01 million in short positions, a strong squeeze on bearish traders as markets are trading in the green. Ethereum led the liquidation totals, with $64.14 million wiped out, $49.62 million from short positions and $14.52 million from longs. Bitcoin followed, with $35.38 million liquidated, including $31.25 million in short positions. Many traders, like Qwatio, misjudged the market direction and were caught off-guard by the strength of the market uptick. NVT golden cross on BTC chart spells price topping According to a CryptoQuant take, the NVT golden cross successfully flagged three recent tops in 2025: February 2, March 24, and June 16. On each occasion, the indicator peaked above the 2.2 threshold, coinciding with BTC price highs of $97,600, $87,500, and $106,800 respectively. Each peak was followed by corrections of -23.65%, -16.06%, and -9.87%. Source: CryptoQuant As of the latest reading, the NVT GC stands at 1.98, yet to breach the 2.2 signal line again, but has room for a price momentum on the upside. Analysts believe that if the NVT crosses 2.2, there will be a price pullback for several days. Bitcoin’s price rise has triggered a chain reaction across derivatives platforms, particularly on Binance, where short positions have been on the rise. Many traders appeared to interpret the rally as a selling opportunity. Still, the continued ascent in BTC’s price forced many of these short-sellers into liquidation or margin calls. The liquidations have helped fuel a bullish feedback loop, accelerating the upward price movement. When bearish bets are squeezed out of the market, bullish momentum builds, a pattern visible in this week’s trading behavior. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-07T10:20:40,"Bitcoin: Metaplanet’s Bold Move Amplifies Japan’s Crypto Ambitions with Massive BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Metaplanet’s Bold Move Amplifies Japan’s Crypto Ambitions with Massive BTC Holdings In a move that reverberates across the global financial landscape, Japan’s publicly traded firm, Metaplanet, has once again underscored its profound commitment to Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically increasing its holdings. This strategic acquisition is not merely a transaction; it’s a powerful statement on the future of corporate treasury management and the burgeoning confidence in Bitcoin as a foundational digital asset. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital finance, Metaplanet’s latest action serves as a compelling indicator of a significant shift, positioning Japan at the forefront of the corporate crypto revolution. What’s Behind Metaplanet’s Bold Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy? Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company that has swiftly become a prominent name in the digital asset space, recently announced a monumental addition to its balance sheet. The company acquired an additional 2,205 BTC for 34.487 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $237.8 million. This substantial purchase brings the firm’s total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 15,555 BTC. This aggressive accumulation strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, the leading corporate Bitcoin holder, signaling a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Metaplanet’s pivot towards Bitcoin is driven by several key factors: Inflation Hedge: In an era of global economic uncertainty and currency devaluation, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply, making it an attractive hedge against inflation. Long-Term Store of Value: Recognized as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s robust network and increasing adoption solidify its position as a reliable store of value over the long term. Strategic Diversification: By integrating Bitcoin into its treasury, Metaplanet diversifies its assets away from traditional financial instruments, potentially enhancing its financial resilience. To illustrate the rapid growth of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin portfolio, consider the following hypothetical progression: Date of Announcement BTC Acquired (Approx.) Total BTC Holdings (Approx.) Value (USD Approx.) May 2024 (Initial) 1,000 1,000 $60M June 2024 1,177 2,177 $70M July 2024 233 2,410 $15.8M August 2024 2,205 15,555 $237.8M Note: The table above uses hypothetical prior acquisition figures to demonstrate growth leading up to the most recent announcement, as only the latest total is specified in the original content. Why is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Gaining Momentum Globally? Metaplanet’s aggressive stance is not an isolated incident but rather a significant component of a broader global trend: the accelerating rate of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . Companies across various sectors are re-evaluating their traditional treasury strategies, increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable, even superior, alternative to holding vast amounts of cash or low-yield bonds. Benefits Driving Adoption: Protection Against Fiat Debasement: As central banks continue quantitative easing, the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes. Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a compelling alternative. Enhanced Shareholder Value: Companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated that a strategic allocation to Bitcoin can significantly enhance shareholder value over time, attracting a new class of investors. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s willingness to innovate and adapt to the evolving digital economy, appealing to tech-savvy talent and customers. Access to Global Liquidity: Bitcoin’s 24/7 global market provides unparalleled liquidity, allowing for large transactions with relative ease. Challenges and Considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, which introduces risk for corporate balance sheets. However, long-term holders often view these fluctuations as temporary. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing compliance challenges for corporations. Accounting Treatment: Accounting standards for digital assets can be complex, requiring careful consideration and specialized expertise. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Beyond Metaplanet, other notable companies that have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury include Tesla, Block (formerly Square), Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Platforms, among others. These pioneers are setting a precedent, demonstrating that Bitcoin is maturing into a legitimate corporate asset. Is Japan Becoming a Hub for Japan Bitcoin Investments? Japan has a unique relationship with cryptocurrencies. As one of the earliest adopters and regulators of digital assets, it has experienced both the highs and lows of the crypto market, including the infamous Mt. Gox incident. However, recent developments suggest a renewed and more positive stance, positioning Japan as a potential leader in Japan Bitcoin Investments and broader Web3 innovation. The Japanese government and financial regulators have shown increasing openness towards fostering a robust Web3 ecosystem. This includes clearer guidelines for stablecoins, efforts to integrate NFTs, and a general push to make Japan a more attractive environment for crypto businesses. Metaplanet’s substantial Bitcoin acquisition is a direct reflection of this evolving sentiment within the country’s corporate sector. Several factors make Japan an interesting case for Bitcoin adoption: Forward-Thinking Regulation: Despite past challenges, Japan has established some of the world’s most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for crypto exchanges and assets, providing a level of clarity that can encourage institutional participation. Economic Context: Japan’s long history of low interest rates and recent depreciation of the Yen might make alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing for corporate treasuries seeking better returns or inflation protection. Technological Prowess: Japan’s deep-rooted technological infrastructure and innovative spirit create fertile ground for the adoption of new digital financial paradigms. Metaplanet’s commitment could serve as a powerful catalyst, encouraging other Japanese corporations to explore similar strategies, potentially transforming the nation into a significant hub for corporate Bitcoin holdings in Asia. The Broader Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Holdings The continuous accumulation of Bitcoin by entities like Metaplanet has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Institutional Bitcoin adoption. When a publicly traded company makes such a significant investment, it sends a powerful signal to the broader financial world. Key Impacts: Legitimization: Large-scale corporate investments lend credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative asset. This can encourage more conservative institutions to consider exposure. Supply Shock Potential: As more Bitcoin is acquired by long-term holders and corporate treasuries, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially contributing to upward price pressure in the long run, assuming demand remains strong or increases. Increased Market Maturity: The entry of institutional players brings greater professionalism, sophisticated financial products (like ETFs), and more robust infrastructure to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Reduced Volatility (Long-Term): While large purchases can cause short-term price movements, a growing base of long-term institutional holders can contribute to overall market stability as less Bitcoin is actively traded. The ‘Bitcoinization’ of corporate balance sheets is a trend that is only just beginning. As more companies witness the success and strategic advantages gained by pioneers like Metaplanet, the domino effect could lead to an unprecedented wave of institutional capital flowing into the digital asset space, fundamentally reshaping global finance. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Metaplanet’s latest move offers valuable insights for various stakeholders: For Investors: Pay close attention to corporate treasury strategies. Companies adopting Bitcoin may offer a unique investment thesis, combining traditional business models with exposure to a rapidly appreciating asset class. Researching firms with significant Bitcoin holdings could uncover new opportunities. For Businesses: Evaluate your own treasury management. Is holding vast amounts of cash truly the most efficient strategy in today’s economic climate? Explore the potential benefits and risks of adding Bitcoin or other digital assets to your balance sheet, consulting with financial and legal experts. For Policymakers and Regulators: The increasing corporate adoption highlights the urgent need for clear, consistent, and forward-looking regulatory frameworks that can foster innovation while protecting investors. Japan’s proactive approach could serve as a model. Metaplanet’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to a strategic vision that sees Bitcoin not as a speculative asset, but as a robust, long-term store of value and a cornerstone of modern corporate finance. This bold move by a prominent Japanese company signals a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. As the world grapples with economic shifts and technological advancements, companies like Metaplanet are charting a new course, demonstrating the profound potential of Bitcoin to redefine wealth preservation and growth strategies in the 21st century. The ripple effects of such decisions are poised to shape the future of global investment, making this an exciting time for anyone observing the evolution of finance.

2025-07-07T10:18:07,"Three crypto tokens set for 25x growth based on new 2025 market forecasts","Crypto’s backdraft after Bitcoin’s surge often sets the stage for the real fireworks: altcoins launching and leading the next wave. With fresh market momentum and several narrative-driven catalysts gaining steam, this cycle could be framed by a handful of tokens poised for exponential growth. Three names in particular are igniting speculators and strategists alike. Each represents a unique approach to utility, community, or blockchain infrastructure—but all share one thing in common: strong conditions have aligned to support the possibility of 25x returns before the end of 2025. Crypto’s next chapter is beginning to write itself, and it isn’t following the old playbook. As Bitcoin and Ethereum attract institutional capital and major headlines, a few smaller tokens are emerging with real momentum and eye-popping upside potential. Amid a fresh wave of analysts’ optimism, three projects stand out as early-stage plays offering the kind of explosive returns that define life-changing investments. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Who would’ve guessed that a meme coin could eclipse its predecessors not just in popularity but in technological depth? Little Pepe , known by its ticker LILPEPE, has been quietly rewriting playbooks. Unlike typical memecoins, it’s built as a Layer‑2 EVM chain tailored specifically for meme-token innovation. The presale progress illustrates the fervor: the first three stages sold out in rapid succession, triggering Stage Four at $0.0013 per token. There are several reasons why Little Pepe could deliver 25x or more. First, it combines ultra-low fees and fast finality with a launchpad designed for new meme tokens, completing a novel ecosystem rooted in utility. Anti-bot mechanisms guard fairness at launch, while zero tax reduces friction for traders. More importantly, it isn’t just about memes—it’s about infrastructure. Little Pepe is building a meme-first blockchain, not a meme-only token. This positions it as a rare sliver of both culture and engineering, with ambitions for centralized exchange listings on the horizon and community-driven marketing initiatives, including a $777,000 giveaway. This narrative gives credence to longer-term forecasts. With community hype fueling presale momentum and technical substance underscoring foundation, a 25x growth from today’s price doesn’t feel like a stretch—it feels realistic. Sui (SUI) Sui is building a reputation as one of the most advanced Layer 1 blockchains available. Following the growth in transaction volume and developer activity, SUI has delivered a notable increase, approximately 16% in just the last week. That wasn’t luck; it was progress. SUI’s architecture is based on parallel execution and an object-centric data model, enabling finality in under two seconds and gas fees close to negligible. Developers launching gaming, DeFi, and social apps are increasingly attracted to this environment. Additionally, the network is exploring sponsored transactions and zero-knowledge login solutions to make Web3 accessible to mainstream users. If adoption escalates faster than projections anticipated—especially in gaming and DeFi—25x returns would place SUI among the top-earning coins of the year. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo currently hovers around $0.77, up 17% over seven days. That’s not just swing-trader noise; it reflects the burgeoning adoption of P2P interaction without intermediaries. A 25x growth would bring ONDO into the $15–20 range. That may sound steep, but considering the improved permissionless protocol and fixed yield loans, ONDO could trade well above its current valuation. Why 25x is not just fantasy Little Pepe’s ecosystem is built around community frenzy backed by blockchain technology. Sui is gathering developer and institutional attention faster than people expected. Ondo is at the epicenter of on-chain DeFi. These tokens are not just vapors; they’re founded on solid utility, partnership, and tangible progress. Investors willing to accept low risk can diversify and act now, as the potential for portfolio gains in 2025 is enormous. A final word on bullish momentum It’s easy to dismiss meme coins or niche utility tokens as speculative noise. But history says otherwise: 25–50x moves require more than hype; they need culture, infrastructure, community, and the crypto trio of LILPEPE, SUI, and ONDO embody these requirements. With Bitcoin drawing the spotlight and Ethereum evolving, the next phase of this cycle rewards tokens that blend relevance with utility, and fast. Timing isn’t everything, but in crypto, timing plus vision equals opportunity. If 25x moves are your target, these three name-grouped tokens may be the frontline contenders. Buckle in—this ride looks unlike anything yet seen.

This presented strong exposure to the token as it witnessed over $67 million in trading within two days of its launch. This implies easy institutional access, adding a new source of demand and reducing volatility with capital getting locked in staking. Apart from this progress, here are the other factors that may lift up the SOL price rally. Massive On-Chain Growth The XRP total value locked (TVL) has jumped from around $2 billion in early 2024 to over $8.6 billion. Besides, Solana leads in daily active addresses, which is around 3.3 million and transaction throughput, surpassing Ethereum on some metrics. Moreover, the SOL-based dApps like Jupiter, MarginFi, Kamino, and Drift could also drive record usage in the DeFi & DePIN sectors. Developer Activity & Innovation Solana remains one of the most developer-active blockchains, second only to Ethereum in GitHub commits. Besides, the innovations like Blazingly fast L1 throughput, Sealevel parallel execution, and local fee markets enhance performance. This creates a long-term moat against competitors like Avalanche and Near Protocol. Solana Use Cases Solana staking has been at the edge, with over 65% of SOL being staked, which reduces the liquid supply and adds yield appeal for long-term holders. With more than 7% staking APY, investors have incentives to lock tokens, which lowers selling pressure and enhances scarcity. On the other hand, Solana Mobile (Saga), Solana Pay (Visa Integration), and in-store crypto payments position it as the Web3 infrastructure chain. Strong Correlation to Bitcoin & Favourable Regulatory Climate Bitcoin’s post-halving cycles have resulted in major price jumps among the other altcoins, including Solana. Usually, the high-performance Layer-1 tokens like SOL undergo massive upswings, outperforming past rallies, if the BTC price enters the discovery phase. On the other hand, the token is gaining traction in regulated financial products, and the absence of active enforcement actions and increasing ETF/derivatives availability could improve investor confidence. Will Solana (SOL) Price Reach $200 in July? Solana price seems to be closely following the other altcoins like XRP and BNB, which set up a bullish case and further rise without making any noise. The bulls are currently facing a tough time in surpassing the local resistance zone between $152.51 and $154.43. They have been failing to breach above the zone since the start of the month, and hence, a successful attempt may turn the tables for the SOL price rally. As seen in the above chart, the Solana price has been trading within an ascending triangle and is very far from the apex. After rebounding from the local lows, the pullback aftermath of breaking the neckline of the head & shoulder pattern, the price is facing tough resistance. While the CMF has risen above 0, signalling a strong inflow of money into the platform. On the other hand, the DMI levels have been juggling along the average range since the start of the month. This suggests there is some scope for uncertainty over the SOL price in the short term. The long-term price action still remains bullish, with multiple events lined up, along with the market conditions changing in the coming days. Bitcoin price is believed to rise and mark new highs in the coming days; with this, the top 10 altcoins, including Solana, are expected to kick-start a new upswing.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-solana-sol-price-is-poised-to-surge-this-july/,"SOL|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|NEAR","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T10:15:18,"NBA Legend Scottie Pippen Reveals Top 11 Crypto Picks – XRP, BTC, SHIB, and More!","The post NBA Legend Scottie Pippen Reveals Top 11 Crypto Picks – XRP, BTC, SHIB, and More! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News NBA great and six-time champion Scottie Pippen is making headlines in a different arena – crypto. In a recent tweet, Pippen revealed a personal list of cryptocurrencies he’s keeping an eye on. And it’s not just Bitcoin. His list includes a mix of established assets and meme coins, like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). As crypto adoption continues to rise, Pippen’s growing interest shows how digital assets are gaining traction beyond the tech crowd. Bitcoin is my #1 but I'm building my watch list. What coins are you watching? I got my picks… $ETH $SOL $BNB $XRP $Ball aka @Game5Ball $ADA $DOGE $SHIB $LINK $CRO What else you got? Drop your crypto picks. — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 6, 2025 A Slam Dunk of Top Coins: What’s on Pippen’s Watchlist? Pippen still considers Bitcoin the top crypto, but his watchlist is wide-ranging. He named several well-known coins including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple’s XRP, Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Cronos (CRO), and a lesser-known token called BALL. He also added fan favorites Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). His picks show a mix of utility-based projects and community-driven tokens. It’s a list that reflects the kind of diversity most retail investors are aiming for today. That Time Satoshi Visited Pippen… In a Dream Pippen has mentioned crypto before. A few years back, he tweeted that Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, visited him in dreams to deliver BTC price predictions. Those predictions didn’t come true, but the tweets earned him attention in the crypto space. While that story was more playful than serious, his latest tweet shows real curiosity toward the crypto market, especially altcoins like XRP, which is used in cross-border payments, and popular tokens like DOGE and SHIB that thrive on community hype. The Gold Asteroid Debate Pippen’s tweet comes at a time when Bitcoin’s scarcity is being talked about again. That’s thanks to fresh reports about Psyche 16, an asteroid that could hold gold worth around $70 quintillion. Bitcoin advocates like JAN3 CEO Samson Mow and trader Willy Woo used the moment to remind people that Bitcoin’s supply is fixed at 21 million coins, no matter what. Mow tweeted: There is zero #Bitcoin on Psyche 16. https://t.co/VSiqDPX6ta — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 6, 2025 Blockstream CEO Adam Back echoed this point, explaining that Bitcoin is different. Its supply can’t be inflated, and new coins are only mined through computation. Pippen’s Tweet Lights Up Crypto Twitter Pippen’s post quickly caught the attention of the crypto community. Many praised his list, with one user calling it a “ banger list. ” Altcoin fans, especially those holding ADA, ETH, and XRP, were thrilled to see their tokens on his radar. Others jumped in with suggestions. Some encouraged Pippen to look into newer tokens like Curve (CRV), and others backed his inclusion of Solana (SOL) for its growing role in the DeFi and NFT space. Is Pippen Becoming a Crypto Voice? Pippen’s support for Bitcoin isn’t surprising, but his interest in altcoins shows he’s paying attention to the broader market. By naming XRP, ETH, SHIB, and DOGE, he’s signaling that he sees potential in more than just the original cryptocurrency. Whether other athletes will follow his lead remains to be seen.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/nba-legend-scottie-pippen-reveals-top-11-crypto-picks-xrp-btc-shib-and-more/,"BTC|SHIB|XRP|DOGE|ETH","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T10:11:15,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price:[liveprice sym=”xrp”]. Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction July XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency [cryptocurrency_name sym=”xrp”] Token [cryptocurrency_symbol sym=”xrp”] Price [liveprice sym=”xrp”] [24hr_change sym=”xrp”] Market cap [marketcap sym=”xrp”] Circulating Supply [circulating_supply sym=”xrp”] Trading Volume [trading_volume sym=”xrp”] All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction July In H1 2025, the XRP price action shifted from a decline to a consolidation phase. In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely, XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. Source: TradingView On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . Meanwhile, another positive development in July first week reveals that Ripple has applied for a U.S. banking license, enhancing credibility. The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The last 15-day momentum is backed by growing investors’ interest, and positive developments fuel a rise in exchange outflow. Also, the technical tools on the XRP price chart show money inflows rising with CMF at 0.09, RSI above median at 56, MACD and histogram went bullish, indicating a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

2025-07-07T10:07:04,"Pop Mart’s first investor admits he has a ‘fondness for Bitcoin’","Mai Gang, the first investor of global Chinese toy giant Pop Mart talks about how he holds a ‘special fondness for Bitcoin’ despite the ban on cryptocurrency in his home country. In an interview with Xiao Yuzhu FM, the angel investor of Chinese toy firm Pop Mart famous for its “blind box” marketing strategy talked about his tendency to choose projects that others might deem uncommon or even unusual at the time. The same can be said about Bitcoin ( BTC ). Even before he graduated university, Gang was already putting some of his pocket money into BTC back when the cryptocurrency was still in its early stages. At the time, BTC had not grown as mainstream as it has now. “Bitcoin is a very important experience in my career. Once, during a forum for alumni of Renmin University, the host asked me why I have a special fondness for Bitcoin, while various big names like chief economists have not grasped or seen it?” said Gang in a translated interview. When he was still studying finance, banking and economic principles in university, he learned about the blockchain and Bitcoin in particular. He considered the concept to be “extremely simple” to grasp, yet not a lot of investors seemed to be aware of its potential. “Understanding [Bitcoin] does not require you to have a PhD. I think the pursuit, questioning, and persistence in essential issues are very rare and important,” said Gang. You might also like: Elon Musk’s new ‘America Party’ will embrace Bitcoin, claiming fiat to be ‘hopeless’ Despite naysayers and non-believers, Gang Mai kept believing in his choice to invest in Pop Mart before it grew into a company with a $42.80 billion market cap. It is currently the 517th most valuable company globally by market cap, according to data from CompaniesMarketCap.com. “Regardless of whether others applaud or believe you, you believe in yourself and have remained steadfast,” said Gang in a translated interview about his role in Pop Mart’s success. “You all think I’m different, but I’m not saying I have to be different from everyone else. Whether I’m different from you or not, it doesn’t matter. What’s important is what I believe in,” he continued. Back in 2014, Gang Mai predicted that Bitcoin would become a vital tool in the “great power game.” When asked to describe the cryptocurrency in just two sentences, he said that he considered Bitcoin to be the “perfect currency” that mathematicians, geeks, and network scientists have simulated using distributed algorithms. In addition, he views it as an asset that can be maintained through harnessing computing power coming from extremely powerful hardware.

Key Takeaways: Crypto funds saw a 12th week of inflows, pushing assets under management to a record $188 billion. Bitcoin ETFs have drawn $14.5 billion in net inflows this year, with trading volume topping $1 trillion since launch. Ethereum inflows are accelerating faster than Bitcoin’s, signaling rising investor interest in ETH. Buoyed by rising prices, assets under management surged to a record $188 billion, while trading volumes held steady at $16.3 billion, matching the year’s average, according to a Monday report from CoinShares . The United States dominated regional activity with $1 billion in new inflows, dwarfing Germany’s $38.5 million and Switzerland’s $33.7 million. Funds Canada and Brazil See Outflows Canada and Brazil bucked the trend, recording outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively, reflecting weaker investor sentiment. Bitcoin products pulled in $790 million, a slower pace compared to recent weeks’ $1.5 billion average, suggesting investors may be treading carefully as BTC nears its all-time highs.

They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. While the final deadlines for individual altcoin ETFs arrive in October, the analysts predict 90% approval odds for other tokens like Dogecoin and Cardano by year-end, but note Sui and Tron ETFs face more regulatory uncertainty with only 60% and 50% odds, respectively. In April, Balchunas revealed that more than 70 cryptocurrency ETFs are currently awaiting review by the SEC.
