2025-07-07T14:50:18,"Bitcoin Options: Decoding the Remarkable Volatility Drop Amidst Peak BTC Price Action","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options: Decoding the Remarkable Volatility Drop Amidst Peak BTC Price Action Are you keeping a close eye on the pulse of the crypto market ? If so, you’ve likely noticed Bitcoin’s incredible resilience, hovering near its all-time highs. But beneath this exciting surface, something rather intriguing is happening in the derivatives space, particularly within the Bitcoin options market. It’s a paradox that has many analysts scratching their heads: a period of surprising calm. Understanding the Unexpected Calm: What is Implied Volatility? In a recent update, the on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode revealed a fascinating trend. Despite Bitcoin’s robust BTC price action , the options market is experiencing what can only be described as a summer slowdown. Implied volatility across most expirations, ranging from one week to six months, has reached its lowest levels since mid-2023. But what exactly is implied volatility, and why does this matter? Implied Volatility (IV): This is a forward-looking metric that represents the market’s expectation of how much an asset’s price will fluctuate over a specific period. It’s derived from the price of an option contract. High IV: Suggests the market anticipates large price swings (up or down) in the near future. Low IV: Indicates the market expects relatively stable or less dramatic price movements. Relevance: For options traders, IV is crucial because it directly impacts option premiums. Higher IV means more expensive options, while lower IV means cheaper options. The fact that implied volatility is at such lows, even with Bitcoin’s price near its peak, suggests a collective market sentiment of stability, or perhaps, a lack of immediate catalysts for significant price shifts. This insight from Glassnode analysis provides a unique lens through which to view the current market dynamics. Why the Silence? Factors Behind the Low Implied Volatility The current low implied volatility in the Bitcoin options market isn’t a random occurrence; several factors could be contributing to this unexpected calm. Understanding these can help both seasoned traders and new investors navigate the complexities of the crypto market . Here are some potential reasons: Market Maturity: As the Bitcoin market matures, with increased institutional participation and regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs, it may be exhibiting more predictable price behavior. Large institutions often employ sophisticated hedging strategies that can dampen volatility. Post-Halving Lull: Historically, periods following a Bitcoin halving event can sometimes see a consolidation phase before the next major bull run. Traders might be waiting for clearer signals, leading to less aggressive positioning in options. Summer Slowdown: Traditional financial markets often experience reduced trading activity during summer months, as many participants take holidays. This seasonal effect could be extending to the crypto space, leading to lower trading volumes and, consequently, lower volatility. Lack of Immediate Catalysts: While Bitcoin is near all-time highs, there might be a temporary absence of major, market-moving news or events (e.g., significant regulatory announcements, major institutional adoption news) that would typically spur large price swings. Consolidation Phase: The market might be in a period of price discovery and consolidation after a strong rally. During such times, price tends to move sideways, which naturally leads to lower implied volatility. Navigating the Calm: Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors For those involved in the crypto market , understanding this low implied volatility environment in Bitcoin options is crucial. It presents both opportunities and challenges, especially concerning future BTC price action . For Options Buyers: Cheaper Premiums: Low IV means options contracts are relatively cheaper. This could be an opportune time to buy calls or puts if you anticipate a significant price move in either direction. Long Straddles/Strangles: If you expect a breakout but are unsure of the direction, buying both a call and a put (a straddle or strangle) can be more cost-effective when IV is low. You profit if the price moves significantly in either direction. For Options Sellers: Reduced Premium Income: Selling options (e.g., covered calls, naked puts) becomes less attractive as the premiums collected are smaller. Increased Risk: While premiums are low, a sudden spike in volatility could lead to significant losses if you are selling options without adequate hedging. For Spot Holders: Potential for Accumulation: A period of low volatility can be seen as a healthy consolidation phase, allowing long-term holders to accumulate Bitcoin at relatively stable prices before a potential next leg up in BTC price action . Watch for Breakouts: The longer the period of low volatility, the more significant the eventual breakout tends to be. This calm could be the precursor to a powerful move. The key takeaway from this Glassnode analysis is that the current environment requires a nuanced approach. It’s not a time for complacency but rather for strategic positioning and careful risk management. Diving Deeper into Glassnode’s Insights on BTC Price Action The detailed Glassnode analysis provides a robust foundation for understanding the current state of the Bitcoin options market. Their observations are particularly insightful because they leverage on-chain data, offering a unique perspective beyond just price charts. Glassnode highlighted that this period of low implied volatility is not just across a few specific contracts but is broad-based, affecting options from one week to six months out. This breadth suggests a systemic calm rather than an isolated anomaly. The fact that it’s the lowest since mid-2023 indicates a return to a pre-bull market sentiment in terms of options pricing, despite the actual BTC price action being significantly higher. This divergence between high spot prices and low options volatility can signal several things: Market Efficiency: The market may be becoming more efficient at pricing in known information, leaving fewer opportunities for extreme short-term volatility. Institutional Hedging: Large institutional players might be using options more for hedging existing spot positions rather than for speculative bets on massive price swings, which inherently reduces the overall implied volatility. Trader Fatigue: After a period of intense price movements, some traders might be taking a step back, leading to lower liquidity and a reduction in aggressive directional bets. The consistent message from the Glassnode analysis is that the market is currently in a state of equilibrium, a quiet period that often precedes significant movements. Traders should be prepared for potential shifts, even if the current data suggests tranquility. What Lies Ahead? The Future of Volatility in the Crypto Market While the current low implied volatility in Bitcoin options suggests a period of calm, the crypto market is known for its sudden shifts. What factors could disrupt this tranquility and reignite volatility in BTC price action ? Macroeconomic Shifts: Unexpected changes in global interest rates, inflation data, or geopolitical events could send ripples through all financial markets, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: Major regulatory news, positive or negative, could significantly impact market sentiment and volatility. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs or setbacks in blockchain technology, or even major network upgrades for Bitcoin, could influence price expectations. Whale Activity: Large movements by significant holders (whales) can always trigger substantial price changes and subsequent volatility. Market Catalysts: The introduction of new financial products, major institutional adoption announcements, or even a sudden influx of retail interest could shift the market dynamics dramatically. The current environment, as highlighted by the Glassnode analysis , might be the calm before a storm, or simply a sign of a maturing market. Either way, staying informed and prepared is paramount. Summary: A Paradoxical Calm in Bitcoin’s Options Landscape The Bitcoin options market is currently presenting a fascinating paradox: record-low implied volatility despite Bitcoin’s proximity to all-time highs. This unexpected calm, as revealed by Glassnode analysis , suggests a period of consolidation and reduced immediate expectations for dramatic BTC price action . Whether this is a sign of market maturity, a seasonal slowdown, or the quiet before a significant move, it offers unique opportunities for informed participants in the crypto market . Traders and investors should leverage this period to refine their strategies, understanding that while volatility is currently subdued, the dynamic nature of crypto means preparation is always key.

2025-07-07T14:46:01,"Did Trump just signal Bitcoin to $120,000 in coming weeks?","Bitcoin ( BTC ) bulls may have found an ally in President Donald Trump’s move to delay controversial trade tariffs. To this end, cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pillows has noted that Bitcoin’s recent price action is tracking a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, and Trump’s tariff delay could catalyze BTC to surge toward $120,000 in the coming weeks. In a July 7 X post , Pillows noted that Bitcoin’s BTC/M2 ratio is nearing the end of its accumulation phase. Notably, M2 is a broad measure of the money supply, and as it expands, liquidity increases, providing investors with more capital to deploy into assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows By comparing Bitcoin’s price to M2, analysts assess its value in relation to the available liquidity. A strong BTC/M2 ratio can indicate that Bitcoin is undervalued compared to the money circulating in the system. Pillows’ analysis shows the BTC/M2 chart completing a Wyckoff accumulation phase, where institutional buyers quietly absorb supply before driving prices higher. Over the weekend, Bitcoin saw a sharp pullback but quickly rebounded, matching the Wyckoff pattern’s typical “spring” phase before a strong move up. Impact of Trump tariffs on Bitcoin’s price Trump’s tariff decision is central to this bullish outlook. By threatening higher tariffs but delaying them until August 1, the administration has given markets a short-term reprieve from trade uncertainty, potentially supporting a move higher for Bitcoin. Generally, reduced trade tensions lower the risk of an economic slowdown and support risk assets, such as equities and cryptocurrencies . Pillows’ analysis indicated that accumulation started around $105,000 to $108,000, with a Wyckoff target near $125,000. Meanwhile, another bullish outlook came from analyst TradingShot , who noted in a July 7 TradingView post that Bitcoin is testing short-term support at its four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA50 ) after forming a golden cross. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analyst sees similarities to May’s rally, with nearly identical gains from recent lows, 13.60% in May versus 12.60% now, and matching four-hour RSI patterns. If this fractal continues, Bitcoin could target the 1.5 Fibonacci extension level around $117,000 in the near term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,263, having experienced a modest 0.5% pullback over the last 24 hours, while it was down 1% for the week.

2025-07-07T14:40:26,"Mercado Bitcoin Unlocks $200M+ RWA Tokenization on XRP Ledger: A Game Changer","BitcoinWorld Mercado Bitcoin Unlocks $200M+ RWA Tokenization on XRP Ledger: A Game Changer Are you ready for a financial revolution? The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a major player from Brazil is making waves that could redefine how we view traditional investments. Mercado Bitcoin , one of Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is embarking on an ambitious journey to tokenize over $200 million in real-world assets (RWAs) directly onto the XRP Ledger. This isn’t just a bold move; it’s a testament to the growing convergence of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology , promising unprecedented accessibility and liquidity for investors worldwide. Unpacking Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: A New Era for Finance Before diving into the specifics of Mercado Bitcoin’s groundbreaking initiative, let’s understand what RWA tokenization truly means. In simple terms, it’s the process of converting the rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. Imagine taking a physical asset – be it a piece of real estate, a valuable painting, a company’s stock, or a government bond – and representing its ownership, or a fractional part of it, as a secure, verifiable token on a distributed ledger. This digital representation brings a host of benefits that are simply not possible in traditional finance: Increased Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 on global markets, unlike traditional assets with limited trading hours and geographical restrictions. Fractional Ownership: High-value assets, previously out of reach for most individual investors, can now be divided into smaller, affordable tokens. This democratizes access to exclusive investment opportunities. Enhanced Transparency: All transactions are recorded on an immutable blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable trail of ownership. Reduced Costs: By eliminating intermediaries and streamlining processes, tokenization can significantly lower transaction fees, administrative overheads, and settlement times. Faster Settlement: Transactions on a blockchain can settle in minutes or seconds, compared to days in traditional financial systems. This transformation is not theoretical; Mercado Bitcoin has already demonstrated its capability, having tokenized over 1 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $185 million) in assets. This significant track record highlights their expertise and commitment to pioneering this new financial frontier. Why Mercado Bitcoin Chose the XRP Ledger for This Monumental Step The decision by Mercado Bitcoin to leverage the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for this massive tokenization effort is strategic and speaks volumes about the capabilities of this particular blockchain. The XRPL is renowned for several key attributes that make it an ideal platform for large-scale RWA tokenization: Speed and Efficiency: The XRP Ledger boasts incredibly fast transaction speeds, with transactions typically confirming in 3-5 seconds. This is crucial for high-volume trading of tokenized assets. Low Transaction Costs: Fees on the XRPL are exceptionally low, often fractions of a cent. This makes it economically viable for frequent trading and micro-transactions, benefiting both issuers and investors. Scalability: Designed to handle a high throughput of transactions, the XRPL is built to scale, making it suitable for managing a vast number of tokenized assets and users. Built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX): The XRPL has a native decentralized exchange that allows for direct peer-to-peer trading of any asset issued on the ledger, facilitating seamless liquidity for tokenized RWAs. Security and Stability: The XRPL has a proven track record of stability and security, vital for handling valuable financial assets. Institutional Focus: Ripple, the company behind XRP, has actively pursued partnerships and use cases with financial institutions globally, aligning with Mercado Bitcoin’s institutional-grade aspirations. By choosing the XRPL, Mercado Bitcoin is not just tokenizing assets; they are integrating into an ecosystem that prioritizes speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability, essential ingredients for the widespread adoption of digital assets in mainstream finance. The Promise of Digital Assets: Transforming Investment Opportunities The tokenization of traditional assets into digital assets on a blockchain like the XRP Ledger isn’t merely a technical innovation; it’s a paradigm shift in how we conceive of and interact with investments. This move by Mercado Bitcoin underscores several profound implications for investors, businesses, and the global financial landscape: Democratizing Access to Wealth Historically, access to certain high-value investments like prime real estate, blue-chip stocks, or exclusive art collections has been restricted to accredited investors or those with substantial capital. Tokenization shatters these barriers, allowing fractional ownership. This means an average investor could potentially own a ‘token’ representing a share of a luxury apartment building, a bond issued by a major corporation, or even a piece of a famous artwork. This democratization of access could unlock vast new pools of capital and create more equitable investment opportunities globally. Unlocking Global Liquidity Traditional markets often suffer from liquidity constraints due to geographical limitations, differing regulatory frameworks, and restricted trading hours. Tokenized assets, being digital and borderless, can be traded on global exchanges 24/7. This dramatically increases the potential buyer and seller pool, leading to enhanced liquidity and more efficient price discovery. For assets like private equity or real estate, which are notoriously illiquid, tokenization offers a revolutionary pathway to unlock their value. Innovation in Financial Products The flexibility of tokenized assets allows for the creation of entirely new financial products and services. Imagine derivatives built on tokenized real estate, or lending protocols collateralized by tokenized bonds. The possibilities are immense, fostering an environment ripe for financial innovation that could lead to more tailored and efficient investment strategies. Here’s a quick comparison illustrating the shift: Feature Traditional Assets Tokenized Assets Access Often limited (accredited investors, high minimums) Democratized (fractional ownership, lower entry barriers) Liquidity Variable, often low (especially for private assets) Potentially high (24/7 global trading) Costs High (brokerage fees, administrative costs) Lower (reduced intermediaries, automated processes) Settlement Days (T+2, T+3) Seconds/Minutes Transparency Limited, centralized records High, immutable blockchain records Geographical Reach Limited by national borders Global, borderless Navigating the Landscape of Blockchain Technology and Regulatory Frameworks The successful integration of RWA tokenization into mainstream finance, particularly at the scale envisioned by Mercado Bitcoin , hinges not only on robust blockchain technology but also on evolving regulatory clarity. While the benefits are clear, the path forward involves navigating complex legal and compliance landscapes. The Role of Robust Blockchain Technology The underlying blockchain must be secure, scalable, and reliable. The XRP Ledger’s architecture, with its consensus mechanism and proven uptime, provides a strong foundation. However, continuous innovation in smart contract security, interoperability between different blockchains, and the ability to handle diverse asset types will be crucial for long-term success. The transparency inherent in blockchain ensures that ownership records are clear and verifiable, reducing fraud and disputes. Addressing Regulatory Challenges One of the primary hurdles for widespread RWA tokenization is the lack of a globally harmonized regulatory framework. Different jurisdictions have varying stances on what constitutes a security token, how it should be issued, and how it should be traded. For Mercado Bitcoin, operating in Brazil, adherence to local securities laws is paramount. This often involves: Issuance Regulations: Ensuring tokens comply with rules for public offerings or private placements. Exchange Licensing: Obtaining appropriate licenses to operate a marketplace for security tokens. Investor Protection: Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to prevent illicit activities and protect investors. Taxation: Clear guidelines on how tokenized assets and their profits are taxed. Companies like Mercado Bitcoin are working closely with regulators to help shape these frameworks, demonstrating the potential benefits while ensuring compliance. Their success will likely serve as a blueprint for others looking to enter this space. Actionable Insights for the Future of Finance What does Mercado Bitcoin’s bold move mean for various stakeholders? For Investors: Keep an eye on platforms offering tokenized RWAs. This could be a pathway to diversify your portfolio with previously inaccessible assets, potentially at lower entry points and with greater liquidity. However, always conduct thorough due diligence on the underlying asset and the issuing platform. For Businesses and Asset Owners: Consider the potential of tokenization to unlock capital, increase liquidity for illiquid assets, and reach a broader, global investor base. This could be a game-changer for fundraising and asset management. For Developers and Blockchain Enthusiasts: The growth of RWA tokenization creates immense opportunities for building new financial applications, compliance tools, and interoperable solutions on platforms like the XRP Ledger. A New Horizon for Global Finance Mercado Bitcoin’s commitment to tokenizing over $200 million in real-world assets on the XRP Ledger is more than just a business decision; it’s a significant milestone in the ongoing digital transformation of finance. By bringing traditional stocks and bonds onto a cutting-edge blockchain, they are not only expanding their own offerings but also paving the way for a more inclusive, efficient, and liquid global financial system. The fusion of traditional assets with the power of blockchain technology is creating a future where investment opportunities are truly borderless and accessible to everyone. This monumental step by Mercado Bitcoin solidifies the XRP Ledger ‘s position as a key player in the RWA tokenization space and promises an exciting new chapter for digital assets .

The acquisition brought Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC. However, Saylor paused purchases this week without reporting new Bitcoin acquisitions. This breaks Strategy’s consistent purchasing streak across recent months. The company previously maintained regular Bitcoin accumulation through various funding mechanisms. Both Metaplanet and Strategy focus on Bitcoin yield metrics for performance measurement. These companies track bitcoin-per-share ratios rather than traditional financial returns. The approach aligns with Bitcoin treasury company strategies across global markets. Corporate Bitcoin adoption continues expanding among public companies worldwide. Corporate Bitcoin adoption spreads across markets On Thursday, Hamak Gold Limited declared its intention to implement a Bitcoin treasury management policy. The London-listed gold exploration company saw shares rise 6% to 1.17 GBX. The announcement marks another traditional mining company entering Bitcoin treasury strategies. Hamak’s placing and subscription rounds generated £2.47 million in gross funds. Shares were priced at 0.8 penny each in the investment round, which was 27% less than the closing prices on July 2. Existing owners received 308.4 million new common shares as a result of the transaction. The new shares make up 452.1 million shares, or 68.2% of Hamak’s expanded share capital. Two-year warrants that are exercisable in the second year are included with every new share. All freshly issued shares are subject to a one-year lock-in term. Traditional companies across various sectors explore Bitcoin treasury policies for asset diversification. Gold mining firms particularly consider Bitcoin as a digital alternative to the precious metal. The trend spans from technology companies to resource extraction businesses. Corporate treasuries also view Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and store of value.

While it is wondered whether this momentum will continue during the week, CoinShares published its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that there was an inflow of $ 1.03 billion last week. “Last week, $1.03 billion inflows were experienced in cryptocurrency investment products, with asset inflows reaching a record level of $188 billion, marking the 12th consecutive week of inflows.” Ethereum Goes on the Attack! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $790 million, positive sentiment also dominated Ethereum (ETH), with an inflow of $226.4 million. When we look at other altcoins, XRP saw an inflow of $10.6 million, Solana (SOL) $21.6 million, and Sui (SUI) $1.6 million. The figures signaled that investors are showing more interest in Ethereum than Bitcoin. “Bitcoin investment products saw inflows of $790 million last week, a slowdown from the previous three weeks when they averaged $1.5 billion. The moderation in inflows suggests investors are becoming more cautious as Bitcoin approaches all-time highs. Ethereum saw $226 million in inflows last week, marking its 11th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the total during that period to $2.85 billion. On a pro rata basis, weekly inflows during this run averaged 1.6% of AuM, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%. This signals a significant shift in investor sentiment in favor of Ethereum.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an inflow of 1.02 billion dollars. After the USA, Germany had an inflow of $38.5 million and Switzerland had an inflow of $33.7 million.

2025-07-07T14:15:39,"Trump administration, US legislators turn attention to crypto tax policy starting July 9","The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Banking Committee are set to hold separate hearings on the digital assets market on Wednesday, July 9, following the completion of President Trump’s major tax and budget bill. Congress now appears ready to take serious steps toward regulating the crypto industry. House Speaker Mike Johnson has designated the week of July 14 as “Crypto Week,” during which the House will consider a series of bills focused on market structure and stablecoins. Beyond the House and Senate hearings, a handful of key developments could steer the future of US crypto policy. The Senate Banking Committee will put out a discussion draft this week to reform market structure based on the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and as related to provisions in the House’s CLARITY Act . The US House develops strategies to focus mainly on the crypto market The House hearing scheduled for Wednesday is titled Ensuring Digital Asset Policy Built for the 21st Century. According to information from the committee’s website, it will focus on what needs to be done to create a tax policy framework for digital assets. As of Sunday last week, there was no list of witnesses available. Meanwhile, the Senate hearing is titled Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets. It will include Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, Paradigm general partner Dan Robinson, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as witnesses. This committee will discuss liquidity systems, how digital assets are held securely, and whether stablecoins are properly backed. As part of “Crypto Week,” House Republicans are preparing to bring two major crypto-related bills to the floor for a vote: the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act , Johnson said. The CLARITY Act, which received approval from two House committees, would create clear authority boundaries between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding various digital assets. The bill is intended to ease regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets that have largely kept Wall Street banks and institutional investors on the edge of cryptocurrency trading. The GENIUS Act, which received approval from the Senate in June, provides a regulatory mechanism for issuing and trading dollar-pegged stablecoins. With the bill presented straight to the House floor, Speaker Johnson is circumventing standard committee procedure, with which amendments to the GENIUS Act can be proposed and voted on. Trump’s crypto ties raise concerns among individuals While both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act had started with bipartisan backing, Democrats in the House and Senate later expressed strong concerns about their approval after President Trump and the Trump family received immense amounts of money through dealing with crypto tokens and stablecoins that a lot of people thought were illegal or corrupt. On the other hand, the Republican majority in both chambers turned down amendments that would have prevented the president and other high-ranking federal officials from trading cryptocurrencies privately while they were in office. Still, if the GENIUS Act passes the House, it would go to President Trump’s desk, and this will open the door for banks, non-bank financial technology companies, and large retailers to be free to issue their own stablecoins and offer the services that consumers use to access their stablecoins. The Senate has not yet discussed the CLARITY Act and is considering its plans for handling the digital asset market. The Trump administration’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets is set to publish its first significant report on crypto by July 22, with David Sacks and Bo Hines in the lead seats. The report, which Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham has likened to a “crypto roadmap,” is anticipated to put forth regulatory and legislative suggestions, which could include proposals for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, better banking access for crypto companies, and the establishment of a national digital asset stockpile.

2025-07-07T14:15:07,"XRP Rich List: Here’s How Much XRP You Need to Join Top 10% Holders","A recent update from crypto analyst Edo Farina has stirred conversation in the XRP community by revealing that holding just 2,486 XRP is enough to place an investor among the top 10% of all XRP holders. The finding offers a fascinating glimpse into XRP’s distribution and highlights how relatively low the barrier to elite ownership still is, especially compared to traditional asset classes. The XRP Distribution Landscape XRP, with a fixed total supply of 100 billion coins, currently has a circulating supply of approximately 56 to 64 billion. While millions of wallet addresses hold XRP, the number of actual individual holders is far lower. Many investors operate multiple wallets—for exchanges, staking, or cold storage—resulting in a skewed impression of overall distribution. Data shows that holding 2,486 XRP—about $6,800 worth at current prices- is enough to qualify for the top 10% of all holders. To be in the top 5%, one needs just 8,762 XRP, while the top 1% starts at around 50,000 XRP . Only a few hundred wallets, roughly 657, hold over 5 million XRP, underscoring the high concentration at the very top. XRP Rich List Update: You need 2,486 $XRP to be on the TOP 10% Full Video: https://t.co/LuOXxnbnV6 pic.twitter.com/FVAFRx8ovf — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 6, 2025 These figures reveal that XRP’s wealth distribution remains top-heavy, yet still offers strategic entry points for smaller retail investors to gain substantial exposure. Strategic Implications for Investors While being in the top 10% doesn’t make one a whale, it does represent a meaningful share of the network. Edo Farina notes that accumulating 10,000 XRP or more puts investors in an even more exclusive category, offering long-term benefits as the asset’s ecosystem matures. These include potential staking rewards, institutional lending yields, and significant appreciation should XRP achieve wider adoption as a global settlement token. Given XRP’s low transaction fees, fast settlement times, and expanding utility, many analysts believe its real value lies in enterprise-level infrastructure and cross-border liquidity, not speculative trading alone. That view is further reinforced by Ripple’s growing network of financial partners and recent strides toward becoming a licensed U.S. banking entity . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bigger Picture XRP’s rich list also serves as a mirror of broader crypto trends. Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has a more consolidated distribution, largely due to significant holdings by Ripple, founders, and centralized exchanges. Yet for retail investors, the opportunity to enter the upper echelons of XRP ownership remains accessible, for now. As XRP adoption expands, particularly through Ripple’s institutional partnerships, the thresholds for top-tier ownership are likely to rise. That means today’s modest holder could, in time, find themselves climbing the ranks without adding a single token, just by holding steady. Edo Farina’s update is more than just a statistic. It’s a reminder that in this evolving financial era, even relatively small investments in high-utility assets like XRP can offer outsized positioning within the ecosystem. For those watching from the sidelines, this could be the ideal moment to act. For those already in, it’s a reaffirmation of where they stand in a rapidly growing digital economy.

2025-07-07T14:10:15,"Explosive Digital Asset Inflows: CoinShares Report Reveals Record $1.03 Billion Surge","BitcoinWorld Explosive Digital Asset Inflows: CoinShares Report Reveals Record $1.03 Billion Surge Are you keeping an eye on the pulse of the crypto market? If so, prepare for some exciting news! The latest CoinShares Report has just dropped, revealing a monumental week for digital asset investments. We’re talking about a staggering $1.03 billion in Digital Asset Inflows , a figure that not only highlights robust investor confidence but also propels the total assets under management (AuM) to an unprecedented $188 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the growing institutional appetite and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Latest CoinShares Report: A Snapshot of Market Health The weekly Digital Asset Fund Flows report by CoinShares is a critical barometer for institutional engagement in the crypto space. It tracks capital movements into various Crypto Investment Products , offering invaluable insights into market sentiment and trends. This recent report paints a decidedly bullish picture, with the vast majority of inflows concentrated in the United States, which alone accounted for $1 billion. While North America dominated the positive sentiment, it’s worth noting that some regions, specifically Canada and Brazil, experienced outflows, suggesting a nuanced global investment landscape. Key Takeaways from the Report: Total Inflows: $1.03 billion injected into digital asset investment products. Record AuM: Assets under management soared to an all-time high of $188 billion. Geographical Focus: The U.S. led the charge with $1 billion in inflows, indicating strong domestic institutional interest. Regional Divergence: Canada and Brazil saw outflows, highlighting varying regional market dynamics. Why Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin in Recent Inflows While Bitcoin (BTC) often grabs the headlines, the CoinShares report brings an intriguing development to light: Ethereum (ETH) has consistently outperformed Bitcoin in terms of weekly inflows over the past 12 weeks. Ethereum averaged 1.6% in weekly inflows, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%. What could be driving this trend? Ethereum’s robust ecosystem continues to be a magnet for capital. Its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various blockchain applications makes it more than just a digital currency; it’s a programmable platform. Investors might be increasingly recognizing ETH’s potential beyond a simple store of value, viewing it as an investment in the future of decentralized technology. This sustained performance indicates a growing diversification within institutional portfolios, moving beyond just Bitcoin to embrace the broader altcoin market, especially those with strong utility and development. The Significance of Record AuM: What Does $188 Billion Mean? The achievement of a Record AuM of $188 billion is more than just a numerical milestone; it’s a powerful statement about the maturity and increasing acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance. This figure represents the total value of assets managed by various investment products like ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) and trusts, reflecting the scale of institutional and professional investor participation. Implications of Record AuM: Institutional Validation: A higher AuM signals growing confidence from large financial entities, legitimizing digital assets as a viable asset class. Market Liquidity and Stability: Increased institutional capital can contribute to deeper liquidity and potentially reduce volatility in the long term. Infrastructure Growth: The influx of capital often fuels further development in regulatory frameworks, custody solutions, and trading platforms, creating a more robust ecosystem. Mainstream Integration: As more traditional investment vehicles embrace crypto, it paves the way for broader public access and understanding. Navigating the Future of Crypto Investment Products The impressive Digital Asset Inflows highlighted by the latest CoinShares report underscore a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. While the benefits of institutional adoption are clear—increased capital, enhanced legitimacy, and infrastructure development—challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the need for greater investor education are ongoing hurdles that the industry must address. For investors, these trends offer actionable insights. Observing which assets attract the most inflows can help in understanding market sentiment and potential future growth areas. The consistent performance of Ethereum, for instance, suggests a strong belief in its ecosystem’s long-term value. Similarly, the dominance of U.S. inflows points to the significant role of American financial markets in shaping global crypto trends. In conclusion, the latest CoinShares report is a resounding affirmation of the growing institutional interest and confidence in digital assets. The record AuM and significant inflows, particularly into Ethereum, signal a dynamic and evolving landscape. As the market continues to mature, we can expect more sophisticated investment products and greater integration into traditional finance, making digital assets an increasingly undeniable force in the global economy.

2025-07-07T14:07:57,"Popular Trader Dumps 5 Altcoins to Focus on Meme Coins With 100X Potential","TL;DR One well-known crypto trader sold TIA, ONDO, and other holdings to chase major gains in the meme coin niche – a move that sparked both support and skepticism across the crypto community. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance above 64%, some analysts believe an altseason is near, with low-cap tokens such as HNT and ONDO expected to lead the charge. Cashing Out While talk of an upcoming altseason continues to buzz across the crypto space, popular X user Crypto Beast has decided to offload some of their bags. The trader revealed the sell-off occurred on July 7 and included the tokens Celestia (TIA), Ondo (ONDO), Ethena (ENA), Quant (QNT), and Pyth Network (PYTH). It is worth mentioning that all of the aforementioned have posted some gains on a 24-hour scale. TIA leads the charge with a spike of around 10%, while the rest have recorded more modest increases. The crypto enthusiast claimed the sold altcoins have utility but questioned whether this is needed in the space. “They’re good for one thing: making VCs richer,” they added. Crypto Beast has now shifted focus to hunting meme coins with 100x potential. Some X users commenting on the post supported the decision, stressing the importance of profit-taking. Others, though, wondered why the trader would prioritize meme coins, considering the hype for these tokens had significantly reduced in the past several months. Recall that the sector was booming towards the end of last year, with its total market cap surging past $120 billion. Currently, the capitalization stands at less than $60 billion (per CoinGecko’s data). Was This the Right Time? Bitcoin (BTC) continues to outperform its rivals, and as of this writing, its market dominance is beyond 64%. However, multiple industry participants believe the altcoins have yet to catch up with the biggest cryptocurrency and steal the show. BTC Dominance, Source: CMC X user Chiefy predicted that the next altcoin “super-cycle” will start in July. “This time, low caps will pump 175x and ignite the most powerful altseason,” they forecasted. The analyst thinks Sui Network (SUI), Helium (HNT), Render (RENDER), Filecoin (FIL), and Ondo (ONDO) are among the top contenders for explosive rallies. It’s worth noting, though, that SUI should not be placed in the same ‘low-cap’ category, as it’s the 15th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $10 billion. Carl Moon – an X user with over 1.5 million followers – chipped in, too. He claimed that the altcoins “will go parabolic” once the combined market capitalization of all digital assets (excluding BTC and ETH) soars above $1.15 trillion. Currently, the figure stands well below $1 trillion.

2025-07-07T14:04:13,"Why Is the Crypto Market Up Today? Here Are 3 Top Cryptos to Buy for the Next Rally","Crypto charts are glowing green. The total crypto market cap has exploded to $3.36T on the daily chart, riding a whopping 40% surge in trading volume. Bitcoin’s already crossed $109K and looks set to break its previous all-time high of $111,970 any moment now. Altcoins aren’t sitting out either. Bonk pumped high in a day to $0.00002320 , and Floki leapt by 10% , joining $BTC on the rocket ride. What’s Fuelling the Crypto Fire? Bitcoin has clawed back its weekly losses and now sits at a $2.15T market cap. Across the board, crypto added $92B in just one day, pushing the total market cap to $3.35T. If this level holds, it could set the stage for a new leg up. Meanwhile, political winds are shifting in crypto’s favour. Elon Musk has announced the formation of the ‘America Party’ on X, a move to shake up the two-party system. When asked if he would support crypto, the answer was remarkably positive for the market . Bitcoin’s 24-hour technicals also paint a bullish picture, 13 out of 25 major indicators flashing green, including 12 strong buy signals from moving averages. Indicator Value Signal What It Means Exponential Moving Average (10) 108,112.54 Buy BTC is trading above this average, showing strong short-term potential. Exponential Moving Average (200) 96,464.53 Buy Long-term outlook remains bullish, with price well above this level. MACD Level (12, 26) 964.38 Buy Indicates a growing bullish picture; recent buying pressure is dominant. Stochastic RSI Fast (3,3,14,14) 76.29 Neutral Close to being overbought. It reflects active trading and market confidence. Relative Strength Index (14) 57.08 Neutral Market is balanced: plenty of room left for upward movement. With both macro sentiment and meme mania aligned, July could end up being crypto’s wildest month of the year. 1. Bitcoin Hyper Rides the Bitcoin Momentum As Bitcoin pushes into six-figure territory, strategic investors are stocking up on a new altcoin. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Layer 2 project that transforms Bitcoin from slow and expensive to lightning-fast and DeFi-ready. Users can bridge $BTC into the Hyper ecosystem to unlock instant transactions, meme coins, staking rewards, and more without sacrificing security. It’s Bitcoin, but turbocharged. With over $2M raised in its presale and rewards yielding up to around 394% APY, Bitcoin Hyper is going viral. The token does more than just sit in a wallet. It fuels apps, trading, governance, and cross-chain action. As Bitcoin reclaims market dominance, $HYPER could be the engine that drives its next evolution. 2. Token6900 Launches Presale, Takes Off TOKEN6900 ($T6900) isn’t another altcoin trying to change the world. Refreshingly, the meme coin makes no effort to pretend. It has no AI buzzwords. No fake roadmaps. $T6900 is built for the chronically online and proudly pointless. It ditches utility in favour of pure satire, wrapped in early 2000s nostalgia and ’69’ energy. The presale is live, with 80% of the supply up for grabs and a hard cap of $5M. The token is being compared to SPX6900, which has recorded 51,739,000% growth since its launch and over 10,300% in a year. The project has no plans to track anything except collective delusion. Now in the early stages of its presale, Token6900 is available for heavily discounted prices. With each new stage, the token price will climb up and the staking APY will decline, promoting early participation. 3. FLOKI’s Back on the Radar FLOKI’s another altcoin riding the wave of bullish market energy. Technical indicators are leaning bullish, which could pave the way for FLOKI to stretch its legs into a bigger rally. But the breakout isn’t confirmed yet. If it fails to breach resistance, a dip to the $0.00008172 support zone could be on the cards. Still, with the meme coin narrative heating up again and Floki’s strong community backing, traders are watching it closely. Is the Crypto Super Cycle Close? With a pro-crypto regulatory shift and rising institutional appetite, signs of another super cycle are starting to show. But this time, investors aren’t sticking to the usual suspects like $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, or $BONK. There’s a noticeable shift to low-cap players like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Token6900 ($T6900), still available at entry-level prices in their ongoing presales. With interest picking up, early buyers are jumping in before the next price hike. However, as always, investors should do their own research before buying presale coins. They might have moon-shot potential, but they’re also wild rides.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-crypto-market-up-today-top-cryptos-to-buy/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T14:00:06,"Bitcoin Price: Unveiling Four Crucial Trends Shaping BTC This Week","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Unveiling Four Crucial Trends Shaping BTC This Week The crypto world never sleeps, and for investors eyeing the digital gold, understanding the intricate dance of Bitcoin market trends is paramount. As we navigate another dynamic week, several key indicators are emerging that could significantly influence Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just keeping an eye on your portfolio, these insights are crucial for making informed decisions in a volatile landscape. Let’s dive into the core factors that Cointelegraph highlights as pivotal for Bitcoin’s performance this week. Is a BTC Price Prediction of Retracement on the Horizon? One of the most talked-about technical indicators in the current Bitcoin discourse is the potential for a retracement to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). This key technical level often acts as a significant support or resistance zone for assets. For Bitcoin, this could mean a correction towards the $105,000 level . But what does this really mean for the average investor? Understanding the 50-day SMA: This average tracks Bitcoin’s price over the last 50 trading days, smoothing out short-term fluctuations to reveal the underlying trend. A price trading above it typically signals bullish momentum, while a drop towards or below it can indicate a cooling-off period or a potential reversal. The Significance of $105,000: If BTC does retrace to this level, it would test a crucial support point. For some, this presents a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, assuming the long-term bullish trend remains intact. For others, it might signal a deeper correction. Navigating Volatility: Such a retracement, while potentially alarming to some, is a natural part of healthy market cycles. It allows the market to consolidate gains and gather strength for the next leg up. Monitoring this level will be vital for any BTC price prediction you might be making this week. A strong bounce off the 50-day SMA would reinforce bullish sentiment, whereas a decisive break below it could signal further downside. Decoding Crypto Market Analysis : Can Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Endure? Bitcoin recently achieved a historic weekly close, a milestone that typically ignites fervent optimism among market participants. However, despite this impressive feat, a cloud of uncertainty looms over BTC’s sustained bullish momentum. Why the hesitation after such a strong performance? Profit-Taking Pressure: After significant rallies, it’s common for early investors and short-term traders to take profits, which can exert downward pressure on the price. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader economic landscape, including inflation concerns and interest rate expectations, can temper even the strongest asset rallies. Market Fatigue: Sustained parabolic moves can lead to market fatigue, where buyers become exhausted, and the asset needs time to consolidate before another leg higher. Expert crypto market analysis suggests that while the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains strong, the short-term path is less clear. The key challenge lies in whether new capital inflows can outpace the selling pressure from profit-takers and those wary of macro conditions. Investors should watch for signs of continued institutional adoption and sustained trading volume to gauge the underlying strength of this momentum. How Will the FOMC Meeting Impact Bitcoin’s Next Move? Beyond the technical charts, macroeconomic events play an undeniable role in the crypto market. This week, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes are a critical point of interest. The Federal Reserve’s stance on monetary policy, particularly interest rates, can send ripples across all financial markets, including Bitcoin. Historically, a hawkish stance (implying higher interest rates) tends to be bearish for risk assets like Bitcoin, as it makes traditional investments more attractive. Conversely, a dovish stance (lower interest rates or quantitative easing) often fuels a rally in risk assets. Additionally, a weakening U.S. dollar often correlates with a strengthening Bitcoin. Here’s why: Factor Impact on USD Potential Impact on BTC Hawkish FOMC (Higher Rates) Stronger USD Negative (BTC less attractive) Dovish FOMC (Lower Rates) Weaker USD Positive (BTC more attractive) Weakening U.S. Dollar Decreased Purchasing Power Positive (BTC as inflation hedge) The minutes will provide deeper insights into the Fed’s future plans, offering clarity that could significantly influence the dollar’s strength and, by extension, Bitcoin’s appeal. The FOMC meeting impact is often felt immediately in the markets, so keeping an eye on financial news outlets around the release time is advisable. Are Declining Bitcoin Funding Rates Signaling an Imminent Squeeze? Finally, a fascinating on-chain metric to watch is the declining funding rates on Binance Futures. Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price close to the spot price. When funding rates are positive, longs pay shorts; when negative, shorts pay longs. A significant drop in funding rates, or even a flip to negative, indicates that short sellers are becoming more dominant or aggressive in the derivatives market. This might seem bearish on the surface, but it can actually set the stage for a ‘short squeeze’. What is a Short Squeeze? It occurs when an asset’s price rises sharply, forcing short sellers (who bet on a price decline) to buy back the asset to limit their losses. This buying further fuels the price increase, creating a cascading effect. Why Declining Rates Matter: When Bitcoin funding rates turn low or negative, it means shorts are paying longs, or that there’s a strong belief the price will fall. If the price then unexpectedly starts to rise, these shorts are forced to cover their positions, creating a surge in demand that can propel the price even higher. Binance Futures Insights: As one of the largest derivatives exchanges, trends on Binance Futures often reflect broader market sentiment and positioning. A noticeable drop here could precede a significant price movement. While not a guaranteed outcome, the declining funding rates are a strong signal that a short squeeze could be on the horizon, potentially leading to a sharp upward movement for BTC. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Week Ahead This week promises to be pivotal for Bitcoin, with a confluence of technical, fundamental, and on-chain factors at play. From potential retracements that could offer buying opportunities to macroeconomic decisions that shift market sentiment, and derivative market dynamics signaling explosive moves, staying informed is your best strategy. The interplay between these factors underscores the complexity and excitement of the crypto market. While no single indicator guarantees future performance, understanding these top Bitcoin market trends empowers you to make more strategic decisions and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. Remember to always conduct your own research and manage risk effectively. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-07-07T14:00:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.458 Price Change 24h -1.4% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.458 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis Pi’s price is below $0.46, forming lower highs while testing weak support zones. The MACD shows continued bearish momentum, with weak crossover signals and minimal upward strength. RSI stays under 40 on both charts, signalling persistent oversold conditions with no recovery yet. As of July 7th 2025, the Pi Network’s price fell to $0.4589, continuing its bearish trend with weak buying interest. Resistance stands at $0.4760, where sellers repeatedly halt upward attempts. The key support level is $0.4570, which has been tested multiple times without a clear breakdown. A drop below this support could push the price toward the $0.44 region. Pi 1-day chart shows struggles below $0.46 On the 24-hour chart, Pi Network is trading at $0.4589, showing a 1.44% decline for the day. The price continues to form lower highs, indicating sustained bearish momentum. The RSI sits at 33.76, showing the token is nearing oversold territory with weak buying strength. Meanwhile, the MACD remains bearish, with the MACD line at -0.0029 and the signal line at -0.0387. This alignment suggests downward pressure is likely to persist unless volume and sentiment shift significantly. PIUSDT Price Chart By TradingView Pi/USDT 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Pi/USDT is trading at $0.4592 after dropping 1.80% in the current session. The price failed to hold above $0.46, showing weak buyer interest and continued downward momentum. The RSI reads 34.45, indicating persistent bearish pressure with no sign of a reversal. Although the MACD line has slightly recovered to 0.0021, it remains below the signal line at -0.0099, signalling limited momentum. Without stronger volume or a breakout above resistance, Pi remains vulnerable to further declines. PIUSDT Price Chart By TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event.

In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T13:58:46,"Bitcoin Developer Jon Atack Briefly Arrested in El Salvador After Neighborly Dispute","Senior Bitcoin developer Jon Atack was arrested in El Salvador over the weekend following a dispute with a neighbor, sparking an online flurry of concern before he was freed about an hour later. Atack, who contributes to Bitcoin Core, posted on microblogging platform X that police confiscated his phone and passport, cutting him off from the outside world and fueling fears in crypto circles. Law enforcement initially told him he could be sent to a nearby prison, though he avoided that outcome. The altercation appears tied to a disagreement over property issues rather than Atack’s crypto work. Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office and a vocal supporter of President Nayib Bukele, said Atack’s neighbor accused him of “violence against women.” Under El Salvador’s 2012 law known as Vida Libre de Violencia para las Mujeres (LEIV), which directly translates to “life free from violence for women,” violent speech and threats against women are criminal offenses. Atack was released within minutes after being handcuffed, describing the officers as “professional and friendly.” He thanked supporters online, saying , “This was the first time I’ve been in cuffs and God willing also the last time.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2025/07/07/bitcoin-developer-jon-atack-briefly-arrested-in-el-salvador-after-neighborly-dispute,"BTC|REGULATION","Web3|El Salvador|Bitcoin Core|News",cryptocompare

While we’ve seen some short-term softness, long-term conviction remains intact. The market is pausing—not panicking. Part of that pause stems from recent comments by Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , who said he’d welcome a major Bitcoin crash. Bitcoin Crash? That’s Exactly What ‘Poor Dad’ Kiyosaki Is Hoping For https://t.co/9Lp6mypiLq — Crypto Brothers (@LosKruptos) July 6, 2025 His reasoning? Buy more . Kiyosaki revealed he purchased BTC above $100,000 and plans to add again on any sharp drop. His price targets remain aggressive—$200,000 by year-end and $1 million within five years.

Institutions Stay Active as ETFs and Treasuries Grow Despite the near-term hesitation, institutional activity has picked up noticeably. Spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $769.6 million last week, according to SoSoValue. That marks four consecutive weeks of inflows, beginning mid-June. On the corporate side, Japan’s Metaplanet added 2,205 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total to 15,555 BTC.

Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a long-term treasury asset, and consistent accumulation by institutions continues to provide structural support against short-term volatility. Recent accumulation highlights: $769.6 million in spot BTC ETF inflows last week Metaplanet treasury now holds 15,555 BTC Blockchain Group added 116 BTC to its balance sheet The divergence between short-term sentiment and long-term capital is widening. The former is cautious, but the latter is steadily building exposure. Bitcoin Technical Outlook and Macro Pressures Technically, Bitcoin has slipped just below a short-term ascending trendline and the 50-period simple moving average around $108,641. It’s currently hovering near the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $108,482, with RSI neutral around 45. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC loses $108,482 on a closing basis, the following levels to watch are $107,836 and $107,202, which mark the 0.618 retracement. A recovery above $109,267 would bring $109,274 into focus and could signal a bullish continuation. Essential levels to monitor: Support: $108,482, $107,836, $107,202 Resistance: $109,267, $109,274 50-SMA: $108,641 In addition to technical analysis, geopolitical concerns are keeping markets on edge. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated that paused U.S. tariffs could resume on August 1. While not immediate, the uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bottom Line Robert Kiyosaki’s crash call may sound extreme, but it’s consistent with a growing long-term mindset. Institutional flows, ETF demand, and corporate treasury all point to one thing: the smart money is still buying. Whether Bitcoin revisits lower support or breaks above $110,000 again, the fundamentals remain strong. The narrative has shifted from speculation to structure, and that’s a sign of maturity. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised nearly $2 million in its public presale, with $1,980,292 out of a $2,452,414 target.

2025-07-07T13:50:12,"Coinsilium’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Bold Move in Digital Assets","BitcoinWorld Coinsilium’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Bold Move in Digital Assets In the dynamic world of digital assets, every move by a significant player sends ripples across the market. The recent announcement that UK-based Web3 investment firm Coinsilium has purchased an additional 14.9 BTC, bringing its total holdings to a remarkable 88.63 BTC, is more than just a transaction. It’s a strategic declaration of confidence in the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This latest acquisition, reported by @btcNLNico on X, underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking firms: a steadfast commitment to integrating digital assets into their core strategy. But what does this mean for Coinsilium, the market, and the evolving landscape of Web3? Coinsilium Bitcoin: What Does This Latest Acquisition Signify? Coinsilium, a company at the forefront of Web3 innovation, has consistently demonstrated a proactive approach to digital asset investment. Their latest purchase of 14.9 Coinsilium Bitcoin is not an isolated event but rather a continuation of a deliberate strategy to build a robust portfolio. For a firm specializing in Web3 technologies, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin is a testament to their belief in its foundational role within the decentralized economy. Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ serves as a primary store of value in the cryptocurrency space, making it a logical anchor for any serious digital asset investor. This incremental accumulation reflects a long-term perspective, suggesting that Coinsilium views Bitcoin not as a speculative short-term trade, but as a strategic reserve asset. By increasing their Coinsilium Bitcoin holdings, they are strengthening their balance sheet with an asset that has historically appreciated significantly over time, despite its volatility. It signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition and its potential to act as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. What Drives a Web3 Investment Firm to Accumulate BTC? The decision by a Web3 investment firm like Coinsilium to continually add to its Bitcoin reserves is rooted in several key factors that define the ethos and operational philosophy of the Web3 space. Unlike traditional investment firms, Web3 entities are deeply embedded in the decentralized internet, understanding its underlying technologies and potential disruptions. Belief in Decentralization: Bitcoin embodies the core principles of decentralization, which is fundamental to Web3. A firm committed to building the decentralized future naturally aligns with the most decentralized and secure cryptocurrency. Long-Term Value Proposition: Beyond short-term price movements, Bitcoin’s scarcity, global accessibility, and censorship resistance make it an attractive long-term asset. A Web3 investment firm often takes a generational view, seeing Bitcoin as a cornerstone of the future financial system. Strategic Treasury Management: For many companies, holding Bitcoin is becoming a form of treasury management, offering an alternative to traditional cash reserves that might be devalued by inflation. It’s a proactive way to preserve and potentially grow capital. Industry Leadership: By publicly accumulating Bitcoin, firms like Coinsilium set an example, signaling confidence to their peers, partners, and the broader market. It reinforces their position as pioneers in the Web3 domain. For a Web3 investment firm , Bitcoin isn’t just another asset; it’s a foundational element of the digital future they are actively helping to build. Why Are Growing Crypto Holdings So Significant? The increasing trend of companies like Coinsilium expanding their crypto holdings carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and the evolving financial landscape. When publicly traded companies, especially those with a focus on innovation, allocate a substantial portion of their treasury to digital assets, it sends a powerful message of legitimacy and maturation. Firstly, it boosts institutional confidence. As more corporate entities embrace Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it normalizes digital assets within traditional finance. This can encourage other corporations, institutional investors, and even sovereign wealth funds to consider similar strategies, potentially unlocking vast pools of capital for the crypto market. The 88.63 BTC held by Coinsilium, while not on the scale of a MicroStrategy, is a clear signal of their conviction and a testament to the viability of digital assets as part of a corporate balance sheet. Secondly, growing crypto holdings can impact market dynamics. Increased institutional demand reduces the circulating supply of Bitcoin available on exchanges, which, coupled with its fixed supply, can exert upward pressure on its price over the long term. This accumulation strategy reflects a belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to grow as adoption expands and its utility as a global, permissionless asset becomes more evident. Furthermore, it highlights a strategic shift in corporate finance. Companies are moving beyond traditional assets and exploring new avenues for capital preservation and growth in an increasingly digital world. This proactive approach to managing crypto holdings positions them to benefit from the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Bitcoin Accumulation: A Broader Market Trend? Coinsilium’s recent purchase is not an isolated incident but rather a microcosm of a much larger, ongoing trend: widespread Bitcoin accumulation by various entities. From publicly traded corporations to institutional funds and even nation-states, the appetite for Bitcoin as a strategic asset has grown considerably over the past few years. One of the most prominent examples is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC. This pioneering move inspired many others to consider similar strategies. While not every company will go to the same lengths, the idea of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or a growth asset has gained significant traction. Beyond individual corporations, the advent of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions has provided an easier, more regulated pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. These ETFs have seen substantial inflows, further indicating a broad-based institutional desire for Bitcoin accumulation without the complexities of direct custody. This trend suggests a maturing market where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative digital currency, but as a legitimate and essential component of a diversified investment portfolio. It underscores the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset with inherent value that can act as a safe haven during economic uncertainty and a powerful growth engine during periods of innovation. The continued Bitcoin accumulation by diverse players is a strong indicator of its long-term staying power and increasing mainstream acceptance. Coinsilium’s Digital Asset Strategy: What’s Their Long-Term Vision? The consistent increase in Coinsilium’s Bitcoin holdings provides a clear window into their overarching digital asset strategy . As a Web3 investment firm, their vision extends beyond mere trading; it encompasses active participation in and support for the foundational technologies that underpin the decentralized internet. Their strategy appears to be multi-faceted: Building a Strong Reserve: By accumulating Bitcoin, Coinsilium is building a robust and liquid reserve asset. This provides financial stability and flexibility, allowing them to pursue other strategic investments within the Web3 ecosystem. Strategic Investment in Web3 Projects: While Bitcoin forms the bedrock, Coinsilium’s primary focus remains on identifying and investing in promising Web3 projects, startups, and protocols. Their Bitcoin holdings provide the capital base to fund these ventures, from DeFi to NFTs, metaverse, and decentralized infrastructure. Long-Term Growth and Value Creation: Their digital asset strategy is geared towards long-term value creation. They are not chasing fleeting trends but rather investing in assets and technologies they believe will define the next generation of the internet. This includes not only direct asset purchases but also equity investments in Web3 companies. Mitigating Inflationary Risks: In an era of increasing global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, holding a non-sovereign, scarce asset like Bitcoin can be a crucial component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy to protect and grow capital. Coinsilium’s approach serves as a compelling example for other firms considering their entry into the digital asset space. It highlights the importance of a clear, well-defined strategy that balances foundational asset accumulation with targeted investments in emerging technologies. Their actions demonstrate a belief in the transformative power of Web3 and the integral role Bitcoin plays within it. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the benefits of holding Bitcoin are clear, firms like Coinsilium also navigate inherent challenges. Volatility remains a key concern, requiring a robust risk management framework. Regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, demanding vigilance and adaptability. Security of digital assets is paramount, necessitating sophisticated custody solutions. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. The potential for significant capital appreciation, the ability to participate in a rapidly expanding technological frontier, and the strategic advantage of being an early mover in Web3 are compelling incentives. Coinsilium’s continued investment signals a deep understanding of these dynamics. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on the Digital Future Coinsilium’s consistent and strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a powerful statement in the evolving narrative of institutional crypto adoption. Their latest purchase of 14.9 BTC, pushing their total holdings to 88.63 BTC, reinforces their position as a visionary Web3 investment firm . It underscores a clear digital asset strategy focused on long-term value and a profound belief in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational asset in the decentralized economy. This move is more than just an investment; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of finance and technology. As crypto holdings by corporations continue to grow, they pave the way for greater mainstream acceptance and integration of digital assets. Coinsilium is not just observing the future; they are actively investing in and shaping it, demonstrating that strategic foresight and a bold approach are key to thriving in the digital age.

The dramatic turnaround from its software business roots comes as the company simultaneously launched a $4.2 billion STRD preferred stock program to acquire additional Bitcoin.

The company incurred $4.04 billion in associated deferred tax expense and holds a $6.31 billion deferred tax liability.

Source: Saylor Tracker During Q2 2025, the company acquired 69,140 bitcoins at a total value of $6.77 billion, funded through multiple equity offerings, including $5.2 billion from common stock ATM programs and $979.7 million from the STRD offering. Capital Markets Activity Fuels Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Strategy received $6.8 billion in aggregate net proceeds from various financing transactions during Q2 2025. The capital raising included $163.1 million from the STRF ATM program, $446.9 million from the STRK ATM program, and $979.7 million from the STRD registered underwritten offering, which was completed on June 10. The company’s 2024 Common ATM program generated $2.4 billion in revenue before its termination, while the new 2025 Common ATM program contributed $2.9 billion. Approximately $18.1 billion of Class A common stock remains available for future issuance under the 2025 program, alongside $20.5 billion of STRK Stock and $1.9 billion of STRF Stock. Strategy’s preferred stock portfolio totals $3.4 billion in notional value with $315.9 million in annual dividends. The company maintains $8.213 billion in convertible notes outstanding, with conversion conditions met for Q3 2025 based on the 130% conversion price threshold.

Source: Strategy Report Bitcoin market prices during Q2 ranged from $74,420.69 to $112,000.00, with quarter-end pricing at $107,751.68 on Coinbase. The volatility created substantial fair value fluctuations, contrasting with the $5.91 billion unrealized loss in Q1 2025.

The complaint mentioned the $5.9 billion unrealized loss disclosure in Q1 2025, which triggered an 8% decline in stock price and exposed volatility risks allegedly downplayed by management.

Analyst Points to This Week!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), which has been lagging behind Bitcoin for a long time and has failed to meet expectations, now seems ready for a big explosion. At this point, one analyst said that the market is going to explode this week and chose Ethereum as the main target. Famous investor Eugene published a positive analysis about Ethereum and stated that he has high expectations for ETH. “A breakout is expected this week and I have chosen Ethereum as my base asset,” Eugene wrote in his analysis on his channel. Ethereum Becomes the Most Undervalued Asset! Eugene cited Ethereum’s low market cap, institutional investment, and correlation with Bitcoin as factors that will drive its growth and explosion. At this point, Eugene, who described Ethereum as the most undervalued asset this year, predicted that Ethereum would also rise when Bitcoin was strong, based on its correlation with Bitcoin, among other factors. “After Ethereum fell from $4,000 to $1,400 this year, no one outside of developers saw it as a major investment target. This means that from a long-term perspective, Ethereum is at its lowest value in the last three years.” However, Eugene stated that traditional finance interest will now shift to Ethereum, saying, “Ethereum will become an investment target for mainstream institutions and traditional financial institutions in the infrastructure and stablecoin sectors.” Bitcoin Could Upgrade Ethereum! Finally, Eugene stated that the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum will be a driving force for ETH, saying, “If Bitcoin exceeds $ 110,000, Ethereum is likely to enter a bull market.

However, after a 12-week buying streak, demand for MSTR, STRK, and STRF started to stall, leading to smaller weekly purchases. The recent pause in buying new BTC may also be a normal operation for the company at the end of the quarter. After the latest skipped purchase, Strategy retains enough authorized stocks to buy up to 500K BTC, as its treasury-building may run up to the end of the decade. For now, the firm’s purchases remain viable, as BTC hovers at a relatively high range, with no significant cycle corrections. The market may have anticipated the skipped weekly purchase, leaving MSTR shares with limited change. MSTR traded above $402, recovering earlier losses. Strategy skips weekly BTC purchase The three-month streak for Strategy once again raised questions about its MSTR stock dilution and the issuance of its alternative convertible shares. On Sunday, executive chairman Michael Saylor hinted at no new purchases this week. Some weeks you just need to HODL. pic.twitter.com/rVcFQkFoG0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 6, 2025 Strategy paused at 597,325 BTC, with an average purchase price rising to $70,982, at the lower range compared to newer treasuries. After accelerated buying from new corporate treasury firms, MSTR is facing competition in the demand for shares. Other stocks often outperform MSTR, though trading under less liquid conditions and with higher risk of volatility. The skipped weekly purchase coincides with a general boost in smaller additions to treasuries, including those of Metaplanet , The Blockchain Group, the Smart Web Company, and others. Even Semler Scientific added another 187 BTC in one of its sporadic purchases. Even without Saylor’s involvement, IBIT and other corporate buyers take thousands of BTC off the market. STRD at-the-market program opens Until recently, the new preferred STRD shares only saw minimal placements. Following this week’s BTC buying hiatus, Strategy announced a new at-the-market program for STRD. The new STRD ATM program intends to raise up to $4.2B over time, depending on market conditions. STRD may be sold and placed by agents and other methods deemed “at the market.” The STRD ATM program will supply funds for general corporate purposes, including new BTC acquisition, as well as for working capital. Strategy may also use the proceeds to pay out the 10% dividends for the Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) and the Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK).

2025-07-07T13:40:18,"BBVA Crypto: Spain’s Banking Giant Revolutionizes Retail Access to Bitcoin and Ethereum","BitcoinWorld BBVA Crypto: Spain’s Banking Giant Revolutionizes Retail Access to Bitcoin and Ethereum The financial world is constantly evolving, and a major shift is underway as traditional banking giants embrace the digital asset revolution. In a significant move that signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, Spanish banking powerhouse BBVA has officially opened its doors to the world of digital assets for its retail customers in Spain. This isn’t just another small step; it’s a bold leap, making it easier than ever for everyday individuals to engage with cryptocurrencies directly through their trusted bank. BBVA Crypto: Unlocking Digital Assets for Everyone BBVA, one of Europe’s largest financial institutions, has announced the launch of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) trading and custody services directly within its mobile banking application for retail customers in Spain. This strategic integration means that users no longer need to navigate complex external crypto exchanges. Instead, they can seamlessly buy, sell, and hold their digital assets right alongside their traditional banking products. The key differentiator here is BBVA’s commitment to self-custody, ensuring that the service is fully integrated within their digital banking platform and independent of third-party custodians. This approach aims to provide a higher level of security and convenience, leveraging the bank’s robust infrastructure and regulatory compliance. The BBVA crypto initiative underscores a pivotal moment for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. The Bitcoin Spain Revolution: What This Means for BTC Holders For years, acquiring Bitcoin in Spain often involved using specialized crypto platforms, which, while effective, sometimes presented a steeper learning curve for new users. BBVA’s new offering dramatically simplifies this process. Retail customers can now access Bitcoin (BTC) directly through an interface they already know and trust – their banking app. This move by a major institution like BBVA lends significant legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially encouraging a broader demographic of investors who might have previously been hesitant due to perceived complexities or security concerns. The ease of access provided by BBVA could significantly boost the number of Bitcoin holders in Spain, contributing to greater liquidity and mainstream acceptance of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This development truly marks a new chapter for Bitcoin Spain , making it more accessible than ever before. Ethereum Spain: Empowering the Smart Contract Ecosystem Beyond Bitcoin, BBVA’s inclusion of Ethereum (ETH) is equally impactful. Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and countless decentralized applications (dApps), represents a different facet of the crypto world. By offering ETH trading and custody, BBVA is not just providing access to a digital currency; it’s indirectly opening a gateway to the broader Web3 ecosystem for its Spanish clientele. This is particularly significant as the Ethereum network continues to evolve, with ongoing upgrades like the upcoming “Dencun” upgrade aiming to enhance scalability and efficiency. The ability for retail customers to easily acquire and hold Ethereum through a regulated banking channel could spur greater participation in the burgeoning DeFi space and foster innovation within the Ethereum Spain community. It signals a recognition of Ethereum’s foundational role in the future of digital finance. Crypto Banking Spain: A New Era of Financial Integration BBVA’s foray into crypto services for retail customers in Spain is part of a larger global trend where traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring and adopting digital assets. This shift is driven by growing client demand, the potential for new revenue streams, and the recognition of blockchain technology’s transformative power. For crypto banking Spain , this move by BBVA sets a precedent. While some banks have launched similar services for institutional clients, offering it directly to retail customers via a mobile app is a significant step towards mainstream integration. This development highlights a strategic pivot for banks, moving from a cautious, wait-and-see approach to actively participating in the digital asset market. It also poses questions about how other Spanish banks will respond, potentially leading to a competitive landscape that benefits consumers with more choices and innovative services. The integration of crypto within traditional banking frameworks aims to provide the best of both worlds: the innovation and potential of digital assets combined with the security and regulatory compliance of established financial institutions. Why Retail Crypto Trading Through Banks? Unpacking the Benefits and Challenges The decision by BBVA to offer retail crypto trading services directly through its banking app comes with a host of advantages for the everyday user, but also presents unique challenges that both the bank and its customers must navigate. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone considering entering the digital asset space via traditional financial institutions. Key Benefits for Customers: Simplified Access: For many, the traditional banking app is a familiar and trusted interface. Integrating crypto services here significantly lowers the barrier to entry, making it easier for new investors to buy, sell, and hold digital assets without needing to learn a new platform. Enhanced Security & Trust: Banks operate under stringent regulatory frameworks, offering robust cybersecurity measures, internal controls, and often deposit protection for traditional funds. This provides a layer of trust and perceived security that many independent crypto exchanges may not offer, reducing concerns about hacks or fraud. Convenience & Integration: Users can manage their traditional bank accounts and digital asset portfolios from a single, unified interface. This streamlines financial management, making it more convenient to monitor investments and move funds between fiat and crypto. Regulatory Compliance: Trading through a regulated bank means that transactions adhere to strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, providing a clearer, more legitimate pathway for crypto engagement within the established financial system. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Limited Asset Selection: Banks often start with a limited selection of highly liquid and well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This might not satisfy investors looking for exposure to a wider range of altcoins or emerging projects. Custody vs. Control: While banks offer custody, users might not have direct control over their private keys, which is a core tenet of the decentralized crypto ethos (“not your keys, not your crypto”). This means relying on the bank for asset security rather than self-custody. Fees and Pricing: Transaction fees and pricing models might differ from dedicated crypto exchanges. Users should carefully review these structures to ensure competitive rates. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite steps towards clarity, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Banks must continuously adapt to new rules, which can impact service offerings. User Education: While access is simplified, understanding the inherent volatility, market risks, and technological nuances of cryptocurrencies remains vital. Banks have a responsibility to provide comprehensive educational resources. Navigating these benefits and challenges will be key for both BBVA and its customers as they embark on this new financial journey, shaping the future of integrated financial services. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Digital Assets in Banking? BBVA’s pioneering step in Spain could serve as a blueprint for other European and global banks. As demand for digital assets continues to grow, more financial institutions are likely to follow suit, offering integrated crypto services. We might see an expansion of supported cryptocurrencies, the introduction of crypto-backed lending, or even seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, all within the familiar and secure environment of a banking app. The future of finance appears to be a hybrid model, where traditional banking infrastructure coexists and increasingly merges with the innovative capabilities of blockchain and digital assets. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Mainstream Crypto Adoption BBVA’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading and custody services for retail customers in Spain is more than just a new product offering; it’s a significant milestone in the journey towards mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. By bringing digital assets into the secure and regulated environment of traditional banking, BBVA is not only meeting growing consumer demand but also building trust and legitimacy for the entire crypto ecosystem. This move demystifies crypto, making it accessible to millions who might otherwise have remained on the sidelines. It heralds a new era where digital assets are no longer niche investments but an integrated part of everyday financial life, truly transforming how individuals interact with their money and the broader digital economy. This is a game-changer, setting a powerful precedent for the future of finance.

As the week unfolds, all eyes will be on these cryptocurrencies to see if they can capitalize on the current momentum and regulatory environment. Bitcoin (BTC): Current Status : Holding just below $108500 and it is consolidating above a breakout point in a flag pattern. Recent Performance : Bitcoin’s price has risen by 3% over the last week and 8.5% over the last two weeks. It is currently down 1.91% from its 7-day high of $110,590. Market Sentiment: Bullish, driven by strong corporate and institutional demand and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Indicators like the daily RSI at 55, above the median line, CMF at 0.11, AO histogram rising, and MACD displaying bullish crossover suggest continued upward momentum.

Often seen as a bellwether for retail sentiment and emerging narratives, understanding the pulse of the **Korean crypto trends** can offer invaluable insights for investors worldwide. Every week, the discussions and searches within the local community, often referred to as the K-Community, provide a fascinating snapshot of what’s capturing attention. This report delves into the most searched for and mentioned tokens within the K-Community of Bitcoin World between June 27 and July 3, offering a unique window into the minds of South Korean crypto enthusiasts. Unveiling the Pulse of **Korean Crypto Trends** The data from Bitcoin World’s K-Community offers a unique lens through which to observe the rapidly evolving interests of South Korean crypto investors. Unlike global averages, local sentiment can be heavily influenced by regional news, regulatory shifts, and even cultural phenomena. Analyzing both search volume and discussion mentions provides a holistic view of engagement, differentiating between passive interest and active conversation. Let’s break down what truly captivated the attention of the K-Community during this specific period. Decoding the **Top Crypto Keywords**: What K-Community is Searching For When it comes to pure curiosity and investigation, the search data reveals a compelling hierarchy of tokens. These are the assets that users actively sought more information about, indicating a high level of interest or potential anticipation. Here’s what the K-Community was searching for: Top 10 Searched Tokens Search Count XRP 61,982 SOL 18,097 ETH 16,929 BTC 13,720 SEI 12,658 ONDO 9,557 ARB 5,898 MOVE 5,707 BSV 4,127 STMX 4,089 The most striking observation from this list of **top crypto keywords** is the overwhelming dominance of XRP. With over 61,000 searches, it far outpaced every other token, signaling an intense level of interest. This could be attributed to ongoing legal developments surrounding Ripple, which often generate significant speculation and discussion among its dedicated investor base. Following XRP, Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) maintained strong positions, reflecting their status as major market players. The appearance of newer or niche tokens like SEI, ONDO (likely related to Real World Assets – RWA), and Arbitrum (ARB) suggests an active exploration of emerging narratives and Layer 2 solutions within the **Korean crypto trends** landscape. Beyond Searches: What **K-Community Crypto** Enthusiasts are Discussing? While searches indicate individual curiosity, mentions reflect collective conversation and shared sentiment. This list tells us which tokens are actively being discussed in forums, chat groups, and social media within the K-Community. Here’s what was being talked about: Top 10 Mentioned Tokens Mention Count BTC 1,263 ETH 665 XRP 349 SOL 277 TRUMP 144 SEI 111 MOODENG 75 STMX 75 ADA 50 APT 44 Interestingly, while XRP dominated searches, Bitcoin (BTC) took the top spot for mentions. This suggests that while people might be searching for specific information on altcoins, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of broader market discussions, serving as a benchmark and a constant topic for market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP also featured prominently, confirming their consistent relevance within the **K-Community crypto** discussions. The appearance of ‘TRUMP’ (likely a political meme coin) and ‘MOODENG’ highlights the speculative and often whimsical nature of some community discussions, showcasing how quickly new narratives can emerge and gain traction in the fast-paced crypto world. The inclusion of ADA (Cardano) and APT (Aptos) further diversifies the range of projects actively discussed by the community. A Closer Look: What Drives **XRP Price Analysis** in South Korea? XRP’s overwhelming lead in search volume in the K-Community is a phenomenon worth exploring. South Korea has historically shown a strong affinity for XRP, with a passionate and dedicated community of holders. This enthusiasm is often fueled by the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Every development, rumor, or court filing tends to spark a surge in interest, as investors hope for a favorable outcome that could significantly impact **XRP price analysis** and its future trajectory. The high search volume indicates that K-Community members are actively monitoring these developments, perhaps looking for entry or exit points, or simply staying informed about their preferred asset. This sustained interest suggests that XRP will continue to be a significant player in future **Korean crypto trends**. The Enduring Influence of **Bitcoin South Korea** While XRP captured the most searches, Bitcoin’s consistent top ranking in mentions reinforces its fundamental importance in the market. In **Bitcoin South Korea**, it serves not just as an investment asset but as the primary reference point for overall market health and direction. Discussions around Bitcoin often encompass broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory changes, and institutional adoption, making it a constant topic of conversation. South Korea has a sophisticated and regulated crypto market, and Bitcoin’s role as the digital gold is well-understood and frequently debated among investors, from seasoned traders to new entrants. Its stability, relative to altcoins, often makes it the focus of long-term investment strategies and general market sentiment analysis in the region. Actionable Insights and Market Dynamics Understanding these **Korean crypto trends** offers several actionable insights: Spotting Retail Interest: High search volumes, particularly for specific altcoins like XRP, can indicate strong retail interest and potential speculative activity. Identifying Core Narratives: The consistent discussion around BTC and ETH highlights their foundational role, while emerging tokens like SEI and ONDO point to evolving themes like Layer 2s and RWAs. Niche Market Influences: The presence of tokens like TRUMP and MOODENG underscores the impact of meme culture and community-driven narratives in specific regional markets. Regulatory Sensitivity: South Korea’s market is highly sensitive to regulatory news. Tokens frequently mentioned or searched might be those directly impacted by local policy discussions. However, investors should also be mindful of the challenges. The K-Community, like any retail-driven market, can be prone to volatility and hype cycles. While high interest can lead to price pumps, it also carries inherent risks. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider market fundamentals before making investment decisions. The weekly insights from Bitcoin World’s K-Community provide a fascinating glimpse into the dynamic and often unique preferences of South Korean crypto enthusiasts. From XRP’s unparalleled search dominance driven by legal sagas to Bitcoin’s steadfast position as the market’s primary discussion point, these trends offer valuable context for understanding global crypto sentiment.

2025-07-07T13:30:00,"Cold Calling Fraudsters Sentenced After £1.5M Crypto Scheme","The two men orchestrated a £1.5 million, or $2 million, crypto investment scam that defrauded at least 65 victims. Meanwhile, Brazil faced a major financial breach when a disgruntled employee of C&M Software sold login credentials for just $2,700. This then allowed hackers to steal nearly $140 million from central bank-linked accounts—some of which was laundered via crypto assets. In Sweden, the government is leveraging a new law that allows asset confiscation, including crypto, even without a formal conviction. The main goal of the law is to help curb organized crime, and has already led to the seizure of over $8.3 million in assets. Collectively, these cases prove that there is rising regulatory pressure and a growing emphasis on the role of crypto in financial crimes worldwide. UK FCA Cracks Down on Crypto Fraudsters Two men were sentenced to a combined 12 years in prison in the UK for operating a crypto scam that defrauded at least 65 victims out of more than £1.5 million ($2 million). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced on Friday that Raymondip Bedi received a prison sentence of five years and four months, while his co-conspirator, Patrick Mavanga, was handed six years and six months. The pair pleaded guilty in November of 2024 to a series of charges including conspiracy to defraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to breach UK financial regulations. According to the FCA, between February of 2017 and June of 2019, Bedi and Mavanga were part of a group that cold-called people and directed them to what appeared to be a legitimate investment website. These sites offered high returns on fake cryptocurrency consultancy services. The operation funneled money through several entities they controlled, including Astaria Group LLP, CCX Capital, and clones of authorized firms like Ian Buckley Financial Services and Capital Partners Group. The FCA described both men as “leading players” in the fraud, with Southwark Crown Court Judge Griffiths stating that they “conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.” Mavanga also pleaded guilty to possessing fake identification documents and was convicted of perverting the course of justice for deleting phone call recordings after Bedi’s arrest in March 2019. The FCA’s joint executive director of enforcement, Steve Smart, condemned their actions as a “callous scam” that “ruthlessly defrauded dozens of innocent victims.” A third defendant that was involved in the case is set to face retrial in September after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A fourth individual, Rowena Bedi, was acquitted of a money laundering charge. Millions Stolen in Brazil Central Bank Hack Cold calls are not the only crypto crimes plaguing the crypto community. C&M Software, the technology provider that connects Brazil’s Central Bank to various financial institutions, suffered a major security breach on Wednesday that led to the theft of approximately 800 million Brazilian reais, or $140 million. The funds were stolen from six institutions linked to the central bank after a C&M employee allegedly sold their login credentials to a hacker for just $2,700. This small but devastating lapse allowed the attacker to access reserve accounts and siphon off a massive amount of capital. The employee suspected of selling his login credentials (Source: Sao Paulo Globo ) Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported that the perpetrators laundered between $30 million and $40 million of the stolen funds by converting them into Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and USDT. These crypto assets were then funneled through Latin American exchanges and over-the-counter trading platforms, making the funds much harder to trace. This incident intensified concerns around the security vulnerabilities of centralized financial systems, particularly those that rely on single points of failure like user credentials and internal access controls. Telegram post by ZachXBT The breach also shed some light on the increasing threat landscape facing centralized software and infrastructure, especially in a digital era fueled by the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence. According to Chainalysis , hacks targeting centralized crypto exchanges surged in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, which attributed to cybercriminals focusing on platforms with large attack surfaces and valuable data troves. Eran Barak , CEO of Shielded Technologies and developer of the Midnight privacy-focused blockchain, shared some thoughts on the broader implications of such breaches. He explained that centralized systems offer massive return on investment for cybercriminals due to their concentration of sensitive information. In contrast, decentralized technologies like those using zero-knowledge proofs greatly reduce this appeal. By eliminating central data repositories, these systems force attackers to go after individual wallets, making attacks less rewarding and often not worth the effort. Overall, it is very clear that there is an urgent need for institutions to reconsider the risks of centralized architecture and adopt more resilient, decentralized alternatives. Sweden Targets Crypto Crime with New Asset Seizure Law Meanwhile, Sweden's Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer urged local enforcement agencies to intensify efforts aimed at seizing assets, including cryptocurrencies, under a recently implemented law that broadens the scope of confiscations. Speaking to financial publication Dagens industri, Strömmer said that authorities like the police, tax agency, and Swedish Enforcement Authority should focus more on cases likely to yield larger criminal proceeds like crypto holdings, real estate, and corporate assets. Since the law came into effect in November of 2024, the Swedish government reportedly seized over $8.3 million in criminal assets. Swedish Justice Minister Gunnar Strömmer The law was introduced to combat rising violent crime, and it allows authorities to confiscate luxury items and large sums of money from people who may not necessarily be the subjects of a formal investigation. The legal shift is a major expansion in Sweden's asset forfeiture strategy. According to the Swedish government, the law allows authorities to seize assets with suspected criminal origins even without proof that a crime has been committed, provided the individual cannot reasonably explain the source of the wealth. For example, someone holding large bank balances or luxury goods without a verifiable income to support such possessions may have them confiscated. While the government hasn’t specified how much of the seized assets were in cryptocurrency, the focus on digital assets suggests an increasing recognition of crypto’s role in illicit finance. Some reports indicate controversial enforcement actions, like one case flagged by The Economist in which a woman had $137,000 in cash and a Rolex watch seized while passing through Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport. Authorities reported seizing approximately $1 million in goods during the law’s first week. (Source: Barron’s ) Additionally, Swedish lawmaker Rickard Nordin recently advocated for Sweden to keep seized Bitcoin as part of a national reserve. In April, he sent a letter to the finance minister recommending a strategy similar to the United States’ “budget-neutral” approach, which involves accumulating seized Bitcoin without selling it.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9829/cold-calling-fraudsters-sentenced-after-1-5-m-crypto-scheme,"REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T13:28:44,"Metaplanet & Blockchain Group Add $15M in Bitcoin Reserves","Two publicly listed Asian firms, Blockchain Group and Metaplanet, made headlines this week by collectively acquiring more than 340 BTC—valued in excess of $15 million—yet again solidifying the trend toward publicly listed companies adopting Bitcoin as a mainstream treasury asset. Inside the Latest Bitcoin Purchases Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed investment company, settled the purchase of 2,205 BTC for $238.7 million, raising its holding to 15,555 BTC and making it the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Though the acquisition this week was a larger broader-strategy, the company's steady accumulation—paid for by issuing bonds and stocks—has doubled its shareholders in three months. Paris-listed Blockchain Group revealed purchasing 116 BTC for €10.7 million ($11.5M), bringing its reserves to 1,904 BTC. Blockchain Group's return on BTC for 2025 stands at more than 1,300%, capturing the stunning rise in the value of Bitcoin in terms of share number. Blockchain Group's recent convertible notes and bond issuances have played a pivotal role in funding these purchases, with custody by leading digital asset infrastructure companies. Accounting Treatment and Treasury Strategy Both companies keep Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset, listing it as a non-current asset on their balance sheets. Acquisitions are funded proportionately with equity or debt issue, with proceeds used directly for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet operates a dedicated company-designed ”BTC Yield” to measure value added per share, distinguishing the impact of treasury actions from dilution of share. Blockchain Group tracks a similar yield, emphasizing the accretive contribution of Bitcoin to shareholder value.

Public firms now hold over 725,000 BTC globally—a 135% increase year-on-year—led by Europe and Asia. Regulatory certainty, fears of inflation, and hedging against the risk of fiat are driving this action. Metaplanet and Blockchain Group's aggressive strategies are spurring other listed firms to follow suit, with numerous looking to make more BTC purchases in future quarters. Experts in the industry warn that although the trend is favorable to Bitcoin, smaller firms must manage risk extremely cautiously, especially if BTC prices grow unstable. Still, the momentum is in evidence that corporate FOMO for Bitcoin is only just getting underway. Scaling the Corporate Bitcoin Playbook As more and more corporations adopt Bitcoin in their treasuries, the competitive landscape for listed firms is altering rapidly. Institutional investors are looking more intensely at how digital assets can contribute to balance sheet health and optimize shareholder value. That is also driving fresh discussions around risk management, custody solutions, and regulation, as businesses seek to offset potential upside against good governance. The growing popularity in Europe and Asia could pave the way for broader acceptance worldwide, adding more pressure on North American businesses and companies globally to reconsider their own treasury behavior. With Bitcoin's finite supply and rising demand helping make corporate hoarding the next unavoidable trend for the next cycle of institutional investment, that trend is already gaining traction.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9830/metaplanet-and-blockchain-group-add-15-m-in-bitcoin-reserves,"BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

With 597,325 BTC now worth $64.4 billion at current prices, Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy has delivered a $22 billion paper profit on its $42.4 billion total investment.

The abrupt halt in Strategy’s relentless Bitcoin buying spree raises questions about what’s next for the company that now holds nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. While Michael Saylor’s quip about “some weeks you just need to HODL” played well on social media, the real story lies in the numbers. Some weeks you just need to HODL. pic.twitter.com/rVcFQkFoG0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 6, 2025 The $14 billion Q2 windfall underscores the success of Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy, but the pause suggests a moment of recalibration rather than retreat. The Form 8-K filing reveals more than just a week of inactivity. Strategy’s last Bitcoin purchase came on June 29, when it added 4,980 BTC for $531.9 million at an average price of $106,801 per coin. Since then, the company has held steady, even as Bitcoin’s price fluctuated between $105,000 and $110,000. Coming on the heels of a $14.05 billion unrealized gain, Strategy may be pausing to recalibrate its tax position or rebalance its funding sources, especially after exhausting much of its initial $42 billion capital raise plan. Notably, the firm incurred a $4.04 billion deferred tax expense tied to that fair value gain, and while unrealized gains don’t generate cash, tax liabilities do. Strategy’s acquisitions have been fueled by a mix of stock sales and debt offerings. In Q2 alone, the company raised $6.8 billion from at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock ($MSTR) and three perpetual preferred stock offerings: STRK, STRF, and STRD. These instruments, with dividend yields ranging from 8% to 10%, have allowed Strategy to tap into investor appetite for yield while avoiding outright dilution. But the funding model isn’t without risks. The company’s “42/42” plan, which is an expansion of its original $21 billion target, now aims to raise $84 billion by 2027 through equity and convertible notes. While this aggressive approach has worked so far, it leaves Strategy exposed to shifts in investor sentiment, particularly if Bitcoin’s price stagnates or declines.

2025-07-07T13:15:22,"Trump administration set to deliver first major crypto policy report","The White House is getting ready to release its first official crypto report after several months of internal work. According to a Monday release by Crypto in America, the report, ordered under a January executive directive from President Trump , is due by July 22. Expected to outline a broad strategy for digital asset regulation in the U.S., it will mark the administration’s first formal stance on how federal agencies should approach the crypto sector, covering both legislative and regulatory recommendations. The working group behind the report is co-led by U.S crypto czar David Sacks and Congressman Bo Hines, and includes senior officials from the Treasury Department, the SEC, the CFTC, and the Department of Commerce. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, the report added that the group has been meeting for months to coordinate a federal framework that aligns with Trump’s goal of cementing the United States as the world’s crypto capital. You might also like: Elon Musk’s new ‘America Party’ will embrace Bitcoin, claiming fiat to be ‘hopeless’ While contents of the report remain under wraps, early signals point to several key areas. One possible recommendation is the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, as proposed by Trump earlier this year. The group is also reportedly weighing how to ensure crypto firms have fair access to banking services, particularly with regard to the Federal Reserve’s role in granting access to payment infrastructures. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham reportedly described the ongoing deliberations as “productive and fruitful,” calling the upcoming report a potential roadmap for the administration’s crypto agenda. The expected July 22 release comes as Congress prepares to vote on a set of major crypto bills, including the GENIUS stablecoin Act and others covering market structure and central bank digital currencies. Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee is also set to hold a hearing on crypto industry regulation later this week, featuring testimony from industry figures such as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, and Paradigm General Partner Dan Robinson.

2025-07-07T13:14:47,"Crypto Price Analysis 7-7: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, LITECOIN: LTC, COSMOS: ATOM","The crypto market has started the new week on a bullish note, up nearly 2%at $3.38 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) , which was steady around $108,000 for most of the weekend, has bounced to reclaim $109,000. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $109,627 as buyers eye a move past $110,000. Analysts are optimistic of a new all-time high if BTC crosses key resistance levels. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) attempted to move past $2,600 early on Monday but was thwarted by upper-level resistance. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $2,577. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up 2.29%, trading around $2.27, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 3%. SOL spent most of the weekend below $150, but sentiment picked up late on Sunday, and the price moved to its current level of $152. Dogecoin (DOGE) has registered a substantial increase over the past 24 hours, up nearly 7%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 2.03%, trading around $0.587. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. DeFi, TradFi Convergence Could Occur Sooner Than Expected Nelli Zaltsman, head of blockchain payments innovation at JPMorgan Kinexys, believes the divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). Zaltsman made the comments speaking alongside Chainlink Labs co-founder Sergey Nazarov at the RWA Summit Cannes 2025. She added that JPMorgan is pushing to merge institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging on-chain assets, indicating a tipping point for blockchain adoption. “Our goal has always been to find the best way to work with the public blockchain, regulatory environment permitting.” JPMorgan has recently partnered with Chainlink to pilot a synchronized settlement technology, enabling the bank’s blockchain-based deposits to orchestrate transactions across multiple blockchains. Nazarov called the milestone an example of how banks can connect traditional capital with digital asset markets. Speaking about TradFi and DeFi, Zaltsman stated that artificial boundaries separating traditional and decentralized finance could disappear faster than expected thanks to improved infrastructure and cooperation. She pointed out that JPMorgan built its private blockchain a decade ago due to the lack of suitable options, adding that the situation was different today. “Thankfully, that’s not the case today. It took many years for there to be tools that are kind of underpriced and in support. I hope that this convergence happens sooner rather than later… we start looking at tech for what it is and how we can help different users and not… having these artificial boundaries.” Secret Service Seizes Nearly $400M In Crypto The US Secret Service has seized over $400 million in digital assets over the past decade, creating one of the largest crypto cold wallets. According to Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst, the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) tracked funds using open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and lots of patience. The Secret Service’s crypto stash, most of which is stored in a single cold wallet, is the result of several investigations into elaborate scams. Scammers have been targeting users by luring them into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms. Victims see initial profits before scammers disappear with all their deposits. Lam stated, “That’s how they do it. They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” $6.8 Billion Bitcoin Whale Not Selling Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham has said that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved last week does not seem to be heading for a sell-off. Arkham believes that the transfers may be the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which offers improved security and lower fees. “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin. Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) price action picked up late on Sunday, fueled by optimism around the upcoming “crypto week” in Washington. However, broader market sentiment remains cautious thanks to growing uncertainty about President Trump’s shifting stance on tariffs. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a low of $107,340 on Friday before recovering over the weekend, with the price rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and move to $109,229. However, BTC finds itself back in the red during the ongoing session, marginally down, trading around $108,834. BTC and the broader crypto market enter a crucial week with two major catalysts set to dictate price action. The most important catalyst for BTC and the broader market will be the upcoming July 9 tariff deadline. The US has reached agreements with several trading partners. However, President Trump could revert to the high tariffs announced back in April. The return of retaliatory tariffs will likely be a bearish development for BTC and the broader markets. BTC had plunged to a low of $74,000 after Trump’s Liberation Day speech before bouncing back when he announced the 90-day pause. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are also scheduled for release on Wednesday and could act as another decisive catalyst for BTC. The minutes are expected to provide more information about the previous meeting, where the Fed left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The minutes will also shed light on when the Fed could cut interest rates. A rate cut will be bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market. However, the odds of a rate cut have reduced due to strong nonfarm payrolls data. Meanwhile,. Bitcoin dominance of the overall crypto market continued to grow, crossing 65% to reach its highest levels since early 2021. BTC registered a sharp increase on Monday (June 23), rising over 4% to cross $105,000 and settle at $105,443.

BTC recovered over the weekend, registering marginal increases on Friday and Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339.

ETH recovered to register a marginal increase on Saturday and then rose over 2% on Sunday, crossing $2,500 and settling at $2,572.

However, one analyst has made an outlandish claim about SOL’s price action, stating, “Bitcoin and Solana Cup and Handle Pattern on the monthly chart. $BTC has broken out of the handle while $SOL is still waiting for the breakout. This pattern sets $BTC and $SOL to targets of $230,000 and $4,390, respectively.” SOL reached an intraday high of $148 on Wednesday (June 25) before losing momentum and settling at $143.

As of press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17, having rallied nearly 2% in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the token is up 3.45%. DOGE seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold For its July 31 price outlook, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok for insight into how the asset might trade in the coming three weeks. ChatGPT predicts DOGE’s price ChatGPT expects Dogecoin to experience a modest recovery from its local support zone if the broader cryptocurrency market remains stable. It noted that Dogecoin has recently attracted buyers around $0.16–$0.17, suggesting a solid floor in that range. However, the AI model cautioned that the meme-coin market has lacked a major hype catalyst, such as a major Elon Musk tweet, to spark a sharp rally. Assuming Bitcoin ( BTC ) holds its current range above $100,000, ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin will drift higher by month’s end, with a base-case target range of $0.17 to $0.185. Its most likely closing price is estimated at around $0.178. ChatGPT Dogecoin price prediction. Source: ChatGPT In downside scenarios, it sees a bearish case near $0.165 if the broader crypto market weakens, while a strong meme-driven surge could push Dogecoin as high as $0.195. Grok’s DOGE price prediction On the other hand, Grok offered a slightly more bullish outlook, taking into account ongoing spot ETF speculation and broader market sentiment. Grok projects Dogecoin trading between $0.18 and $0.22, with a likely price of around $0.20 by the end of the month. The AI tool noted that while social media hype can quickly move Dogecoin’s price, downside risks remain. A drop below $0.155 could see it fall further to $0.14, while a bullish breakout above $0.18 might even carry it toward $0.25. Although the models offered different projections, both emphasized that investors should remain cautious and be prepared for sharp swings in either direction.

2025-07-07T13:07:12,"Gold Crash Incoming? Bitcoin Will Win, Says Blockstream CEO Adam Back","The post Gold Crash Incoming? Bitcoin Will Win, Says Blockstream CEO Adam Back appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and one of the few people who directly communicated with Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is turning heads with his latest prediction: gold might crash, but Bitcoin is here to stay. His comments follow the resurfacing of reports about Psyche 16, an asteroid believed to contain a massive amount of gold worth around $700 quintillion. With Elon Musk also throwing support behind Bitcoin, the market is buzzing with renewed energy. Psyche 16: Could This Asteroid Sink Gold? Psyche 16 orbits between Mars and Jupiter and is rumored to hold enough gold to make every person on Earth a billionaire. But that kind of supply could flood the market and send gold prices crashing. Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, pointed this out on social media, emphasizing that Bitcoin doesn’t face this problem. Its supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflation or sudden market dilution. He also reminded the community that Bitcoin’s issuance is cut in half every four years, through a process called halving. The most recent halving happened on April 20, 2024, reducing mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. There is zero #Bitcoin on Psyche 16. https://t.co/VSiqDPX6ta — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 6, 2025 Adam Back replied to Mow’s post, explaining that if such a gold surplus were to hit the market, it would likely cause gold’s price to crash. In contrast, Bitcoin’s fixed and transparent supply model strengthens its position as a reliable store of value. Elon Musk: “Fiat is hopeless, so yes” to Bitcoin Tech billionaire Elon Musk recently energized the crypto community by endorsing Bitcoin. Responding to queries about his proposed “America Party,” aimed at curbing U.S. debt after Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” raised the debt ceiling by trillions, Musk accused fiat currency, stating, “Fiat is hopeless, so yes.” Bitcoin vs Gold: Which One Will Win? Gold has long been seen as a safe haven during uncertain times, but its value depends on controlled supply. With the threat of Psyche 16 flooding the market, that status could be challenged.

2025-07-07T13:07:12,"Satoshi-era Bitcoin whale shuffles $8.6 billion, is a dump incoming?","A Bitcoin wallet holding billions just came back online after more than a decade of silence, and it’s now shifting its assets across fresh addresses. Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham recently spotlighted the re-mergence of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale, which moved roughly $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin across eight different wallets after 14 years of dormancy. Each of the wallets had originally received BTC between April and May 2011, back when Bitcoin was still trading below $1. The funds were split into various portions and transferred into eight new addresses, where they currently remain untouched. A single entity moved $8.6 BILLION of BTC from 8 addresses in the past day. All of the Bitcoin was moved into the original wallets on either 2nd April or 4th May 2011 and has been held for over 14 years. Currently, the Bitcoin is sitting in 8 new addresses and has not been… pic.twitter.com/nm53tVRzLJ — Arkham (@arkham) July 4, 2025 The return of long-dormant whales from the early BTC days is often associated with efforts to realize profits, and such large volumes spark speculation that a whale may be preparing to offload a significant portion of its holdings. You might also like: Metaplanet inches closer to top 4 BTC corporate holders with fresh $238 million buy However, Arkham Intelligence added that the movement patterns suggest that the transfers were likely part of address upgrades, with the entity moving assets from outdated to newer wallet formats. This kind of shift is often done to improve security and reduce transaction fees, especially for wallets that have remained untouched for years. The total value of the BTC held across the wallets now sits slightly above $8.62 billion at current prices. Commenting on the whale’s resurgence and movement, 10x Research pointed to growing signs that Satoshi-era wallets like these are quietly offloading into rising Bitcoin ETF and institutional demand. According to their research, these early holders, often referred to as “OG whales,” have been gradually reducing their exposure since mid-2024. While the recently reactivated wallets haven’t sold,10x suggests they’re part of a broader shift beneath the surface that may help explain why Bitcoin’s upside has been capped, despite strong seasonal trends and ongoing accumulation by ETFs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,729, posting a modest 0.64% gain over the past 24 hours.

The company during the second quarter raised $6.8 billion in net proceeds through various capital markets activities, including preferred stock offerings and at-the-market sales of class A common stock, according to a Monday morning filing .

2025-07-07T13:06:09,"CoinShares: BTC loses favor, assets under management reach new all-time high on 12th week of inflows","Price gains over the past week boost total assets under management up to a new all-time high of $188 billion. CoinShares noted a shift in investor attitudes which favored Ethereum more than Bitcoin. In the past week, digital asset investment products saw $1.04 billion in global inflows, which marked the 12th consecutive week of inflows . According to CoinShares’ weekly report , the total net inflows have reached $16.3 billion, which aligns with the weekly average of 2025 so far. Not only that, price gains evident throughout the last week also pushed the AuM to a new all-time high of $188 billion from its previous $187.5 billion record. Although Bitcoin ( BTC ) still contributed the largest share of inflows, with $790 million last week, it marked a significant decline from the previous three weeks. Bitcoin held up an average of $1.5 billion in inflows within the past three weeks. However now it has dipped by nearly 50% this week alone. According to Head of CoinShares research, James Butterfill, noted that the slowdown in Bitcoin’s performance indicates that investors are growing cautious of betting their funds on the largest cryptocurrency by marketcap. “The moderation in inflows suggests that investors are becoming more cautious as Bitcoin approaches its all-time high price levels,” said Butterfill. Crypto flows recorded last week by asset type and provider | Source: CoinShares You might also like: CoinShares: Digital asset funds saw fourth week of inflows with $882m In fact, he noted that there has been a shift in investors’ attitude towards Ethereum ( ETH ), which recorded its 11th week of consecutive inflows with $226 million. According to the CoinShares report, weekly inflows from ETH throughout last week’s period amounted to 1.6% of the total assets under management. Butterfill observed that this rate was significantly higher than the 0.8% contributed by Bitcoin, which he believes is a sign that more investors are warming up towards Ethereum while keeping a safe distance from Bitcoin. From a regional standpoint, the United States still holds the largest share of inflows last week with $1 billion in inflows. Meanwhile, Germany and Switzerland also saw inflows with $38.5 million and $33.7 million respectively. On the other hand, Canada and Sweden experienced outflows amounting to $29.3 million and $19.2 million. Other regions such as Hong Kong and Brazil saw modest outflows of $3 million and $9.7 million.

The price action continues to respect the January all-time high of $109,590 as resistance, while drawing consistent support from the Short-Term Holder Realised Price (STH-RP) around $98,220–$99,474. Despite a recent rebound from sub-$100K levels, the broader trend has stalled, and the current market setup reflects a delicate equilibrium : profit-taking pressures have eased, but the lack of sustained momentum suggests buyers are also hesitant. Importantly, the market’s repeated defence of the rising STH-RP underscores continued structural strength. This key on-chain level has historically acted as a pivot for trend continuation, and its resilience in recent weeks indicates that bulls still hold control of the broader structure. The rising cost basis reflects ongoing accumulation, likely by institutional players via ETFs and corporate inflows offering a more durable foundation than in prior cycles. However, the lack of follow-through at the range highs, and recent drawdowns in aggregate open interest and whale holdings, highlight growing caution , particularly among experienced market participants. The US macroeconomic landscape is increasingly marked by signs of strain, with recent data underscoring a labour market losing momentum amid broader economic headwinds. June payrolls showed a headline gain of 147,000 jobs, yet nearly half stemmed from government hiring linked to seasonal factors, while private sector job creation weakened to its slowest pace in eight months. Sectors like manufacturing and wholesale trade shed jobs, and the overall drop in labour force participation masked the rise in long-term unemployment . Wage growth softened, the average workweek shrank, and aggregate hours worked fell, reflecting cautious employer sentiment and hinting at subdued consumer demand ahead. Manufacturing, too, remains under pressure; the ISM PMI stayed below the 50 mark for the fourth consecutive month, with businesses grappling with supply chain bottlenecks and trade uncertainty, further clouding prospects for a recovery. While job openings rose, largely in lower-wage leisure and hospitality roles, hiring lagged, exposing the fragile underpinnings of labor demand. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve appears set to hold rates steady in the near term, with markets eyeing potential easing toward year-end. In parallel, the cryptocurrency sector is capturing growing institutional interest, with developments that are in contrast with the tentative macroeconomic mood. The debut of the first Solana staking ETF, SSK, marked a milestone , drawing $33 million in volume on its first day and offering 5–7 percent staking yields, positioning Solana as a credible player in regulated capital markets. Similarly, corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies are accelerating: Spain’s Vanadi Coffee pivoted dramatically from its café business to amass Bitcoin holdings, aiming for €1 billion in BTC exposure, though there is concern about the company’s strategy given its overall financial fragility. Meanwhile, Tokyo-based Metaplanet has intensified its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, now holding a total of 15,555 BTC following its latest purchase of 2,205 BTC, with ambitions to reach 210,000 BTC by 2027 and solidify its role as Asia’s leading corporate Bitcoin holder. Together, these crypto moves highlight a growing divergence: while traditional markets wrestle with uncertainty, digital assets are increasingly seen as a vehicle for yield, treasury diversification, and inflation hedging — signalling shifting priorities in institutional capital deployment.

2025-07-07T13:00:58,"XLM Traders, Beware! Stellar’s Funding Rate Is Plummeting","Stellar Lumens hit a critical support level this week at $0.20, putting the token in a precarious spot. At that price, XLM sits 30% below its peak in May and 60% under its 2024 high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Meets Heartbreak In Drake’s Latest Track—Details Based on reports, bears have been piling on, pushing the funding rate into negative territory since early June. If that support gives way, traders warn XLM could slide toward $0.15, a drop of about 35%. Network Activity Up According to Artemis, operations on the Stellar network surged to 197 million in June. Stablecoin supply also reached a record $667 million. Over the past five months, the total value locked in real‑world asset tokenization grew to $487 million, helped by new offerings such as the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Market Fund. Those figures suggest healthy demand for on‑chain services and asset tokenization inside Stellar’s ecosystem. Funding Rates Down Funding rates in perpetual futures have been negative most days since May. That means more short positions than long ones, with short traders paying long traders to keep their bets in place. XLM’s funding rate hit its lowest point since June 30, pointing to rising bearish sentiment. When funding rates stay deep in the red, it often adds selling pressure as traders brace for steeper losses. The image above shows that XLM funding rates are down on most major exchanges, particularly for stablecoin-margined pairs, data from Coinalyze shows. On‑Chain Growth Clashes With Market Mood Nansen data shows the number of transactions rose by 11% over the last seven days to 182 million. Active addresses climbed 10% to 146,700 in the same span. Even so, price action has ignored these gains. XLM fell beneath its 50‑day and 100‑day Exponential Moving Averages, and momentum appears to favor sellers. Some market watchers suggest that deep negative funding could trigger a short squeeze, turning sentiment around if shorts rush to cover. Chart Patterns Warn Of Drop The daily chart reveals a descending triangle pattern, with $0.21 forming the lower trendline. That level also marked April’s lows when altcoins broadly sold off. XLM has slipped below the 60% Fibonacci Retracement zone, where many traders expect a bounce. A clean break under the triangle could unleash algorithm‑driven orders, sending price toward $0.15. Related Reading: Brazil’s Central Bank Hacked—$40M In Crypto Washed In Aftermath Meanwhile, Stellar’s fundamentals look solid, but technical signals remain bearish. Traders and holders should watch that $0.21 line. A strong rebound there could restore confidence in on‑chain strength. On the flip side, a slide through support may spark faster losses. Either way, XLM’s near‑term path hinges on that key level.

2025-07-07T12:56:46,"Bitcoin price outlook: $108k CME gap may trigger short-term pullback","Bitcoin remains stuck in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000. A CME futures gap at $108K adds pressure for a retrace as traders watch for a breakout backed by volume. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is consolidating between two major high time frame levels: $110,000 as range resistance and $100,169 as range support. A recent failed breakout to $111,960 followed by a quick re-entry into the range confirms a deviation, a classic hallmark of range-bound price action. Without strong volume, BTC is likely to continue oscillating within this zone. Traders are now focused on a CME futures gap at $108,300, which adds to the probability of a short-term retrace this week. Key technical points Range Resistance at $110K: Price rejected from this zone after a false breakout. Range Support at $100,169: Backed by a swing low at $98,200. CME Futures Gap at $108,300: Historically, 90% of CME gaps get filled, this one may attract price action soon. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin has been locked between $110,000 and $100,169 ever since the deviation above $111,960 failed to hold. This reaffirms the idea that BTC is currently in a rotational environment where failed breakouts and breakdowns are met with mean reversion. With no volume-backed conviction to push beyond the range, BTC continues to oscillate between these critical levels. You might also like: Russia’s biggest state-backed bank sees no use for CBDC, so why push ahead anyway? Currently, price is hovering around the range high near $110,000, which also aligns with the value area high on the volume profile. Unless BTC can close decisively above this level on strong volume, the structure favors continued consolidation or a move back toward range support. BTCCME (3D) Chart, Source: TradingView Of particular interest this week is the CME futures gap left open at $108,300 following Bitcoin’s weekend rally. Since CME Bitcoin futures don’t trade on weekends, the gap formed when markets reopened, a phenomenon with strong historical weight. Over 90% of these gaps get filled, often within days. This gives traders a technical target and increases the likelihood of a pullback in the near term, possibly toward that level. Unless the range is broken with decisive volume, this pattern of deviation and return is likely to persist. The $100,169 support zone remains crucial if price does begin to drop, especially if it follows a gap-fill move. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin is likely to continue range-bound this week unless a high-volume breakout occurs. A retrace toward $108,000 is probable due to the CME gap, with $100,000 remaining key support.
