2025-07-07T15:42:49,"No Monday Buy, but Strategy Reports $14B Bitcoin Gain","On a day when several major corporate buyers added to their Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries, Strategy stood pat on its signature Monday announcement. However, the business intelligence giant made up for the pause with some staggering financial news: it raked in more than $14 billion in unrealized gains in the second quarter of 2025. The $14 Billion Quarter According to Strategy’s latest Form 8-K , filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 7, the carrying value of the company’s Bitcoin stash had ballooned to $64.36 billion as of June 30, 2025. Importantly, the quarter ended with the number one cryptocurrency trading around $107,751 on Strategy’s principal market, the Coinbase exchange, resulting in a $14.05 billion fair value increase. However, this paper gain also triggered a $4.04 billion deferred tax expense. The Michael Saylor-helmed firm detailed the sheer scale of its Bitcoin acquisition during Q2 2025 in the filing, picking up 69,140 BTC for approximately $6.77 billion, at an average price of $97,906 per Bitcoin. The company funded this aggressive buying through complex capital markets activity, including net proceeds of $6.8 billion raised via “at-the-market” (ATM) equity offering programs as well as a registered offering of its STRD preferred stock that bagged $979.7 million net. At the same time, Strategy carries significant leverage, reporting about $8.24 billion in outstanding debt as of June 30, alongside $3.4 billion in preferred stock, which have pushed its annual interest and dividend obligations past $350 million. The company also struck a note of caution, stressing that future profitability hinges on Bitcoin’s price and acknowledging potential liquidity risks if forced to sell its BTC to meet obligations during market downturns. Imitators Ramp Up Buying Sprees While Strategy’s Q2 buying spree was monumental, with the last being a $531 million outlay on 4,980 BTC, pushing its total holding to 597,325 BTC, its absence from the market this Monday was notable. Per the 8-K, between June 30 and July 6, Strategy acquired “0” Bitcoin. This breaks its well-established pattern of consistent purchases, often announced on Mondays. The company confirmed its various ATM programs had ample remaining capacity, running into the billions, suggesting funding wasn’t the immediate constraint. Meanwhile, other firms that have taken up the Strategy playbook took advantage of the OG’s absence to increase their holdings. Tokyo-based Metaplanet snagged 2,205 BTC for around $238.7 million, bringing its stash to 15,555 BTC. The Smarter Web Company also announced a 226.42 BTC purchase as part of its “10-Year Plan,” while The Blockchain Group scooped up 116 BTC for nearly €11 million, taking its holdings to 1,904 BTC.

In the official statement, Strategy's current total assets remained at 597,325 BTC ($65 billion). No Bitcoin Purchases! Strategy halted purchases of Bitcoin (BTC) between June 30 and July 6, as disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

2025-07-07T15:30:57,"Iris Energy Surges: Record Revenue and Monumental AI Cloud Expansion in June","BitcoinWorld Iris Energy Surges: Record Revenue and Monumental AI Cloud Expansion in June The cryptocurrency world is constantly buzzing with innovation and growth, but every now and then, a company truly stands out. Iris Energy (NASDAQ: IREN), a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining sector, has just reported a June performance that’s nothing short of phenomenal. With record-breaking revenue and significant strides in its ambitious AI Cloud expansion , IREN is not just participating in the digital revolution—it’s leading the charge. This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about strategic vision and execution in a rapidly evolving landscape, highlighting the immense potential within the digital asset economy. Iris Energy’s Record-Breaking June Performance Iris Energy has truly outdone itself in June, marking a period of unprecedented financial success. The company announced a staggering monthly revenue of $68 million , a figure that sets a new benchmark for their operations. This impressive top-line growth was accompanied by a robust hardware profit of $51 million , showcasing efficient management and strong operational margins. While electricity costs amounted to $16 million , the net profitability underscores IREN’s ability to navigate the volatile energy market effectively while scaling its operations. These financial milestones are a testament to Iris Energy’s operational excellence and strategic foresight, solidifying its position as a powerhouse in the digital asset space. Let’s break down the key financial highlights: Total Revenue: $68 million (Record high) Hardware Profit: $51 million Electricity Costs: $16 million This remarkable performance indicates not just a strong market but also Iris Energy’s enhanced capacity and optimized mining strategies paying dividends. It’s a clear signal of their growing influence and profitability within the competitive Bitcoin mining industry. Powering Up: The Ascent of a Bitcoin Mining Company What does it take for a leading Bitcoin mining company to achieve such scale? For Iris Energy, it’s a combination of aggressive expansion and strategic infrastructure development. In June, IREN successfully hit its ambitious target of 50 EH/s (Exahashes per second) hashrate . This isn’t just a number; it represents a colossal amount of computational power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin network and validating transactions. To support this immense hashrate, the company boasts a substantial data center capacity of 810 MW (Megawatts) . This significant infrastructure allows IREN to deploy and operate a vast fleet of mining equipment, ensuring high efficiency and competitive advantage. Achieving 50 EH/s places Iris Energy among the elite in the global Bitcoin mining landscape. It signifies not only their commitment to scaling but also their operational prowess in managing large-scale energy consumption and hardware deployment. This expansion directly translates into increased potential for Bitcoin block rewards and transaction fees, fueling their revenue growth and strengthening their market position. As a premier Bitcoin mining company , IREN’s commitment to expanding its operational footprint is evident. Beyond Mining: IREN’s Bold AI Cloud Expansion While its roots are firmly in Bitcoin mining, Iris Energy is strategically diversifying its portfolio by making significant inroads into the burgeoning AI market. The company’s AI Cloud expansion is a prime example of this forward-thinking approach. In June, IREN substantially boosted its AI capabilities by adding approximately 2,400 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs . This addition brings their total count of powerful NVIDIA GPUs to an impressive 4,300 . NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs are at the forefront of AI computing, designed to handle the most demanding machine learning and deep learning workloads. Why is this significant? The demand for high-performance computing power for AI applications is skyrocketing across industries, from scientific research to enterprise solutions. By leveraging its existing data center infrastructure and power capacity, Iris Energy is uniquely positioned to offer scalable and efficient AI computing services. This strategic pivot allows them to tap into a new, high-growth revenue stream, reducing their sole reliance on Bitcoin price fluctuations and diversifying their business model. This move transforms IREN from purely a mining entity into a comprehensive digital infrastructure provider, making their AI Cloud expansion a critical strategic move. Key aspects of IREN’s AI Cloud strategy: Strategic Diversification: Reduces reliance on Bitcoin mining alone. High-Demand Market: Taps into the rapidly growing AI computing sector. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure: Utilizes current data center and power capabilities. Cutting-Edge Hardware: Deployment of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for superior performance. Reaching New Heights: Understanding Crypto Hashrate Milestones The concept of crypto hashrate is fundamental to understanding the operational scale of companies like Iris Energy. Hashrate represents the total combined computational power being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin. A higher hashrate indicates greater security for the network and, for miners, a higher probability of solving blocks and earning rewards. Iris Energy’s achievement of 50 EH/s is a significant milestone that places them among the largest contributors to Bitcoin’s network security, showcasing their impressive crypto hashrate capabilities. This substantial increase in hashrate is a direct result of their ongoing deployment of high-efficiency mining rigs and the expansion of their data center facilities. It underscores a strategic commitment to growth and market dominance in the Bitcoin mining sector. Furthermore, a higher hashrate often translates into improved operational efficiency and lower per-unit mining costs over time, enhancing the company’s profitability and competitive edge. How does a higher hashrate benefit a mining company? Increased Block Rewards: A larger share of the network hashrate means a higher chance of solving a block and earning Bitcoin rewards. Enhanced Network Security: Contributing more hashrate helps secure the Bitcoin network against attacks. Operational Scale: Indicates significant investment and capability in large-scale infrastructure. Competitive Advantage: Positions the company as a leader in the mining industry. Driving Growth: The Significance of Digital Asset Revenue Beyond the operational achievements, the financial backbone of Iris Energy’s success lies in its impressive digital asset revenue . The record $68 million monthly revenue isn’t just a number; it reflects the culmination of efficient mining operations, strategic capital deployment, and perhaps the early fruits of their AI cloud initiatives. This revenue stream is critical for funding ongoing expansion, technological upgrades, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet in a capital-intensive industry. Furthermore, Iris Energy’s strategic financial moves in June also contributed to its robust position. The company’s $550 million convertible notes offering was oversubscribed , a clear indicator of strong investor confidence in their growth trajectory and diversified business model. An oversubscribed offering suggests that demand from investors exceeded the available notes, allowing the company to secure capital on favorable terms. This capital infusion is crucial for further expanding both their Bitcoin mining operations and accelerating their AI Cloud development. Another pivotal development was Iris Energy’s completion of its transition to U.S. domestic issuer status . This move simplifies regulatory compliance, potentially lowers administrative costs, and broadens the company’s access to U.S. capital markets. It also enhances transparency and appeal to a wider range of institutional investors, further advancing their initiatives in AI customer acquisition and broader financing efforts, all contributing to their robust digital asset revenue streams. Iris Energy’s June report paints a vivid picture of a company firing on all cylinders. From achieving record-breaking revenue and hardware profit to hitting its ambitious 50 EH/s crypto hashrate target, IREN is solidifying its dominance as a leading Bitcoin mining company . More impressively, its bold and rapid AI Cloud expansion with a massive deployment of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs signals a strategic diversification that positions the company for long-term growth beyond traditional crypto mining. Coupled with an oversubscribed convertible notes offering and a smooth transition to U.S. domestic issuer status, Iris Energy is demonstrating not just operational prowess but also astute financial management and strategic foresight. As the digital economy continues to evolve, IREN’s integrated approach to digital infrastructure, encompassing both Bitcoin mining and AI computing, makes it a compelling entity to watch in the coming years. Their recent achievements underscore a powerful trajectory towards becoming a leading provider of high-performance computing solutions and generating significant digital asset revenue .

2025-07-07T15:17:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Starts Crucial Week In The Red, Slips Below $109,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in bearish territory despite early gains. The flagship cryptocurrency started positively, rising to an intraday high of $109,726 before losing momentum and dropping to its current level. BTC is down 0.48%, trading around $108,698. Analysts believe BTC is on the verge of a big move, with its Bollinger Bands reaching a critical point that could suggest a breakout is imminent. MetaPlanet Purchases 2,205 BTC To Take Total Holdings Past 15,000 Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has completed the acquisition of an additional 2,205 BTC , taking its total holdings to 15,555 BTC . The firm made its latest purchase at an average price of 15.64 million yen per Bitcoin for a total price of 34.49 billion yen ($213 million). The purchase pushes Metaplanet’s aggregate Bitcoin investment to 225.82 billion yen ($1.38 billion), with a blended average purchase price of 14.52 million yen per BTC . The company reported a BTC yield of 95.6% for the quarter ending June 30 and reported a 309% yield during the previous quarter. BTC Yield reflects the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share. Metaplanet’s latest purchase is its largest single-day purchase since it began its Bitcoin strategy. The firm redeemed 6 billion yen worth of bonds issued last June, using the proceeds to complete its latest acquisition. Metaplanet has consistently used this approach, raising capital and converting it into Bitcoin . Bitcoin Whale Not Selling After Record Transfer Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham has said that the $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) moved last week does not seem to be heading for a sell-off. Arkham believes that the transfers may be the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which offers improved security and lower fees. “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin. Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses.” Bitcoin (BTC) Heads Into Crucial Week Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a range for most of last week, despite drops to $105,400 and a brief move past $110,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency heads into a crucial week with President Trump’s tariff deadline looming, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. President Trump’s tariff deadline is likely the most important catalyst for Bitcoin and the broader market. The 90-day pause expires on July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with several countries, including China and the UK. However, Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea may revert to the tariffs announced in April. A return of retaliatory tariffs could be bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC had plunged to a low of $74,000 after Trump’s Liberation Day speech before bouncing back when he announced the 90-day pause. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes are also scheduled for release on Wednesday and could act as another decisive catalyst for BTC . The minutes are expected to provide more information about the previous meeting, where the Fed left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The minutes will also shed light on when the Fed could cut interest rates. A rate cut will be bullish for BTC and the broader crypto market. However, the odds of a rate cut have reduced due to strong nonfarm payrolls data. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp decline during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum despite starting the week in positive territory, rising to an intraday high of $109,726 before quickly losing momentum. BTC fell to a low of $107,340 on Friday but recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising nearly 1% on Sunday and settling at $109,229. However, selling pressure has returned during the ongoing session, with the price at $108,332. Despite the decline, analysts believe BTC is positioned for a recovery, based on the position of the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands are used to assess momentum and volatility within a certain range. One analyst pointed out that the bands were at their tightest point in nearly a year, suggesting that a big push upwards could be imminent. “Bitcoin Bollinger Bands are tighter than they’ve been in over a year. BIG PUMP INCOMING!” BTC surged 75% between February and March 2024 after breaking above the upper Bollinger Band boundary. Other analysts were quick to spot the emerging pattern, with analyst Cantonese Cat stating, “Bollinger band is tighter than it’s been for over a year. Bigger move coming.” Analysts believe the bull trend is intact despite multiple rejections around $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has registered consistent institutional demand through ETF inflows and treasury companies. Additionally, a cup-and-handle pattern in higher timeframes indicates a potential breakout towards $200,000. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 0.14% on Friday and 0.20% on Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 to $105,742. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,845, but not before reaching an intraday high of $109,792. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650. The flagship cryptocurrency lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097. Price action turned positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday, reclaiming $109,000 and settling at $109,229. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 1% at $108,397. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-07T15:09:17,"SEC Sets July Deadline for Solana ETF Refilings, Clearing Path for Pre-October Approval","The road to a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be much shorter than expected. The Securities and Exchange Commission asked prospective issuers to respond to comments and re-file amended S-1 documents before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. Technically, the SEC has until October 10 to approve or deny such a fund, but it seems want to accelerate the process and approve one or more of the funds way ahead of that deadline, one of the individuals said. The reason could be the recent approval of the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF (SSK) which the Commission had no choice but to green-light as it falls under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore received automatic approval unless stopped by the SEC. SSK started trading last week , becoming the first Solana staking fund on the market, giving it a first-mover advantage over the potential remaining Solana ETFs. This is something that the SEC has previously attempted to prevent, which is why it approved several spot ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) ETFs at the same time. “I think that the SEC has some pressure to approve these quicker than waiting all the way to October, especially with that Rex Shares product that got approved last week,” one person familiar with the matter said. In June, the Commission asked issuers to amend their S-1 filings for their requested Solana ETFs and to include language for in-kind redemption and creations as well as staking, which was the first official communication from the SEC regarding those potential products. The spot Solana ETFs would be the third kind of spot crypto funds on the U.S. market after the approval of the spot ether and bitcoin funds. Other outstanding applications include funds tracking the price of XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC), among others.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/07/sec-sets-july-deadline-for-solana-etf-refilings-clearing-path-for-pre-october-approval,"SOL|REGULATION|BTC|DOGE|LTC","Policy|Solana|Top Stories|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T15:00:30,"Digital Asset Working Group Unveils Pivotal Crypto Policy Report by July 22","BitcoinWorld Digital Asset Working Group Unveils Pivotal Crypto Policy Report by July 22 The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation! A significant moment is on the horizon for the digital asset space, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Working Group is poised to release its inaugural major crypto policy report by July 22. This isn’t just another government document; it’s a collaborative masterpiece from key agencies like the Treasury, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Its release is expected to bring much-needed clarity and direction to the rapidly evolving crypto sector. For anyone invested in, or simply curious about, the future of digital currencies, this report could be a game-changer. Understanding the Digital Asset Working Group and Its Mandate So, what exactly is the Digital Asset Working Group , and why is its work so important? Formed under the previous administration, this group brings together various federal agencies to tackle the complex challenges and opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Their primary mandate is to foster innovation while simultaneously protecting consumers and ensuring financial stability within the digital asset ecosystem. This involves: Identifying Gaps: Pinpointing areas where existing regulations fall short or create undue burdens for crypto businesses. Proposing Solutions: Developing legislative and regulatory frameworks that can adapt to new technologies. Ensuring Competitiveness: Helping the U.S. maintain its leadership in financial innovation. The upcoming report isn’t just theoretical; it’s expected to outline concrete proposals that could shape how crypto businesses operate, how investors trade, and how digital assets are integrated into the broader financial system. It’s a testament to the growing recognition of crypto’s impact on the global economy. What to Expect from the Crucial Crypto Policy Report ? While the full details of the upcoming Crypto Policy Report remain under wraps, speculation is rife about its potential contents. This report is a culmination of extensive research and discussions among some of the most influential financial regulators in the U.S. Here are some of the key areas it’s expected to touch upon: Regulatory Clarity: Providing clear guidelines on which digital assets fall under the purview of the SEC (as securities) or the CFTC (as commodities), and how existing laws apply. Consumer Protection: Recommendations for safeguarding investors from fraud, manipulation, and market volatility. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Strengthening frameworks to prevent illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies. Innovation & Competitiveness: Balancing regulatory oversight with the need to foster technological advancement and maintain the U.S.’s competitive edge in the global digital economy. The report’s findings will be pivotal for both established crypto firms and burgeoning startups, potentially setting a precedent for how other nations approach their own crypto regulatory frameworks. The Intriguing Possibility of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve One of the most intriguing rumors circulating around the report’s content, as highlighted by Crypto in America, is the potential recommendation for creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This concept, while still speculative, could have profound implications. Imagine the U.S. government holding a significant amount of Bitcoin as a national asset, similar to how countries hold gold or foreign currencies. The potential benefits and challenges are numerous: Potential Benefits: Economic Stability: Diversifying national reserves beyond traditional assets, potentially hedging against inflation or currency devaluation. Geopolitical Influence: Enhancing the U.S.’s position in the global digital economy and potentially influencing international crypto standards. Market Confidence: A government endorsement of Bitcoin could significantly boost institutional and retail confidence in the asset. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price volatility could pose risks to national reserves. Acquisition & Storage: The logistics of acquiring and securely storing a large volume of Bitcoin would be complex. Public Perception: Gaining public and political consensus for such a novel approach could be difficult. While a strategic Bitcoin reserve remains a speculative point, its inclusion in discussions underscores the growing seriousness with which digital assets are being considered at the highest levels of government. Ensuring Fair Crypto Banking Access : A Game Changer? Another critical area the report is expected to address is ensuring crypto firms have fair access to banking services from the Federal Reserve. This has been a persistent pain point for the industry. Many traditional banks remain hesitant to serve crypto businesses due to perceived risks, regulatory uncertainty, and compliance burdens. This often forces legitimate crypto companies to operate without adequate banking infrastructure, hindering their growth and stability. Why is this important? Legitimacy & Growth: Access to banking services legitimizes crypto businesses, enabling them to process transactions, manage payrolls, and secure loans like any other industry. Reduced Risk: Pushing crypto firms to the fringes of the financial system can ironically increase risks, as they may resort to less regulated or transparent methods. Level Playing Field: Fair access ensures that innovative crypto startups can compete on an equal footing with traditional financial institutions. Recommendations from the report could include clear guidelines for banks on how to onboard and serve crypto clients, or even direct pathways for certain crypto entities to access Federal Reserve master accounts. Such a move would be a monumental step towards integrating the crypto sector into mainstream finance, fostering a more robust and secure ecosystem for all participants. Navigating the Future of US Crypto Regulation The release of this report marks a significant milestone in the journey towards comprehensive US Crypto Regulation . It signifies a proactive approach from the government to not only understand but also shape the future of digital assets. For investors, businesses, and developers in the crypto space, this means: Increased Clarity: Less ambiguity around legal and operational requirements, potentially reducing compliance costs and fostering innovation. Enhanced Stability: A more regulated environment could lead to greater market stability and reduced instances of fraud, attracting more institutional capital. Global Leadership: A clear and effective regulatory framework could solidify the U.S.’s position as a leader in digital finance. However, navigating these new regulations will require diligence. Businesses will need to adapt their operations, and investors will need to stay informed about changes that could impact their portfolios. The report is likely to be a starting point, with further legislative actions and regulatory updates following in its wake. In conclusion, the impending release of the Digital Asset Working Group’s first Crypto Policy Report by July 22 is a moment of profound significance for the entire digital asset landscape. From potential recommendations for a strategic Bitcoin reserve to ensuring fair crypto banking access , this document is set to lay down the foundational elements for future US Crypto Regulation . It promises to bring much-needed clarity, foster innovation, and integrate the vibrant world of digital assets more deeply into the traditional financial system. As the crypto industry matures, such concerted efforts from policymakers are not just welcome, but absolutely essential for sustainable growth and widespread adoption.

The collaboration enables users to deposit their BTC on Sui and mint tBTC, potentially adding over $500 million worth of bitcoin liquidity to the Sui network. It means users can deploy their BTC in the Sui-based DeFi to generate additional yield while seamlessly using tBTC across the ecosystem. ""tBTC is expected to bring a massive amount of Bitcoin liquidity to Sui, creating a bridge that truly matters—not just for institutions but for everyday people who love Bitcoin,” Adeniyi Abiodun, co-founder and chief product officer at Mysten Labs, the original contributors to Sui, said in the announcement shared exclusively with CoinDesk. “This new integration opens another door to accessible, sovereign BTCfi participation,” Abiodun added. BTCFi represents a full spectrum of decentralized finance applications built to work with bitcoin, aiming to enhance the cryptocurrency's appeal beyond the store-of-value narrative. Nearly 600 BTC, worth over $65 million, have been bridged to the Sui ecosystem since February, and BTC-backed assets account for more than 10% of the total value locked (TVL) in the SUI ecosystem. At press time, cryptocurrencies worth $1.83 billion were locked in the Sui-based DeFi, according to data source DeFiLlama. ""Bitcoin was designed to be used, not locked away,” Callan Sarre, co-founder at Threshold Labs, said. “With tBTC coming on Sui, we’re combining the security of threshold cryptography with a high-throughput network to create a new standard for Bitcoin utility.” Home to tBTC, Threshold Network is a decentralized protocol that combines cryptography and blockchain infrastructure to provide secure and trust-minimized access to bitcoin DeFi.

2025-07-07T14:58:02,"PEPE coin fails to hold above 100‑day SMA despite market resurgence","The recent attempt by PEPE coin to reclaim higher ground has faltered, as the meme coin fails to sustain momentum above its 100-day simple moving average (SMA), despite broader optimism in the crypto market. Notably, PEPE’s inability to maintain its push above key resistance comes despite Bitcoin (BTC) recording a fresh all-time high weekly close above $109,000, lifting overall market sentiment and fuelling rallies across select meme coins. Short-lived breakout above key resistance On Monday, PEPE briefly surged past its 100-day SMA, which stood near the $0.00001009 level, sparking initial hopes of a trend reversal. Although the price action hinted at a bullish continuation, sellers quickly overwhelmed the move, sending PEPE back down to hover around $0.00000992 just hours later. This rejection marked the continuation of a broader sideways movement, as PEPE remained trapped between the $0.00000990 support floor and resistance near $0.00001020. The price structure over the past two weeks has taken the shape of a horizontal channel, with both lower and upper boundaries repeatedly tested but not convincingly breached. Adding to the bearish pressure, whale wallets have continued distributing significant volumes of PEPE to exchanges, further clouding the near-term outlook. According to on-chain data , one notable transaction saw 500 billion PEPE tokens worth approximately $3.85 million transferred to Binance, hinting at potential liquidation or strategic unloading by large holders. Technical analysis points to indecision Despite PEPE’s bounce from recent lows, technical indicators have offered mixed signals, reflecting the coin’s fragile position in a volatile market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 44.3, suggesting a neutral momentum as the coin straddled the line between oversold and recovery zones. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed early signs of a bullish crossover, with the signal and MACD lines rising toward the zero mark, yet still operating in negative territory. A rising MACD histogram added to short-term optimism, implying that buying pressure may be slowly rebuilding beneath the surface. Nevertheless, these signals are not yet conclusive, and traders remain cautious as PEPE struggles to close decisively above key technical levels. Anticipated triangle breakout now faces tough resistance Over the weekend, the PEPE coin staged a recovery and broke out of a descending triangle pattern that had formed from the May 23 and June 10 highs, with base support at $0.00000900. The pattern breakout initially sparked optimism among bulls, especially after PEPE gained over 3.4% on Sunday and continued inching higher into Monday. However, the rally faced immediate resistance near $0.00001037, a level that has repeatedly capped upside attempts since mid-June. A confirmed close above this point could open the door for a move toward $0.00001196, the May 17 low, and potentially $0.00001362, the June high. But without strong volume support and clearer momentum signals, PEPE’s price remains vulnerable to retracements and consolidation. The PEPE coin derivatives market is flashing tentative optimism The derivatives market has reflected a modest increase in optimism, as Open Interest (OI) climbed by 2.25% to $533.63 million in the past 24 hours. Moreover, the OI-weighted funding rate flipped from negative to positive, moving from -0.0052% on Sunday to +0.0052% by Monday, indicating a growing willingness among traders to pay premiums for long positions. PEPE OI-Weighted Funding Rate | Source: Coinglass This shift suggests that speculative sentiment may be turning more bullish, though the sustainability of that enthusiasm remains uncertain. Traders are now watching for a decisive close above $0.00001037, which could confirm PEPE’s readiness for an extended breakout rally. Until then, downside risks remain prominent, especially if the coin fails to hold above the $0.00000990 zone and re-tests the $0.00000900 support base.

2025-07-07T14:50:18,"Bitcoin Options: Decoding the Remarkable Volatility Drop Amidst Peak BTC Price Action","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options: Decoding the Remarkable Volatility Drop Amidst Peak BTC Price Action Are you keeping a close eye on the pulse of the crypto market ? If so, you’ve likely noticed Bitcoin’s incredible resilience, hovering near its all-time highs. But beneath this exciting surface, something rather intriguing is happening in the derivatives space, particularly within the Bitcoin options market. It’s a paradox that has many analysts scratching their heads: a period of surprising calm. Understanding the Unexpected Calm: What is Implied Volatility? In a recent update, the on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode revealed a fascinating trend. Despite Bitcoin’s robust BTC price action , the options market is experiencing what can only be described as a summer slowdown. Implied volatility across most expirations, ranging from one week to six months, has reached its lowest levels since mid-2023. But what exactly is implied volatility, and why does this matter? Implied Volatility (IV): This is a forward-looking metric that represents the market’s expectation of how much an asset’s price will fluctuate over a specific period. It’s derived from the price of an option contract. High IV: Suggests the market anticipates large price swings (up or down) in the near future. Low IV: Indicates the market expects relatively stable or less dramatic price movements. Relevance: For options traders, IV is crucial because it directly impacts option premiums. Higher IV means more expensive options, while lower IV means cheaper options. The fact that implied volatility is at such lows, even with Bitcoin’s price near its peak, suggests a collective market sentiment of stability, or perhaps, a lack of immediate catalysts for significant price shifts. This insight from Glassnode analysis provides a unique lens through which to view the current market dynamics. Why the Silence? Factors Behind the Low Implied Volatility The current low implied volatility in the Bitcoin options market isn’t a random occurrence; several factors could be contributing to this unexpected calm. Understanding these can help both seasoned traders and new investors navigate the complexities of the crypto market . Here are some potential reasons: Market Maturity: As the Bitcoin market matures, with increased institutional participation and regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs, it may be exhibiting more predictable price behavior. Large institutions often employ sophisticated hedging strategies that can dampen volatility. Post-Halving Lull: Historically, periods following a Bitcoin halving event can sometimes see a consolidation phase before the next major bull run. Traders might be waiting for clearer signals, leading to less aggressive positioning in options. Summer Slowdown: Traditional financial markets often experience reduced trading activity during summer months, as many participants take holidays. This seasonal effect could be extending to the crypto space, leading to lower trading volumes and, consequently, lower volatility. Lack of Immediate Catalysts: While Bitcoin is near all-time highs, there might be a temporary absence of major, market-moving news or events (e.g., significant regulatory announcements, major institutional adoption news) that would typically spur large price swings. Consolidation Phase: The market might be in a period of price discovery and consolidation after a strong rally. During such times, price tends to move sideways, which naturally leads to lower implied volatility. Navigating the Calm: Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors For those involved in the crypto market , understanding this low implied volatility environment in Bitcoin options is crucial. It presents both opportunities and challenges, especially concerning future BTC price action . For Options Buyers: Cheaper Premiums: Low IV means options contracts are relatively cheaper. This could be an opportune time to buy calls or puts if you anticipate a significant price move in either direction. Long Straddles/Strangles: If you expect a breakout but are unsure of the direction, buying both a call and a put (a straddle or strangle) can be more cost-effective when IV is low. You profit if the price moves significantly in either direction. For Options Sellers: Reduced Premium Income: Selling options (e.g., covered calls, naked puts) becomes less attractive as the premiums collected are smaller. Increased Risk: While premiums are low, a sudden spike in volatility could lead to significant losses if you are selling options without adequate hedging. For Spot Holders: Potential for Accumulation: A period of low volatility can be seen as a healthy consolidation phase, allowing long-term holders to accumulate Bitcoin at relatively stable prices before a potential next leg up in BTC price action . Watch for Breakouts: The longer the period of low volatility, the more significant the eventual breakout tends to be. This calm could be the precursor to a powerful move. The key takeaway from this Glassnode analysis is that the current environment requires a nuanced approach. It’s not a time for complacency but rather for strategic positioning and careful risk management. Diving Deeper into Glassnode’s Insights on BTC Price Action The detailed Glassnode analysis provides a robust foundation for understanding the current state of the Bitcoin options market. Their observations are particularly insightful because they leverage on-chain data, offering a unique perspective beyond just price charts. Glassnode highlighted that this period of low implied volatility is not just across a few specific contracts but is broad-based, affecting options from one week to six months out. This breadth suggests a systemic calm rather than an isolated anomaly. The fact that it’s the lowest since mid-2023 indicates a return to a pre-bull market sentiment in terms of options pricing, despite the actual BTC price action being significantly higher. This divergence between high spot prices and low options volatility can signal several things: Market Efficiency: The market may be becoming more efficient at pricing in known information, leaving fewer opportunities for extreme short-term volatility. Institutional Hedging: Large institutional players might be using options more for hedging existing spot positions rather than for speculative bets on massive price swings, which inherently reduces the overall implied volatility. Trader Fatigue: After a period of intense price movements, some traders might be taking a step back, leading to lower liquidity and a reduction in aggressive directional bets. The consistent message from the Glassnode analysis is that the market is currently in a state of equilibrium, a quiet period that often precedes significant movements. Traders should be prepared for potential shifts, even if the current data suggests tranquility. What Lies Ahead? The Future of Volatility in the Crypto Market While the current low implied volatility in Bitcoin options suggests a period of calm, the crypto market is known for its sudden shifts. What factors could disrupt this tranquility and reignite volatility in BTC price action ? Macroeconomic Shifts: Unexpected changes in global interest rates, inflation data, or geopolitical events could send ripples through all financial markets, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: Major regulatory news, positive or negative, could significantly impact market sentiment and volatility. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs or setbacks in blockchain technology, or even major network upgrades for Bitcoin, could influence price expectations. Whale Activity: Large movements by significant holders (whales) can always trigger substantial price changes and subsequent volatility. Market Catalysts: The introduction of new financial products, major institutional adoption announcements, or even a sudden influx of retail interest could shift the market dynamics dramatically. The current environment, as highlighted by the Glassnode analysis , might be the calm before a storm, or simply a sign of a maturing market. Either way, staying informed and prepared is paramount. Summary: A Paradoxical Calm in Bitcoin’s Options Landscape The Bitcoin options market is currently presenting a fascinating paradox: record-low implied volatility despite Bitcoin’s proximity to all-time highs. This unexpected calm, as revealed by Glassnode analysis , suggests a period of consolidation and reduced immediate expectations for dramatic BTC price action . Whether this is a sign of market maturity, a seasonal slowdown, or the quiet before a significant move, it offers unique opportunities for informed participants in the crypto market . Traders and investors should leverage this period to refine their strategies, understanding that while volatility is currently subdued, the dynamic nature of crypto means preparation is always key.

2025-07-07T14:46:01,"Did Trump just signal Bitcoin to $120,000 in coming weeks?","Bitcoin ( BTC ) bulls may have found an ally in President Donald Trump’s move to delay controversial trade tariffs. To this end, cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pillows has noted that Bitcoin’s recent price action is tracking a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, and Trump’s tariff delay could catalyze BTC to surge toward $120,000 in the coming weeks. In a July 7 X post , Pillows noted that Bitcoin’s BTC/M2 ratio is nearing the end of its accumulation phase. Notably, M2 is a broad measure of the money supply, and as it expands, liquidity increases, providing investors with more capital to deploy into assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows By comparing Bitcoin’s price to M2, analysts assess its value in relation to the available liquidity. A strong BTC/M2 ratio can indicate that Bitcoin is undervalued compared to the money circulating in the system. Pillows’ analysis shows the BTC/M2 chart completing a Wyckoff accumulation phase, where institutional buyers quietly absorb supply before driving prices higher. Over the weekend, Bitcoin saw a sharp pullback but quickly rebounded, matching the Wyckoff pattern’s typical “spring” phase before a strong move up. Impact of Trump tariffs on Bitcoin’s price Trump’s tariff decision is central to this bullish outlook. By threatening higher tariffs but delaying them until August 1, the administration has given markets a short-term reprieve from trade uncertainty, potentially supporting a move higher for Bitcoin. Generally, reduced trade tensions lower the risk of an economic slowdown and support risk assets, such as equities and cryptocurrencies . Pillows’ analysis indicated that accumulation started around $105,000 to $108,000, with a Wyckoff target near $125,000. Meanwhile, another bullish outlook came from analyst TradingShot , who noted in a July 7 TradingView post that Bitcoin is testing short-term support at its four-hour 50-period moving average ( MA50 ) after forming a golden cross. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analyst sees similarities to May’s rally, with nearly identical gains from recent lows, 13.60% in May versus 12.60% now, and matching four-hour RSI patterns. If this fractal continues, Bitcoin could target the 1.5 Fibonacci extension level around $117,000 in the near term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,263, having experienced a modest 0.5% pullback over the last 24 hours, while it was down 1% for the week.

2025-07-07T14:43:51,"Musk Teases Pro-Bitcoin America Party, Trump Fires Back, BTC Bull Token to Thrive","In a daring move that brings politics, tech, and crypto all under one banner, Elon Musk has revealed that his newly formed ‘America Party’ will fully support $BTC. Such an announcement comes on the heels of Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ a key turning point that led to a very public split between Musk and the US President. Their opposing views on economic policies became the catalyst for Musk to launch his own political party, with $BTC at the heart of its financial vision. As $BTC interest and adoption grow, the America Party creates the perfect environment for projects like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) to thrive. That’s because $BTCBULL gives token holders exposure to real-world $BTC gains without needing to hold or manage the #1 crypto directly. Musk Receives 80% Votes to Start New Political Party Although Elon Musk has yet to officially launch the America Party, he has floated the idea publicly . This is because he’s frustrated by what he sees as a lack of real economic vision from America’s political parties. Musk accused Trump of abandoning political centrism. Following this, he ran a poll on X asking if he should start a new party for ‘the 80% in the middle.’ With 80.4% voting yes, he moved forward (though unofficially for now). And Trump’s no longer a massive fan of Musk, either. On Sunday night, he slammed his former ally on Truth Social, calling him a ‘train wreck’ who has gone ‘off the rails’ over the past month. He then dismissed Musk’s third-party ambitions as doomed to fail, accusing him of creating ‘disruption and chaos,’ just like the ‘radical left.’ Still, Musk had opportunities to join existing third-party movements (like Andrew Yang’s Forward Party and Steven Nekhaila’s Libertarian Party), but he opted to explore his own political path instead. $BTC stands as a core pillar of the America Party for financial freedom. Musk underscored this stance on X, bluntly declaring fiat currency as ‘hopeless.’ By framing $BTC as part of a broader political realignment, he elevates it from being a mere speculative asset to a symbol of economic sovereignty. This narrative boost could have meaningful ripple effects on projects like $BTCBULL , which offers you the chance to capitalize on $BTC for less than a cent. $BTCBULL to Airdrop Real $BTC Rewards $BTCBULL is a meme coin designed to ride the wave of $BTC’s next explosive bull run. Its primary draw is the fact that it’ll airdrop real $BTC when the OG coin breaks new records, including $150K and $200K. When it reaches $250K, you can also expect some free $BTCBULL. BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes predicts that $BTC could reach $250K this year, so these milestones might be closer than you think. For airdrop eligibility, all you need to do is hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , the platform’s integrated crypto wallet. To enjoy lower transaction fees, we recommend purchasing $BEST , the wallet’s native token. $BTCBULL’s token burns are also noteworthy. At key $BTC milestones ($125K, $175K, and $225K), it’ll burn a portion of its token supply. By increasing scarcity, the native token aims to boost its value higher when $BTC climbs. The $BTCBULL token claim is now live, marking the presales official close at $8.4M+. Trading is now expected to heat up as the token enters the market. Purchase $BTCBULL on Uniswap By placing $BTC at the heart of his proposed America Party, Musk validated that $BTC represents financial freedom and sovereignty. As $BTC continues to attract attention, $BTCBULL is built to thrive on its heightened demand. To reap the benefits of real $BTC airdrops, you can now buy $BTCBULL on Uniswap.

2025-07-07T14:42:34,"ATOM Breaks Resistance Level as Trading Volume Triples","The Cosmos ecosystem token (ATOM) demonstrated significant bullish momentum during a recent 24-hour period from 6 July 15:00 to 7 July 14:00, climbing from $4.05 to $4.10 with strong buyer support at key levels. The move comes as bitcoin ambles its way back to the $110,000 level of resistance, a point it rejected from last week causing a day of decline across the altcoin market. ATOM is now well poised to continue to the upside as trading volume tripled over the past 24 hours, indicating optimism from traders. Technical Analysis ATOM-USD climbed from $4.05 to $4.10, representing a 1.23% gain during the 24-hour period from 6 July 15:00 to 7 July 14:00. A significant breakout occurred at 21:00 on 6 July when volume surged to over 1 million units (3x the hourly average), pushing price through the $4.10 resistance level. Price established a trading range of $0.097 (2.4%) with a high of $4.13. Strong buyer interest confirmed at support zones between $4.03-$4.05, suggesting continued upward momentum. During the 60-minute period from 7 July 13:05 to 14:04, ATOM exhibited a bullish breakout at 13:57-13:59, with price surging from $4.09 to $4.10 on elevated volume exceeding 20,000 units per minute.

2025-07-07T14:40:26,"Mercado Bitcoin Unlocks $200M+ RWA Tokenization on XRP Ledger: A Game Changer","BitcoinWorld Mercado Bitcoin Unlocks $200M+ RWA Tokenization on XRP Ledger: A Game Changer Are you ready for a financial revolution? The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a major player from Brazil is making waves that could redefine how we view traditional investments. Mercado Bitcoin , one of Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is embarking on an ambitious journey to tokenize over $200 million in real-world assets (RWAs) directly onto the XRP Ledger. This isn’t just a bold move; it’s a testament to the growing convergence of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology , promising unprecedented accessibility and liquidity for investors worldwide. Unpacking Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: A New Era for Finance Before diving into the specifics of Mercado Bitcoin’s groundbreaking initiative, let’s understand what RWA tokenization truly means. In simple terms, it’s the process of converting the rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. Imagine taking a physical asset – be it a piece of real estate, a valuable painting, a company’s stock, or a government bond – and representing its ownership, or a fractional part of it, as a secure, verifiable token on a distributed ledger. This digital representation brings a host of benefits that are simply not possible in traditional finance: Increased Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 on global markets, unlike traditional assets with limited trading hours and geographical restrictions. Fractional Ownership: High-value assets, previously out of reach for most individual investors, can now be divided into smaller, affordable tokens. This democratizes access to exclusive investment opportunities. Enhanced Transparency: All transactions are recorded on an immutable blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable trail of ownership. Reduced Costs: By eliminating intermediaries and streamlining processes, tokenization can significantly lower transaction fees, administrative overheads, and settlement times. Faster Settlement: Transactions on a blockchain can settle in minutes or seconds, compared to days in traditional financial systems. This transformation is not theoretical; Mercado Bitcoin has already demonstrated its capability, having tokenized over 1 billion Brazilian reais (approximately $185 million) in assets. This significant track record highlights their expertise and commitment to pioneering this new financial frontier. Why Mercado Bitcoin Chose the XRP Ledger for This Monumental Step The decision by Mercado Bitcoin to leverage the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for this massive tokenization effort is strategic and speaks volumes about the capabilities of this particular blockchain. The XRPL is renowned for several key attributes that make it an ideal platform for large-scale RWA tokenization: Speed and Efficiency: The XRP Ledger boasts incredibly fast transaction speeds, with transactions typically confirming in 3-5 seconds. This is crucial for high-volume trading of tokenized assets. Low Transaction Costs: Fees on the XRPL are exceptionally low, often fractions of a cent. This makes it economically viable for frequent trading and micro-transactions, benefiting both issuers and investors. Scalability: Designed to handle a high throughput of transactions, the XRPL is built to scale, making it suitable for managing a vast number of tokenized assets and users. Built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX): The XRPL has a native decentralized exchange that allows for direct peer-to-peer trading of any asset issued on the ledger, facilitating seamless liquidity for tokenized RWAs. Security and Stability: The XRPL has a proven track record of stability and security, vital for handling valuable financial assets. Institutional Focus: Ripple, the company behind XRP, has actively pursued partnerships and use cases with financial institutions globally, aligning with Mercado Bitcoin’s institutional-grade aspirations. By choosing the XRPL, Mercado Bitcoin is not just tokenizing assets; they are integrating into an ecosystem that prioritizes speed, cost-effectiveness, and reliability, essential ingredients for the widespread adoption of digital assets in mainstream finance. The Promise of Digital Assets: Transforming Investment Opportunities The tokenization of traditional assets into digital assets on a blockchain like the XRP Ledger isn’t merely a technical innovation; it’s a paradigm shift in how we conceive of and interact with investments. This move by Mercado Bitcoin underscores several profound implications for investors, businesses, and the global financial landscape: Democratizing Access to Wealth Historically, access to certain high-value investments like prime real estate, blue-chip stocks, or exclusive art collections has been restricted to accredited investors or those with substantial capital. Tokenization shatters these barriers, allowing fractional ownership. This means an average investor could potentially own a ‘token’ representing a share of a luxury apartment building, a bond issued by a major corporation, or even a piece of a famous artwork. This democratization of access could unlock vast new pools of capital and create more equitable investment opportunities globally. Unlocking Global Liquidity Traditional markets often suffer from liquidity constraints due to geographical limitations, differing regulatory frameworks, and restricted trading hours. Tokenized assets, being digital and borderless, can be traded on global exchanges 24/7. This dramatically increases the potential buyer and seller pool, leading to enhanced liquidity and more efficient price discovery. For assets like private equity or real estate, which are notoriously illiquid, tokenization offers a revolutionary pathway to unlock their value. Innovation in Financial Products The flexibility of tokenized assets allows for the creation of entirely new financial products and services. Imagine derivatives built on tokenized real estate, or lending protocols collateralized by tokenized bonds. The possibilities are immense, fostering an environment ripe for financial innovation that could lead to more tailored and efficient investment strategies. Here’s a quick comparison illustrating the shift: Feature Traditional Assets Tokenized Assets Access Often limited (accredited investors, high minimums) Democratized (fractional ownership, lower entry barriers) Liquidity Variable, often low (especially for private assets) Potentially high (24/7 global trading) Costs High (brokerage fees, administrative costs) Lower (reduced intermediaries, automated processes) Settlement Days (T+2, T+3) Seconds/Minutes Transparency Limited, centralized records High, immutable blockchain records Geographical Reach Limited by national borders Global, borderless Navigating the Landscape of Blockchain Technology and Regulatory Frameworks The successful integration of RWA tokenization into mainstream finance, particularly at the scale envisioned by Mercado Bitcoin , hinges not only on robust blockchain technology but also on evolving regulatory clarity. While the benefits are clear, the path forward involves navigating complex legal and compliance landscapes. The Role of Robust Blockchain Technology The underlying blockchain must be secure, scalable, and reliable. The XRP Ledger’s architecture, with its consensus mechanism and proven uptime, provides a strong foundation. However, continuous innovation in smart contract security, interoperability between different blockchains, and the ability to handle diverse asset types will be crucial for long-term success. The transparency inherent in blockchain ensures that ownership records are clear and verifiable, reducing fraud and disputes. Addressing Regulatory Challenges One of the primary hurdles for widespread RWA tokenization is the lack of a globally harmonized regulatory framework. Different jurisdictions have varying stances on what constitutes a security token, how it should be issued, and how it should be traded. For Mercado Bitcoin, operating in Brazil, adherence to local securities laws is paramount. This often involves: Issuance Regulations: Ensuring tokens comply with rules for public offerings or private placements. Exchange Licensing: Obtaining appropriate licenses to operate a marketplace for security tokens. Investor Protection: Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to prevent illicit activities and protect investors. Taxation: Clear guidelines on how tokenized assets and their profits are taxed. Companies like Mercado Bitcoin are working closely with regulators to help shape these frameworks, demonstrating the potential benefits while ensuring compliance. Their success will likely serve as a blueprint for others looking to enter this space. Actionable Insights for the Future of Finance What does Mercado Bitcoin’s bold move mean for various stakeholders? For Investors: Keep an eye on platforms offering tokenized RWAs. This could be a pathway to diversify your portfolio with previously inaccessible assets, potentially at lower entry points and with greater liquidity. However, always conduct thorough due diligence on the underlying asset and the issuing platform. For Businesses and Asset Owners: Consider the potential of tokenization to unlock capital, increase liquidity for illiquid assets, and reach a broader, global investor base. This could be a game-changer for fundraising and asset management. For Developers and Blockchain Enthusiasts: The growth of RWA tokenization creates immense opportunities for building new financial applications, compliance tools, and interoperable solutions on platforms like the XRP Ledger. A New Horizon for Global Finance Mercado Bitcoin’s commitment to tokenizing over $200 million in real-world assets on the XRP Ledger is more than just a business decision; it’s a significant milestone in the ongoing digital transformation of finance. By bringing traditional stocks and bonds onto a cutting-edge blockchain, they are not only expanding their own offerings but also paving the way for a more inclusive, efficient, and liquid global financial system. The fusion of traditional assets with the power of blockchain technology is creating a future where investment opportunities are truly borderless and accessible to everyone. This monumental step by Mercado Bitcoin solidifies the XRP Ledger ‘s position as a key player in the RWA tokenization space and promises an exciting new chapter for digital assets .

The acquisition brought Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 597,325 BTC. However, Saylor paused purchases this week without reporting new Bitcoin acquisitions. This breaks Strategy’s consistent purchasing streak across recent months. The company previously maintained regular Bitcoin accumulation through various funding mechanisms. Both Metaplanet and Strategy focus on Bitcoin yield metrics for performance measurement. These companies track bitcoin-per-share ratios rather than traditional financial returns. The approach aligns with Bitcoin treasury company strategies across global markets. Corporate Bitcoin adoption continues expanding among public companies worldwide. Corporate Bitcoin adoption spreads across markets On Thursday, Hamak Gold Limited declared its intention to implement a Bitcoin treasury management policy. The London-listed gold exploration company saw shares rise 6% to 1.17 GBX. The announcement marks another traditional mining company entering Bitcoin treasury strategies. Hamak’s placing and subscription rounds generated £2.47 million in gross funds. Shares were priced at 0.8 penny each in the investment round, which was 27% less than the closing prices on July 2. Existing owners received 308.4 million new common shares as a result of the transaction. The new shares make up 452.1 million shares, or 68.2% of Hamak’s expanded share capital. Two-year warrants that are exercisable in the second year are included with every new share. All freshly issued shares are subject to a one-year lock-in term. Traditional companies across various sectors explore Bitcoin treasury policies for asset diversification. Gold mining firms particularly consider Bitcoin as a digital alternative to the precious metal. The trend spans from technology companies to resource extraction businesses. Corporate treasuries also view Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and store of value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-07T14:29:04,"Core Scientific, Bitcoin Miners Tumble on CoreWeave Buyout; Jefferies Says Price in Expected Range","AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave (CRWV) has agreed to buy bitcoin (BTC) miner Core Scientific (CORZ) in an all-stock deal valuing CORZ at approximately $20.40 per share, based on recent closing prices. The offer price is near the middle of investment bank Jefferies’ prior estimated takeout range of $16–$23/share. The deal is expected to close in Q4 2025. Core Scientific shares were 22% lower, trading around $14 at publication time, while fellow bitcoin miners and possible high performance computing plays like HUT 8 (HUT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) were down more than 7%. Another similarly-situated miner, IREN (IREN), however, was higher by 3%. Coreweave shares were lower by 3.3%. Jefferies analysts previously noted that CoreWeave's strong post-IPO share performance put it in a favorable position to pursue large-scale M&A. The bank sees the move as a strategic effort to vertically integrate CoreWeave’s infrastructure and reduce reliance on long-term leases and third-party developers. CoreWeave is well-positioned to use its relatively low cost of equity to replace long-term lease obligations and take direct control of data center assets, analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote. The deal underscores the accelerating trend of consolidation in the AI infrastructure and high-performance computing (HPC) space, as vertically integrated providers seek scale and control. For CoreWeave, the move positions it as not just a supplier of compute, but a full-stack infrastructure operator, an increasingly critical posture as demand from AI firms and cloud-native enterprises continues to surge. Acquiring Core Scientific's data center capacity and platform allows CoreWeave to expand owned infrastructure and better control future capacity expansion, the analysts said. Core Scientific has also been seeking new leases with hyperscalers, and the analysts suggested that CoreWeave may be aiming to secure that space before new deals are finalized. Jefferies has a buy rating on Core Scientific shares with an $18 price target.

2025-07-07T14:25:09,"The Critical Report of the Week for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL) Has Arrived: Interest Shifted from Bitcoin to This Altcoin!","The new week started on the upside for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. While it is wondered whether this momentum will continue during the week, CoinShares published its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that there was an inflow of $ 1.03 billion last week. “Last week, $1.03 billion inflows were experienced in cryptocurrency investment products, with asset inflows reaching a record level of $188 billion, marking the 12th consecutive week of inflows.” Ethereum Goes on the Attack! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $790 million, positive sentiment also dominated Ethereum (ETH), with an inflow of $226.4 million. When we look at other altcoins, XRP saw an inflow of $10.6 million, Solana (SOL) $21.6 million, and Sui (SUI) $1.6 million. The figures signaled that investors are showing more interest in Ethereum than Bitcoin. “Bitcoin investment products saw inflows of $790 million last week, a slowdown from the previous three weeks when they averaged $1.5 billion. The moderation in inflows suggests investors are becoming more cautious as Bitcoin approaches all-time highs. Ethereum saw $226 million in inflows last week, marking its 11th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the total during that period to $2.85 billion. On a pro rata basis, weekly inflows during this run averaged 1.6% of AuM, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%. This signals a significant shift in investor sentiment in favor of Ethereum.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an inflow of 1.02 billion dollars. After the USA, Germany had an inflow of $38.5 million and Switzerland had an inflow of $33.7 million. Against these inflows, Canada had an outflow of $29.3 million, while Sweden had an outflow of $19.2 million. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T14:15:39,"Trump administration, US legislators turn attention to crypto tax policy starting July 9","The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Banking Committee are set to hold separate hearings on the digital assets market on Wednesday, July 9, following the completion of President Trump’s major tax and budget bill. Congress now appears ready to take serious steps toward regulating the crypto industry. House Speaker Mike Johnson has designated the week of July 14 as “Crypto Week,” during which the House will consider a series of bills focused on market structure and stablecoins. Beyond the House and Senate hearings, a handful of key developments could steer the future of US crypto policy. The Senate Banking Committee will put out a discussion draft this week to reform market structure based on the 2023 Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and as related to provisions in the House’s CLARITY Act . The US House develops strategies to focus mainly on the crypto market The House hearing scheduled for Wednesday is titled Ensuring Digital Asset Policy Built for the 21st Century. According to information from the committee’s website, it will focus on what needs to be done to create a tax policy framework for digital assets. As of Sunday last week, there was no list of witnesses available. Meanwhile, the Senate hearing is titled Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets. It will include Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, Paradigm general partner Dan Robinson, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as witnesses. This committee will discuss liquidity systems, how digital assets are held securely, and whether stablecoins are properly backed. As part of “Crypto Week,” House Republicans are preparing to bring two major crypto-related bills to the floor for a vote: the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act , Johnson said. The CLARITY Act, which received approval from two House committees, would create clear authority boundaries between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding various digital assets. The bill is intended to ease regulatory uncertainty surrounding digital assets that have largely kept Wall Street banks and institutional investors on the edge of cryptocurrency trading. The GENIUS Act, which received approval from the Senate in June, provides a regulatory mechanism for issuing and trading dollar-pegged stablecoins. With the bill presented straight to the House floor, Speaker Johnson is circumventing standard committee procedure, with which amendments to the GENIUS Act can be proposed and voted on. Trump’s crypto ties raise concerns among individuals While both the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act had started with bipartisan backing, Democrats in the House and Senate later expressed strong concerns about their approval after President Trump and the Trump family received immense amounts of money through dealing with crypto tokens and stablecoins that a lot of people thought were illegal or corrupt. On the other hand, the Republican majority in both chambers turned down amendments that would have prevented the president and other high-ranking federal officials from trading cryptocurrencies privately while they were in office. Still, if the GENIUS Act passes the House, it would go to President Trump’s desk, and this will open the door for banks, non-bank financial technology companies, and large retailers to be free to issue their own stablecoins and offer the services that consumers use to access their stablecoins. The Senate has not yet discussed the CLARITY Act and is considering its plans for handling the digital asset market. The Trump administration’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets is set to publish its first significant report on crypto by July 22, with David Sacks and Bo Hines in the lead seats. The report, which Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham has likened to a “crypto roadmap,” is anticipated to put forth regulatory and legislative suggestions, which could include proposals for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, better banking access for crypto companies, and the establishment of a national digital asset stockpile.

2025-07-07T14:15:07,"XRP Rich List: Here’s How Much XRP You Need to Join Top 10% Holders","A recent update from crypto analyst Edo Farina has stirred conversation in the XRP community by revealing that holding just 2,486 XRP is enough to place an investor among the top 10% of all XRP holders. The finding offers a fascinating glimpse into XRP’s distribution and highlights how relatively low the barrier to elite ownership still is, especially compared to traditional asset classes. The XRP Distribution Landscape XRP, with a fixed total supply of 100 billion coins, currently has a circulating supply of approximately 56 to 64 billion. While millions of wallet addresses hold XRP, the number of actual individual holders is far lower. Many investors operate multiple wallets—for exchanges, staking, or cold storage—resulting in a skewed impression of overall distribution. Data shows that holding 2,486 XRP—about $6,800 worth at current prices- is enough to qualify for the top 10% of all holders. To be in the top 5%, one needs just 8,762 XRP, while the top 1% starts at around 50,000 XRP . Only a few hundred wallets, roughly 657, hold over 5 million XRP, underscoring the high concentration at the very top. XRP Rich List Update: You need 2,486 $XRP to be on the TOP 10% Full Video: https://t.co/LuOXxnbnV6 pic.twitter.com/FVAFRx8ovf — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 6, 2025 These figures reveal that XRP’s wealth distribution remains top-heavy, yet still offers strategic entry points for smaller retail investors to gain substantial exposure. Strategic Implications for Investors While being in the top 10% doesn’t make one a whale, it does represent a meaningful share of the network. Edo Farina notes that accumulating 10,000 XRP or more puts investors in an even more exclusive category, offering long-term benefits as the asset’s ecosystem matures. These include potential staking rewards, institutional lending yields, and significant appreciation should XRP achieve wider adoption as a global settlement token. Given XRP’s low transaction fees, fast settlement times, and expanding utility, many analysts believe its real value lies in enterprise-level infrastructure and cross-border liquidity, not speculative trading alone. That view is further reinforced by Ripple’s growing network of financial partners and recent strides toward becoming a licensed U.S. banking entity . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bigger Picture XRP’s rich list also serves as a mirror of broader crypto trends. Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has a more consolidated distribution, largely due to significant holdings by Ripple, founders, and centralized exchanges. Yet for retail investors, the opportunity to enter the upper echelons of XRP ownership remains accessible, for now. As XRP adoption expands, particularly through Ripple’s institutional partnerships, the thresholds for top-tier ownership are likely to rise. That means today’s modest holder could, in time, find themselves climbing the ranks without adding a single token, just by holding steady. Edo Farina’s update is more than just a statistic. It’s a reminder that in this evolving financial era, even relatively small investments in high-utility assets like XRP can offer outsized positioning within the ecosystem. For those watching from the sidelines, this could be the ideal moment to act. For those already in, it’s a reaffirmation of where they stand in a rapidly growing digital economy.

2025-07-07T14:10:15,"Explosive Digital Asset Inflows: CoinShares Report Reveals Record $1.03 Billion Surge","BitcoinWorld Explosive Digital Asset Inflows: CoinShares Report Reveals Record $1.03 Billion Surge Are you keeping an eye on the pulse of the crypto market? If so, prepare for some exciting news! The latest CoinShares Report has just dropped, revealing a monumental week for digital asset investments. We’re talking about a staggering $1.03 billion in Digital Asset Inflows , a figure that not only highlights robust investor confidence but also propels the total assets under management (AuM) to an unprecedented $188 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the growing institutional appetite and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Latest CoinShares Report: A Snapshot of Market Health The weekly Digital Asset Fund Flows report by CoinShares is a critical barometer for institutional engagement in the crypto space. It tracks capital movements into various Crypto Investment Products , offering invaluable insights into market sentiment and trends. This recent report paints a decidedly bullish picture, with the vast majority of inflows concentrated in the United States, which alone accounted for $1 billion. While North America dominated the positive sentiment, it’s worth noting that some regions, specifically Canada and Brazil, experienced outflows, suggesting a nuanced global investment landscape. Key Takeaways from the Report: Total Inflows: $1.03 billion injected into digital asset investment products. Record AuM: Assets under management soared to an all-time high of $188 billion. Geographical Focus: The U.S. led the charge with $1 billion in inflows, indicating strong domestic institutional interest. Regional Divergence: Canada and Brazil saw outflows, highlighting varying regional market dynamics. Why Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin in Recent Inflows While Bitcoin (BTC) often grabs the headlines, the CoinShares report brings an intriguing development to light: Ethereum (ETH) has consistently outperformed Bitcoin in terms of weekly inflows over the past 12 weeks. Ethereum averaged 1.6% in weekly inflows, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%. What could be driving this trend? Ethereum’s robust ecosystem continues to be a magnet for capital. Its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various blockchain applications makes it more than just a digital currency; it’s a programmable platform. Investors might be increasingly recognizing ETH’s potential beyond a simple store of value, viewing it as an investment in the future of decentralized technology. This sustained performance indicates a growing diversification within institutional portfolios, moving beyond just Bitcoin to embrace the broader altcoin market, especially those with strong utility and development. The Significance of Record AuM: What Does $188 Billion Mean? The achievement of a Record AuM of $188 billion is more than just a numerical milestone; it’s a powerful statement about the maturity and increasing acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance. This figure represents the total value of assets managed by various investment products like ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) and trusts, reflecting the scale of institutional and professional investor participation. Implications of Record AuM: Institutional Validation: A higher AuM signals growing confidence from large financial entities, legitimizing digital assets as a viable asset class. Market Liquidity and Stability: Increased institutional capital can contribute to deeper liquidity and potentially reduce volatility in the long term. Infrastructure Growth: The influx of capital often fuels further development in regulatory frameworks, custody solutions, and trading platforms, creating a more robust ecosystem. Mainstream Integration: As more traditional investment vehicles embrace crypto, it paves the way for broader public access and understanding. Navigating the Future of Crypto Investment Products The impressive Digital Asset Inflows highlighted by the latest CoinShares report underscore a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. While the benefits of institutional adoption are clear—increased capital, enhanced legitimacy, and infrastructure development—challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the need for greater investor education are ongoing hurdles that the industry must address. For investors, these trends offer actionable insights. Observing which assets attract the most inflows can help in understanding market sentiment and potential future growth areas. The consistent performance of Ethereum, for instance, suggests a strong belief in its ecosystem’s long-term value. Similarly, the dominance of U.S. inflows points to the significant role of American financial markets in shaping global crypto trends.

2025-07-07T14:07:57,"Popular Trader Dumps 5 Altcoins to Focus on Meme Coins With 100X Potential","TL;DR One well-known crypto trader sold TIA, ONDO, and other holdings to chase major gains in the meme coin niche – a move that sparked both support and skepticism across the crypto community. Despite Bitcoin’s dominance above 64%, some analysts believe an altseason is near, with low-cap tokens such as HNT and ONDO expected to lead the charge. Cashing Out While talk of an upcoming altseason continues to buzz across the crypto space, popular X user Crypto Beast has decided to offload some of their bags. The trader revealed the sell-off occurred on July 7 and included the tokens Celestia (TIA), Ondo (ONDO), Ethena (ENA), Quant (QNT), and Pyth Network (PYTH). It is worth mentioning that all of the aforementioned have posted some gains on a 24-hour scale. TIA leads the charge with a spike of around 10%, while the rest have recorded more modest increases. The crypto enthusiast claimed the sold altcoins have utility but questioned whether this is needed in the space. “They’re good for one thing: making VCs richer,” they added. Crypto Beast has now shifted focus to hunting meme coins with 100x potential. Some X users commenting on the post supported the decision, stressing the importance of profit-taking. Others, though, wondered why the trader would prioritize meme coins, considering the hype for these tokens had significantly reduced in the past several months. Recall that the sector was booming towards the end of last year, with its total market cap surging past $120 billion. Currently, the capitalization stands at less than $60 billion (per CoinGecko’s data). Was This the Right Time? Bitcoin (BTC) continues to outperform its rivals, and as of this writing, its market dominance is beyond 64%. However, multiple industry participants believe the altcoins have yet to catch up with the biggest cryptocurrency and steal the show. BTC Dominance, Source: CMC X user Chiefy predicted that the next altcoin “super-cycle” will start in July. “This time, low caps will pump 175x and ignite the most powerful altseason,” they forecasted. The analyst thinks Sui Network (SUI), Helium (HNT), Render (RENDER), Filecoin (FIL), and Ondo (ONDO) are among the top contenders for explosive rallies. It’s worth noting, though, that SUI should not be placed in the same ‘low-cap’ category, as it’s the 15th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $10 billion. Carl Moon – an X user with over 1.5 million followers – chipped in, too. He claimed that the altcoins “will go parabolic” once the combined market capitalization of all digital assets (excluding BTC and ETH) soars above $1.15 trillion. Currently, the figure stands well below $1 trillion.

2025-07-07T14:00:06,"Bitcoin Price: Unveiling Four Crucial Trends Shaping BTC This Week","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Unveiling Four Crucial Trends Shaping BTC This Week The crypto world never sleeps, and for investors eyeing the digital gold, understanding the intricate dance of Bitcoin market trends is paramount. As we navigate another dynamic week, several key indicators are emerging that could significantly influence Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just keeping an eye on your portfolio, these insights are crucial for making informed decisions in a volatile landscape. Let’s dive into the core factors that Cointelegraph highlights as pivotal for Bitcoin’s performance this week. Is a BTC Price Prediction of Retracement on the Horizon? One of the most talked-about technical indicators in the current Bitcoin discourse is the potential for a retracement to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). This key technical level often acts as a significant support or resistance zone for assets. For Bitcoin, this could mean a correction towards the $105,000 level . But what does this really mean for the average investor? Understanding the 50-day SMA: This average tracks Bitcoin’s price over the last 50 trading days, smoothing out short-term fluctuations to reveal the underlying trend. A price trading above it typically signals bullish momentum, while a drop towards or below it can indicate a cooling-off period or a potential reversal. The Significance of $105,000: If BTC does retrace to this level, it would test a crucial support point. For some, this presents a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, assuming the long-term bullish trend remains intact. For others, it might signal a deeper correction. Navigating Volatility: Such a retracement, while potentially alarming to some, is a natural part of healthy market cycles. It allows the market to consolidate gains and gather strength for the next leg up. Monitoring this level will be vital for any BTC price prediction you might be making this week. A strong bounce off the 50-day SMA would reinforce bullish sentiment, whereas a decisive break below it could signal further downside. Decoding Crypto Market Analysis : Can Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum Endure? Bitcoin recently achieved a historic weekly close, a milestone that typically ignites fervent optimism among market participants. However, despite this impressive feat, a cloud of uncertainty looms over BTC’s sustained bullish momentum. Why the hesitation after such a strong performance? Profit-Taking Pressure: After significant rallies, it’s common for early investors and short-term traders to take profits, which can exert downward pressure on the price. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader economic landscape, including inflation concerns and interest rate expectations, can temper even the strongest asset rallies. Market Fatigue: Sustained parabolic moves can lead to market fatigue, where buyers become exhausted, and the asset needs time to consolidate before another leg higher. Expert crypto market analysis suggests that while the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains strong, the short-term path is less clear. The key challenge lies in whether new capital inflows can outpace the selling pressure from profit-takers and those wary of macro conditions. Investors should watch for signs of continued institutional adoption and sustained trading volume to gauge the underlying strength of this momentum. How Will the FOMC Meeting Impact Bitcoin’s Next Move? Beyond the technical charts, macroeconomic events play an undeniable role in the crypto market. This week, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes are a critical point of interest. The Federal Reserve’s stance on monetary policy, particularly interest rates, can send ripples across all financial markets, including Bitcoin. Historically, a hawkish stance (implying higher interest rates) tends to be bearish for risk assets like Bitcoin, as it makes traditional investments more attractive. Conversely, a dovish stance (lower interest rates or quantitative easing) often fuels a rally in risk assets. Additionally, a weakening U.S. dollar often correlates with a strengthening Bitcoin. Here’s why: Factor Impact on USD Potential Impact on BTC Hawkish FOMC (Higher Rates) Stronger USD Negative (BTC less attractive) Dovish FOMC (Lower Rates) Weaker USD Positive (BTC more attractive) Weakening U.S. Dollar Decreased Purchasing Power Positive (BTC as inflation hedge) The minutes will provide deeper insights into the Fed’s future plans, offering clarity that could significantly influence the dollar’s strength and, by extension, Bitcoin’s appeal. The FOMC meeting impact is often felt immediately in the markets, so keeping an eye on financial news outlets around the release time is advisable. Are Declining Bitcoin Funding Rates Signaling an Imminent Squeeze? Finally, a fascinating on-chain metric to watch is the declining funding rates on Binance Futures. Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price close to the spot price. When funding rates are positive, longs pay shorts; when negative, shorts pay longs. A significant drop in funding rates, or even a flip to negative, indicates that short sellers are becoming more dominant or aggressive in the derivatives market. This might seem bearish on the surface, but it can actually set the stage for a ‘short squeeze’. What is a Short Squeeze? It occurs when an asset’s price rises sharply, forcing short sellers (who bet on a price decline) to buy back the asset to limit their losses. This buying further fuels the price increase, creating a cascading effect. Why Declining Rates Matter: When Bitcoin funding rates turn low or negative, it means shorts are paying longs, or that there’s a strong belief the price will fall. If the price then unexpectedly starts to rise, these shorts are forced to cover their positions, creating a surge in demand that can propel the price even higher. Binance Futures Insights: As one of the largest derivatives exchanges, trends on Binance Futures often reflect broader market sentiment and positioning. A noticeable drop here could precede a significant price movement. While not a guaranteed outcome, the declining funding rates are a strong signal that a short squeeze could be on the horizon, potentially leading to a sharp upward movement for BTC. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Week Ahead This week promises to be pivotal for Bitcoin, with a confluence of technical, fundamental, and on-chain factors at play. From potential retracements that could offer buying opportunities to macroeconomic decisions that shift market sentiment, and derivative market dynamics signaling explosive moves, staying informed is your best strategy. The interplay between these factors underscores the complexity and excitement of the crypto market. While no single indicator guarantees future performance, understanding these top Bitcoin market trends empowers you to make more strategic decisions and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. Remember to always conduct your own research and manage risk effectively. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-07-07T14:00:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.458 Price Change 24h -1.4% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.458 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis Pi’s price is below $0.46, forming lower highs while testing weak support zones. The MACD shows continued bearish momentum, with weak crossover signals and minimal upward strength. RSI stays under 40 on both charts, signalling persistent oversold conditions with no recovery yet. As of July 7th 2025, the Pi Network’s price fell to $0.4589, continuing its bearish trend with weak buying interest. Resistance stands at $0.4760, where sellers repeatedly halt upward attempts. The key support level is $0.4570, which has been tested multiple times without a clear breakdown. A drop below this support could push the price toward the $0.44 region. Pi 1-day chart shows struggles below $0.46 On the 24-hour chart, Pi Network is trading at $0.4589, showing a 1.44% decline for the day. The price continues to form lower highs, indicating sustained bearish momentum. The RSI sits at 33.76, showing the token is nearing oversold territory with weak buying strength. Meanwhile, the MACD remains bearish, with the MACD line at -0.0029 and the signal line at -0.0387. This alignment suggests downward pressure is likely to persist unless volume and sentiment shift significantly. PIUSDT Price Chart By TradingView Pi/USDT 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Pi/USDT is trading at $0.4592 after dropping 1.80% in the current session. The price failed to hold above $0.46, showing weak buyer interest and continued downward momentum. The RSI reads 34.45, indicating persistent bearish pressure with no sign of a reversal. Although the MACD line has slightly recovered to 0.0021, it remains below the signal line at -0.0099, signalling limited momentum. Without stronger volume or a breakout above resistance, Pi remains vulnerable to further declines. PIUSDT Price Chart By TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 Pi Price Prediction July 2025 Heading into July 2025, the price of Pi is predicted to reach an average price of $0.5110, while the coin could trade between a maximum of $0.5256 and a minimum of $0.4672.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T13:58:46,"Bitcoin Developer Jon Atack Briefly Arrested in El Salvador After Neighborly Dispute","Senior Bitcoin developer Jon Atack was arrested in El Salvador over the weekend following a dispute with a neighbor, sparking an online flurry of concern before he was freed about an hour later. Atack, who contributes to Bitcoin Core, posted on microblogging platform X that police confiscated his phone and passport, cutting him off from the outside world and fueling fears in crypto circles. Law enforcement initially told him he could be sent to a nearby prison, though he avoided that outcome. The altercation appears tied to a disagreement over property issues rather than Atack’s crypto work. Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office and a vocal supporter of President Nayib Bukele, said Atack’s neighbor accused him of “violence against women.” Under El Salvador’s 2012 law known as Vida Libre de Violencia para las Mujeres (LEIV), which directly translates to “life free from violence for women,” violent speech and threats against women are criminal offenses. Atack was released within minutes after being handcuffed, describing the officers as “professional and friendly.” He thanked supporters online, saying , “This was the first time I’ve been in cuffs and God willing also the last time.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2025/07/07/bitcoin-developer-jon-atack-briefly-arrested-in-el-salvador-after-neighborly-dispute,"BTC|REGULATION","Web3|El Salvador|Bitcoin Core|News",cryptocompare

While we’ve seen some short-term softness, long-term conviction remains intact. The market is pausing—not panicking.

Institutions Stay Active as ETFs and Treasuries Grow Despite the near-term hesitation, institutional activity has picked up noticeably. Spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $769.6 million last week, according to SoSoValue. That marks four consecutive weeks of inflows, beginning mid-June.

Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a long-term treasury asset, and consistent accumulation by institutions continues to provide structural support against short-term volatility. Recent accumulation highlights: $769.6 million in spot BTC ETF inflows last week Metaplanet treasury now holds 15,555 BTC Blockchain Group added 116 BTC to its balance sheet The divergence between short-term sentiment and long-term capital is widening. The former is cautious, but the latter is steadily building exposure. Bitcoin Technical Outlook and Macro Pressures Technically, Bitcoin has slipped just below a short-term ascending trendline and the 50-period simple moving average around $108,641. It’s currently hovering near the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $108,482, with RSI neutral around 45. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC loses $108,482 on a closing basis, the following levels to watch are $107,836 and $107,202, which mark the 0.618 retracement. A recovery above $109,267 would bring $109,274 into focus and could signal a bullish continuation. Essential levels to monitor: Support: $108,482, $107,836, $107,202 Resistance: $109,267, $109,274 50-SMA: $108,641 In addition to technical analysis, geopolitical concerns are keeping markets on edge. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated that paused U.S. tariffs could resume on August 1. While not immediate, the uncertainty could weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bottom Line Robert Kiyosaki’s crash call may sound extreme, but it’s consistent with a growing long-term mindset. Institutional flows, ETF demand, and corporate treasury all point to one thing: the smart money is still buying. Whether Bitcoin revisits lower support or breaks above $110,000 again, the fundamentals remain strong. The narrative has shifted from speculation to structure, and that’s a sign of maturity.

The recent announcement that UK-based Web3 investment firm Coinsilium has purchased an additional 14.9 BTC, bringing its total holdings to a remarkable 88.63 BTC, is more than just a transaction. It’s a strategic declaration of confidence in the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This latest acquisition, reported by @btcNLNico on X, underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking firms: a steadfast commitment to integrating digital assets into their core strategy. But what does this mean for Coinsilium, the market, and the evolving landscape of Web3? Coinsilium Bitcoin: What Does This Latest Acquisition Signify? Coinsilium, a company at the forefront of Web3 innovation, has consistently demonstrated a proactive approach to digital asset investment. Their latest purchase of 14.9 Coinsilium Bitcoin is not an isolated event but rather a continuation of a deliberate strategy to build a robust portfolio. For a firm specializing in Web3 technologies, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin is a testament to their belief in its foundational role within the decentralized economy. Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ serves as a primary store of value in the cryptocurrency space, making it a logical anchor for any serious digital asset investor. This incremental accumulation reflects a long-term perspective, suggesting that Coinsilium views Bitcoin not as a speculative short-term trade, but as a strategic reserve asset. By increasing their Coinsilium Bitcoin holdings, they are strengthening their balance sheet with an asset that has historically appreciated significantly over time, despite its volatility. It signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition and its potential to act as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. What Drives a Web3 Investment Firm to Accumulate BTC? The decision by a Web3 investment firm like Coinsilium to continually add to its Bitcoin reserves is rooted in several key factors that define the ethos and operational philosophy of the Web3 space. Unlike traditional investment firms, Web3 entities are deeply embedded in the decentralized internet, understanding its underlying technologies and potential disruptions. Belief in Decentralization: Bitcoin embodies the core principles of decentralization, which is fundamental to Web3. A firm committed to building the decentralized future naturally aligns with the most decentralized and secure cryptocurrency. Long-Term Value Proposition: Beyond short-term price movements, Bitcoin’s scarcity, global accessibility, and censorship resistance make it an attractive long-term asset. A Web3 investment firm often takes a generational view, seeing Bitcoin as a cornerstone of the future financial system. Strategic Treasury Management: For many companies, holding Bitcoin is becoming a form of treasury management, offering an alternative to traditional cash reserves that might be devalued by inflation. It’s a proactive way to preserve and potentially grow capital. Industry Leadership: By publicly accumulating Bitcoin, firms like Coinsilium set an example, signaling confidence to their peers, partners, and the broader market. It reinforces their position as pioneers in the Web3 domain. For a Web3 investment firm , Bitcoin isn’t just another asset; it’s a foundational element of the digital future they are actively helping to build. Why Are Growing Crypto Holdings So Significant? The increasing trend of companies like Coinsilium expanding their crypto holdings carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and the evolving financial landscape. When publicly traded companies, especially those with a focus on innovation, allocate a substantial portion of their treasury to digital assets, it sends a powerful message of legitimacy and maturation. Firstly, it boosts institutional confidence. As more corporate entities embrace Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it normalizes digital assets within traditional finance. This can encourage other corporations, institutional investors, and even sovereign wealth funds to consider similar strategies, potentially unlocking vast pools of capital for the crypto market. The 88.63 BTC held by Coinsilium, while not on the scale of a MicroStrategy, is a clear signal of their conviction and a testament to the viability of digital assets as part of a corporate balance sheet. Secondly, growing crypto holdings can impact market dynamics. Increased institutional demand reduces the circulating supply of Bitcoin available on exchanges, which, coupled with its fixed supply, can exert upward pressure on its price over the long term. This accumulation strategy reflects a belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to grow as adoption expands and its utility as a global, permissionless asset becomes more evident. Furthermore, it highlights a strategic shift in corporate finance. Companies are moving beyond traditional assets and exploring new avenues for capital preservation and growth in an increasingly digital world. This proactive approach to managing crypto holdings positions them to benefit from the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Bitcoin Accumulation: A Broader Market Trend? Coinsilium’s recent purchase is not an isolated incident but rather a microcosm of a much larger, ongoing trend: widespread Bitcoin accumulation by various entities. From publicly traded corporations to institutional funds and even nation-states, the appetite for Bitcoin as a strategic asset has grown considerably over the past few years. One of the most prominent examples is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has aggressively adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC. This pioneering move inspired many others to consider similar strategies. While not every company will go to the same lengths, the idea of holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or a growth asset has gained significant traction. Beyond individual corporations, the advent of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions has provided an easier, more regulated pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. These ETFs have seen substantial inflows, further indicating a broad-based institutional desire for Bitcoin accumulation without the complexities of direct custody. This trend suggests a maturing market where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative digital currency, but as a legitimate and essential component of a diversified investment portfolio. It underscores the narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset with inherent value that can act as a safe haven during economic uncertainty and a powerful growth engine during periods of innovation. The continued Bitcoin accumulation by diverse players is a strong indicator of its long-term staying power and increasing mainstream acceptance. Coinsilium’s Digital Asset Strategy: What’s Their Long-Term Vision? The consistent increase in Coinsilium’s Bitcoin holdings provides a clear window into their overarching digital asset strategy . As a Web3 investment firm, their vision extends beyond mere trading; it encompasses active participation in and support for the foundational technologies that underpin the decentralized internet. Their strategy appears to be multi-faceted: Building a Strong Reserve: By accumulating Bitcoin, Coinsilium is building a robust and liquid reserve asset. This provides financial stability and flexibility, allowing them to pursue other strategic investments within the Web3 ecosystem. Strategic Investment in Web3 Projects: While Bitcoin forms the bedrock, Coinsilium’s primary focus remains on identifying and investing in promising Web3 projects, startups, and protocols. Their Bitcoin holdings provide the capital base to fund these ventures, from DeFi to NFTs, metaverse, and decentralized infrastructure. Long-Term Growth and Value Creation: Their digital asset strategy is geared towards long-term value creation. They are not chasing fleeting trends but rather investing in assets and technologies they believe will define the next generation of the internet. This includes not only direct asset purchases but also equity investments in Web3 companies. Mitigating Inflationary Risks: In an era of increasing global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, holding a non-sovereign, scarce asset like Bitcoin can be a crucial component of a forward-thinking digital asset strategy to protect and grow capital. Coinsilium’s approach serves as a compelling example for other firms considering their entry into the digital asset space. It highlights the importance of a clear, well-defined strategy that balances foundational asset accumulation with targeted investments in emerging technologies. Their actions demonstrate a belief in the transformative power of Web3 and the integral role Bitcoin plays within it. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the benefits of holding Bitcoin are clear, firms like Coinsilium also navigate inherent challenges. Volatility remains a key concern, requiring a robust risk management framework. Regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, demanding vigilance and adaptability. Security of digital assets is paramount, necessitating sophisticated custody solutions. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. The potential for significant capital appreciation, the ability to participate in a rapidly expanding technological frontier, and the strategic advantage of being an early mover in Web3 are compelling incentives. Coinsilium’s continued investment signals a deep understanding of these dynamics. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on the Digital Future Coinsilium’s consistent and strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a powerful statement in the evolving narrative of institutional crypto adoption. Their latest purchase of 14.9 BTC, pushing their total holdings to 88.63 BTC, reinforces their position as a visionary Web3 investment firm . It underscores a clear digital asset strategy focused on long-term value and a profound belief in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational asset in the decentralized economy. This move is more than just an investment; it’s a vote of confidence in the future of finance and technology. As crypto holdings by corporations continue to grow, they pave the way for greater mainstream acceptance and integration of digital assets. Coinsilium is not just observing the future; they are actively investing in and shaping it, demonstrating that strategic foresight and a bold approach are key to thriving in the digital age.

2025-07-07T13:42:16,"MicroStrategy Reports $14B Bitcoin Gains in Q2 While Launching $4.2B STRD Stock Program to Buy More BTC","MicroStrategy, operating as Strategy, recorded $14.05 billion in unrealized Bitcoin gains during Q2 2025, elevating the company to the exclusive tier of corporate giants typically reserved for Amazon and JPMorgan Chase . The dramatic turnaround from its software business roots comes as the company simultaneously launched a $4.2 billion STRD preferred stock program to acquire additional Bitcoin. Biggest Bitcoin Gains, Yet Still Buying More The record quarterly gain is attributed to Bitcoin’s price recovery and the Strategy’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08 , effective January 1, 2025. Under the new accounting model, Strategy recognizes fair value changes in Bitcoin holdings as they occur rather than only recording impairment losses. The company incurred $4.04 billion in associated deferred tax expense and holds a $6.31 billion deferred tax liability. Additionally, Strategy announced its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock offering with an aggregate value up to $4.2 billion through an at-the-market program. Strategy Announces $4.2 Billion $STRD At-The-Market Program pic.twitter.com/JVIYQmQSpv — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 7, 2025 The company expects disciplined sales over an extended period, taking into account trading price and volume conditions. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including additional Bitcoin acquisitions and working capital requirements. As of July 6, 2025, Strategy held 597,325 bitcoins with an aggregate purchase price of $42.40 billion and an average cost of $70,982 per bitcoin. Source: Saylor Tracker During Q2 2025, the company acquired 69,140 bitcoins at a total value of $6.77 billion, funded through multiple equity offerings, including $5.2 billion from common stock ATM programs and $979.7 million from the STRD offering. Capital Markets Activity Fuels Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Strategy received $6.8 billion in aggregate net proceeds from various financing transactions during Q2 2025. The capital raising included $163.1 million from the STRF ATM program, $446.9 million from the STRK ATM program, and $979.7 million from the STRD registered underwritten offering, which was completed on June 10. The company’s 2024 Common ATM program generated $2.4 billion in revenue before its termination, while the new 2025 Common ATM program contributed $2.9 billion. Approximately $18.1 billion of Class A common stock remains available for future issuance under the 2025 program, alongside $20.5 billion of STRK Stock and $1.9 billion of STRF Stock. Strategy’s preferred stock portfolio totals $3.4 billion in notional value with $315.9 million in annual dividends. The company maintains $8.213 billion in convertible notes outstanding, with conversion conditions met for Q3 2025 based on the 130% conversion price threshold. The maximum potential common shares from conversion total 24,439,825 shares. Source: Strategy Report Bitcoin market prices during Q2 ranged from $74,420.69 to $112,000.00, with quarter-end pricing at $107,751.68 on Coinbase. The volatility created substantial fair value fluctuations, contrasting with the $5.91 billion unrealized loss in Q1 2025. Strategy warns that results will not be comparable to pre-2025 periods due to accounting changes. Legal Challenges and S&P 500 Inclusion Prospects Emerge Strategy faces multiple class-action lawsuits alleging false and misleading statements regarding the profitability and risks of its Bitcoin strategy. Pomerantz LLP filed suit representing shareholders who purchased stock between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025, with a July 15 deadline for additional investors to join. New York law firm Pomerantz has filed a lawsuit against Michael @Saylor ’s @Strategy , accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors. #Bitcoin #Saylor https://t.co/ZwEcH2nYTQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 The lawsuit centers on Strategy’s adoption of ASU 2023-08 accounting standards, claiming that the company failed to explain the potential impact on its financial results adequately. The complaint mentioned the $5.9 billion unrealized loss disclosure in Q1 2025, which triggered an 8% decline in stock price and exposed volatility risks allegedly downplayed by management. Financial analyst Jeff Walton calculated that Strategy has a 91% chance of S&P 500 inclusion, provided Bitcoin maintains levels above $95,240 through June 30. Strategy tracking day 337 $MSTR now ranked 93rd largest US company by market cap ($112.99B) Jumped 1 company (Nike) today, and 1 company this week. Digital Capital now chasing Analog Devices.

Critics, including short-seller Jim Chanos, have intensified their opposition to Strategy’s business model , calling it “financial gibberish” and noting that the company’s $100 billion market capitalization exceeds its $60 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Chanos advises shorting MSTR stock while buying Bitcoin directly, betting the premium will eventually contract. Strategy’s shares gained 3,130% since initiating Bitcoin purchases in mid-2020, compared to Bitcoin’s 1,000% gain and the S&P 500’s 115% rise during the same period. The stock advanced 40% in Q2, outperforming the S&P’s 11% quarterly gain, while inspiring corporate imitators, like SharpLink Gaming’s Ether strategy .

2025-07-07T13:42:10,"It's Time for Ethereum (ETH), Which Lags Behind Bitcoin, to Explode! Analyst Points to This Week!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), which has been lagging behind Bitcoin for a long time and has failed to meet expectations, now seems ready for a big explosion. At this point, one analyst said that the market is going to explode this week and chose Ethereum as the main target. Famous investor Eugene published a positive analysis about Ethereum and stated that he has high expectations for ETH. “A breakout is expected this week and I have chosen Ethereum as my base asset,” Eugene wrote in his analysis on his channel. Ethereum Becomes the Most Undervalued Asset! Eugene cited Ethereum’s low market cap, institutional investment, and correlation with Bitcoin as factors that will drive its growth and explosion. At this point, Eugene, who described Ethereum as the most undervalued asset this year, predicted that Ethereum would also rise when Bitcoin was strong, based on its correlation with Bitcoin, among other factors. “After Ethereum fell from $4,000 to $1,400 this year, no one outside of developers saw it as a major investment target. This means that from a long-term perspective, Ethereum is at its lowest value in the last three years.” However, Eugene stated that traditional finance interest will now shift to Ethereum, saying, “Ethereum will become an investment target for mainstream institutions and traditional financial institutions in the infrastructure and stablecoin sectors.” Bitcoin Could Upgrade Ethereum! Finally, Eugene stated that the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum will be a driving force for ETH, saying, “If Bitcoin exceeds $ 110,000, Ethereum is likely to enter a bull market. Ethereum rarely underperforms when Bitcoin is in an uptrend.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: It's Time for Ethereum (ETH), Which Lags Behind Bitcoin, to Explode!
