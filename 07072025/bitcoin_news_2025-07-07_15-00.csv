2025-07-07T12:56:46,"Bitcoin price outlook: $108k CME gap may trigger short-term pullback","Bitcoin remains stuck in a tight range between $100,000 and $110,000. A CME futures gap at $108K adds pressure for a retrace as traders watch for a breakout backed by volume. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is consolidating between two major high time frame levels: $110,000 as range resistance and $100,169 as range support. A recent failed breakout to $111,960 followed by a quick re-entry into the range confirms a deviation, a classic hallmark of range-bound price action. Without strong volume, BTC is likely to continue oscillating within this zone. Traders are now focused on a CME futures gap at $108,300, which adds to the probability of a short-term retrace this week. Key technical points Range Resistance at $110K: Price rejected from this zone after a false breakout. Range Support at $100,169: Backed by a swing low at $98,200. CME Futures Gap at $108,300: Historically, 90% of CME gaps get filled, this one may attract price action soon. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin has been locked between $110,000 and $100,169 ever since the deviation above $111,960 failed to hold. This reaffirms the idea that BTC is currently in a rotational environment where failed breakouts and breakdowns are met with mean reversion. With no volume-backed conviction to push beyond the range, BTC continues to oscillate between these critical levels. You might also like: Russia’s biggest state-backed bank sees no use for CBDC, so why push ahead anyway? Currently, price is hovering around the range high near $110,000, which also aligns with the value area high on the volume profile. Unless BTC can close decisively above this level on strong volume, the structure favors continued consolidation or a move back toward range support. BTCCME (3D) Chart, Source: TradingView Of particular interest this week is the CME futures gap left open at $108,300 following Bitcoin’s weekend rally. Since CME Bitcoin futures don’t trade on weekends, the gap formed when markets reopened, a phenomenon with strong historical weight. Over 90% of these gaps get filled, often within days. This gives traders a technical target and increases the likelihood of a pullback in the near term, possibly toward that level. Unless the range is broken with decisive volume, this pattern of deviation and return is likely to persist. The $100,169 support zone remains crucial if price does begin to drop, especially if it follows a gap-fill move. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin is likely to continue range-bound this week unless a high-volume breakout occurs. A retrace toward $108,000 is probable due to the CME gap, with $100,000 remaining key support.

2025-07-07T12:48:37,"UK Treasury Targets Crypto Tax Evaders with £300 Fines Starting January 2026","The UK Treasury has unveiled a comprehensive crackdown on crypto tax evasion, introducing £300 fines for individuals who refuse to share personal details with crypto service providers starting January 2026. According to a Daily Mail report, the new Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will require holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and other digital currencies to share their tax reference numbers with crypto platforms or face penalties. Treasury officials project the initiative will close loopholes in crypto taxation and generate up to £315 million in additional revenue by April 2030. Source: PA Archive (The Standard) Exchequer Secretary James Murray emphasized that the initiative is part of a broader strategy to eliminate tax avoidance, stating that the rules will ensure “ tax dodgers have nowhere to hide ” and the government will be able to fund essential public services through improved compliance. Both crypto users and service providers will face financial penalties for non-compliance, creating a dual-layer enforcement mechanism that holds both parties accountable for every transaction. New Compliance Framework Puts Pressure on Platforms and Users Crypto service providers operating in the UK will bear significant responsibility under the new framework, as they are required to collect and verify customer tax information before facilitating any transactions. Platforms that fail to obtain accurate tax reference numbers or provide complete transaction records to HM Revenue and Customs will face their own financial penalties, which are currently not disclosed. The reporting requirements extend beyond simple trading activities to encompass staking rewards, DeFi yield farming, NFT transactions, and any other crypto-related income generation. Non-compliant individuals face penalties of £300 per instance, while service providers risk separate fines for failing to maintain accurate records or provide the required information to tax authorities. Source: Daily Mail ( From left to right; Treasury Parliamentary Secretary Emma Reynolds, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury James Murray, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq, and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Spencer Livermore ) Murray also described the framework as part of a broader effort to ensure “everyone pays their fair share,” positioning the crackdown as essential for maintaining public funding for nurses, police, and other vital services. Service providers will need to adapt their onboarding processes and customer management systems to accommodate the new data collection requirements, potentially increasing operational costs that could be passed to users. Global Momentum Builds Around Crypto Tax Enforcement Britain’s move is part of a worldwide trend toward stricter cryptocurrency tax compliance, with multiple jurisdictions implementing similar reporting frameworks designed to capture previously hidden digital asset profits. The European Union’s DAC8 directive , which takes effect in 2026, will require crypto platforms across all member states to share customer transaction data with tax authorities, creating a continent-wide information exchange network. European Parliament Supports DAC8 Crypto Tax Rule by an Overwhelming Margin Lawmakers in the European Parliament have expressed support for the eighth iteration of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC8). #CryptoNews #EU https://t.co/pn02rJg4qM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 14, 2023 Recent data from Denmark reveals the scale of the challenge facing tax authorities, with over 90% of crypto traders failing to report gains despite mandatory exchange reporting requirements implemented in 2019. Nordic countries appear particularly aggressive in their approach, with Norway estimating that roughly 88% of crypto traders omitted gains in 2023, while Denmark is now considering a 42% tax on unrealized cryptocurrency gains . Thailand has taken the opposite approach, offering a five-year personal income tax exemption on crypto capital gains for transactions conducted through licensed platforms, seeking to attract international investment and establish itself as a digital asset hub. As it stands now, some jurisdictions are tightening enforcement, while others compete for crypto capital through favorable tax treatment. These approaches, however, create both opportunities and challenges for crypto investors, who may increasingly start to consider tax implications when choosing where to trade or establish residency.

2025-07-07T12:48:03,"Here’s How High XRP Will Go in 2025, According to 4 Top AI Tools","With XRP still stuck below major resistance and investor sentiment split, one researcher turned to artificial intelligence for a fresh perspective on XRP price prospects in 2025. Instead of relying on traditional analysts, leading AI tools, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok, were asked to predict how high XRP could climb by the end of 2025. While their responses leaned bullish, they came with conditions. Crypto Researcher Ripple Van Winkle called attention to the responses in a post on X.ChatGPT XRP Price PredictionSpecifically, ChatGPT presented three distinct scenarios depending on how events unfold for Ripple. In a conservative estimate, it predicts XRP will climb back to $3.80, matching its previous all-time high from 2018. A more moderate forecast predicts the token will be between $5 and $6, assuming Ripple secures key partnerships and continues to experience adoption. However, in the most aggressive scenario, XRP could rise as high as $10 to $15 if everything breaks in its favor.Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok Weigh InInterestingly, both Gemini and Perplexity provided similar outlooks, projecting XRP in the $5 to $10 range. Nonetheless, they emphasized that such growth is only possible if Ripple’s legal troubles are resolved and if an XRP spot ETF enters the market. It bears mentioning that Ripple and the SEC have already decided to drop the case, pending court approval.Meanwhile, Grok, the AI developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, was more cautious. It projected a lower range between $1.80 and $5.81, with its most likely scenario falling between $3 and $4.50.https://twitter.com/RipBullWinkle/status/1941856566967201816Key Drivers Behind the PredictionsThe AIs identified three main forces that could push XRP higher this year. First is the outcome of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Both parties have agreed to dismiss their appeal. What's pending is the official settlement announcement. Market watchers believe this development could unlock institutional interest. Second is adoption, in terms of new partnerships and broader use of XRP in cross-border payment systems. Ripple has continued to pursue new alliances and acquisitions, which many believe will benefit XRP. Finally, the AI tools noted that the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the United States could serve as a major catalyst for the XRP price. This is because it would attract both retail and institutional capital. ETF inflows played a significant role in propelling Bitcoin's price in 2024.Bitcoin Influence on the Broader MarketAnother common theme across the AI predictions is the importance of Bitcoin’s trajectory. The chatbots noted that a strong post-halving bull run, combined with clearer pro-crypto U.S. policies, could lift the entire market, including XRP. In other words, XRP’s success will not exist in isolation but as part of a larger shift in market sentiment.While the outlooks were generally optimistic, all four AIs included a disclaimer that the projections were not financial advice. Specifically, they encouraged investors to do their research and remain cautious, even in the face of promising forecasts.

Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 48.47% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

With RSI at 48.76 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-07T12:36:02,"Crypto Price Prediction 2025: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, LINK, AVAX, ARB, DOT, SOL","The cryptocurrency scene is developing as 2025 approaches, moving from institutional adoption to decentralized innovation. Market sentiment was improved by the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and ongoing spot-ETF inflows as retail investors continue to show interest in the crypto sector. With scaling, improvements, and staking mechanisms that are expected to propel it toward $7K–$10K, Ethereum maintains its leadership, aligning with many bullish crypto price predictions for 2025 that analysts are sharing. Table of Contents 1. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2. Ethereum (ETH) price prediction 3. Binance Coin (BNB) price prediction 4. Cardano (ADA) price prediction 5. Chainlink (LINK) price prediction 6. Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction 7. Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction 8. Polkadot (DOT) price prediction 9. Solana (SOL) price prediction The big picture Meanwhile, the distinctive stories of top-cap altcoins like Binance Coin, Cardano, Chainlink, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polkadot, and Solana—token burning, Layer-2 scale, interoperable networks, and real-world utility—are drawing in investors. In addition to highlighting important technical levels and offering chart insights for nine major cryptocurrencies, this article describes bullish and bearish scenarios as well, which will help you set your crypto expectations the right way in 2025. Now, let’s dive into the crypto price predictions of 2025 for some of the top cryptocurrencies. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction BTC 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish Scenario If ETF inflows and governmental adoption trends (such as the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve) continue to grow, Bitcoin ( BTC ) may reach $143K. As Bitcoin establishes itself as digital gold, institutional investors might increase demand, particularly if macroeconomic conditions continue to be inflationary. Bearish scenario If regulatory concerns or a worldwide economic collapse prevent Bitcoin from holding the $100K psychological barrier, it may retrace to $85K to $90K, hitting earlier all-time highs as support. Key Levels Support: $100K, $92K Resistance: $114K, $143K You might also like: Over $1b flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as macro sentiment improves 2. Ethereum (ETH) price prediction ETH 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Ethereum ( ETH ) may rise to $7K to $10K if it can scale through Layer-2 solutions and its staking enhancements work as planned. Approval of a spot ETH ETF would only hasten this trend. Bearish scenario ETH may stall between $2.5K and $3K if network congestion or scaling delays continue, with a $2K downside risk, with some crypto price predicitons for 2025 also aiming for $1800. Key Levels Support: $2.2K, $2.5K Resistance: $3.2K, $5K, $10K 3. Binance Coin (BNB) price prediction BNB 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario BNB ( B NB) cryptocurrency prediction for 2025 suggests that the token might reach $800–$1,000 if token burning continues, DEX adoption increases, and ecosystem resilience persists in the face of regulatory setbacks. Bearish scenario BNB may decline to $500–$600 as a result of ongoing regulatory concerns or a decline in exchange volume. Key Levels Support: $610, $550 Resistance: $693, $800, $1,000 4. Cardano (ADA) price prediction Cardano 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Crypto forecast 2025 for Cardano ( ADA ) suggests that the token may aim for $1.50 to $2.00 if enterprise integration and smart contract adoption pick up speed. Long-term investors continue to be drawn to its emphasis on scalability and academic rigor. Bearish scenario ADA may remain constrained in the $0.40–$0.70 range due to slow growth in the dApp ecosystem. Key Levels Support: $0.56, $0.68 Resistance: $1.23, $1.50 5. Chainlink (LINK) price prediction Chainlink 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario As demand for oracles in DeFi and real-world assets (RWAs) grows, Chainlink ( LINK ) could rally to $44–$50. Chainlink’s CCIP and partnerships with institutions are major catalysts. Bearish Scenario A shrinking DeFi sector could stall LINK’s growth, causing it to linger around $20–$25. Key Levels Support: $25, $20 Resistance: $36, $44 6. Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction Avax 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Avalanche ( AVAX ) is perfect for institutional and enterprise use cases because of its subnet design. An increase to $90–$100 is probable as adoption increases. Bearish scenario L1 competition or slowed developer activity may cause it to return to $20–$28. Key Levels Support: $20, $28 Resistance: $36, $90 7. Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction Arbitrum 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario If usage metrics and governance acceptance increase, the cryptocurrency outlook for Arbitrum ( ARB ), which has one of the highest TVLs among Layer-2s, might rise to $2.00 to $2.50. Bearish scenario If overall usage declines or other L2s do better, ARB may return to $0.75–$1.00. Key Levels Support: $0.80, $1.00 Resistance: $1.50, $2.00 8. Polkadot (DOT) price prediction DOT 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario Polkadot ( DOT ) may reach $15–$20 due to cross-chain use cases, XCM enhancements, and parachain auctions. Bearish scenario The potential could be limited by weak user uptake, which would keep it below $10 and perhaps return to $5–$6. Key Levels Support: $6, $5 Resistance: $9, $15 9. Solana (SOL) price prediction SOL 1d chart – crypto.news Bullish scenario With sustained network stability, Solana’s ( SOL ) rapid ecosystem growth—particularly in NFTs and gaming—could propel it past $200, and perhaps as high as $300. Bearish scenario In the event of another interruption or exploit, SOL might go back to $140–$160. Key Levels Support: $160, $140 Resistance: $185, $220, $300 The big picture In 2025, cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more incorporated into larger financial markets in response to institutional attitudes and macroeconomic trends: Inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs: A total of over $250 billion has entered these funds, stabilizing volatility and creating analogies to gold in conventional portfolios. By using confiscated Bitcoin to increase legitimacy, the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve project , which was established by executive order on March 6, 2025, has a favorable impact on Bitcoin’s role in sovereign asset allocation. Fed Policy & Inflation Outlook: Risk assets are favored by anticipated interest rate reductions and moderate inflation; Bitcoin and Ethereum have outpaced the S&P 500 in 2025 YTD (15% vs. 5%), capitalizing on this trend. Altseason Trigger: In the past, rallies in high-growth L1/L2 coins have been preceded by sustained BTC strength. Spiking BTC supremacy usually signals bullish runs in tokens such as DOT, AVAX, ARB, and LINK. To put it briefly, macro support—easing rates, positive U.S. policy, and ETF flows—is driving up cryptocurrency assets. This tendency might be reversed, though, by any change in Fed instructions, regulatory actions, or global unrest. You might also like: Analysis: Bitcoin could reach $120K in July amid BTC market maturity 1. What is the potential 2025 price of Bitcoin? Analysts’ salaries vary greatly, ranging from $120,000 to $200K, based on economic circumstances, ETF volume, and the halving cycle. While cautious models concentrate on $120K to $150K, Galaxy Digital and VanEck anticipate highs of $180K to $200K. However, it should be noted that not all 2025 crypto predictions may be true for Bitcoin, and you should do your research before investing in any token. 2. By the end of 2025, will Ethereum reach $10,000? According to top projections, $6K is fair during a bull market, with potential upside to $10K assuming both ETFs and Layer 2 provide steady capital flows. More affordable models have an ETH cap of $4.5K to $5.2K. However, long-term cryptocurrency predictions are dependent on macroeconomic events, so do your research before investing in any cryptocurrency. 3. What motivates altcoins like as ARB, DOT, and AVAX? TVL, development activity, governance updates, and cross-chain integrations are among the on-chain factors that have a significant impact on these tokens. The factors that drive upside—or lack thereof—are the expansion of TVL on Arbitrum, Polkadot’s parachain victories, and the use of Avalanche and Chainlink by enterprises.

2025-07-07T12:34:32,"BRICS, Fed, tariffs, and earnings: Market reports to watch this week","Markets are running high with record closes across the S&P and Nasdaq, but investors might have to wait. The week ahead is fully dominated by a mix of geopolitics, Federal Reserve policy signals, high-stakes trade decisions from the Trump administration, and corporate earnings. Investors are eyeing a packed agenda that includes Monday’s BRICS Summit, Amazon’s extended four-day Prime Day starting Tuesday, and two key macro moments on Wednesday. The week also features the release of the Fed’s June meeting minutes and the expiration of the 90-day moratorium on Trump’s “ Liberation Day ” tariffs. The Federal Reserve will dominate this week’s market agenda On Monday, BRICS leaders gather for a highly anticipated summit that could further solidify the bloc’s alternative financial ambitions. Their alignment may be exactly what US President Donald Trump is targeting. The upcoming tariff deadline is drawing particular scrutiny, and Trump is expected to finalize a new round of “reciprocal” duties by July 9. The implementation is set for August 1. While trade deals have been announced with the US, Vietnam, and China, several countries remain at risk. On Sunday, Trump threatened 10% extra tariffs on countries “aligned with anti-American BRICS policies”. Tuesday will see US Consumer Credit Data Insight into household debt and spending habits. This is a key signal for recession risk . On the other hand, Amazon’s Prime Day will also serve as a consumer sentiment litmus test. With this year’s event extended to four days, the retail giant is hoping to build on last year’s record-setting sales. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s June minutes will offer fresh insight into policymakers’ views as markets continue to recalibrate interest rate cuts. Last week’s US employment data revealed stronger-than-expected job growth in June. Meanwhile, private sector hiring was the weakest in eight months, and the average workweek shrank. This suggests that labor market momentum may be losing steam. Thursday’s US jobless claims and Tuesday’s consumer credit figures could influence sentiment. Europe flat ahead of tariff risks Equities surged last week as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs . S&P 500 stood at 6,279.35 while Nasdaq maintained 20,601. The Dow is hovering near its peak, still, analysts warn that the rally is increasingly fragile. However, European markets were muted Monday as investors braced for trade shockwaves from a looming tariff blitz. The STOXX 600 held flat at 541.15, with regional indexes split: Germany’s DAX edged higher, while the CAC 40, IBEX, and FTSE dipped slightly in early trading. Meanwhile, the US dollar remains under pressure near multi-year lows, with FX markets particularly sensitive to any trade headlines. Risk-sensitive currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars have already dipped ahead of central bank decisions in those countries this week. The global digital assets market surged marginally to remain above the $3.36 trillion cap mark. Its 24-hour trading volume is at $92 billion. The biggest crypto , Bitcoin, is up by 3% over the last 30 days and is trading at an average price of $108,615 at press time. The largest altcoin, Ethereum, price posted a jump of more than 4% over the last 7 days. ETH is trading at an average price of $2,562 at press time. The biggest meme coin, Dogecoin, saw a jump of 3% in the last 24 hours after recording a decline of 8% over the past 30 days.

2025-07-07T12:30:57,"Bitcoin First: Musk’s Political Party, Crypto Push Shakes Up Washington","Elon Musk has stirred up Washington by announcing that his yet‑to‑be‑registered “The American Party” will back Bitcoin . His move comes as he takes aim at what he calls wasteful government spending and vows to shake up the status quo. Musk’s short statement—that “fiat is hopeless”—has already sent ripples through both political and crypto circles. Musk Launches Political Bid According to Musk’s recent tweet, his new centrist party will start by fielding candidates for the US Senate and House. He’s on record saying he won’t jump straight to a White House run. Instead, he plans to build out support at the state level first. This measured approach reflects the massive effort needed to get on ballots: most states demand tens of thousands of signatures for each race. Musk will need a ground game rivaling established parties. Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Bitcoin Figures Front And Center Based on reports , Musk isn’t just talking the talk. Two of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, hold a combined 19,794 BTC—11,509 at Tesla and 8,285 at SpaceX. That stash is worth about $2.1 billion at current prices. He’s also said he personally holds Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin . By tying his political project to Bitcoin, Musk is likely appealing to the same audience that powered US President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign on crypto buzz. The price of Bitcoin has barely budged on the news. The coin sits at $108,772, showing no clear spike or dip. Traders seem to view this more as another Musk headline than a sign of concrete policy change. Volatility has hit 30 % swings in recent months, so any real plan to take campaign funds or taxes in Bitcoin would face tough questions about price swings. Regulatory And Logistical Hurdles Based on public filings, no “Department of Government Efficiency” exists—Musk’s DOGE jibe is just a nod to Dogecoin fans. Actual agencies like the IRS and SEC would need to weigh in if a political party tried to use Bitcoin for donations or payments. US campaign finance laws cap donations and demand strict reporting. Converting crypto to cash quickly, especially during sell‑offs, could trigger accounting nightmares. Getting on ballots is another mountain. Each state has unique rules on deadlines, forms and signature thresholds. Some require petitions submitted more than a year before an election. Musk will have to hire or mobilize coordinate teams to track hundreds of deadlines. Failure in just one key state could keep him off that state’s ballot entirely. The real test will come if Musk files party paperwork and publishes a plan for handling crypto volatility and compliance.

In June 2021, BBVA Switzerland pioneered the bank’s cryptocurrency offerings by introducing Bitcoin custody and trading services for private banking clientele Spain's BBVA, with $782 billion of total assets, is launching a #bitcoin trading service for private clients in Switzerland, due to ""significant desire"" among investors. — Documenting ₿itcoin (@DocumentingBTC) June 18, 2021 The Swiss division has since diversified its cryptocurrency portfolio to encompass Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and AVAX, successfully attracting both institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Recent reports from June 18 indicate that BBVA has been recommending portfolio allocations of 3% to 7% in cryptocurrencies for its affluent clients. Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, indicated that the bank currently advises clients to focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum investments , with plans to introduce additional cryptocurrencies later this year. “ A 3% portfolio allocation to cryptocurrency represents manageable risk exposure ,” Meyer explained. “ In a balanced portfolio structure, introducing 3% cryptocurrency allocation can enhance overall performance. “ Expanding Stablecoin Services See 9% of Spaniards Own Crypto, While 95% of EU Banks Stay Away Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, BBVA has incorporated USDC stablecoin services into its offerings. In September 2024, the bank extended its cryptocurrency custody and trading capabilities to include USD Coin for institutional and private banking clients in Switzerland. This expansion enables clients to trade, hold, or convert USDC into euros, dollars, or other currencies with near-instantaneous execution. The bank noted that investment fund managers and large corporations frequently utilize stablecoins like USDC to accelerate transactions across various cryptocurrency exchanges. Additionally, stablecoins serve as a hedge against cryptocurrency volatility by allowing investors to preserve asset value during market fluctuations. Despite approximately 95% of EU banks avoiding cryptocurrency services due to the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) cautious regulatory stance, Spain’s cryptocurrency market has demonstrated substantial growth. Europe's crypto regulation will be its biggest mistake since the dotcom era: – EU imposing MiCA – US embracing crypto – Major players leaving EU – $499B+ in crypto flowing through Eastern Europe Is crypto's future in Europe doomed? Here's the full breakdown: pic.twitter.com/mZIi79cru3 — Alessandro Palombo (@thealepalombo) December 16, 2024 A 2024 European Central Bank survey, published in January 2025, revealed that nearly 9% of Spanish citizens now hold digital assets , representing more than double the figure from 2022. Spain’s cryptocurrency adoption rate now equals that of France and Croatia within the Eurozone, though it remains below Slovenia’s 15% adoption rate and Greece’s 14% ownership levels. Between 2023 and 2024 alone, Spain received over $80 billion worth of cryptocurrency, making it the 5th largest European country with the most crypto value received. Source: Chainalysis Spain’s 28% Crypto Tax: The Hidden Cost of Digital Assets Despite growing adoption, Spain has tight tax regulations on crypto. The Spanish cryptocurrency taxation follows specific guidelines established by the Spanish State Agency for Tax Administration (AEAT). Spanish residents are required to declare gains from cryptocurrency transactions and income generated from digital asset holdings or related activities.

2025-07-07T12:17:43,"Market Strategist Sets Timeline for $10 Trillion XRP Market Cap","A bold forecast from prominent X user and market strategist 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 is shaking up conversations across the crypto space: XRP could reach a $10 trillion market capitalization by 2030. According to the strategist, the future of finance isn’t about outdated comparisons to traditional systems; it’s about real utility at a scale the world has never seen before. XRP and the Rise of Utility-Based Valuation 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 argues that market participants must stop comparing crypto valuations to legacy systems that are quickly becoming obsolete. In his view, XRP isn’t just another digital asset; it’s a critical infrastructure layer for a new financial system , powering real-time, borderless payments. This vision is anchored in Ripple’s long-standing goal to build the Internet of Value, where money moves as quickly and seamlessly as data does today. Unlike many crypto assets that rely heavily on speculation, XRP has a clear utility: it serves as a bridge currency for fast, cost-effective cross-border settlements. This makes it uniquely positioned to address global liquidity demands, particularly as financial institutions and governments explore blockchain-based payment rails. XRP will hit a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Stop comparing market caps to old systems. This is utility-driven value on a scale humanity’s never seen. Bitcoin sits at $2T for just existing. Tell me… what problem is it solving today? Where’s the real utility? Or is it just… — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) July 6, 2025 Questioning Bitcoin’s Real-world Utility In making his case, 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 draws a sharp contrast between XRP and Bitcoin. He notes that Bitcoin commands a $2 trillion market cap essentially for existing, despite lacking direct utility in solving modern financial inefficiencies. “Tell me… what problem is it solving today?” he asks. While Bitcoin is often touted as digital gold, it is slow, expensive, and energy-intensive, limiting its functionality in daily finance or institutional operations. XRP, on the other hand, is already integrated into RippleNet and the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, which enables instant settlement between fiat currencies using XRP as a bridge. Its recent advancements, including the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, are only strengthening its real-world value proposition. Legal Clarity and Institutional Confidence Another key advantage of XRP is regulatory certainty. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when traded on secondary markets , removing a major cloud of uncertainty. This landmark decision gave Ripple the green light to scale its operations globally and attract institutional interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 With increasing partnerships across the banking sector, support for CBDC infrastructure, and expanding corridors for cross-border payments, XRP’s foundational role in future financial systems is becoming harder to ignore. A $10 Trillion Reality? While a $10 trillion market cap may seem ambitious through today’s lens , 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 urges the market to reconsider what’s possible when global finance becomes tokenized. The Internet of Value isn’t just a theory; it’s already unfolding. If XRP becomes the backbone of that system, its valuation will reflect global demand for fast, neutral, and scalable settlement infrastructure. The message is clear: the future of finance belongs to utility, and XRP may just be the asset leading the charge.

These massive daily releases are creating significant sell pressure in the market. As more tokens flood into circulation, volatility is expected to rise. Pioneers should stay alert and closely monitor price movements. July 7, 2025 12:21:59 UTC Is Pi Network at Risk of a Decline? Pi Network is hovering around $0.477, but storm clouds may be forming. With over 300 million tokens set to unlock next month, sell pressure could spike. If Pi fails to hold the $0.477 level, it risks dropping back to its previous bottom near $0.40. Investors should watch this key support zone closely. July 7, 2025 12:19:36 UTC Pi Network Price in India The current Pi Network (PI) price on July 7, 2025, is around ₹39.82–₹41.07 per coin. The 24-hour trading volume is approximately $80–92 million, showing strong interest and liquidity. PI’s market cap stands near $3.5 billion. The coin saw a 4% price rise today, but remains volatile. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Ecosystem Expands Rapidly with Over 10,000 Apps The Pi Network ecosystem is witnessing rapid growth, with the number of applications reaching 10,580 as of July 7. This surge highlights increasing developer interest and user adoption. Meanwhile, global banks and financial institutions are accelerating their integration into the Pi ecosystem. With its expanding Web3 infrastructure, Pi is steadily positioning itself as a global decentralized network. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Price Faces Critical Phase Pi Network may be entering its most dangerous phase yet. Despite bullish news like AI partnerships and new apps, $Pi’s price remains stagnant. A massive 276 million token unlock this July could trigger $127M in sell pressure. The core team’s silence, stalled KYC, and falling on-chain activity are alarming. With top influencers quiet and community engagement dropping, trust is fading fast. While Bitcoin and Ethereum soar, Pi continues to lag. These aren’t just slowdowns they may signal a deeper crisis. Pioneers should prepare wisely and not rely on blind faith as pressure builds.

A few whispers in Telegram groups. A couple of tweets on X. Then suddenly, it’s everywhere. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another presale buzz. It’s a storm pulling investors from every direction, including those who’ve been holding Ripple for years hoping for that “next breakout.” With a surprise price rollback announced just weeks before exchange launch, BTC-S may have just handed the market a second shot at Bitcoin-level wealth building. Ripple’s Steady Pace Meets a New Challenger Ripple has held its place as a reliable project with strong enterprise connections. XRP’s use case in cross-border payments is known and respected, and its legal clarity in the U.S. offers some peace of mind to long-term holders. But here’s the thing. Growth has been slow, the token’s movement often stagnant, and while the tech is solid, it lacks the explosive upside some investors are chasing in this new cycle. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris comes in, offering not just high performance but the rare blend of utility and opportunity. It’s not about abandoning Ripple. It’s about exploring what BTC-S is doing right, right now. BTC-S Is Built for Speed, Scale, and Wealth Creation What sets Bitcoin Solaris apart isn’t just the hype. It’s the infrastructure under the hood. BTC-S combines Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake in a dual-layer blockchain that hits 10,000 transactions per second with finality in 2 seconds. This hybrid architecture offers the best of both worlds: security and scalability. And the development pace? Unmatched. According to the latest update: The smart contract layer is optimized for fast, DeFi-compatible execution. A dynamic validator rotation system keeps the network fair and decentralized. Energy use is cut by 99.95 percent compared to traditional mining chains. The cross-chain bridge is nearly complete, unlocking asset interoperability. The upcoming Solaris Nova app introduces intuitive, mobile-first mining. And it’s not just hype from forums. Influencers like Token Galaxy have covered why Bitcoin Solaris is attracting serious attention from new and seasoned investors alike in this detailed review . The Mining Revolution and Income Opportunity While some blockchains limit mining to heavy hardware users, BTC-S flips that model. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova app, everyday users can mine from their smartphones. This approach makes passive crypto income possible for anyone, regardless of technical skill or budget. A visit to the official BTC-S mining calculator shows that even modest participation could become highly lucrative once the token hits centralized exchanges. No GPU needed. No warehouse. Just your phone and some spare time. This Presale Comes With a Twist: A Rare Rollback Event We’re now in Phase 11 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale. The price is locked at $11 per token, and the launch price is expected to hit $20, representing a potential 150 percent return. Over $6.3 million has already been raised, and the community has grown to more than 13,900 unique buyers. This alone would be impressive, but then came the twist. Not Just Scalable Designed to Be Unstoppable That’s BTC-S For a very limited time, Bitcoin Solaris has announced a price rollback. Yes, rollback. The token, currently priced at $11, is being offered temporarily at just $5. That’s right. Less than half of the current value. The kind of entry point early Bitcoin investors brag about today. Add to that: It’s one of the shortest presales in crypto history. Less than 4 weeks remain until the exchange listing on July 31. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask . Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. They are not required to buy. Full Transparency and Bulletproof Credibility If you’re wondering whether it’s safe to dive in, the answer is in the details. Bitcoin Solaris has already passed a thorough audit by Cyberscope and an additional audit from Freshcoins . Community engagement is strong and growing across social platforms, especially in their Telegram and on X , where daily updates keep the transparency levels high. Roadmap Momentum Signals Long-Term Strength BTC-S isn’t stopping at launch. The roadmap is detailed and ambitious, giving a glimpse into years of planned expansion. Some of the key stages include: Q3 2026: Full mainnet launch with AI-enhanced features and the Solaris Nova app going live. Q4 2026: Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain capabilities. Q1–Q2 2027: Quantum-resistant security upgrades and layer-2 scaling. Beyond 2028: Global partnerships and community governance expansion. Each phase is documented in the live Bitcoin Solaris roadmap , reflecting a real plan, not just promises. Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris is not just trending. It’s transforming how investors think about wealth creation in crypto. With the presale ending soon and a rare price rollback offering tokens at only $5, the entry point has never looked more like a second chance at catching a Bitcoin-level ride before the next big exchange pump. If Ripple was the old guard, Bitcoin Solaris may be the new playbook.

In the past seven days, ETH has gained over 4.5% , and in just the last 24 hours, it’s jumped more than 2.3% . Now, whale activity and exchange data suggest something bigger may be coming. Ethereum Whales Make Bold Moves According to on-chain reports , a major Ethereum whale has withdrawn 6,989 ETH (worth around $17.5 million) from Binance over the past three weeks. Just recently, the same wallet removed 1,900 ETH, valued at nearly $4.86 million, from the exchange.This kind of large-scale withdrawal reduces exchange liquidity, and if demand surges while supply dips, it could lead to a supply shock—a classic recipe for a price rally. Ethereum Exchange Reserve Drops The latest data shows that Ethereum exchange reserves are steadily falling: Total exchange reserve now : 18,962,692 ETH On May 1 : 19,576,503 ETH Binance ETH reserve : 4,947,990 ETH This drop suggests more ETH is being moved to cold wallets or DeFi platforms—an indicator of long-term holding sentiment among investors. Ethereum Price Performance: Steady Climb ETH price on July 1 : $2,405.08 ETH price now : $2,562.97 7-day growth : 4.5% 24-hour surge : 2.3% For weeks, ETH has been consolidating between $2,400 and $2,700.

The neutral RSI means ETH still has room to grow without entering overbought territory. What’s Next for Ethereum? If the current whale accumulation trend continues and ETH breaks above $2,700, analysts expect a move toward $3,000 and possibly beyond. A shrinking exchange supply and bullish technicals could fuel that breakout.

2025-07-07T11:48:24,"Solana (SOL) Set for Major Surge Against Bitcoin (BTC): Price Analysis","The Solana (SOL) price has been in the doldrums for quite some time now. However, with Bitcoin (BTC) looking as though it may be about to put on a surge out of its bull flag, $SOL is ready to not just match this, but to outperform $BTC over these next few weeks. (SOL/USDT) breakout in favour of $SOL Source: TradingView Starting off with $SOL against its $USDT pair on the weekly time frame, it can be seen that the price has broken out of the descending wedge and is consolidating above the breakout. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is showing a cross back up of the indicator lines which should signal a rise in the $SOL price. If the bulls can get the price beyond the $158 horizontal resistance level this could help to propel it to $180 and a higher high just beyond this. W bottoming pattern could help propel $SOL to higher high against $BTC Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $SOL against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC) reveals that $SOL has confirmed the breakout of the descending trendline, which has been in $BTC’s favour since mid-January 2025. As can be noted in the chart, a W bottoming pattern has formed which could help to propel $SOL back above the big triangle pattern. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI shows a cross back up of the indicator lines - another signal that $SOL is about to start outperforming $BTC. The same thing could be about to happen in favour of $SOL in the 2-week chart, with the indicator lines right at the bottom, with therefore a lot more room and time to move upwards. (SOL/ETH) pair about to move in favour of $SOL Source: TradingView Not only is $SOL about to outperform $BTC, but it should start outperforming $ETH as well. The ascending channel in the 2-week chart above is not a bullish pattern as such, but if the $SOL bulls can manage to get the price back into the channel, a swing back to the top of this channel could be expected to take place, which could result in a 60% gain for $SOL over $ETH. The support belt that the price is currently resting on is also perfect for a bounce back to the upside from $SOL.

2025-07-07T11:48:09,"Experienced Analyst Says ""A Big Rise Is Coming in Altcoins Even by the End of 2023"", Announces His Bitcoin Price Prediction!","Famous cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe claimed in his assessments on social media that a major rise is on the horizon in the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. According to Van de Poppe, the market is preparing for a bigger rally by the end of 2023. Van de Poppe said, “The Altcoin Season Index shows that a massive altcoin season is about to begin. Over the last 5 years, this index has bottomed every summer, especially in June. “Then we saw a strong rally in altcoins in the second half of the year,” he said. According to the analyst, we are currently in the middle of a bull market and global quantitative easing (QE) policies are expected to ease. According to the analyst, this could be a sign of a much bigger movement in the last quarter of 2023. Van de Poppe also made the following striking predictions for the Bitcoin price: Bitcoin in Q3: $150,000 Bitcoin in the fourth quarter: $250,000 The analyst also argued that the volatility in Bitcoin has decreased significantly, which is a sign of a major price movement. He noted that the M2 money supply is already increasing rapidly, and the possibility of an interest rate cut is quite close. Drawing attention to the valuations of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe said, “Due to macroeconomic conditions, the values of altcoins against BTC are at rock bottom. This shows that we are in the depression phase of the cycle. After this phase, the bull phase will begin.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T11:45:43,"Three-Year Bull Market for One Stock Sector Just Getting Started, According to Investor Dan Ives","Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives says that a three-year bull market for the one stock market sector is just in its initial phase. In a new interview with CNBC Television, Ives says that tech stocks will continue to surge as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution keeps moving along. “I think we’re just beginning this golden age for tech. And the reason I think tech stocks are up 10 to 15% in the second half of the year is because the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI, they’re just starting to play out. I mean, when you look across software, you look across semis, you look across the consumer report. And to me, that’s really the focus here – is that as the AI revolution plays out, that’s how I think you get to Nasdaq 22,000 or 23,000.” Ives goes on to note that he views price dips along the way up not as risky scenarios that should be avoided, but rather as opportunities for traders to get in the game. “I view those as opportunities. I mean my whole career, those are the opportunities, if you think the fundamental stories are playing out. And I think when it comes to tech, this is just starting. I think it’s a three-year tech bull market still ahead of us.” The Nasdaq Composite is at 20,601 points at time of writing, a 1.02% increase during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-07T11:30:18,"XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts","XRP’s market dominance may be on the verge of a historic breakout, with analyst Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) suggesting the token could command as much as 30% of the entire crypto market cap in this cycle—representing a fivefold surge from current levels. 30% XRP Dominance? The bold projection stems from an emerging bullish structure on the XRP dominance chart, reinforced by a key technical signal: the three-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken its multi-year downtrend for the first time since XRP’s last local highs. This shift, visible on the attached chart, signals a significant change in market dynamics, potentially marking the beginning of a new accumulation-driven expansion. The analyst argues that XRP dominance has completed a textbook Wyckoff accumulation pattern. “We’ve pretty much completed a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, and I would argue we’re nearing the end of Phase D and about to enter Phase E,” they noted. According to the Wyckoff method, Phase E represents the breakout phase, where assets typically enter strong markup periods after prolonged accumulation. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen This interpretation is supported by a side-by-side comparison of the theoretical Wyckoff schematic overlaid directly on XRP dominance price action. The analyst specifically points to the recent “Last Point of Support” (LPS) as confirmation that XRP is transitioning toward breakout territory, having already completed the “Spring” phase—a final shakeout that traps late sellers before a sustained rally. “If that’s correct, we should see significant upside in XRP dominance,” the analyst continued, adding that the signal is particularly meaningful when viewed on the three-day timeframe, which filters out short-term noise and emphasizes broader cyclical trends. In terms of concrete targets, the analyst acknowledges that consensus among market participants remains modest, with many expecting a peak in XRP dominance around 14%. However, CryptoInsightUK argues this is a gross underestimation of potential upside in the event that XRP reclaims narrative leadership in the crypto space. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $9 In Euphoric Fifth Wave, Elliott Wave Analyst Predicts “I believe we could push as high as 20%. There’s even a possibility we reach broader capital inflows accompanying a Bitcoin breakout to new all-time highs. Many are calling for a top around 14% dominance, but I believe we could push as high as 20%,” the analyst wrote. “There’s even a possibility we reach 30%, though I’m personally targeting the 20% zone, which would represent a 5x increase in dominance from current levels.” XRP’s current market dominance sits below 6%, making the analyst’s 20–30% target not just ambitious but transformative. It would mark the first time since the early XRP rally days in 2017 that XRP commanded such a share of the crypto market. The broader context driving this thesis is the possibility of a liquidity-driven crypto cycle, catalyzed by Bitcoin achieving new highs and investor capital rotating into alternative assets. “If this coincides with Bitcoin breaking out to new all-time highs and broader capital flowing into the market, I believe we could witness a major price expansion for XRP—one that few are currently expecting,” the analyst added. At press time, XRP traded at $2.28.

2025-07-07T11:30:14,"Tariff Deadline Nears— Will it Renew Trade Tensions or be the Catalyst for Crypto Bull Run?","The post Tariff Deadline Nears— Will it Renew Trade Tensions or be the Catalyst for Crypto Bull Run? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The financial world is bracing for a pivotal moment on July 09, 2025, when the US’s temporary suspension of its new tariff regime expires. Initially dubbed ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump, carry implications far beyond traditional trade routes. Soon after the announcement, the crypto markets and the traditional markets were disrupted, causing a major drop. Now that the deadline is approaching, the question arises whether this deadline will reignite a global tariff war or it could unexpectedly serve as a bullish catalyst for the crypto market and Bitcoin price . Understanding the July 09 Deadline The July 09 deadline marks the end of a 90-day suspension on sweeping tariffs proposed by the US earlier in 2025. These tariffs were designed to punish countries with persistent trade imbalances or those seen as having unfair trade practices. The US government offered temporary relief in April, giving trade partners time to negotiate deals or face new levies. If the agreement is not reached by the deadline, the full weight of tariffs could take effect by early August, sparking fears of renewed global trade conflict. Market Sentiment: Calm Before the Storm? Interestingly, traditional markets have remained relatively stable in the lead-up to the July 09 deadline. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ have both shown resilience, while the U.S.Dollar Index (DXY) has slipped over 6% since April, which is believed to be the worst start to a year since 1973. Some analysts believe much of the tariff uncertainty is already priced into equities, though volatility is expected to spike if no trade resolutions are announced. Moreover, the safe-haven asset, Gold, has seen a rise in inflows, indicating that investors are preparing for a potential geopolitical fallout. Crypto Markets Reacting Ahead of Time Unlike traditional markets, the crypto markets appear to be thriving in this ocean of uncertainty. Bitcoin price has surged past $108,500, while Ethereum & other altcoins have posted significant gains. Several factors contribute to this bullish sentiment, including a weaker USD, decentralised hedge and rising market confidence. Therefore, the crypto markets are expected to face a short-term pullback if tensions escalate or if the countries reach out to make a deal, then the Bitcoin price is expected to experience a significant bullish push. Scenario Analysis: Three Possible Outcomes Firstly, if the US resumes tariffs without any new deals, global trade could deteriorate rapidly, stocks may plunge, inflation could spike, and crypto may initially fall in a risk-off panic. Besides, if the deadline is extended, which is expected to be more likely, risk appetite could return across all sectors. Stocks & crypto may rise if traders see this as a sign of market-friendly policy. On the other hand, if a comprehensive resolution is reached, it could lead to bullish sentiment across global markets. This may even cause a breakout, propelling the Bitcoin price towards new highs. Wrapping it Up! The July 09 tariff deadline is more than just a bureaucratic market, representing a turning point for the global economy and the evolving crypto ecosystem. Whether it triggers a new trade war or serves as a launchpad for crypto depends entirely on how global leaders navigate these final hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/tariff-deadline-nears-will-it-renew-trade-tensions-or-be-the-catalyst-for-crypto-bull-run/,"MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T11:26:50,"Expert Says XRP Could Be About to Explode Past Its Biggest Wall. Here’s Why","XRP is approaching one of the most critical levels in its recent trading history, and analysts say the outcome could define the next phase of its market cycle. According to crypto researcher Ripple Van Winkle, a breakout past $2.33 could unleash a major rally, and institutional investors are already paying close attention. A Crucial Technical Breakout Zone At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.26, marking a 1.84% increase in the past 24 hours. The asset is now pressing up against the $2.33 resistance level, which perfectly aligns with the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a key technical indicator that often marks bullish reversals in long-term price trends. Top crypto analyst Steph has labeled $2.33 as the pivotal level for XRP . “Break it,” he said, “and bulls are eyeing $2.60 next.” This price region hasn’t been touched in months, and clearing it could set the stage for a swift move higher. BREAKING: XRP could be about to explode past its biggest wall in months. Almost no one is ready for what happens if $2.33 gets smashed. Here’s why the smart money is watching $XRP right now : — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) July 6, 2025 Ripple’s U.S. Banking License Ambition While technical indicators point to a possible breakout, there’s growing excitement around Ripple’s strategic push for a U.S. national banking charter . If approved, Ripple would become the first blockchain-based company to obtain such a license, granting it legitimacy and regulatory recognition that could massively benefit XRP’s adoption across the financial sector. This move would enable Ripple to offer banking services directly, bypassing intermediaries and strengthening XRP’s use case as a bridge asset between crypto and fiat ecosystems. XRP ETF Approval Odds Surge Another major catalyst is the rising possibility of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Ripple Van Winkle points out that Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to an approval, citing a more favorable regulatory climate and mounting pressure from major asset managers. An XRP ETF would represent a breakthrough for institutional involvement, offering traditional investors direct exposure to the asset through regulated financial products. If approved, this could bring billions in fresh capital into the XRP market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Chart Patterns Confirm Momentum From a technical standpoint, XRP/BTC has just broken out of a classic falling wedge pattern, a historically reliable bullish reversal signal. This formation suggests the downtrend has likely been exhausted and that buying momentum is beginning to build, especially as XRP strengthens against Bitcoin. This chart structure adds further weight to the case for an upward move, especially if $2.33 is breached in the coming days. Downside Risks and Key Support Levels Despite the bullish outlook, analysts caution that $2.33 remains a formidable barrier. If XRP fails to break through, strong support sits at $2.00, a level that has repeatedly held during pullbacks in recent months. However, with momentum across technical and fundamental fronts aligning, many believe XRP is on the verge of a breakout that could define the next major chapter of the crypto market. The Bottom Line Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. banking license, rising ETF approval odds, and powerful technical indicators are converging in real-time. Ripple Van Winkle and other experts say this may be XRP’s biggest breakout opportunity in months. If $2.33 is cleared, XRP could rapidly accelerate toward $2.60 and beyond, potentially leading the next wave of crypto gains. Few are prepared for what could come next. But the smart money is already watching—and waiting. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
