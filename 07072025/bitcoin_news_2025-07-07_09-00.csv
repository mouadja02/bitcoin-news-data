2025-07-07T06:58:15,"Hong Kong to limit the number of stablecoin licenses issued in 2025","Hong Kong may begin issuing stablecoin licenses before the end of 2025. Still, the number will likely remain in the “single digits,” according to Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury. As per the local newspaper Ming Pao , published Monday, Hui said the stablecoin licensing regime is expected to take effect in August. Authorities aim to issue limited licenses within the year, reflecting a cautious but proactive approach to digital asset oversight. Hui said they hope stablecoins can help tackle real-world economic challenges, especially cross-border payments. This is particularly relevant in regions with volatile local currencies or underdeveloped financial systems. He added that fiat-backed stablecoins could lower transaction costs and improve the efficiency of international payments. Hong Kong eyes regional dominance as stablecoin race heats up Initially, Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox and licensing plans targeted Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoins. However, there is growing industry interest in offshore yuan-pegged alternatives. Chinese tech giants JD.com and Ant Group are reportedly lobbying China’s central bank to greenlight such offerings, intensifying the regional stablecoin race . Hui emphasized that any stablecoin involving foreign currencies would require close coordination with relevant jurisdictions. While the current framework allows stablecoins backed by legal tender, regulators must weigh exchange rate impacts and systemic risks when foreign currencies are involved. The regulatory activity in Hong Kong is emerging as the popularity of stablecoins soars worldwide. In the US, a landmark regulatory bill to regulate stablecoins, the GENIUS Act , passed the Senate and is waiting for House review. President Donald Trump has feverishly backed rapid passage. At the same time, China’s central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, recognized that stablecoins and CBDCs have increasingly influenced global payment systems. Although things haven’t been that great for crypto in mainland China (where cryptocurrency trading and mining have been banned for some time now), Hong Kong has been making a name for itself as a crypto haven. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) opened a stablecoin sandbox, drawing key industry participants such as Standard Chartered, Animoca Brands, Hong Kong Telecommunications (HKT), JD Coinlink, and RD InnoTech. The city’s decision to license stablecoins shows its ambition to be a central figure in the future of digital payments across Asia and beyond. Hong Kong sets global standard with new stablecoin licensing law Just a few weeks ago, Hong Kong passed a new stablecoin bill, expanding its cryptocurrency licensing framework as global regulators increasingly move to oversee digital assets. Unlike highly volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world assets like fiat currencies or commodities, including gold. The new legislation targets fiat-referenced stablecoins and introduces a licensing mandate for issuers under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Under the new law, stablecoin issuers must meet a series of requirements, including maintaining full asset reserves and segregating client assets. The HKMA said the framework is designed to “enhance Hong Kong’s existing regulatory framework on virtual-asset (VA) activities, thereby fostering financial stability and encouraging financial innovation.” The authority added that further consultations would be held to finalize regulatory details. The government confirmed that the stablecoin regime is expected to take effect later this year, with a transitional period to help industry participants adapt. This legislation builds on Hong Kong’s 2023 rollout of a broader virtual asset licensing regime, which applies to crypto firms offering services to retail investors. Until recently, stablecoins were not covered under that framework. YeFeng Gong, Risk and Strategy Director at HashKey OTC, the trading division of licensed crypto platform HashKey Group, noted that Hong Kong’s new stablecoin policy sets a global benchmark by mandating full reserve backing, strict redemption guarantees, and HKMA oversight. He added that the policy provides institutional-level assurance for traders and strengthens Hong Kong’s position as a frontrunner in regulated digital finance.

2025-07-07T06:54:45,"Why WazirX Users Are Taking the Fight to the Singapore Court","The post Why WazirX Users Are Taking the Fight to the Singapore Court appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The battle over frozen crypto is heating up inside a Singapore courtroom, where WazirX users are demanding answers and their money back. In the High Court, frustrated users are standing up to Zettai, WazirX’s Singapore entity, claiming their unhacked Bitcoin, XRP, TRX, BNB, USDT, and even fiat balances have been wrongly frozen by Zettai, WazirX’s Singapore company. Now, an affidavit by Romy Johnson may become a big turning point for crypto rights. The Big Problem: Frozen Assets At the center of this fight is how Zettai grouped all user assets. According to Romy Johnson’s 40-page affidavit , these are: unhacked coins (Category A), fiat-like INR (Category B), and the hacked ETH/ERC-20 tokens (Category C). But under Singapore’s law, only real debts can be restructured, not user-owned assets held in trust. Users say Zettai crossed the line by using everyone’s coins to push a plan that doesn’t protect innocent holders. THREAD: Why WazirX Users Are Fighting Back in Singapore Court A 25-part breakdown of Romy Johnson’s 40-page affidavit representing “Category A” users whose unhacked crypto assets remain unjustly frozen by Zettai Pte Ltd. https://t.co/BVHshdbhq9 #WazirX #WazirXScam pic.twitter.com/fJkQKNTmQs — TOOFAAN (@TOOFAANARMY) July 6, 2025 The Hack That May Not Be a Hack Things get more confusing because the so-called hack might not even be real. Blockchain records show something odd: the stolen coins were moved using internal multisig wallets that needed multiple approvals. No clear sign of an outside attack has been shown so far. Therefore, this kills Zettai’s excuse that it was an outside hack. Meanwhile, users are now calling out Zettai for hiding key details. They want the names of people who approved these transfers. They also want an audit to check where all the coins went and who should be held responsible. Where the Court Fight Stands Now Singapore’s High Court already rejected Zettai’s first scheme because it hid links to an offshore shell company. Now, Romy Johnson’s affidavit shows this is not just about one exchange. He cites major court cases proving that crypto held in trust belongs to the users, even during bankruptcy. However, the next hearing in WazirX’s ongoing case has now been rescheduled for July 15, 2025 . Will WazirX Return the Money? At the heart of it, this is about protecting user funds. Meanwhile, Zettai claims it will repay users once the new plan is approved. But trust is low.

2025-07-07T06:53:02,"If Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $180,000, These 3 Meme Coins Could Go Parabolic, Expect Big Gains By Year-End","The post If Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $180,000, These 3 Meme Coins Could Go Parabolic, Expect Big Gains By Year-End appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Suppose BTC breaks the $180,000 barrier; in that case, a significant amount of money and interest will likely flow into the altcoin arena, especially meme currencies, which have historically generated huge returns during bullish cycles. But Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , the meme world’s rising star, are the three that stand out as the best bets for 30x to 60x returns by the end of the year. Dogecoin (DOGE): The King Returns Dogecoin needs no introduction. DOGE is trading around $0.16, with a robust daily trading volume of $558.93 million and a market cap of $24.61 billion. Technically, DOGE is flashing bullish signals—having just broken out of a prolonged falling wedge pattern on the charts, accompanied by a weekly MACD bullish crossover. Historically, there has been a relationship of 0.67 between DOGE and Bitcoin. This means that as the price of BTC increases, the cost of DOGE typically rises as well. If BTC rises to $180,000, DOGE may increase to between $4.80 and $9.60, representing a 30x to 60x rise from its current value. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Underdog Poised to Explode Trading at $0.00001179 with a daily volume of $101.03 million and a $6.78 billion market cap, SHIB is quietly building momentum. On the technical front, SHIB has recently completed a bullish W-pattern and is forming a textbook inverted head-and-shoulders—a pattern often preceding massive upward breakouts. Its SHIB/BTC trading pair has climbed 3.16% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing its strong correlation with BTC (historically ranging from 0.82 to 0.92). Should BTC skyrocket to $180,000, SHIB could ride the wave to a staggering $0.0007074—up to 60x its current price. For a coin once written off as a joke, SHIB is shaping up to be a serious contender in the meme coin resurgence. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The New Meme King in the Making If DOGE is the king and SHIB the challenger, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the next meme legend ready to storm the throne. What makes Little Pepe different? It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a fully functional Layer 2 blockchain powered by meme magic and serious tech. Built for speed, low fees, and scalability, LILPEPE doesn’t just ride Ethereum’s coattails—it out-memes it, delivering both fun and function in equal measure. Currently in its red-hot presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $2.5 million, with Stage 3 selling out ahead of schedule. The token is now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, a 30% increase from its initial price. With over 2.6 billion LILPEPE tokens sold—71% of the presale allocation—investor confidence is surging. The project is rumored to be backed by several influential anonymous figures who have previously helped catapult major meme coins to success. Their involvement has added significant credibility, driving community excitement to new highs. The most compelling reason to watch LILPEPE is its growth potential. Analysts speculate that if BTC reaches $180,000, LILPEPE could surge to between $0.0715 and $0.13, representing a potential 60x gain from its current presale price. In addition, Little Pepe’s team is building an entire meme-powered ecosystem, positioning it not just as a coin but as a full-blown movement. To mark its meteoric rise and bring the community along for the ride, Little Pepe has launched one of the largest giveaways in the history of meme coins. This $777,000 giveaway campaign has gained over 17,000 entries, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. Final Thoughts: The Meme Coin Moment Is Here With Bitcoin potentially heading for $180,000, we’re on the cusp of another epic altcoin season—and meme coins are once again at the forefront of that narrative. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most unique of them all—a meme coin with utility, community firepower, and early-stage explosiveness that could eclipse both DOGE and SHIB in this cycle. For those looking to ride the next meme coin rocket, Little Pepe isn’t just a contender—it might just be the main event. Presale is live. Meme magic is real. Don’t miss the $LILPEPE wave.

Replying to another X user, Elon Musk confirmed that the party would embrace Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Will America Party embrace Bitcoin?” asked X user Renato Lima. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” said Elon Musk in his post . Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 The post garnered major support from cryptocurrency and Bitcoin advocates including Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser and Founder of IBC Group and co-founder of NFT Technologies Mario Nawfal. Many crypto figureheads claimed that they would “vote” for Elon Musk’s America Party if it championed Bitcoin. “Crypto could be the strongest tool to fight inflation, and Washington’s addiction to money printing and runaway spending,” said Mario Nawfal in his post . You might also like: Dogecoin rises over 5% after Elon Musk threatens DOGE haters with federal action Director of Bitcoin Strategy at Scientific, Joe Burnett, also voiced out his support for Musk’s views on fiat being a hopeless currency. He stated that digital money could be instrumental in creating economic incentives for smaller more efficient government systems. It’s less about politics and more about creating monetary tools that restructure the economic incentives,” Burnett weighed in, replying to Musk’s earlier post. In response to Musk’s idea to form a third political party, his ally-turned-rival President Donald Trump said that Musk had gone “off the rails” in the past few weeks. He said a third party would only serve to create disruption and chaos to the existing system. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – The System seems not designed for them,” said Trump in a TruthSocial post . What is Elon Musk’s America Party? Earlier this month on July 4th, Musk announced his plans to form the America Party. He launched a poll on X asking whether he should create an independent party to challenge the current two-party system in the U.S. The poll received over 1.2 million votes, with 65.4% voting YES to the America party. “Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!” said Musk in his post . Although the party itself has yet to be fully realized, Musk has stated that the way to carry out an independent party would be to secure two to three Senate sears and around eight to 10 House districts. “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” continued Musk. Earlier this year, Elon Musk and President Donald Trump had a falling out which resulted in a big political blowout between the two men who were once political allies. In June, Musk called Trump’s $3.4 trillion Big, Beautiful Bill a “disgusting abomination” and accused Republican lawmakers of fiscal dishonesty. The Big Beautiful Bill is a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump’s second-term. The bill passed with a House vote of 218 to 214. It includes several items including an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, cuts to health care and food programs, as well as other tax cuts and breaks.

2025-07-07T06:40:51,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars: Unveiling Optimistic Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars: Unveiling Optimistic Market Sentiment Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? If you’re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, you’ve likely noticed a palpable shift in the atmosphere. The latest update from Alternative, a prominent software development platform, reveals that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed to a significant 73 as of July 7. This seven-point jump from the previous day firmly plants the market in the ‘Greed’ zone, signaling a surge in positive crypto market sentiment . But what exactly does this number mean for your digital assets, and how should you interpret this growing optimism? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Your Market Compass The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful psychological barometer designed to help investors gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index provides a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful (0-24), fearful (25-49), neutral (50), greedy (51-74), or extremely greedy (75-100). A score of 73, as we see now, clearly places us firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. Why is such an index crucial? Because market emotions can be powerful drivers of price action. When investors are fearful, they often sell, driving prices down. Conversely, when greed takes over, buying pressure intensifies, pushing prices higher. As legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” The index attempts to quantify these often-irrational human behaviors. What Factors Drive This Crucial Index? The index isn’t based on a single factor but rather a sophisticated amalgamation of six distinct components, each weighted to reflect its impact on overall market sentiment. Understanding these components is key to truly grasping the index’s implications: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current cryptocurrency volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on upward price movements, can indicate a surge in greed, as investors rush to buy. Conversely, high volatility during downturns often signals panic and fear. Currently, a more controlled but still significant upward volatility might be contributing to the greed score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum in the cryptocurrency space, primarily focusing on Bitcoin. High buying volumes accompanying strong price increases typically indicate healthy bullish sentiment and growing greed. Conversely, low volume on price increases or high volume on price drops can suggest weakness or fear. The current index suggests robust buying interest. Social Media (15%): By analyzing social media platforms (primarily Twitter), the index gauges the sentiment around various cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. It looks at the number of posts, hashtags, and the general tone of discussions. An increase in positive sentiment and high engagement often correlates with rising greed, as more people discuss and promote their holdings. Surveys (15%): Historically, this component included weekly polls asking investors about their market outlook. While currently paused, these surveys provided a direct measure of retail investor sentiment. When active, a high percentage of bullish responses would contribute to a higher greed score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during times of uncertainty (fear), as investors move capital from riskier altcoins back into the perceived stability of Bitcoin. However, in a strong bull market, rising Bitcoin dominance can also signify Bitcoin leading the charge, pulling the rest of the market up, contributing to overall greed. The current increase in the index suggests Bitcoin’s strength is perceived positively. Google Trends (10%): This component analyzes search query data for terms related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Spikes in searches for terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “Bitcoin price prediction” can indicate growing public interest and potential FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), contributing to a higher greed score. Conversely, searches for “Bitcoin crash” or “sell crypto” would indicate fear. Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 73 Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? A score of 73 places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone, just shy of ‘Extreme Greed.’ This suggests that investors are feeling increasingly confident and optimistic about the market’s future performance. Such periods are often characterized by: Increased Buying Pressure: More individuals are willing to buy cryptocurrencies, even at higher prices, driven by the belief that prices will continue to rise. Reduced Selling Pressure: Holders are less likely to sell their assets, anticipating further gains. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New money often flows into the market as people see prices climbing and don’t want to be left behind. Potential for Overvaluation: While not a direct indicator of overvaluation, prolonged periods of extreme greed can sometimes lead to asset prices detaching from their fundamental value, creating bubbles. The current score reflects a general positive outlook, possibly fueled by recent price stability, specific project developments, or broader macroeconomic factors. It’s a sign that the collective consciousness of the crypto community is leaning towards bullishness, indicating a strong positive crypto market sentiment . Navigating Cryptocurrency Volatility: Strategies for the ‘Greed’ Phase While a high ‘Greed’ score can be exhilarating, it also warrants caution. History has shown that periods of extreme greed often precede market corrections or consolidations. Here’s how you can navigate the current environment, keeping cryptocurrency volatility in mind: Strategy Description Why it’s relevant in ‘Greed’ Profit-Taking Consider taking a portion of your profits off the table, converting them into stablecoins or fiat. Secures gains before a potential downturn; reduces exposure to high volatility. Rebalancing Portfolio Adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level. Sell overperforming assets to buy underperforming ones. Ensures you’re not overexposed to any single asset that might be overheated. Setting Stop-Loss Orders Automate selling your assets if their price drops to a certain level. Protects against sudden, sharp corrections common after periods of high greed. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Out Instead of selling everything at once, sell small portions of your holdings at regular intervals. Reduces the risk of trying to time the market peak; smooths out your average selling price. It’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It tells you how people feel , not necessarily what will happen next. Always combine this insight with your own research, technical analysis, and fundamental understanding of the projects you invest in. Beyond the Index: The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Market Momentum While the overall Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view, diving deeper into its components, particularly Bitcoin dominance and market momentum , offers additional layers of insight. These two factors, contributing a combined 35% to the index, are crucial for understanding the market’s underlying health. Bitcoin Dominance: The King’s Influence Bitcoin, as the first and largest cryptocurrency, often dictates the broader market’s direction. Its dominance, or its market cap percentage relative to the total crypto market, can tell us a lot. In a ‘Greed’ phase like the current one, a rising Bitcoin dominance often means that capital is flowing into Bitcoin first, leading the charge. This can be a healthy sign, as a strong Bitcoin often pulls altcoins up with it, albeit with a delay. Conversely, a falling Bitcoin dominance during a bull market might signal an ‘altcoin season,’ where investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into smaller, potentially higher-gain altcoins. The current index score, influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, suggests that Bitcoin is playing a key role in fostering this optimistic environment. Market Momentum: The Engine of Growth The market momentum component, powered by trading volume, is essentially the market’s engine. When prices are rising on high volume, it signifies strong conviction among buyers. This momentum can be self-reinforcing; as prices go up, more people want to join, further increasing volume and pushing prices higher. However, it’s also a double-edged sword. When momentum starts to wane, or if prices rise without corresponding volume, it can be a warning sign that the current trend might be unsustainable. The fact that momentum contributes significantly to the current ‘Greed’ score suggests that there’s substantial capital flowing into the market, underpinning the recent price increases. Understanding the interplay between these factors provides a nuanced perspective. For instance, if the index is high due to strong Bitcoin dominance and market momentum, it suggests a more robust, institutionally-led optimism. If it’s driven primarily by social media buzz with less underlying volume, it might indicate a more speculative, retail-driven rally that could be less sustainable. Challenges and Considerations: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Foolproof? While an invaluable tool, it’s important to acknowledge that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not infallible. No single indicator can perfectly predict the future of a complex and rapidly evolving market like cryptocurrency. Here are some limitations to keep in mind: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current and recent sentiment, not future sentiment. By the time the index hits ‘Extreme Greed,’ a market top might be near, or conversely, by the time it hits ‘Extreme Fear,’ the bottom might have already passed. Primarily Bitcoin-Centric: While it considers the broader market, its calculations are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin’s performance and data. This means it might not perfectly reflect the sentiment for specific altcoins or niche sectors of the crypto market. Doesn’t Account for Macro Events: Sudden, unforeseen global economic shifts, regulatory crackdowns, or black swan events can dramatically impact the market regardless of the index’s current reading. The index reacts to these events, but doesn’t predict them. Psychological Biases Persist: Even with the index, individual investors are still prone to their own biases. Knowing the market is ‘greedy’ doesn’t automatically prevent one from succumbing to FOMO or making impulsive decisions. Therefore, use the index as a complementary tool alongside your own fundamental analysis of projects, technical analysis of price charts, and awareness of broader economic and regulatory landscapes. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Conclusion: Empowering Your Crypto Journey The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear signal of an increasingly optimistic crypto market sentiment . Driven by factors like sustained market momentum , controlled cryptocurrency volatility , and strong Bitcoin dominance , this surge in confidence presents both opportunities and potential pitfalls. While the excitement is palpable, smart investors will use this information to inform their strategies, rather than being swept away by emotion. Understanding the underlying components of the index, and acknowledging its limitations, empowers you to make more informed decisions in this dynamic and exhilarating market.

Institutional treasury moves drain liquidity, making this cycle feel flat. Altcoin rally expected, but slower due to institutional market dynamics. Bitcoin has managed to break above an important resistance level ($109,000) on its chart for the second time this month. The first breakout happened on July 2nd, followed by a rally, a minor pullback, and now another move higher. So far, key support zones have held firm, keeping bullish hopes alive. If Bitcoin can stay above $106,300, there’s a good chance it continues climbing. But there’s a catch. According to market veteran Willy Woo , the market is now in a tricky late-stage bull market zone, where the risk is high and liquidity isn’t as reliable as before. Woo points out that while the system is bigger and more stable than past cycles, it is now dealing with a more macro-driven, institutional market, and that changes the game. Why This Cycle Feels “Flat” In previous cycles, Bitcoin and altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and meme tokens would shoot up together in explosive, short-lived rallies.

2025-07-07T06:27:08,"How Will Bitcoin Perform in the Second Half of the Year? Will It Rise or Fall? Experts Answer","Some investors expect Bitcoin to break out of its consolidation phase and reach new record highs in the second half of the year. Behind this optimistic expectation are the acceleration of corporate treasury purchases, strong cash inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and cryptocurrency legislation advancing in the US Congress. Bitcoin rose nearly 30% in the second quarter, but the period has been labeled “consolidation.” Bitcoin’s gains have diminished month-on-month after trading in a narrow price range for three months. The cryptocurrency gained 15% in the first half of the year, a more subdued performance compared to the 45% rise in the same period last year. But analysts say the real rise may be starting now. Bitcoin, which had largely traded above $100,000 since May 9, was trading at $108,000 today, about 3% below the record of $111,999 reached in May. “We are still seeing an acceleration in ETF adoption. Institutional treasuries are just starting to develop Bitcoin strategies, and we expect more money to flow through these channels,” said Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens Bank. According to Ryan, there is increasing individual and institutional interest in Bitcoin, and this trend points to strong upside potential. Another element that plays a significant role in this rise is “Bitcoin treasury companies.” Firms like Nakamoto, Twenty One and Strive Asset Management are raising capital to buy Bitcoin through stock issuances by merging with public companies. “There are mergers that are pending SEC approval. So there is a lot more money waiting to buy Bitcoin that hasn’t bought yet,” said Steven Lubka, Vice President of Investor Relations at Nakamoto. Related News: Watch Out: Many Economic Developments and Altcoin Events in the Coming Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Lubka says that not only institutional demand, but also new fiscal stimulus expected from Washington and record-breaking stock markets will contribute to Bitcoin’s rise. “On the one hand, Bitcoin is becoming a more mature asset class, and on the other hand, a large amount of capital is flowing into this area with the financialization process,” Lubka says, arguing that the current administration’s positive attitude towards Bitcoin will also be a major catalyst. According to Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, regulatory developments in the US could also support Bitcoin for the rest of the year. Markets could price in expectations of an earlier rate cut if President Donald Trump appoints a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Additionally, the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill expected to pass Congress, could boost interest in Bitcoin, especially among individual investors. Kendrick noted that some investors may be concerned about Bitcoin’s four-year cycle toward the end of September. Noting that previous cycles have seen prices fall about 18 months after each halving, Kendrick said institutional inflows could offset those effects this time around. Bitcoin could reach $135,000 by the end of the third quarter and $200,000 by the end of the year, according to Standard Chartered’s estimate. “Once the market gets over these cyclical fears, we expect Bitcoin to continue its rise,” Kendrick said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T06:20:39,"Trump Trade Deals: Unveiling the Crucial Impact of August 1st Tariff Increases","BitcoinWorld Trump Trade Deals: Unveiling the Crucial Impact of August 1st Tariff Increases Cryptocurrency Markets are often highly sensitive to shifts in global economics and geopolitics. When significant announcements emerge from major political figures, the digital asset space takes notice. Recently, former U.S. President Donald Trump made a statement that has captured attention: new trade agreements have been established, and importantly, tariffs on other countries are set to increase starting August 1st. This declaration, reported by Watcher Guru on X, could signal a renewed focus on protectionist trade measures, potentially sending ripples across the global economy and, by extension, influencing your crypto portfolio. Let’s delve into the implications of this significant Trade Policy Update . Unpacking the Latest Trump Trade Deals Announcement The announcement from Donald Trump regarding new trade agreements and impending Tariff Increases on August 1st comes at a pivotal time for the global economy. While specific details of these ‘new trade deals’ were not immediately elaborated upon in the initial report, the mere mention suggests a potential shift in international economic relations. Trump’s past presidency was characterized by an assertive approach to trade, marked by the imposition of tariffs on goods from countries like China and the renegotiation of existing agreements such as NAFTA (rebranded as USMCA). This latest statement, if implemented, could indicate a return to a more protectionist stance, aiming to prioritize domestic industries and potentially reshape supply chains. For businesses and consumers globally, such a move could introduce new costs and complexities. The uncertainty surrounding these potential actions often translates into market volatility, which is something that Cryptocurrency Markets , known for their sensitivity to external economic factors, tend to react to. Understanding the broader context of these proposed Trump Trade Deals is essential for anticipating their economic fallout. The Mechanics of Tariff Increases: What Does August 1st Mean for You? Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons: to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, to generate revenue, or as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. When a country imposes Tariff Increases , it makes imported goods more expensive, which can have several direct and indirect consequences: Higher Consumer Prices: Businesses often pass on the increased cost of tariffs to consumers, leading to higher prices for goods ranging from electronics to clothing. Disruption of Supply Chains: Companies that rely on imported components or raw materials may face increased costs or be forced to seek new suppliers, leading to supply chain inefficiencies. Retaliatory Tariffs: Countries targeted by tariffs may impose their own tariffs in response, escalating trade disputes into full-blown trade wars. This can further complicate international trade and hurt export-oriented industries. Reduced Trade Volume: The overall volume of international trade may decrease as goods become more expensive or less competitive across borders. The August 1st deadline provides a specific timeline for businesses to prepare for these changes. Companies may scramble to import goods before the deadline or adjust their sourcing strategies. The anticipation of these increases can create market jitters, influencing investor behavior across traditional financial markets and potentially spilling over into the Cryptocurrency Markets . Analyzing the Global Economic Impact on Traditional Markets Any significant Trade Policy Update , particularly one involving widespread Tariff Increases , has the potential to create a substantial Global Economic Impact . Historically, trade wars have been shown to slow economic growth, increase inflation, and reduce corporate profits. Here’s how such policies typically affect traditional markets: Stock Market Volatility: Industries heavily reliant on international trade, such as manufacturing, technology, and automotive, can see their stock prices fluctuate significantly. Investor confidence can erode, leading to broader market sell-offs. Currency Fluctuations: Trade tensions can lead to currency depreciation or appreciation as investors react to perceived economic strengths or weaknesses of different nations. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which can contribute to overall inflation within an economy. Central banks might then face difficult decisions regarding interest rates. Reduced Global Growth: A prolonged period of trade disputes can dampen global economic growth by disrupting supply chains, reducing investment, and creating uncertainty. For example, during previous trade disputes, companies often reported lower earnings due to increased costs and reduced demand. This broad economic uncertainty can lead investors to seek safe-haven assets, or conversely, to pull back from riskier investments, a trend that directly influences the sentiment within Cryptocurrency Markets . The Ripple Effect: How Trump’s Trade Policy Update Could Influence Cryptocurrency Markets The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that significant economic shifts, such as those caused by a major Trade Policy Update , inevitably find their way to the crypto space. While digital assets often operate independently of traditional banking systems, they are not immune to macroeconomic forces. Here’s how Trump’s announcement could impact Cryptocurrency Markets : Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often translates to increased volatility in crypto. Investors may move funds in or out of digital assets based on their risk appetite during turbulent times. Safe-Haven Narrative Revisited: Bitcoin has, at times, been touted as a digital safe haven, similar to gold. In periods of geopolitical or economic instability, some investors might flock to Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market downturns or currency devaluation. However, this narrative is not always consistent, and Bitcoin can also experience sell-offs during broad market fear. Capital Flows: As traditional markets react to Tariff Increases and trade disputes, capital may shift. Some investors might move funds into crypto if they perceive it as a viable alternative or a way to escape inflation in fiat currencies. Conversely, if economic downturns are severe, liquidity crunches could lead to sell-offs in all asset classes, including crypto. Impact on Stablecoins and CBDCs: Heightened trade tensions could accelerate discussions around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as nations seek more control over their financial systems. Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the U.S. dollar, might see increased usage as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance, though their stability could also be tested if the underlying fiat currency experiences significant pressure. The overall sentiment driven by a potential trade war can lead to unpredictable movements. Digital asset investors should monitor not just crypto-specific news but also global economic indicators. Navigating Potential Tariff Increases: Strategies for Digital Asset Holders Given the potential for a renewed focus on Tariff Increases and their broader economic implications, what can digital asset holders do to navigate this environment? Proactive measures can help mitigate risks and potentially identify opportunities: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, trade negotiations, and economic indicators. Reliable news sources like Watcher Guru and other financial news outlets are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: While tempting to go all-in on a single asset, a diversified crypto portfolio can help spread risk. Consider a mix of established assets (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) and potentially some altcoins with strong fundamentals. Understand Risk Tolerance: Before making any moves, assess your personal risk tolerance. Trade wars can lead to significant market swings, and it’s important to only invest what you are comfortable losing. Consider Stablecoins: During periods of high volatility, parking some capital in stablecoins can offer a temporary refuge from market fluctuations, allowing you to re-enter when conditions stabilize or opportunities arise. Long-Term Perspective: For many crypto investors, a long-term strategy often weathers short-term market turbulence better. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends rather than daily price movements driven by macroeconomic headlines. The impact of these proposed Trump Trade Deals will unfold over time, and a well-informed, strategic approach is key for anyone involved in Cryptocurrency Markets . What’s Next for Global Trade and Your Digital Assets? The announcement from Donald Trump about new trade deals and Tariff Increases set for August 1st introduces a fresh layer of uncertainty into the global economic landscape. While the precise details and full scope of these actions remain to be seen, their potential to create a significant Global Economic Impact is undeniable. From disrupted supply chains to shifts in investor sentiment, the ripple effects will be felt across traditional markets and, crucially, within Cryptocurrency Markets . As digital asset holders, understanding this evolving Trade Policy Update is not just academic; it’s practical. The interconnectedness of global finance means that even news about trade agreements can influence the volatility and direction of your crypto investments. Staying vigilant, diversifying your portfolio, and maintaining a long-term perspective will be vital strategies as these economic narratives continue to develop. The coming months will reveal the true extent of these trade adjustments and how the resilient world of digital assets adapts to them.

2025-07-07T06:10:38,"UAE Golden Visa: Crucial Reports Debunked for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld UAE Golden Visa: Crucial Reports Debunked for Crypto Investors The world of digital assets is constantly buzzing with innovation, investment, and, sometimes, misinformation. Recently, a particular rumor sent ripples through the global cryptocurrency community: the tantalizing prospect of securing a coveted UAE Golden Visa simply by holding virtual assets. This idea, which promised long-term residency in one of the world’s most dynamic economic hubs for crypto investors, understandably captured widespread attention. However, official sources in the United Arab Emirates have now stepped forward to set the record straight. The Emirates News Agency reported a joint statement from the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), unequivocally dismissing these online reports as false. This crucial clarification emphasizes that eligibility for the Golden Visa is based on specific, official criteria that currently do not include crypto investors. So, what does this mean for the crypto community, and what are the actual pathways to living and working in the UAE? Understanding the Prestigious UAE Golden Visa Program Before diving deeper into the denial, it’s essential to understand what the UAE Golden Visa truly represents. Launched in 2019, this long-term residence permit is a cornerstone of the UAE’s strategy to attract global talent, investors, and entrepreneurs. It allows foreign nationals to live, work, or study in the UAE with significant benefits, including: Long-term Residency: Visas are typically issued for 5 or 10 years, renewable automatically. Self-Sponsorship: Holders do not require a national sponsor for their visa. Family Inclusion: The visa extends to family members, including spouses and children, and even executive directors and advisors. Freedom of Movement: Holders can stay outside the UAE for extended periods without their visa being invalidated. Exclusive Benefits: These can include special discounts, health services, and other perks designed to enhance the quality of life for long-term residents. The program is designed to attract individuals who can contribute significantly to the UAE’s economy and society. Current eligibility categories typically include: Investors (in public investments, real estate) Entrepreneurs Specialized Talents (doctors, scientists, artists, athletes, innovators) Outstanding Students and Graduates Humanitarian Pioneers Frontline Heroes The emphasis is on tangible contributions, established wealth in traditional assets, or recognized expertise in critical sectors. Debunking the Myth: What This Means for Crypto Investors UAE The recent denial by the ICP, SCA, and VARA serves as a critical reminder that while the UAE is indeed a progressive hub for virtual assets, its residency programs operate under distinct, established guidelines. The joint statement was clear: ‘golden visas are granted based on official criteria that exclude crypto investors.’ Why did this rumor gain traction? It’s likely a confluence of factors: UAE’s Crypto-Friendly Image: The UAE, particularly Dubai, has actively positioned itself as a global leader in the virtual assets space, attracting major crypto firms and fostering innovation. This positive reputation might have led to assumptions about broader benefits for crypto holders. Desire for Residency: Many crypto investors, seeking favorable regulatory environments and high-quality living standards, naturally look towards jurisdictions like the UAE. Misinterpretation of Policies: Some might have confused the UAE’s support for virtual asset businesses and innovation with direct visa pathways for individual crypto wealth. It’s important to differentiate between the UAE’s forward-thinking approach to regulating virtual assets as an industry and the specific criteria for immigration. While the nation welcomes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and fosters a vibrant ecosystem, this does not automatically translate into golden visa eligibility based solely on crypto holdings. Navigating the Dubai Crypto Landscape: A Hub, But With Rules Despite the golden visa clarification, the UAE’s commitment to becoming a leading global hub for virtual assets remains unwavering. Dubai Crypto initiatives, in particular, have garnered international acclaim. Entities like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), established in Dubai, are at the forefront of creating a robust and clear regulatory framework for virtual assets. This includes: Licensing Frameworks: VARA issues licenses for various virtual asset activities, including exchanges, broker-dealers, and custody services. Investor Protection: Regulations aim to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Innovation Support: The framework seeks to foster innovation while managing risks. The UAE’s strategy is to attract legitimate virtual asset businesses and talent, encouraging them to set up operations within its jurisdiction. This creates jobs, stimulates the economy, and positions the UAE as a digital economy leader. However, this support for the industry is distinct from individual immigration policies. Investors looking to participate in the Dubai Crypto scene can certainly do so, but their path to residency will follow established immigration channels, not necessarily through their digital asset portfolios directly. Understanding Virtual Assets Regulation in the UAE The role of VARA, alongside the SCA and ICP, in issuing this joint statement highlights the coordinated effort by UAE authorities to provide clarity and prevent misinformation. The robust framework for Virtual Assets Regulation is a testament to the UAE’s methodical approach: The UAE’s approach to virtual assets is multifaceted, aiming to balance innovation with investor protection and financial stability. This comprehensive regulatory environment, rather than a loose interpretation of visa rules, is what truly defines the UAE’s stance on crypto. Legitimate UAE Residency Requirements for Aspiring Expats For individuals, including crypto investors, who aspire to live and work in the UAE, there are numerous established and legitimate pathways to residency. It’s vital to focus on these official routes rather than unverified rumors. Common UAE Residency Requirements include: Employment Visa: Obtaining a job with a UAE-based company is one of the most common ways to secure residency. Property Investor Visa: Investing in real estate above a certain value (typically AED 750,000 or AED 2 million, depending on the visa type) can qualify for a long-term residency. Entrepreneur Visa: Individuals who establish a new business in the UAE that meets specific criteria can apply for this visa. Freelance Visa: Dubai offers a specific freelance visa for certain professions, allowing individuals to work independently. Retirement Visa: For those over 55 who meet specific financial criteria. Student Visa: For individuals enrolled in accredited educational institutions in the UAE. For crypto investors specifically, if their wealth is primarily in virtual assets, they would need to convert these assets into a form that meets the criteria for existing visa categories, such as investing in qualifying real estate or establishing a legitimate, licensed business in the UAE that aligns with entrepreneurial visa requirements. Simply holding crypto assets does not, at present, qualify one for a Golden Visa. Conclusion: Clarity in a Dynamic Landscape The recent denial by UAE authorities regarding golden visas for crypto investors serves as a vital reminder to always seek information from official and verified sources. While the UAE remains a pioneering force in the global virtual assets landscape, attracting businesses and fostering innovation through clear Virtual Assets Regulation , its residency programs operate under specific, established criteria. The UAE Golden Visa is a prestigious offering designed for specific categories of individuals, and currently, holding cryptocurrencies is not a direct pathway to eligibility. For aspiring expats and Crypto Investors UAE -bound, the message is clear: explore the many legitimate avenues for residency, such as employment, traditional investment, or entrepreneurship. The UAE continues to be a welcoming and dynamic environment, but navigating its opportunities requires adherence to its well-defined rules and regulations.

Key Takeaways: Metaplanet bought 2,205 BTC, raising total holdings to 15,555 BTC worth $1.7 billion. BTC Yield jumped 15.1% in one week, adding 2,017 BTC valued at 31.7 billion yen. The firm’s Bitcoin treasury has quadrupled since March, reflecting an aggressive accumulation strategy. The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield Jumps 15.1%, Adds 2,017 BTC in a Week According to company disclosures, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a key metric tracking the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share, rose 15.1% between July 1 and July 7, adding 2,017 BTC worth 31.7 billion yen in the quarter-to-date period. BTC Yield highlights the net Bitcoin growth relative to share dilution, which the firm views as a measure of shareholder accretion. Metaplanet’s steady Bitcoin purchases have been funded through a mix of capital market activities and operating income. Notably, the company executed an early redemption of 6 billion yen from a recent bond issuance, repaying investors with proceeds raised from recent stock acquisition rights exercises. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin buying spree has outpaced traditional corporate approaches to digital assets. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 2,205 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 15,555 BTC* pic.twitter.com/VqKGOwCs6N — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 Since early 2025, Metaplanet has expanded its holdings from under 4,000 BTC in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, quadrupling its position in just four months. The company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy mirrors moves by U.S.-based Strategy but on a Japanese scale. “Metaplanet has acquired 2,205 BTC for ~$238.7 million at ~$108,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 416.6% YTD 2025. As of 7/7/2025, we hold 15,555 $BTC acquired for ~$1.54 billion at ~$99,307 per bitcoin,” CEO Simon Gerovich said in a recent post on X . Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows at least 21 new entities added BTC holdings in the past month alone. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

The latest purchase was made at an average price of 15.64 million yen per bitcoin, totaling approximately 34.49 billion yen ($213 million). That pushes Metaplanet’s aggregate BTC investment to 225.82 billion yen ($1.38 billion), with a blended average purchase price of 14.52 million yen per BTC. Metaplanet utilizes a custom metric, called BTC Yield, to track shareholder value in relation to dilution.

2025-07-07T05:54:21,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2030: Analyst Predicts Pi Coin Could Hit $1,000","The post Pi Network Price Prediction 2030: Analyst Predicts Pi Coin Could Hit $1,000 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network, the mobile mining project that turned millions into casual crypto miners once again in the spotlight after Pi Coin reaching a value of $1,000 is catching fire again, this time, with research backing from Bitget Global. As one of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms, Bitget has offered a long-term prediction that could surprise even the most optimistic Pi supporters. But is $1,000 really possible? Let’s break it down. Bitget’s Bullish 2030 Prediction According to Bitget Global Research , Pi Coins could climb to $500–$1,000 or more by 2030—but only if a few big things fall into place. This isn’t just a hopeful guess, the forecast is based on the idea that Pi Network becomes a global digital payment platform used for DeFi, shopping, and everyday transactions. To get there, the network needs mass adoption, not just hype. What Needs to Happen? For Pi to reach those heights, five major things must happen or else Bitget says without these, Pi’s price could stay flat, or even drop. Real World Use: Pi needs to become a payment option for everyday transactions, not just in theory, but in stores and platforms globally. Big Partnerships: Collaborating with well-known brands and blockchain players will help Pi gain credibility. User Activity: Growth alone isn’t enough. Millions must actually use the apps and tools built on Pi. Strong Tech: The blockchain must be fast, secure, and scalable to support heavy usage. Utility Over Hype: An open and functioning mainnet is key to moving beyond speculation. Meanwhile, Pi has to prove it’s more than a speculative token, it must offer real solutions. [post_titles_links postid=”479140″] Analysis: Bold, But Not Impossible Bitget analysis suggests that it sounds like a big dream, but crypto history is full of surprises. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum also started with doubters, and look where they are now. As Bitget puts it, real adoption creates real value, and if Pi can offer real-world use, $1,000 by 2030 may not be that impossible. For now, Pi Coin’s future lies in the hands of its core team and loyal “Pioneers.” [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Will Pi Network’s Pi Coin ever be worth money? Yes, Pi Coin is already trading and has a market value, currently around $0.46 USD (July 2025). Its potential for significant future worth depends on widespread real-world utility, major exchange listings, and continued ecosystem development. Does the Pi Network have a long-term future? The Pi Network has a potential future if it achieves mass adoption for everyday transactions, secures major partnerships, maintains active user engagement, develops robust and scalable technology, and demonstrates genuine utility beyond mere speculation. Its recent Open Mainnet launch is a step forward. Can Pi Coin realistically reach $1,000 in value? While Bitget Global Research predicts Pi Coin could reach $500–$1,000 or more by 2030, this is considered an optimistic forecast. It hinges on unprecedented global adoption, extensive real-world use cases, and strong market demand. Many other predictions are more conservative, ranging from a few dollars to a few hundred.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-price-prediction-2030-bitget-predicts-pi-coin-could-hit-1000/,"EXCHANGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|RESEARCH|BTC","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

The efforts center on sophisticated fraudulent schemes that trick victims into paying small profits and then losing their fortunes through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has seized nearly $400 million worth of digital assets over the past decade, a figure that has not been previously made public. The team uses software, subpoenas and patience to track down digital crimes, not guns or badges. “They send you a photo of a young person, but in reality it's probably an old man in Russia,” GIOC analyst Jamie Lam told a meeting in Bermuda last month, explaining how the scams start: “They send you a photo of someone who looks like they're a young person, but in reality it's probably an old man in Russia.” Fake investment sites offer victims small profits, then disappear as investments grow. Related News: Watch Out: Many Economic Developments and Altcoin Events in the Coming Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List The team can track down the criminals by tracking down the domains of fake platforms, crypto wallets, and sometimes IP addresses leaked through VPN errors. “Sometimes it just takes patience,” Lam says. “Victims often think they see opportunity. They think they’re safe when they use Bitcoin, but that’s not true,” Smith said during training in Bermuda. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch warned: “Technology is great for economic growth, but it’s also open to abuse. You have to have strong investigative powers.” According to FBI data, of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime reported in the US in 2024, $9.3 billion was related to crypto. The elderly suffered the most losses, losing $2.8 billion to fake investment sites alone. The Secret Service is working closely with industry partners to recover stolen funds. Coinbase and Tether have assisted with wallet analysis and asset freezes in some cases. One scam in which $225 million in USDT was recovered was among the largest recoveries ever. *This is not investment advice.

The Tesla CEO, in a thread on X, confirmed that the party will embrace Bitcoin, calling fiat as “hopeless.” Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Musk first confirmed the formation of his new political party on Saturday, following a poll on X. He said that the America Party would address the consistent rise in debts, which has been present irrespective of whichever party is in power. “The America Party is needed to fight the Republican/Democrat Uniparty,” he wrote to his 221.8 million followers . Musk criticised Trump’s 940-page “Big, Beautiful Bill“, which proposes tax breaks and sweeping cuts, warning of job loss and strategic harm, sparking conflict with the Trump administration. “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” he wrote on another thread. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” Meanwhile, Trump posted on Truth Social that a third political party has never succeeded in the United States. He said that Elon Musk has gone completely “off the rails,” becoming a ‘TRAIN WRECK’ in the past weeks. Elon Musk America Party and Bitcoin Relationship – What it Means for BTC Musk noted that his party would support Bitcoin and focus on House and Senate races. Following his confirmation, Bitcoin jumped from $108,735.07 to $109,361.29 and is currently trading at $109.16K at press time. Musk has expressed a long-standing opinion about various cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin and Dogecoin, since 2014. One user called it a “ huge signal ” for Bitcoin, given Musk’s influence on the industry and current backing of BTC on a political level. Further, the community has been speculating over Elon Musk staking Bitcoin silently. The buzz started on July 2, when the crypto-focused handle on X pointed out Musk’s silence on Bitcoin lately.

The breakout was backed by over 1.1 billion in trading volume, establishing strong support at $0.166. Whale wallets accumulated aggressively during the move, even as smaller holders exited, suggesting renewed institutional confidence in DOGE. News Background Elon Musk’s surprise announcement of the America Party over the weekend reignited political and crypto debate alike. His platform, which includes strong pro-Bitcoin language and sharp criticism of Donald Trump’s “anti-innovation” financial agenda, has sparked speculation about DOGE’s role as a cultural and financial asset in Musk’s movement. While no formal mention of Dogecoin was made, Musk’s history of integrating DOGE into Tesla and X (formerly Twitter) products has fueled speculation that the token may play a symbolic or transactional role in the new party’s vision. The announcement comes amid broader economic uncertainty. President Trump’s July 9 tariff deadline looms large over global markets, contributing to volatility in crypto and equities alike. Despite this, DOGE saw heavy buying from whale wallets — particularly those holding 1M–100M DOGE — even as retail positions declined, according to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock. Technical Analysis Highlights DOGE surged 5.01% over 24 hours from 6 July 03:00 to 7 July 02:00, moving from $0.163 to $0.171.

2025-07-07T05:30:00,"Mercado Bitcoin to Tokenize $200 Million in RWAs on XRPL","Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s leading crypto exchanges, announced it will tokenize $200 million in RWAs on the XRP Ledger. Boston Consulting Group estimates that the tokenized RWA market could hit $19 trillion by 2033.Meanwhile, Hong Kong is expanding its tokenized green bond program and refining its digital asset framework, including new rules for stablecoins and digital asset platforms. In the US, Robinhood’s plan to tokenize equities via its new Ethereum-compatible blockchain could disrupt Wall Street by moving trading on-chain and extending market access to 24/7. Latin American Exchange Joins Tokenization Wave Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced on Friday that it will tokenize $200 million worth of real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to a joint announcement with Ripple, the tokenized assets will include a mix of fixed-income and equity financial instruments. This initiative is part of the trend in the crypto and financial sectors to digitize traditional assets through blockchain technology, despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Press release from Ripple A report by Boston Consulting Group and Ripple projected that the tokenized RWA market could reach a staggering $19 trillion in market capitalization by 2033, thanks to the strong institutional interest in the space. The move by Mercado Bitcoin comes at a time when crypto firms and asset managers are calling for clearer regulatory frameworks, particularly in the United States, to support the growth of tokenized equities and other digital representations of traditional financial assets. RWA tokenization market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) On the same day, Ondo Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, acquired Oasis Pro , a US-regulated alternative trading system. The goal of the acquisition is to strengthen Ondo's foothold in the RWA space by leveraging Oasis Pro's ability to settle digital securities in both fiat currency and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Centrifuge , a blockchain company specializing in RWAs, unveiled plans to tokenize the S&P 500 stock index, which could bring a major benchmark of the US equity market onto the blockchain. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize the tokenization of stocks and bonds. However, there are still some major regulatory challenges in the way. John Murillo, chief business officer at B2BROKER, warned that tokenized equity instruments currently exist in a regulatory grey area. Unlike traditional stocks, they may not offer direct claims on company assets, voting rights, or access to internal financial disclosures. He advised investors to thoroughly examine the specific terms of any tokenized RWA they consider, and pay very close attention to potential cash flows, dividend rights, legal protections, and smart contract-related risks. Hong Kong Expands Tokenized Bond Strategy Hong Kong is also moving to expand its tokenized bond program with a third batch of tokenized green bonds. This could mean that the government is planning to make such offerings a permanent part of its debt issuance strategy. At the Hong Kong Digital Finance Awards 2025, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui pointed out that the upcoming tokenized bond sale builds on the momentum of two successful issuances in 2023 and 2024. These bonds were recorded and settled by using distributed ledger technology, and authorities are now exploring measures like stamp duty exemptions on tokenized exchange-traded funds to further incentivize adoption. This initiative is part of Hong Kong’s broader digital asset push, as laid out in its newly released Digital Asset Development Policy Declaration 2.0. The government’s updated strategy places a lot of emphasis on the regulation of stablecoins and the promotion of asset tokenization under its “LEAP” framework , which focuses on legal clarity, ecosystem development, real-world use cases, and talent cultivation. As part of this plan, a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers will go into effect on August 1, to help encourage practical adoption of tokenized solutions. Hong Kong’s ‘LEAP’ framework At the same time, public consultations are underway for proposed licensing regulations governing digital asset trading platforms and custodians, with the consultation period set to close by the end of August. Additionally, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) launched the city's first digital asset indexes, offering institutional investors benchmark pricing for Bitcoin and Ethereum during Asian trading hours. To help boost its digital finance ambitions even more, Hong Kong’s financial authorities recently announced plans to introduce digital asset derivatives trading targeted at professional investors. This follows a wave of regulatory progress, including the approval of spot cryptocurrency ETFs, futures contracts, and staking services. In April, licensed exchange HashKey was also cleared to offer staking . To add to this, the region’s Legislative Council passed the Stablecoin Bill in May. This laid the regulatory foundation for a secure and structured environment for digital assets and Web3 innovation. Tokenized Stocks Could Disrupt Wall Street Robinhood’s plan to tokenize stocks through a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain, known as Robinhood Chain, could disrupt traditional financial markets by shifting trading activity away from legacy exchanges like the NYSE. At the EthCC conference, CEO Vlad Tenev introduced the project as a layer 2 blockchain built on Arbitrum Orbit that will allow users to trade tokenized derivatives of stocks directly on-chain. The goal of this initiative is to provide near-instant settlement and extend trading hours to 24/5 initially, with plans for 24/7 trading in the future. By minting token wrappers tied to real equities held by a US broker-dealer, Robinhood will enable users to self-custody their assets or interact with decentralized applications. Galaxy Digital shared in a report released Friday that Robinhood’s move brings assets on-chain, bypassing traditional markets and potentially undermining the liquidity dominance and revenue models of centralized exchanges. The architecture of Robinhood Chain resembles Coinbase’s Base, as it allows the company to control its own sequencer and capture transaction fees across its trading ecosystem. Galaxy estimates that Base earns over $150,000 in daily fees for Coinbase, a model Robinhood may replicate. (Source: Galaxy Digital ) The benefits of tokenization extend beyond just expanded trading hours. Programmable assets could be used as collateral in DeFi applications or automate dividends. Galaxy warned that if established exchanges fail to adapt, they could be reduced to custodians of a less functional version of the same assets, losing relevance as traders migrate to more versatile blockchain-based platforms. However, the model is not without challenges. Around-the-clock trading could increase volatility risks for retail investors by exposing them to unexpected price swings outside standard market hours. Regulatory uncertainty is another obstacle, as the SEC has yet to weigh in on Robinhood’s approach. Currently, access to tokenized stock trading is limited to users in the European Union. Meanwhile, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has already urged the SEC to reject trading of tokenized equities outside the current Regulation NMS framework.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9822/mercado-bitcoin-to-tokenize-200-million-in-rw-as-on-xrpl,"TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T05:30:00,"Ethereum Must Evolve as Buterin Proposes Gas Cap and Decentralization Tests","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a series of proposals aimed at reinforcing the network’s long-term stability and decentralization. Speaking at the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, Buterin emphasized the need for Ethereum and the broader crypto industry to adopt more practical, user-focused safeguards. He also co-authored a new technical proposal, EIP-7983, that would place a protocol-level cap on gas usage for individual transactions to enhance security and compatibility with future technologies. Vitalik Buterin Proposes Ethereum Gas Cap to Boost Network Security and zkVM Compatibility Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum researcher Toni Wahrstätter have introduced a new proposal aimed at fortifying the Ethereum network's resilience and performance by placing a hard cap on the gas consumption of individual transactions. Known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7983 (EIP-7983), the change would set a protocol-level gas ceiling of 16.77 million units (2²⁴) per transaction, a move that could significantly reduce the network’s vulnerability to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and make it more compatible with emerging technologies like zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Currently, Ethereum’s architecture technically allows a single transaction to consume the entire block gas limit — a loophole that presents serious risks to network stability. This has been particularly problematic in scenarios where one transaction monopolizes gas resources, leading to failed transactions and inconsistent block performance. EIP-7983 seeks to mitigate this issue by enforcing a per-transaction gas limit, effectively distributing the gas load across multiple transactions and reducing the risk of a single operation jamming the pipeline. The proposed 16.77 million gas ceiling was selected to support even the most demanding smart contract deployments and DeFi interactions while discouraging inefficient or potentially malicious activity. “By implementing this limit, Ethereum can enhance its resilience against certain DoS vectors, improve network stability, and provide more predictability to transaction processing costs,” the proposal states. Enhancing zkVM Compatibility Beyond the security implications, the gas cap is also aimed at streamlining Ethereum’s compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines, or zkVMs. These next-generation computational models are expected to become a cornerstone of Ethereum scaling and privacy solutions. However, zkVMs currently struggle with processing extremely large transactions due to their architecture, which breaks computations into smaller proofs. By encouraging developers to split gas-intensive transactions into smaller, modular ones, EIP-7983 would make Ethereum more accommodating to zkVMs, potentially accelerating their mainstream adoption. Despite setting a hard cap, the proposal notes that the vast majority of transactions on the Ethereum network already operate well below the proposed threshold. As such, the authors argue that the change would have minimal impact on day-to-day users and developers. However, transactions that do exceed the cap would be rejected outright during block validation. This means that any attempt to exceed the 16.77 million gas limit would be invalidated before inclusion in a block, ensuring the new rule is strictly enforced. The cap itself is distinct from the total block gas limit — a parameter still controlled by validators and miners within the consensus protocol — and is not intended to replace it. EIP-7983 is not an isolated initiative. It follows earlier efforts like EIP-7825, which aimed to improve the predictability of transaction execution. These proposals are part of a broader philosophical shift led by Buterin, who has increasingly advocated for simplifying Ethereum’s base-layer architecture. In a May blog post, Buterin argued that Ethereum had grown too complex, which in turn was creating development bottlenecks and security liabilities. Inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist philosophy, he outlined a vision for restructuring Ethereum across its consensus, execution, and shared components with the goal of creating a leaner and more robust protocol over the next five years. The Future of Ethereum: Identity, Scaling, and Security Buterin’s vision for Ethereum goes far beyond transaction mechanics. In recent months, he has unveiled a host of forward-looking ideas — from partially stateless nodes that could support better scaling, to a digital identity framework called ”pluralistic identity,” which is designed to balance user privacy with verifiable participation in digital systems. The overarching narrative is clear: Buterin wants to ensure Ethereum remains adaptable and scalable while reducing systemic risks and increasing usability. EIP-7983 is yet another brick in that wall — a targeted upgrade aimed at aligning Ethereum with the future demands of a decentralized internet. Whether EIP-7983 gains community support and ultimately becomes part of a future hard fork remains to be seen. But with the growing complexity of Ethereum's ecosystem and the ever-present threat of DoS attacks, the proposal shows the importance of keeping the network resilient, secure, and efficient in the face of exponential growth. Buterin Warns Ethereum Community: Grow Up or Risk Becoming Irrelevant Meanwhile, in a keynote address that resonated like a wake-up call, Buterin urged the crypto industry to ”grow up fast” or risk becoming just another overhyped fad. Speaking to a packed audience at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) , Buterin outlined a stark reality: decentralization must stop being a marketing slogan and start being a provable user guarantee — or face obsolescence. As Ethereum recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary, Buterin’s remarks struck a balance between concern and constructive criticism. He emphasized that the crypto sector stands at an inflection point, where its founding ideals are being tested against the pressures of mass adoption, political endorsement, and increasingly complex technical systems. Back to Basics: Trust, Resilience, and Simplicity Buterin called for a return to Ethereum's core principles — decentralization, trust minimization, and user sovereignty. He warned that too many projects are building systems that fail the very tests that matter. He then laid out a trio of tests that every crypto project should aim to pass if it wants to be truly decentralized: The Walk-Away Test — If the founding company disappears tomorrow, will users still have access to their assets? The Insider Attack Test — How much damage can be done if an insider goes rogue or a front-end is compromised? The Trusted Computing Base Test — How many lines of code must users blindly trust to ensure their funds or data remain safe? These tests aren’t just theoretical metrics. Buterin pointed out that many layer-2 networks, DeFi apps, and so-called decentralized front-ends secretly rely on central points of failure — including backdoors, upgrade buttons, or weak user interfaces that could be hijacked. Buterin didn’t spare even the most hyped sectors of crypto, like zero-knowledge (ZK) solutions and privacy-focused apps. He argued that privacy must evolve from an optional feature to a default setting — something that reduces data leakage automatically rather than relying on user behavior. This line of thought echoes Buterin’s growing emphasis on Ethereum becoming a simpler, more robust system. Ethereum’s Next 10 Years — or Its Last? The urgency in Buterin’s tone wasn’t just for show. With alternative blockchains nipping at Ethereum’s heels — offering faster speeds, lower fees, and often simpler user experiences — the pressure to evolve is mounting. If Ethereum fails to simplify its design, secure its base layer, and deliver real user protections, Buterin warned, it could fade into irrelevance. In a world where governments are crafting crypto regulations, major corporations are jumping into the blockchain space, and digital identity is becoming a battleground, Ethereum’s next moves may define not just its own future, but the future of decentralized tech as a whole.

2025-07-07T05:10:07,"Elon Musk Founded His Own Political Party in the US – What Does This Mean for Bitcoin (BTC) and How Will It Affect It?","Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced his new political party, describing the US's national debt burden of over $37 trillion as “a disaster that will lead the country to bankruptcy.” With this formation, which he called the “America Party”, Musk also declared a clear separation from his old friend and re-elected president last year, Donald Trump. The developments brought with them the expectation of a big rise in the cryptocurrency market, especially for Bitcoin. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, financial commentator Lyn Alden drew attention to the dramatic increase in the US budget deficit, using the phrase “Nothing stops this train” in reference to the Breaking Bad series. Alden said that $2 trillion more will be added to the US debt in 2024 alone. Musk has been harshly critical of Trump’s new mega-economic bill, which he calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill will increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion and add an additional $3 trillion in debt to the country. Musk lashed out at Trump in his post on the X platform, saying, “This is going to bankrupt the country.” Musk also argued that Trump and the Republicans have failed to keep their promises of “cutting spending” in their election promises last year. Related News: The Altcoin That Earned the Most Decentralized Application Revenue in the Last Three Months Has Been Revealed - It Made a Big Difference Musk’s move and the increasing financial expansion in the US have created excitement in the crypto market. Unity Wallet COO James Toledano commented, “The government printing so much money is weakening the dollar while strengthening Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ status.” Crypto investor Lark Davis reminded that Bitcoin usually makes double-digit gains after such huge spending bills, saying, “When Trump signed another huge spending bill at the end of 2020, Bitcoin rose by 38%. If the same pattern repeats, the BTC price could hit $150,000. Because nothing can stop this train.” “All In Podcast” host David Friedberg summarizes the picture as follows: “We are facing a financial emergency in this country, and no one is trying to solve it.” Rapidly rising interest rates following major stimulus packages during the pandemic are making it even more difficult to finance the US’s debt, which has reached $37 trillion. While the increasing public spending and borrowing trend in the US creates uncertainty in financial markets, many investors are turning their eyes back to limited-supply digital assets like Bitcoin. Elon Musk’s new political formation, the “America Party,” shows that this financial turmoil will have not only political but also economic consequences. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T05:07:58,"Dogecoin Pops 6% to Lead Majors Gains as Bitcoin Nears $110K on Fresh Rate-Cut Optimism","Dogecoin (DOGE) surged over 6% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among major cryptocurrencies, as bitcoin (BTC) bounced toward the $110,000 mark on renewed rate-cut hopes and easing fears around looming U.S. tariffs. The rally came after U.S. officials clarified that President Trump’s long-anticipated tariff hikes would not go into effect immediately, giving countries more time to negotiate. The initial July 9 deadline sparked concerns over a sharp deterioration in global trade, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that nations without a deal would likely receive a three-week extension to reach agreements before the new levies take effect on August 1. “Markets are rallying after it was revealed countries will have more time to negotiate before tariffs take effect,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram message. “If we see a soft CPI print on Tuesday, that could open the door for a Fed rate cut later this year.” The clarification helped stabilize risk sentiment heading into a crucial week. Traders are now watching Wednesday’s U.S. inflation data for signals that could support a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve. A lower-than-expected CPI print could boost the case for a rate cut as early as September, helping crypto and risk assets extend their rebound. Bitcoin gained 1.1% over 24 hours to trade above $109,000, while ether (ETH) added 2.5% to reach $2,570. Other majors, including Solana's SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP), Cardano' ADA (ADA), and Tron's TRX (TRX) posted 2%-4% gains, supported by strong inflows and improving sentiment. “The BTC bounce and ETH inflows show traders are rotating into long-term value assets,” said Eugene Cheung, Chief Commercial Officer at OSL, said in a Telegram message. “We expect more investors to seek shelter in crypto as macro volatility builds.” “We’re optimistic that more investors will look to Bitcoin and Ethereum to escape macro volatility and potential inflation increases as the Fed signals high potential to cut interest rates this year,” Cheung added. Dogecoin’s outperformance marks a sharp return of retail enthusiasm, with trading volumes crossing $1.5 billion in the past 24 hours (relatively high for a weekend after an otherwise flat week), as known-backer Elon Musk unveiled plans for an “America Party.” Read more: Elon Musk Says America Party Will Embrace BTC as 'Fiat Is Hopeless'",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/07/dogecoin-pops-6-to-lead-majors-gains-as-bitcoin-nears-110k-on-fresh-rate-cut-optimism,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|ADA|ETH","Markets|Markets|Dogecoin|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

But after officials denied the link, TON dropped and is now trading at $2.83. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov also reposted a crypto influencer’s claim, which sparked speculation.

July 7, 2025 06:05:47 UTC Bitcoin Nears $110K as Tariff Delay Eases Fears; Dogecoin Leads With 6% Gains Bitcoin has surged close to $110,000 today after it was clarified that Trump’s proposed Tariffs will not take immediate effect. This has given countries until August 1 to reach trade deals, which is three weeks ahead of the original July 9 deadline. Dogecoin led the rally with 6% rise and topped gains among major tokens. Other altcoins like Solana, XRP, and ADA saw 2-3% gains. This comes ahead of key U.S inflation data. Traders expect a softer CPI report, which could boost the chances of an earlier rate cut. July 7, 2025 05:51:34 UTC Trump Threatens Additional 10% Tariffs on BRICS Supporters President Trump has announced a new 10% tariff on countries that support BRICS, calling their actions “anti-American.” The BRICS summit began Sunday in Brazil. As the G7 and G20 face internal rifts, BRICS is trying to offer a more united and cooperative alternative amid rising global conflicts. However, he revealed no details on what those policies meant, and also added that there would be “no exceptions to this.” This is the first BRICS summit to include Indonesia, one of several new members alongside Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.

Musk believes the legislation fuels reckless fiscal policy and deepens economic instability. Why Bitcoin Is Central to Musk’s Political Vision In a recent post on X, Musk declared fiat money “ hopeless ,” signaling a bold pivot toward digital assets in political discourse. Bitcoin , in particular, is set to be a cornerstone of the American Party’s platform. Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Musk has long been a vocal advocate of cryptocurrency, with Tesla and SpaceX holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Now, he’s extending that vision into the political sphere, promoting Bitcoin as a tool to combat inflation and resist centralized monetary control. Focus on Congress, Not the Presidency While many speculated Musk may have presidential ambitions, he clarified that his immediate focus will be on Congressional races, not a run for the White House. The American Party aims to support innovation, protect free speech, and reduce excessive regulation—while maintaining a moderate stance on divisive issues. A filing under the name “Elon Reeve Musk” for the “America Party” recently circulated on X, purportedly from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The America Party is the solution https://t.co/KryqdEcqIU — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 6, 2025 However, no such record exists on the official FEC website, and Musk has since denied any involvement with that filing, calling it false. The Musk-Trump Rift Goes Public Tensions between Musk and Trump have escalated rapidly. Following Musk’s announcement, Trump lashed out on Truth Social, labeling Musk a “ TRAIN WRECK ” and accusing him of going “ off the rails .” The clash highlights a deeper divide between the two figures, who were once politically aligned. Musk’s popularity among younger, tech-savvy, and pro-crypto voters is growing—putting him at odds with Trump’s base. In response, Musk accused Trump of abandoning the political center. He launched a poll asking followers whether he should start a new party for the “80 percent in the middle.” After receiving overwhelming support, Musk moved forward with the unofficial launch of the American Party. [post_titles_links postid=”479140″] Backchannel Offers and Political Ambitions Before launching his own party, Musk reportedly received outreach from political figures like Andrew Yang and Libertarian Party Chair Steven Nekhaila, urging him to support their movements. However, Musk remained focused on fighting Trump’s bill and challenging the Republicans who supported it. He later unveiled a loose political strategy, criticizing both Democrats and Republicans as a “ uniparty ” lacking meaningful differences. Though some have speculated about Musk’s presidential ambitions, the U.S. Constitution bars him from running—as he was born in South Africa. This limitation restricts the leadership options of the American Party but hasn’t dampened its momentum.
