2025-07-07T08:56:02,"Elon Musk Backs Bitcoin in America Party Launch, Market Reacts","The post Elon Musk Backs Bitcoin in America Party Launch, Market Reacts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The world’s richest man says Bitcoin will be part of the official platform of his new “America Party,” sending BTC close to the $110,000 mark earlier today. The move comes just days after Musk broke away from the Republican Party over a controversial budget bill pushed by Donald Trump. When asked if his new party would support Bitcoin, Musk replied: “Fiat is hopeless so yes.” That one sentence was enough to set off a fresh wave of excitement in the market. This is big news. Here’s what you should know. Bitcoin Gets Political Musk’s statement is already being seen as a major moment for Bitcoin in U.S. politics. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, called it “massive,” saying Musk had officially made Bitcoin part of the America Party’s platform. This is massive. Elon has officially declared that Bitcoin will be a part of the new party platform for @AmericaPartyX . pic.twitter.com/sJkJbVtvWB — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) July 7, 2025 The Republican Party has also been pushing pro-crypto policies, but Musk’s entry could shift the conversation further. After all, he’s putting it on a political agenda. And that could change a lot for the crypto industry, perhaps more than what Trump has already been able to do. Dogecoin Jumps As expected, Dogecoin (DOGE) also reacted. The meme coin, often backed by Musk, jumped nearly 6% after the news. Bitcoin, meanwhile, saw a steady climb toward $110K. It’s worth noting: Tesla still holds over 11,500 BTC, valued at more than $1.2 billion, making it one of the top corporate holders of Bitcoin. What Happened Between Trump and Musk? This Bitcoin announcement is also tied to a deeper story – Musk’s growing feud with Donald Trump. He recently slammed Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a major tax and budget policy expected to add $3.3 trillion to the U.S. debt. Musk called the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” and argued it would kill jobs and hurt the country’s future. Important to note is that the bill would kill the EV Mandate, which is essential for a company like Tesla. Trump even threatened Musk with sending him back to South Africa. I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025 It was recently passed by Congress despite Musk’s protests. After a poll that drew over 1.2 million votes, Musk officially announced the launch of the America Party, saying the U.S. needs a political movement that “actually cares about the people.” Trump responded by attacking Musk, calling the move “ridiculous”. Will Musk Run for President? Now let’s be clear – Trump just secured a second term in December 2024. So, Musk isn’t headed for the Oval Office anytime soon. But if the America Party gains momentum, especially by 2026 or 2028, Musk could turn Bitcoin into a serious political issue in the U.S. That would bring both opportunities and challenges for crypto. On one hand, it could drive more adoption and awareness. On the other, it could also lead to tighter regulations as crypto becomes part of national politics. Bottom line: when Musk speaks, markets listen.

2025-07-07T08:53:21,"Worldcoin Price Fluctuates While Bitcoin Solaris Announces LBank Listing and 72-Hour Price Rollback","In a week dominated by volatility, Worldcoin made headlines with sudden price dips that left holders holding their breath. But just as some investors were bracing for another wave of uncertainty, a different kind of crypto announcement stormed into the spotlight. Bitcoin Solaris, the high-speed, mobile-first blockchain project, confirmed its listing on LBank and dropped a surprise announcement that’s already sending shockwaves through Live Coin Watch Data. A 72-hour price rollback to just $5, timed perfectly before the listing, has traders scrambling for a piece of what’s quickly becoming the most talked-about coin in the market. Worldcoin Wavers, BTC-S Surges Worldcoin has certainly built its name on big ideas. With ambitions tied to global identity systems and eye-scanning devices, it captured attention early. But that attention often comes with price swings that make even seasoned traders a little nervous. While the project deserves credit for tackling ambitious goals, recent fluctuations have raised more questions than confidence. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that speed, simplicity, and surprise can go a long way. Instead of pushing futuristic narratives, it’s delivering something tangible, immediate, and exciting, especially with a limited-time rollback that feels more like a flash sale than a crypto event. A New Era of Mining That Fits in Your Pocket Forget bulky hardware and soaring electricity bills. Bitcoin Solaris is ushering in a new era of mobile-first mining that anyone can access with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Designed for efficiency and scalability, the app allows users to mine directly from their smartphones, no rigs, no overheating, just pure convenience. It’s already turning heads among GPU-weary veterans who want passive income without the pain. And the best part? The current mining model is backed by a high-throughput network capable of up to 100,000 TPS through its Solaris Layer. That’s not just fast, that’s lightning in blockchain form. You can even estimate your mining potential with the official Bitcoin Solaris calculator , giving users clear projections on earnings before they get started. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here. Core Features Setting BTC-S Apart What’s making Bitcoin Solaris the darling of Live Coin Watch this week isn’t just hype or the LBank listing . It’s the tech stack under the hood. Here’s why analysts and investors are jumping in: Dual-layer consensus model combining PoW for security and DPoS for performance. Validator rotation every 24 hours ensures decentralization and avoids monopolies. Dynamic block sizes up to 32MB and block time of 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer. Advanced smart contract support using Rust, compatible with Solana’s dev tools. Energy efficiency improved by over 99 percent compared to traditional mining. Crypto’s Next Giant Isn’t a Clone It’s Bitcoin Solaris Some of the most active crypto influencers are covering it too, including: A feature breakdown from Token Empire that highlights the speed and accessibility of the project. Token Galaxy showcasing the potential of the mobile mining model. Crypto Vlog analyzing the technical architecture in depth. And behind the scenes, Bitcoin Solaris has passed not one, but two audits one from Cyberscope and another from Freshcoins . That means trust isn’t just implied, it’s verified. The Presale Storm and the $5 Rollback With over 13,900 users already onboard and more than $6.3 million raised, the Bitcoin Solaris presale has already outpaced expectations. The presale is currently in Phase 11 with a price of $11 per token. However, for just 72 hours, the team is rolling back the price to $5, giving both new buyers and hesitant watchers a rare window to jump in before it returns to $11 and heads toward its $20 launch target. It’s rare to see a presale offer a rollback like this, and rarer still when the fundamentals are this strong. The 72-hour countdown isn’t just about pricing, it’s a test of who’s ready to take action. Less than 4 weeks remain before the listing. Already one of the shortest and fastest-moving presales in the market. Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. Built to Scale and Built to Last The architecture behind Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just flashy, it’s solid. With a Base Layer throughput of up to 3,000 TPS and a Solaris Layer pushing performance to 100,000 TPS, the system can handle mass adoption. Cross-layer transactions are synchronized through secure block commitments, while validator rotation prevents centralization and keeps the network fair. More importantly, the token distribution is smart and sustainable. With a fixed 21 million BTC-S cap, the tokenomics ensures long-term growth and community control: 66.66% allocated for mining 20% reserved for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for marketing, staking rewards, ecosystem development, and community rewards each 0.33% for the team and advisors This guarantees that the majority of BTC-S remains in the hands of actual users and miners, not locked behind private deals. Final Thoughts Bitcoin Solaris is pulling off what most projects only dream of. With a real-use mobile mining app on the horizon, dual-consensus security, and a high-speed blockchain that doesn’t compromise on decentralization, BTC-S is on a collision course with mainstream success. And with the LBank listing confirmed and a surprise price rollback live for just 72 hours, the timing couldn’t be better. Whether you're a seasoned miner tired of chasing hash rates or a new investor looking for a smarter way in, this is your moment. When the dust settles, you’ll either be part of the Bitcoin Solaris movement, or wishing you had been.

2025-07-07T08:49:57,"Elon Musk’s America Party to Accept Bitcoin for Political Donations","Tesla CEO and tech billionaire Elon Musk has confirmed that his newly launched political party, the America Party, will accept Bitcoin, marking a significant step for crypto in US politics. When asked on X if his party would embrace BTC, Musk simply replied , “Fiat is hopeless, so yes.” Musk is no stranger to Bitcoin, with Tesla holding 11,509 BTC worth around $1.26 billion , making it the ninth-largest publicly traded company with Bitcoin reserves. Tesla initially purchased $1.5 billion in BTC under Musk’s leadership in 2021, signaling early institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency. While Musk has often voiced support for Dogecoin, his embrace of Bitcoin for political donations places the cryptocurrency at the center of a growing conversation about campaign finance and decentralized money in US elections. Bitcoin for Political Leverage Samson Mow, founder of Jan3, noted that Musk’s decision could give him an edge over President Donald Trump in their ongoing public feud. Mow suggested that Tesla should resume accepting Bitcoin for vehicle purchases and that Musk’s SpaceX could consider offering discounts to customers who pay with BTC. In the past, Musk has shown a complicated relationship with Bitcoin. In 2021, he argued that Bitcoin’s price was “too high,” leading to a dip in its value. He also rejected the idea of using Bitcoin on Mars due to slow transaction times but later entertained the use of a localized Lightning Network to enable faster payments. Feud with Trump Deepens Amid America Party Launch Musk’s decision to form the America Party follows a heated disagreement with Trump over the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which Musk labeled “destructive.” The bill is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and Musk questioned how Trump’s initiatives could reduce the debt while simultaneously increasing it by trillions. After more than 1.24 million people voted on Musk’s poll, with nearly two-thirds in favor, he announced the creation of the America Party, stating that the US “needs a party that actually cares about the people.” He further criticized the US system as a “one-party system” when it comes to wasteful spending. In response, Trump has warned that Musk’s new party could fracture the Republican vote in the 2026 US midterm elections, escalating the tension between the two figures as Musk positions himself as a disruptive political force willing to bring Bitcoin into the heart of American politics.

According to the firm’s latest disclosure , it purchased an additional 2,205 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for roughly $237.9 million (34.49 billion yen). The tokens were obtained at an average cost of 15.64 million yen per bitcoin, approximately $107,800, now bringing its total holdings to 15,555 BTC. The latest purchase marks the firm’s largest single-day purchase since commencing its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, funded by a mix of bond issuances and stock warrant exercises. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 2,205 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 15,555 BTC* pic.twitter.com/VqKGOwCs6N — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 Just days prior to this acquisition, Metaplanet redeemed 6 billion yen worth of bonds issued in late June, using proceeds from newly exercised warrants. The company has consistently followed this approach, raising capital and converting it directly into Bitcoin to expand its treasury holdings. So far, the Tokyo-based firm has now spent a total of 225.8 billion yen, around $1.6 billion, on Bitcoin since beginning its treasury strategy, with an average cost basis of 14.5 million yen per BTC. This continues to build momentum toward its bigger goal of reaching 30,000 BTC by the end of the year, 100,000 BTC by 2026, and 210,000 BTC by 2027.

Analyst Warns of Massive Sell-Off Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Veteran crypto trader Capo of Crypto has just doubled down on his warning that Bitcoin could soon see a huge drop to as low as $70,000. Despite Bitcoin staying above $100K for now, Capo says big hidden moves and fresh global risks could break this key level and spark a massive sell-off. Here’s why he’s not backing down from his bearish call and what could trigger the next big shake-up. Altcoins Fallen 30% – 50% While Bitcoin has managed to hover around $108,000, most altcoins have already seen heavy losses, falling 30% to 50% from their May peaks. According to Capo, this drop was no surprise , he called it perfectly and has continued to add to his short trades, especially focusing on altcoins he believes have more downside ahead. But here’s where it gets more interesting: Bitcoin is still holding above $100,000, mainly due to institutional investors accumulating BTC for their reserves, which creates steady buying pressure. However, he finds it odd that with all this buying, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t soared higher. “Something feels off,” he says, suggesting that bigger whales may be quietly selling at these levels. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Come Alive Adding to the uncertainty, several old Bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era have suddenly become active, moving over 80,000 BTC, worth nearly $8.7 billion, after 14 years. It’s unclear if these coins will be sold, but Capo sees this as a sign that large holders might be distributing, not accumulating, at current prices. Bitcoin To Drop To $70k, IF! What makes Capo even more bearish is his view that if Bitcoin breaks below the $100K level clearly, it could soon drop to the next support area around $92K–$93K. Making this even worse, a deeper slip could drag BTC to $60K–$70K, and altcoins might collapse another 50%–80% in a panic sell-off. China–Taiwan Tensions Loom Large One trigger he points to is the China–Taiwan conflict, which he says is quietly reaching a dangerous point. Any disruption in Taiwan’s vital chip supply could shake global markets and push investors to panic, and crypto won’t be safe. As of now, bitcoin is shying away from its all-time high, currently trading around $108,912 , reflecting a rise of 1% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.16 trillion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-crash-to-70k-analyst-warns-of-massive-sell-off-ahead/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T08:30:02,"Chartist Slams Misleading Dogecoin Analysis: ‘Focus On This Instead’","Technical analyst Kevin, better known on X as @Kev_Capital_TA, rekindled debate over Dogecoin’s market structure on Sunday when he urged traders to ignore the “non-stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes” and to concentrate on the two signals that have guided the meme-coin’s price for more than two years. “Not much has changed for Dogecoin here,” he wrote. “Don’t let the other analysts on this platform flood you with non stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes. We know what to watch for here.” Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Kevin’s view hinges on the weekly chart he posted on 26 June. At that time, Dogecoin (DOGE) was hovering near $0.166—and, according to his chart, sitting directly on an ascending support cluster that has defined every major move since the 2022 bear-market washout. “Looking at Dogecoin on the weekly time frame,” he said, “you can see that ever since the bear market breakout on the weekly RSI back in 2022, any time DOGE has hit that level again—which has happened five times now—Doge has gone on to see major bounces. A failure of this weekly RSI level along with a failure of the $0.143-$0.127 level would be the line in the sand between longer term bearish price action or continued bull.” Related Reading: The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario The chart shows Dogecoin sitting just millimetres above a confluence of the green 0.382 Fibonacci retracement ($0.13778), the upper boundary of a falling trend line that has been in force since May 2021 and the weekly 200 SMA and EMA. Previously, Kevin stated via X: “Weekly 200 SMA and EMA are must holds for Dogecoin along with the macro .382 and down trending support.” Beneath lies the horizontal “line in the sand” at $0.143-$0.127—a zone Kevin has ring-fenced with bold yellow trend lines. Below the price pane, the weekly Relative Strength Index tells an equally focused story. Kevin has drawn a white band just above the 40-line; the yellow RSI profile has now tapped that band five times. Each tag coincided with a price trough circled in orange on the main chart. The oscillator’s simple moving average (plotted in magenta) has curled below 50 but remains above the 40-support, keeping the pattern intact. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst—Here’s The Target Overhead, Kevin’s chart maps a hierarchy of Fibonacci checkpoints: the 0.5 retracement at $0.18988 (red), the tightly stacked 0.618 ($0.26169) and 0.65 ($0.28548) (yellow), and the 0.786 ($0.41317) (blue). Two large violet supply boxes—one between $1.00 and $1.30 and another around $2.20 and $2.70—represent possible bull run targets. Kevin refrains from forecasting how quickly those zones might come into play, emphasising instead that holding the current support cluster is the single prerequisite for any higher-time-frame bullish thesis. The analyst also zoomed out to the broader digital-asset landscape in a Sunday follow-up. “The biggest moves for #Altcoins have yet to occur,” he argued, tying potential break-outs to macro-economic easing. “If the macro leads us to further easing and the market sniffs that out … then the ingredients will be in place for a massive move higher on Alts. Altcoins have always required the proper ingredients to make a sustained out-performance over #BTC for months. We’re closer than many understand; we just need a few more things to fall into place.” For now, Kevin’s message is stripped to its essentials: watch the weekly RSI band and the $0.143-$0.127 price shelf. As long as both survive, the chartist sees no reason to overhaul his structural bias—no matter how crowded the Dogecoin commentary stream becomes. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.172.

U.S. President Donald Trump wasted no time slamming the move, calling Musk’s latest political venture a “train wreck” and warning it could splinter the Republican vote in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Trump Slams Musk for Going ‘Off the Rails’ Trump didn’t hold back in his criticism, posting on Truth Social that Musk had gone “off the rails,” calling his political aspirations a “train wreck.” He warned that third-party efforts historically don’t succeed in the U.S. due to the rigid two-party system. “The system seems not designed for them,” Trump noted. The president’s skepticism is backed by past failures. Ross Perot, another billionaire outsider, gained nearly 19% of the popular vote in 1992 but failed to win a single electoral college vote. His Reform Party did see one win, Jesse Ventura’s 1998 gubernatorial victory in Minnesota, but even that fizzled out as Ventura left the party shortly after. These examples reinforce Trump’s belief that Musk’s political path may be short-lived. Musk Launches ‘America Party’ to Fight the GOP and Dems Just hours before Trump’s comments, Musk confirmed via X that he had officially launched the America Party. The announcement came in response to Congress passing Trump’s controversial tax-and-spending bill. Musk had warned he’d retaliate by launching a party if the bill went through, and he made good on the threat. Filings linked to the America Party began appearing with the Federal Election Commission. Musk later clarified that at least one of these was fake, and doubts remain about the authenticity of others. The Bill That Fueled the Feud The clash between Trump and Musk largely centers around the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which Musk called a “disgusting abomination.” The bill, estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, undermines the mission of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, where Musk served briefly. Before the bill passed, Musk vowed to oust any GOP lawmaker who supported it, a threat he now seems prepared to act on. [post_titles_links postid=”479146″] Rising Fears of a GOP Split I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG and Thomas Massie will join the new “America Party” to spite President Trump. — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) July 5, 2025 Trump loyalists are growing increasingly worried that Musk’s America Party could split the Republican vote, threatening their slim majority in Congress. Influencer Laura Loomer even suggested that Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie may consider defecting. Such moves could divide conservative voters and hand electoral wins to Democrats in tightly contested districts. Musk’s Tactical Play: Flipping Key Seats Rather than launching a presidential campaign, Musk appears to be playing the long game. He stated that his party will “laser-focus” on 2–3 Senate seats and 8–10 House districts. In today’s polarized political environment, even a handful of wins could give Musk’s party the leverage to block legislation and reshape Congressional dynamics.

2025-07-07T08:23:10,"Metaplanet Boosts Bitcoin Stack to 15,555 BTC","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has made a new purchase of 2,205 BTC. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, making it the fifth-largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Purchase Details CEO Simon Gerovich announced the news on Monday via an X post . He revealed that the outfit acquired the Bitcoin for $238.7 million at an average price of $108,237 each. As of July 7, the company now holds a total of 15,555 BTC, which were procured for around $1.54 billion at $99,307 per unit. Metaplanet tracks the success of its Bitcoin strategy using a metric called BTC Yield that measures how much value is being added per share over time. Gerovich shared that the company has achieved a BTC Yield of 416.6% so far in 2025. The firm has been following an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy in recent months. This latest purchase comes after it picked up 1,234 BTC for $133 million on June 26 and another 1,111 BTC worth $118 million just days before that. It also spent $117 million on 1,112 BTC on June 16, which pushed its holdings to 10,000 BTC. With 15,555 BTC, Metaplanet has now surpassed Cleanspark Inc. and Galaxy Digital to become the fifth-largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. The company plans to grow its holdings to 30,000 BTC by the end of the year and aims for 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would put its ownership of Bitcoin at 1% of the king cryptocurrency’s total supply. Elsewhere, Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company also said it has secured 116 BTC for $12.6 million on July 7. The Blockchain Group now holds a total of 1,904 BTC, valued at approximately $203 million. The France-based firm also reported a year-to-date BTC Yield of 1,348.8%. Capital Market Activities Metaplanet’s stock has seen some modest gains following the news. The shares are currently trading at ¥1,568 each. According to Google Finance data , this figure marks a 1.49% increase over the last 24 hours. The stock has also risen by 1,854% since last year. The Tokyo-listed company funds its Bitcoin purchases through stock and bond issuances. On June 16, it issued $210 million in zero-coupon straight bonds to EVO Fund, with all proceeds going toward BTC. Later that month, it announced the release of its 19th Series of Ordinary Bonds valued at around $190 million. Earlier in June, the outfit also completed the early redemption and full repayment of its 16th, 17th, and 18th Series bonds for $281 million using proceeds from the exercise of its stock acquisition rights.

2025-07-07T08:10:10,"Bitcoin price prediction: here’s why BTC will explode higher soon","Bitcoin price could be on the verge of a multi-year breakout in the coming days as numerous factors align. BTC was trading at $108,955 on Monday, a few points below the all-time high of $111,900. Here are some of the top reasons why it may stage a strong surge this year. Bitcoin price has strong technicals The first main reason why Bitcoin price may stage a strong surge is that it has formed numerous bullish patterns. The daily chart shows that it bottomed at $74,558 in April and then bounced back to an all-time high of $111,900. Bitcoin price has formed a highly bullish cup-and-handle pattern, comprising of a horizontal resistance level and a rounded bottom. This pattern also has a handle section, comprising of a descending channel. Furthermore, the handle section occurred after the coin surged, indicating that it is part of a bullish flag pattern. Similar to the cup-and-handle pattern, the bullish flag typically yields additional gains over time. Bitcoin price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. It has also moved slightly above the upper side of the flag section, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued rising. Therefore, the BTC price is likely to experience a strong bullish breakout, with the initial target level set at $112,000. A break above that level will indicate further upside, potentially reaching over $145,000. This target price is established by first measuring the cup’s depth, which, in this case, is about 30%. After this, one then measures the same distance from the cup’s upper side, bringing the target price at above $140,000. Bitcoin price chart Long-term chart points to more BTC price gains The all-time chart suggests more Bitcoin price gains in the coming months if it breaks above the ascending trendline. This chart shows that Bitcoin has formed two rounded bottoms in the past few years. The first one formed between December 2017 and April 2021. The other rounded bottom formed between November 2021 and January 2025. Bitcoin remains slightly below the ascending trend line that connects the highest swings sinc 2017. Therefore, a move above that eight-year trendline will indicate further gains, potentially reaching $200,000 and beyond. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView BTC price has strong fundamentals Further, Bitcoin has strong fundamentals that may drive its price much higher in the coming months. As with all assets, the price movement is usually dependent on demand and supply. While the demand trajectory is slowing, the reality is that more investors are accumulating the coin. A good example of this is in the ETF space, where inflows have surged in the past few months. Data shows that BTC ETF inflows have increased in the last four consecutive months and are slowly approaching the $50 billion milestone. The iShares Bitcoin ETF is nearing the $80 billion asset mark. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF now holds over $22 billion in assets, while Grayscale’s GBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB have over $20 billion and $5.3 billion in assets, respectively. The rising Bitcoin ETF inflows are happening at a time when the supply continues to plunge. Mining activity has slowed as the difficulty rate has surge after last year’s halving event. Bitcoin supply on exchanges Furthermore, the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued to fall in the past few months. Additionally, Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill , the soaring US public debt, and upcoming interest rate cuts are likely to boost risky assets, such as Bitcoin and stocks.

2025-07-07T08:02:32,"Babylon unveils 2025 roadmap with Bitcoin multi-staking and EVM mainnet launch","Babylon Genesis is set to roll out testnets for multi-staking and EVM support this summer, with both features scheduled to go live on mainnet in Q4 this year. The Bitcoin ( BTC ) staking protocol Babylon Genesis has unveiled its 2025 roadmap, outlining a series of milestones that will mark the completion of Babylon’s core staking infrastructure and open the door to BTCFi-native applications such as lending, trading, and stablecoins. This summer, the protocol will launch testnet support for multi-staking, allowing a single BTC position to secure multiple networks simultaneously. The initial integrations include Ethereum rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum, as well as various Cosmos chains. Alongside the multi-staking testnet, Babylon is also preparing to launch its Ethereum Virtual Machine testnet, enabling developers to deploy DeFi applications directly on Babylon Genesis using familiar Ethereum tooling. In Q4, both multi-staking and EVM functionality will go live on mainnet, alongside RPC upgrades, faster block times, and integrations with IBC and LayerZero. Babylon Genesis will also onboard a suite of BTCFi dApps, positioning itself as the execution layer for Bitcoin-native DeFi. In parallel, Babylon Labs continues R&D on a native Bitcoin liquidity layer using BitVM, aiming to enable trustless cross-chain BTC use. The first real-world applications of this work are expected to launch in Q1 2026. You might also like: Babylon Genesis launches as first-ever layer-1 secured by Bitcoin Launched in April this year, Babylon Genesis marked the official release of the first Layer-1 blockchain secured by native Bitcoin. This followed an earlier Phase 1 rollout in August last year, which introduced self-custodial BTC staking via Bitcoin contracts, allowing users to retain full control over their BTC while participating in network security. According to DefiLlama , Babylon currently ranks second among restaking protocols by TVL, with $19.81 billion locked, trailing only EigenLayer. The April launch also marked the debut of the BABY token, which is currently trading at $0.05073, up 9% in the past 24 hours, likely driven by the recent roadmap release.

2025-07-07T08:00:44,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows: A Monumental $769.6M Week for US Spot Crypto Investments","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows: A Monumental $769.6M Week for US Spot Crypto Investments The world of digital assets is buzzing, and for good reason. Last week, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a truly monumental surge, attracting a staggering $769.60 million in net inflows. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these significant movements is crucial for anyone keen on digital asset investment. What’s Driving the Surge in Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The recent explosion in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflects a confluence of factors that are reshaping the investment landscape. Since their approval in January, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have provided a regulated and accessible pathway for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This ease of access has been a game-changer. Several key elements are contributing to this remarkable momentum: Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are increasingly allocating capital to these regulated products, viewing them as a legitimate and less volatile way to diversify portfolios. The substantial inflows suggest that big money is making its move. Market Sentiment: A generally positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, fueled by its inherent scarcity and the upcoming halving event, creates an optimistic environment. Investors are anticipating potential price appreciation, making ETFs an attractive entry point. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Regulatory Clarity: The very existence of these ETFs, sanctioned by the SEC, provides a level of regulatory clarity and legitimacy that was previously absent, reducing perceived risks for cautious investors. According to data from SoSoValue, the $769.60 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week underscores this robust demand, highlighting a sustained appetite for exposure to the leading cryptocurrency through traditional investment vehicles. The Rise of the Spot Bitcoin ETF: A Game Changer? The introduction of the Spot Bitcoin ETF has been widely hailed as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin’s future price, a spot ETF directly holds Bitcoin, providing a more direct and often preferred form of exposure for investors. This distinction is vital for understanding its impact. How has the Spot Bitcoin ETF become such a significant player? Accessibility: For many, buying and securing actual Bitcoin can be complex. ETFs simplify this by allowing investors to buy shares through their existing brokerage accounts, just like stocks or mutual funds. Regulation and Security: Operating under stringent regulatory oversight, these ETFs offer a layer of investor protection and security that direct crypto holdings might not. This appeals to a broader base of investors who prioritize compliance and safety. Diversification: Fund managers can now easily add Bitcoin exposure to diversified portfolios, making it a more integrated part of traditional finance. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Market volatility, regulatory shifts, and the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency remain factors that investors must consider. However, the sheer volume of inflows suggests that the benefits are currently outweighing these concerns for a significant portion of the investment community. Ethereum ETF’s Moment: Are Ethereum ETFs Catching Up? While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, its younger sibling, Ethereum, is also making significant strides in the ETF space. Last week, U.S. Ethereum ETFs recorded impressive net inflows of $219.19 million. This indicates a growing recognition of Ethereum’s unique value proposition and its pivotal role in the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems. Here’s why Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational blockchain platform for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and smart contracts. Investing in ETH ETFs offers exposure to this expansive and innovative ecosystem. Staking Potential: The transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades) introduced staking, allowing ETH holders to earn rewards by helping secure the network. While direct ETF staking is still evolving, the underlying asset’s utility adds to its appeal. Diversification within Crypto: For investors looking beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum provides a crucial diversification option within the digital asset space, offering exposure to a different set of use cases and growth drivers. The inflows into Ethereum ETFs, though smaller than Bitcoin’s, are significant and suggest that investors are increasingly comfortable with Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable digital asset. The regulatory path for spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. is still unfolding, but the positive sentiment surrounding these inflows could pave the way for broader adoption. Navigating Crypto Market Trends: What Do These Inflows Mean? The substantial inflows into both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are more than just financial figures; they are powerful indicators of evolving crypto market trends . These movements signal a profound shift in how traditional finance views and interacts with digital assets. What are the broader implications for the crypto market? Price Impact: Increased demand through ETFs can exert upward pressure on the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as fund managers acquire the underlying assets to back the ETF shares. Market Maturity: The consistent inflows suggest a maturing market, moving beyond speculative retail trading to more structured and long-term investment strategies. Legitimacy and Trust: The success of these ETFs enhances the overall legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of mainstream investors and regulators, potentially leading to further integration into global financial systems. Investor Behavior: The data offers insights into investor sentiment, showing a clear preference for regulated, easy-to-access investment products, which could influence future product development in the crypto space. These trends indicate that cryptocurrencies are no longer niche assets but are becoming integral components of a diversified investment portfolio, attracting capital from various investor segments globally. Digital Asset Investment: The Future is Here? The impressive performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs points towards a future where digital asset investment is not just an alternative, but a core component of global finance. The ease of access provided by ETFs is breaking down barriers, inviting a new wave of capital into the crypto ecosystem. What does the future hold for digital asset investment? Expansion to Other Altcoins: The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for ETFs tracking other major altcoins, further broadening the scope of regulated crypto investment products. Increased Institutional Involvement: As more traditional financial giants enter the space, we can expect even larger capital allocations and more sophisticated investment strategies. Regulatory Evolution: Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are likely to continue refining their approaches to digital assets, potentially leading to more comprehensive frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring investor protection. Technological Integration: The convergence of traditional finance with blockchain technology will likely accelerate, leading to new financial products and services that leverage the best of both worlds. The journey of digital assets from a niche technology to a mainstream investment class is well underway. The strong inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are not just a snapshot of last week’s performance; they are a powerful testament to the growing conviction that digital assets are here to stay, shaping the future of finance. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investment The remarkable $769.60 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with significant gains for Ethereum ETFs, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital asset investment. These figures are more than just statistics; they represent a surging tide of institutional and retail confidence, signaling the maturation of the crypto market and its increasing integration into traditional finance. The accessibility, regulatory clarity, and security offered by these ETF products are clearly resonating with investors, driving unprecedented capital into the space. As the crypto market trends continue to unfold, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge, it’s evident that digital assets are solidifying their position as legitimate and compelling components of a modern investment portfolio. This era promises continued innovation, broader adoption, and exciting opportunities for those ready to embrace the future of finance.

2025-07-07T08:00:14,"Bitcoin To Anchor America Party—’Fiat Is Hopeless,’ Says Elon Musk","Five hours after declaring on X that “The America Party is the solution,” Elon Musk faced a follower’s blunt question: would his just-minted political vehicle back Bitcoin? Musk’s answer landed three hours later and rocketed across crypto Twitter in seconds: “Fiat is hopeless, so yes.” Musk Pitches Bitcoin As Pillar Of America Party Musk’s brief exchange with Brazilian Bitcoiner Renato Lima crystallized two currents that had been converging for days: the billionaire’s split from President Donald Trump over the deficit-ballooning “ Big Beautiful Bill ” and BTC as an answer to the endless money printing in the fiat money system. The Tesla and SpaceX chief had formally unveiled the America Party on July 5, insisting a third force could win a handful of razor-thin House and Senate races and hold the balance of power in Washington. In the same July 4–5 burst of posts, Musk polled 1.25 million X users on whether they wanted “independence from the two-party system”; roughly 65 percent clicked Yes. Trump’s rejoinder—calling Musk “off the rails” and a “train wreck” who was angry about lost EV subsidies—only hardened the billionaire’s stance. Bitcoiners seized the moment. An account styling itself “America Party” replied to Michael Saylor ’s ubiquitous BTC-treasury tracker with the slogan, “Some weeks you HODL. Some decades, you need a new political party.” The line went viral, but fact-checkers and community notes quickly flagged the handle as unaffiliated with Musk, underscoring how little formal infrastructure the nascent party actually possesses at the moment. Still, Musk’s own imprimatur carried more weight than any sock-puppet. Within minutes of the “Fiat is hopeless” tweet, amplification from large crypto accounts pushed impressions past several million, while Bitcoin spiked just above $109,000. The billionaire’s corporate history lends credibility to his promise. Tesla first added Bitcoin to its treasury in February 2021 and, despite later net sales, still holds roughly 11,509 BTC. Musk also enabled (then suspended) Bitcoin payments for Tesla vehicles, citing energy concerns. His new political venture therefore inherits both a reputational stake in the asset and a well-documented willingness to defy orthodoxy—traits that resonate with Bitcoin’s hard-money ethos. Policy ramifications, however, remain cloudy. The America Party has no platform beyond Musk’s tweets, no officers, and no fundraising committees registered with the Federal Election Commission. Even so, its founder’s pledge to target swing districts means crypto regulation could surface as a wedge issue. The prospect of another pro-Bitcoin party confronts Donald Trump with an awkward electoral calculus just as his footing in the tech world erodes. Single-issue Bitcoin and crypto voters—crucial to his 2024 win—now see a new banner whose libertarian accents echo their own. Should Musk field candidates in 2026, he could siphon off the very bloc of tech-savvy, anti-establishment voters that buttressed Trump, tipping razor-thin districts and undercutting the president’s power.

Will it Fall Below $2 in July?","The post XRP Price Prediction 2025—What if it Fails to Break the $2.5 Resistance? Will it Fall Below $2 in July? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price faced a strong push during the weekend, propelling the price above the consolidation. The token formed a lower low, then rebounded and was expected to break through the resistance threshold, which was preventing a strong bullish move. This move comes when the Ripple CTO claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin founder, had stacked a huge number of XRP. In the times when the likelihood of an XRP bull run persists and insane targets of more than $10 or $100 or more are being set, the question arises whether it can make it back to $3. XRP Price Stuck Within an Equilibrium The XRP price has not displayed any major price action since the start of 2025; rather, it has remained consolidated below $2.8. Although the token bounced off the $2.2 support zone, it is showing fewer signs of a breakout above $2.3, which could result in an extended consolidation within the pattern. On the other hand, the token has failed to attract the volume that it possessed during the November 2024 breakout. Hence, the XRP price is feared to maintain a slow & steady consolidation for some more time. The XRP price is finding strong support at the 50-day MA at $2.22, while a resistance is at the 200-day MA at $2.36. Whenever the 200-day MA acts as a resistance to achieve, the crypto is believed to remain under bullish influence, which is substantiated by the rising RSI. Interestingly, the daily RSI has never been to the overbought or oversold zone, suggesting less participation of both the bulls and the bears. However, both are preventing the price from either rising above the resistance or plunging below the local support. What’s Next? Will the XRP Price Reach $5 in 2025? In the broader perspective, the token continues to remain within a massive bullish pattern and still has more room to consolidate as the apex is not nearby. Even if the price failed to rise above the resistance or face a pullback, the bulls could help the token to reach the apex of the decisive symmetrical triangle, with $2 being a strong base. Once the token reaches these levels, a breakout could be imminent, and below are the factors that could influence the XRP price rally to a new ATH. A Favorable Outcome in the Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit : A decisive court ruling for Ripple Labs could eliminate regulatory uncertainty and allow US-based exchanges to relist the token. Increased Institutional Adoption : RippleNet, with its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services, is being adopted by financial institutions for worldwide cross-border payments and hence offering a real-world utility and demand for XRP. XRP Ledger (XRPL) Developments : New technical upgrades such as hooks( smart contracts), sidechains, or the automated market maker (AMM) integration could make XRPL more competitive and attract developers and liquidity. Ripple’s Global Expansion : Ripple’s aggressive expansion into Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America gives XRP broader exposure to high-growth payment corridors. Overall Crypto Market Rally : In a broader bull market driven by macro trends or ETF approvals, XRP could benefit from rising investor sentiment Considering the market conditions and the probable events occurring in the second half of 2025, it is very tough for the XRP price to reach $5, but the token may rise above $3.5 and try hard to reach $4, marking a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-prediction-2025-what-if-it-fails-to-break-the-2-5-resistance-will-it-fall-below-2-in-july/,"TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T07:50:47,"Jack Dorsey Unleashes Revolutionary Decentralized Messaging App Bitchat","BitcoinWorld Jack Dorsey Unleashes Revolutionary Decentralized Messaging App Bitchat The digital world is constantly evolving, and at its forefront are innovators challenging the status quo. One such pioneer, Jack Dorsey , the visionary co-founder of Twitter and Block, is once again making waves, this time with a groundbreaking venture into the realm of private communication. His latest project, a decentralized messaging app named Bitchat, has just launched its beta version, promising a radical shift in how we connect online. This isn’t just another messaging app; it’s a bold statement about privacy, freedom, and true peer-to-peer interaction in the burgeoning Web3 space. Jack Dorsey’s Vision: Redefining Digital Communication with Bitchat For years, Jack Dorsey has been a vocal proponent of decentralization, blockchain technology, and the importance of open protocols. His past endeavors, from co-founding Twitter to leading Square (now Block) into the Bitcoin ecosystem, consistently reflect a commitment to empowering individuals and reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries. Bitchat emerges as a natural extension of this philosophy. Cointelegraph reported on the beta rollout, highlighting its core promise: an encrypted communication environment that operates independently of traditional internet infrastructure. This means your messages aren’t just encrypted; they aren’t stored in a centralized database susceptible to breaches or censorship. It’s a significant departure from the WhatsApps and Telegrams of the world. Why a Decentralized Messaging App Now? In an era dominated by concerns over data privacy, surveillance, and corporate control over personal information, the timing for a truly decentralized messaging app like Bitchat couldn’t be more pertinent. Centralized platforms, while convenient, often come with hidden costs: your data. They collect vast amounts of information, making it vulnerable to hacks, government requests, and targeted advertising. A decentralized approach aims to eliminate these risks by distributing data across a network, putting control back into the hands of the users. This fundamental shift is what makes projects like Bitchat so compelling for anyone concerned about their digital footprint. Understanding Bitchat’s Core: Peer-to-Peer Messaging and Encrypted Communication At its heart, Bitchat is built on the principles of peer-to-peer messaging . This architecture allows users to communicate directly with each other without routing messages through a central server. Think of it like direct mail, but digital and instantaneous. This design choice inherently enhances privacy and censorship resistance. If there’s no central server to shut down or compromise, it becomes significantly harder for external entities to interfere with communication. Beyond its peer-to-peer nature, Bitchat emphasizes encrypted communication . While many mainstream apps offer end-to-end encryption, Bitchat takes it a step further by combining it with a decentralized infrastructure. This means: No Central Data Storage: Messages are not held on a server, drastically reducing the risk of large-scale data breaches. Enhanced Privacy: Without a central authority, there’s no single point for data collection or monitoring. Censorship Resistance: The distributed nature makes it incredibly difficult for any single entity to block or censor messages. Reduced Reliance on Internet Infrastructure: As stated in its whitepaper, Bitchat aims to function even without traditional internet connectivity, suggesting innovative routing mechanisms that could leverage mesh networks or other alternative communication channels. This is a game-changer for regions with unreliable internet or during times of crisis. This combination of features positions Bitchat not just as a secure alternative but as a foundational piece for the future of private digital interaction. The Promise of Web3 Communication: Beyond Traditional Social Media Web3 communication represents a paradigm shift from the centralized models of Web2. It’s about ownership, decentralization, and user empowerment. Bitchat aligns perfectly with this ethos. While the current beta focuses on messaging, the underlying technology could pave the way for a new generation of social interactions that are resistant to the whims of corporate policies or government censorship. Imagine a social media platform where you truly own your data, your identity, and your content, and where communities can flourish without fear of deplatforming. This is the broader vision that projects like Bitchat contribute to. Key differences between Web2 and Web3 communication models: Feature Web2 Communication (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook) Web3 Communication (e.g., Bitchat) Data Storage Centralized servers owned by companies Decentralized network, distributed across user nodes Control Company controls data, access, and content policies User controls their data and communication Privacy Dependent on company policies; data often collected Enhanced by design; minimal data collection Censorship Vulnerable to company or government censorship Highly resistant to censorship Infrastructure Reliance Heavy reliance on traditional internet service providers Aims for independence from traditional internet Bitchat’s Beta: What Does It Mean for Early Adopters? The launch of the Bitchat beta is an exciting development, but what does it entail for those eager to try it out? A beta version typically means the app is in its early stages of development, and users should expect potential bugs, limited features, and a focus on testing core functionalities. For early adopters, this is an opportunity to provide crucial feedback that will shape the app’s future. It’s also a chance to be at the forefront of a movement aiming to redefine digital privacy. Challenges for a new decentralized app often include: User Adoption: Overcoming the network effect of established platforms. Scalability: Ensuring the decentralized network can handle a large volume of users and messages efficiently. User Experience: Making the app as intuitive and user-friendly as its centralized counterparts. Security Audits: Rigorous testing to ensure the encryption and decentralization mechanisms are truly robust. Jack Dorsey’s involvement brings significant attention and credibility, which can help Bitchat overcome some of these initial hurdles. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, inviting developers and privacy advocates to scrutinize and contribute to its evolution. What’s Next for Encrypted Communication and Beyond? The arrival of Bitchat signals a growing trend towards more secure and private forms of encrypted communication . As concerns about data breaches and surveillance continue to mount, demand for solutions that offer true privacy will only increase. Bitchat, with its unique approach to peer-to-peer, decentralized, and infrastructure-agnostic communication, could set a new standard. This development isn’t just about messaging; it’s part of a larger movement to build a more resilient, private, and user-controlled internet. Whether Bitchat becomes the dominant force in this new paradigm or simply paves the way for others, its launch is a significant milestone. It challenges us to rethink our assumptions about digital communication and empowers us to demand greater control over our online lives. In conclusion, Jack Dorsey’s beta launch of Bitchat is more than just a new app; it’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of the internet towards decentralization and user empowerment. By offering a truly private, peer-to-peer, and encrypted communication environment, Bitchat aims to provide a vital alternative to centralized platforms. As the Web3 landscape continues to unfold, innovations like Bitchat are crucial steps towards a future where digital interactions are defined by freedom, privacy, and user control. It’s an exciting time for anyone who believes in the power of decentralization to reshape our digital world.

Analyst Michael van de Poppe Predicts 76% Surge in Coming Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The total altcoin market cap currently stands at $1.16 trillion, reflecting a decline of 23.63% from this year’s peak. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index sits at just 29, signaling that Bitcoin continues to dominate the market . Yet, according to top crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, altcoins may be on the verge of a major breakout. Altcoin Market Overview At the start of 2025, the altcoin market cap was around $1.34 trillion. It reached a peak of $1.51 trillion on January 17, before declining 42.12% by April 8. Despite recovering by 43.6% between April 9 and May 13, the market hasn’t fully bounced back. Since May 8, the market has moved sideways, ranging between $1.01 trillion and $1.26 trillion, indicating consolidation and potential buildup for the next move. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Say? The Altcoin Season Index helps identify whether it’s currently Altcoin season or Bitcoin season. According to the index: Altcoin season = 75% of top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin in the last 90 days Bitcoin season = 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin Currently, only 29 coins out of the top 100 have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 30 days. That confirms we’re in a Bitcoin season, not altcoin season—yet. Bitcoin has surged 36.65% in the last 30 days, dominating the market. Some top-performing altcoins in the same timeframe include: SYRUP : +451.69% PENGU : +268.71% HYPE : +233.70% VIRTUAL : +230.65% SPX : +193.91% WIF : +154.32% AAVE : +115.40% Michael van de Poppe: Alt Season May Be Closer Than You Think In a recent post on X, Michael van de Poppe pointed out that the Altcoin Season Index typically bottoms out in June, historically signaling the start of strong altcoin performance in the second half of the year “We’re still in the middle of the crypto bull market, and with Quantitative Easing expected to ease, the macro environment looks favorable for altcoins to rally again,” Poppe explained . [post_titles_links postid=”479140″] Can This Alt Season Outperform Q4 2023? Poppe also compared the current setup with the Q4 2023 altcoin rally. Back then, the market cap rose from $120.7 billion to $213.43 billion, marking a 76.85% increase. If history repeats, Poppe suggests we could witness another 76% or higher surge in the upcoming altcoin season.

Altcoin Season, or Altseason, is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in price growth. This typically occurs as capital rotates from a consolidating Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to rapid and substantial gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that determines if it’s “Altcoin Season” or “Bitcoin Season” by comparing the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score above 75 indicates Altcoin Season, while a score below 25 (currently around 27) signals Bitcoin Season, meaning Bitcoin is dominating the market. How is the overall crypto market performing today? As of July 7, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed to slightly positive movements. Bitcoin is trading around $109,000, with slight gains. The total crypto market capitalization is growing, with a slight increase over the last week, though altcoin performance is mixed, with some gaining and others declining. What are the top-performing altcoins today? Altcoins showing strong recent activity include Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, and TRON. Broader trends indicate that meme coins (such as SYRUP, PENGU, HYPE, and WIF) and specific Layer 1s (such as AAVE, VIRTUAL, and SPX) have also seen significant gains over the past 30 days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoin-season-loading-analyst-michael-van-de-poppe-predicts-76-surge-in-coming-months/,"ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|AAVE","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T07:10:00,"US Tariffs Unleash Dire Global Economic Uncertainty: What it Means for Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld US Tariffs Unleash Dire Global Economic Uncertainty: What it Means for Crypto Markets The global economic landscape is bracing for a significant shift as the United States prepares to implement new rounds of US Tariffs . This isn’t just about trade; it’s a seismic event with far-reaching implications that could ripple through traditional financial markets and, crucially, reshape the burgeoning cryptocurrency ecosystem. For anyone invested in digital assets, understanding these geopolitical tremors is paramount. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement on Truth Social signals a critical juncture, setting the stage for a period of heightened uncertainty and potential volatility. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how might crypto offer a unique hedge in these turbulent times? Understanding the New US Tariffs and Their Scope The U.S. President’s declaration marks a decisive move in international trade policy. Starting precisely at 16:00 UTC on July 7, tariff letters will be dispatched to various countries worldwide. This initial phase, while significant, is overshadowed by a more pointed measure: an additional 10% tariff specifically targeting nations perceived as supporting the anti-American policies of the BRICS alliance. This isn’t a blanket tariff but a targeted economic pressure point, designed to compel a re-evaluation of international allegiances and trade practices. To grasp the full weight of these US Tariffs , it’s essential to consider a few key aspects: The ‘July 7’ Deadline: This specific date and time act as a clear line in the sand, indicating a rapid implementation rather than a protracted negotiation period. Businesses, supply chains, and governments have a very short window to prepare. Targeted Application: The distinction between general tariff letters and the specific 10% tariff on BRICS supporters highlights a strategic, rather than purely economic, motivation. It’s a blend of trade policy and foreign policy, aiming to exert influence on geopolitical alignments. Precedent and Escalation: Donald Trump’s previous presidency was marked by significant use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool. This new announcement suggests a continuation, and potentially an escalation, of that approach, indicating a willingness to disrupt established trade norms to achieve specific political objectives. These tariffs are not merely taxes on imported goods; they are instruments of economic statecraft, designed to alter trade flows, incentivize domestic production, and pressure foreign governments. Their ripple effects are complex, touching everything from consumer prices to corporate profit margins and, ultimately, global economic stability. The BRICS Alliance: A Catalyst for Global Trade War? The mention of the BRICS Alliance is not incidental; it’s central to understanding the strategic intent behind these new tariffs. BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has recently expanded to include countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, signaling a growing bloc of nations seeking to challenge the existing global order, particularly the dominance of the U.S. dollar and Western-led institutions. The U.S. administration’s accusation of ‘anti-American policies’ from BRICS supporters can encompass a wide range of actions, including: De-dollarization Efforts: BRICS nations are actively pursuing trade in local currencies, reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, which Washington views as undermining its economic leverage. Geopolitical Alignments: Support for nations or policies deemed adversarial to U.S. interests, such as closer ties with Russia or China on critical international issues. Economic Competition: Practices perceived as unfair trade advantages or intellectual property theft, particularly from economic powerhouses within the BRICS bloc. This targeted tariff approach could indeed ignite a more intense Global Trade War . When one major economic power imposes tariffs, the targeted nations often retaliate with their own tariffs, creating a cycle of escalating trade barriers. This tit-for-tat dynamic can severely disrupt international commerce, leading to higher costs for consumers, reduced corporate profits, and slower economic growth worldwide. The BRICS nations, with their collective economic might and growing geopolitical ambition, are unlikely to simply absorb these tariffs without a response, setting the stage for a potentially protracted and damaging economic conflict. What Does This Mean for Global Trade War Dynamics? The imposition of new US Tariffs , especially those aimed at countries aligned with BRICS, fundamentally alters the dynamics of the ongoing Global Trade War . It’s an escalation that moves beyond specific product categories or industries, venturing into the realm of geopolitical alignment and economic coercion. The immediate consequences could be widespread: Area of Impact Potential Outcome Supply Chains Disruption, re-routing, and increased costs as companies seek tariff-free alternatives or absorb duties. This could lead to longer lead times and less efficient production. Consumer Prices Higher prices for imported goods as tariffs are often passed on to consumers. This contributes to inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power. Corporate Profitability Reduced margins for companies reliant on international trade, particularly those importing from or exporting to targeted nations. Some businesses may struggle to remain competitive. Economic Growth Overall dampening of global economic growth due to reduced trade volumes, increased uncertainty, and investment hesitancy. This isn’t just about tariffs on steel or aluminum anymore; it’s about the broader implications for international cooperation and the rules-based global trading system. The more countries engage in retaliatory tariffs, the greater the risk of a full-blown trade war that could spiral into a global recession. Companies that have optimized their supply chains for efficiency and cost-effectiveness over decades will now face immense pressure to re-evaluate and potentially onshore production, leading to significant capital expenditure and potentially higher prices for goods. The Broader Economic Impact Beyond Borders The Economic Impact of these escalating trade tensions will undoubtedly extend far beyond the immediate parties involved. When major economies impose tariffs, it creates a domino effect across interconnected global markets. Consider the following ripple effects: Currency Fluctuations: Trade disputes often lead to currency volatility. Countries facing tariffs might see their currencies weaken as exports become less competitive, while the imposing country’s currency might strengthen, making its exports more expensive. This can create instability in foreign exchange markets, impacting international investments and capital flows. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. When these goods are essential components for domestic industries or consumer products, the cost is often passed on to the end-user, contributing to inflation. This can erode real wages and reduce consumer spending power, further dampening economic activity. Investment Uncertainty: Businesses thrive on predictability. A prolonged Global Trade War creates immense uncertainty, making companies hesitant to invest in new projects, expand operations, or hire more staff. This reduction in investment can stifle innovation and long-term economic growth. Impact on Developing Nations: Smaller, developing economies, often reliant on global supply chains and stable trade relationships, are particularly vulnerable. They may lack the economic resilience to absorb higher import costs or find alternative markets for their exports, potentially leading to economic hardship and social unrest. Furthermore, these tariffs could accelerate the trend towards economic decoupling, where nations strategically reduce their interdependence to mitigate geopolitical risks. While this might be seen as a national security benefit by some, it carries the significant cost of reduced global efficiency, innovation, and overall prosperity. The long-term Economic Impact could reshape global alliances and trade routes for decades to come. How Will This Reshape the Crypto Market Impact? While the immediate focus of US Tariffs and a potential Global Trade War is on traditional goods and services, the cryptocurrency market is not immune to these macroeconomic shifts. In fact, it might be uniquely positioned to react, both positively and negatively, to such turbulence. The Crypto Market Impact could manifest in several ways: Potential Upsides for Crypto: Hedge Against Traditional Market Volatility: In times of economic uncertainty and stock market instability, investors often seek safe-haven assets. While Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has increased, it can still act as a diversification tool. If trade wars lead to significant downturns in equity markets, some capital might flow into cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, seen by some as ‘digital gold.’ Inflationary Hedge: If tariffs lead to higher inflation in fiat currencies, the fixed supply nature of many cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, could make them attractive as an inflation hedge. People might seek to preserve their purchasing power by converting fiat into crypto. De-dollarization Acceleration: The BRICS alliance’s push for de-dollarization could be intensified by these tariffs. If countries seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar for international trade, this could inadvertently boost interest in decentralized digital currencies or even spur the development and adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as alternative settlement layers. Increased Adoption in Targeted Regions: Countries heavily impacted by tariffs or facing economic sanctions might see increased adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means to circumvent traditional financial systems or access global markets. This has been observed in regions with high inflation or restrictive capital controls. Potential Downsides and Challenges for Crypto: Overall Market Contagion: Cryptocurrencies, while distinct, are still part of the broader financial ecosystem. A severe global economic downturn caused by trade wars could lead to a general risk-off sentiment, causing investors to liquidate all assets, including crypto, to cover losses or maintain liquidity. Regulatory Scrutiny: As geopolitical tensions rise, governments might increase scrutiny and regulation of cryptocurrencies, viewing them as potential tools for sanctions evasion or capital flight. This could lead to stricter KYC/AML requirements or even outright bans in some jurisdictions. Reduced Disposable Income: If tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and reduced economic growth, people will have less disposable income, which could translate to less capital flowing into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the Crypto Market Impact will depend on the severity and duration of the trade conflict, as well as the specific reactions of central banks and governments. While cryptocurrencies offer unique properties that could serve as a hedge, they are not immune to global economic shocks. Investors will need to monitor developments closely and consider how these macro trends align with their long-term investment strategies. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Investors In an environment shaped by evolving US Tariffs and a looming Global Trade War , investors across all asset classes, including crypto, must adopt a proactive and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Crypto Investors: Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin and Ethereum are foundational, consider diversifying into other promising altcoins that might have unique use cases or less correlation with traditional markets. However, avoid over-diversification into highly speculative assets. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the potential for increased volatility, employing a DCA strategy can mitigate risk. Instead of making a single large investment, invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations. This averages out your purchase price over time. Stay Informed and Research: The crypto market is highly sensitive to news, particularly macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Follow reputable news sources, understand the fundamentals of your chosen assets, and be aware of regulatory changes. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of extreme volatility, parking some capital in stablecoins can provide a temporary refuge from market swings, allowing you to re-enter when conditions stabilize or opportunities arise. Understand the Macro Landscape: Don’t view crypto in isolation. The impact of the BRICS Alliance , the Economic Impact of tariffs, and broader global events will inevitably influence crypto prices. A holistic understanding is key. Broader Investment Considerations: Review Supply Chains: For businesses and investors in traditional sectors, understanding the vulnerability of supply chains to tariff disruptions is crucial. Companies with diversified manufacturing bases or domestic alternatives might fare better. Monitor Inflation: Keep a close eye on inflation data. Persistent inflationary pressures due to tariffs could influence central bank policies, impacting interest rates and overall market liquidity. Geopolitical Risk Assessment: Incorporate geopolitical risk into your investment analysis. Companies or sectors with significant exposure to countries involved in trade disputes might face headwinds. This period of heightened trade tensions underscores the importance of resilience and adaptability in investment strategies. While challenges abound, new opportunities can also emerge for those who are well-prepared and willing to look beyond conventional wisdom. The ongoing Global Trade War could inadvertently accelerate the shift towards decentralized finance and alternative economic models, creating a fascinating landscape for the future of money. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For The announcement of new US Tariffs and the targeted pressure on the BRICS Alliance marks a significant turning point in global economic relations. The path forward is fraught with uncertainty, and several key indicators will determine the ultimate Economic Impact and subsequent Crypto Market Impact : 1. Retaliatory Measures: The immediate reaction of the targeted nations will be crucial. Will they impose their own tariffs? Will they seek to strengthen economic ties within the BRICS bloc, potentially accelerating de-dollarization efforts? The nature and scale of these retaliations will dictate the severity of the Global Trade War . 2. Supply Chain Adjustments: Businesses worldwide will be scrambling to adjust their supply chains. Watch for shifts in manufacturing locations, sourcing strategies, and logistics. Companies that can adapt quickly will be more resilient. 3. Inflation and Consumer Behavior: Monitor inflation rates in major economies. If tariffs lead to significant price increases, consumer spending could decline, further impacting economic growth. Central banks’ responses to these inflationary pressures will also be critical. 4. Geopolitical Developments: Beyond trade, observe the broader geopolitical landscape. Any further escalation of tensions or shifts in alliances could have profound implications for global stability and market sentiment. 5. Crypto Market Trends: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action and its correlation with traditional assets. Look for signs of increased institutional adoption or retail interest in crypto as a hedge against economic instability. The performance of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and stablecoins in this environment will also be telling. The unfolding scenario is a complex interplay of economics, politics, and technology. For those in the cryptocurrency space, this period could either be a test of resilience or an unprecedented opportunity for growth and mainstream adoption, as the traditional financial system grapples with profound structural shifts. Conclusion: Navigating a New Era of Global Trade and Digital Finance The U.S. decision to deliver new US Tariffs starting July 7, particularly the targeted 10% tariff on countries supporting the anti-American policies of the BRICS Alliance , heralds a new, more uncertain chapter in global economic relations. This aggressive stance is poised to escalate the ongoing Global Trade War , triggering a profound Economic Impact that will ripple across continents, affecting supply chains, consumer prices, and corporate profitability. For the cryptocurrency ecosystem, this geopolitical and economic upheaval presents a unique duality of challenges and opportunities. While traditional markets may face increased volatility and downturns, the unique characteristics of digital assets could position them as potential hedges against inflation and traditional financial instability, leading to a significant Crypto Market Impact . Investors must remain vigilant, informed, and adaptable, recognizing that the interplay between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets is becoming increasingly intertwined. As nations navigate these turbulent waters, the world watches to see how this crucial move will reshape the future of trade, international cooperation, and the evolving role of digital currencies.

2025-07-07T07:06:50,"Bitcoin ETF weekly inflows fall 65%, market cools after $110K BTC rally","Weekly inflows into the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant drop last week as fading Fed rate cut hopes and Trump’s newly passed budget bill tempered investor appetite. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $769.6 million over the past week, a 65% drop from the prior week when these investment products drew in $2.22 billion. The week began with $102.14 million in net inflows on Monday, followed by significant outflows of $342.25 million on Tuesday. Momentum reversed midweek, with inflows of $407.78 million on Wednesday and $601.94 million on Thursday, the highest single-day inflow since May. Markets remained closed on Friday in observance of the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Among the issuers, BlackRock’s IBIT led with $336.8 million in weekly inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $248.4 million and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $160 million. Other funds, including Bitwise’s BITB, Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and VanEck’s HODL, along with minor inflows into Grayscale’s new BTC funds, added another $109.2 million in combined inflows. These were partially offset by net outflows of $84.9 million from Grayscale’s legacy GBTC. You might also like: Tron eyes new local highs after 13B transactions and RSI surge The sharp decline in inflows is partly attributed to profit-taking activity, as Bitcoin approached its all-time high near $111,960. Investors are likely locked in gains ahead of the holiday weekend, limiting directional conviction and reducing short-term flows into crypto investment vehicles. Broader macroeconomic developments also weighed on sentiment. The June U.S. jobs report came in stronger than expected, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 147,000 versus consensus estimates around 110,000. As the report weakened hopes for a July rate cut , investors started rebalancing their exposure to assets such as Bitcoin. Simultaneously, market sentiment was impacted by the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, a comprehensive tax and spending package that cleared the Senate on July 1. Although the bill included fiscal reforms, it failed to include crypto-related tax provisions that had been proposed by pro-crypto lawmakers, including favorable treatment for staking and mining activities. This disappointed segments of the crypto industry, who had hoped for regulatory clarity and tax relief. Following the Senate vote, Bitcoin briefly dropped to $105,000 on July 2, as the investors digested the bill’s implications on the crypto industry. However, the asset swiftly rebounded above $110,000, a day later, after President Trump announced a new trade deal with a key ASEAN partner, restoring some investor confidence. As of press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $109,000, showing little change on the day and hovering just 2.5% below its all-time high. Despite lingering concerns over U.S. tariffs, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. Standard Chartered recently reaffirmed its Q3 target of $135,000 for Bitcoin and reiterated its year-end forecast of $200,000, citing continued institutional demand and constrained exchange supply. Other analysts, including those at Bernstein and BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes, have set even more aggressive targets between $200,000 and $250,000 by year-end, contingent on ETF inflows and global liquidity conditions.

2025-07-07T07:00:56,"Elon Musk Bitcoin: The Revolutionary Future of Political Crypto Adoption","BitcoinWorld Elon Musk Bitcoin: The Revolutionary Future of Political Crypto Adoption The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing once again, thanks to a bold declaration from none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In a move that could reshape the intersection of technology and governance, Musk has indicated that his newly formed ‘America Party’ is poised to accept Bitcoin . This isn’t just a headline; it’s a potential game-changer for the digital asset landscape and political fundraising, signaling a fascinating shift in how political movements might operate in the digital age. Elon Musk Bitcoin: A Bold New Era for Digital Currency? Elon Musk, a figure synonymous with innovation and disruption, has once again sent ripples through the financial world. His recent statement on X, confirming that his ‘America Party’ would embrace Bitcoin , was succinct yet profound: ‘Fiat is hopeless, so yes.’ This direct response to a query about the party’s stance on cryptocurrency immediately highlights Musk’s long-standing skepticism towards traditional fiat currencies and his strong belief in the decentralized nature of digital assets. His personal endorsement carries immense weight, given his influence across technology, finance, and social media. What does this mean for the future trajectory of Elon Musk Bitcoin interactions and the broader cryptocurrency market? Musk’s perspective on fiat currencies isn’t new. He has often expressed concerns about inflation and the centralized control inherent in traditional financial systems. His embrace of Bitcoin, therefore, aligns perfectly with his techno-libertarian leanings and his vision for a more decentralized future. This announcement could inspire other public figures and political organizations to seriously consider cryptocurrency as a viable financial tool, pushing the boundaries of traditional campaign finance. The America Party Bitcoin Stance: What Does It Signify? While details about the ‘America Party’ itself remain nascent, its stated intention to accept Bitcoin is a significant development. Traditionally, political campaigns and parties rely heavily on fiat donations, navigating complex regulations and banking systems. By signaling an openness to cryptocurrency, the ‘America Party’ could be pioneering a new model for political financing. This move could potentially: Attract a tech-savvy donor base: Appealing directly to individuals and communities already invested in the digital economy and seeking innovative ways to support political causes. Increase transparency: Blockchain transactions are inherently public, potentially offering a new level of transparency in political donations, though privacy concerns for individual donors would also need addressing through appropriate protocols. Reduce transaction fees: Compared to traditional payment processors, cryptocurrency transactions can sometimes offer lower fees, benefiting both donors and the party by maximizing the impact of each contribution. Enable global reach: Facilitating donations from supporters worldwide, bypassing traditional cross-border banking hurdles and expanding the potential donor pool significantly. The adoption of an America Party Bitcoin policy sets a precedent that other political entities might eventually consider, especially as digital literacy and crypto adoption continue to grow globally. This could be a test case for how a political movement leverages cutting-edge financial technology. Is Political Crypto Adoption the Next Frontier? The idea of political entities embracing cryptocurrency is not entirely new, but a high-profile figure like Elon Musk championing it could accelerate its mainstream acceptance. Political crypto adoption presents both exciting opportunities and considerable challenges for parties, donors, and regulators alike. Benefits of Crypto in Politics: Efficiency and Speed: Cryptocurrency transactions can be processed quickly, potentially speeding up fundraising efforts and allowing for rapid deployment of funds for campaign activities. Innovation Showcase: Demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, appealing to a demographic interested in technological advancement and modern solutions to traditional problems. Empowerment: Offers a direct way for individuals to contribute, potentially bypassing intermediaries and giving donors more control over their contributions. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing compliance risks and requiring careful navigation of campaign finance laws. Volatility: The fluctuating value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could impact the real-world value of donations, making budgeting and financial planning more complex for campaigns. Security Concerns: Managing and securing crypto assets requires specialized knowledge and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public Perception: Overcoming skepticism or lack of understanding among the general public about cryptocurrencies remains a hurdle, requiring education and clear communication. Traceability vs. Anonymity: While blockchain is transparent, the pseudonymity of crypto addresses can complicate donor identification for regulatory purposes, necessitating robust KYC/AML procedures. A comprehensive table outlining potential pros and cons of political crypto adoption could further illustrate these points, comparing it with traditional fundraising methods and highlighting the specific legal and logistical hurdles. The Expanding Horizon of Bitcoin Acceptance Musk’s statement further solidifies a growing trend of Bitcoin acceptance across various sectors. From major corporations like Tesla (which previously accepted Bitcoin for vehicle vehicle purchases and holds significant amounts on its balance sheet) to small businesses and even entire nations (El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender), the cryptocurrency is steadily gaining traction beyond its early adopter base. This increasing mainstream integration points to a future where digital assets play a more central role in commerce and finance. For political organizations, accepting Bitcoin could not only broaden their donor base but also signal an alignment with a digitally progressive future. The practical implications of widespread Bitcoin acceptance include the development of more user-friendly payment gateways, increased liquidity in the market, and greater public awareness. As more entities, both commercial and political, embrace Bitcoin, its utility as a medium of exchange and a store of value is reinforced, contributing to its long-term stability and growth. This trend suggests a gradual but persistent shift in how value is transferred and perceived globally. The Future of Fiat: Is It Truly Hopeless? Elon Musk’s dismissive ‘Fiat is hopeless’ comment is perhaps the most provocative part of his statement. It reflects a growing sentiment among cryptocurrency proponents who view traditional government-issued currencies as inherently flawed due to inflation, central bank control, and opaque monetary policies. While fiat currencies remain the backbone of the global economy, concerns about their long-term stability and fairness are increasingly voiced. The rise of cryptocurrencies, designed to be decentralized and often deflationary (or at least with controlled supply), offers an alternative vision. The debate around the future of fiat versus cryptocurrencies is complex. Fiat currencies are backed by government trust and legal tender laws, providing a degree of stability and widespread acceptance for daily transactions. However, their value can be eroded by inflation and government policies. Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, offer characteristics like decentralization, transparency, and often a capped supply, which appeal to those wary of traditional systems. Whether the future of fiat is truly ‘hopeless’ remains a subject of intense debate, but Musk’s powerful endorsement of Bitcoin certainly adds fuel to the fire, pushing conversations about monetary policy and economic systems into new territory and challenging conventional wisdom. A Revolutionary Step Forward? Elon Musk’s declaration that his ‘America Party’ will accept Bitcoin is more than just a fleeting news item; it’s a significant indicator of the evolving relationship between digital assets and the political sphere. It highlights the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, the potential for innovative fundraising models, and the ongoing debate about the long-term viability of traditional fiat currencies. As the world watches how this unfolds, one thing is clear: the intersection of technology, finance, and politics is becoming increasingly dynamic, with Bitcoin poised to play a crucial role in shaping its future. This move could indeed be a revolutionary step towards a more digitally integrated political landscape, setting a precedent for how future political campaigns are funded and how citizens engage with their chosen representatives.

2025-07-07T07:00:50,"Altcoin Season Index: Unpacking the Crypto Market’s Powerful Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index: Unpacking the Crypto Market’s Powerful Bitcoin Season Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market? The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric for understanding market dynamics, stands at 27 as of 00:30 UTC on July 7. This particular number isn’t just a data point; it’s a clear signal that the broader cryptocurrency market is currently entrenched in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . For anyone engaged in cryptocurrency investing , understanding what this means is paramount to navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), designed to offer a snapshot of market sentiment and performance. It helps investors gauge whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or the vast universe of altcoins. But how exactly is this index calculated, and what do its numbers truly represent? The Core Metric: The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. This 90-day window provides a robust, short-to-medium term view of market leadership. Performance Comparison: The key to the index is its comparative nature. It doesn’t just look at how altcoins are doing in isolation; instead, it measures how many of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) during the specified period. Defining the Seasons: The index has a range from 1 to 100, with specific thresholds indicating different market phases: Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin. A higher index score, typically above 75, points to a strong Altcoin Season. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score of 25 or below, like our current 27, firmly places us in Bitcoin’s territory. No Dominant Season: Scores between 26 and 74 generally indicate a more balanced market, or a period where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins show overwhelming dominance. Understanding these definitions is crucial for any investor looking to make informed decisions about their altcoin performance and overall portfolio strategy. Navigating Bitcoin Season: What Does it Mean for Your Portfolio? With the Altcoin Season Index at 27, the message is clear: Bitcoin is currently leading the charge. But what are the practical implications of a Bitcoin Season for your cryptocurrency investing strategies? During Bitcoin Season, we typically observe several key market behaviors: Bitcoin’s Dominance Grows: Bitcoin tends to absorb a larger share of the total crypto market capitalization. This often happens as capital flows from altcoins into Bitcoin, or new capital entering the market opts for the perceived safety and liquidity of BTC. Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, struggle to gain significant traction against Bitcoin. While some might see minor pumps, sustained rallies are less common, and many may even bleed value when measured against BTC. Flight to Quality: Investors often view Bitcoin as the less risky asset within the crypto space, especially during periods of uncertainty or consolidation. This can lead to a ‘flight to quality’ where funds move from more speculative altcoins into Bitcoin. Market Consolidation: Bitcoin Season can sometimes coincide with periods of market consolidation or even correction, where Bitcoin acts as a relative safe haven compared to the higher volatility of altcoins. For investors, this often means a strategic shift is warranted. Rather than chasing every altcoin pump, a focus on Bitcoin or a more cautious approach to altcoin exposure might be beneficial. This period is less about explosive altcoin performance and more about Bitcoin establishing or reinforcing its market position. Why Do Crypto Market Trends Shift Between Seasons? The cyclical nature of the crypto market, oscillating between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons, is driven by a complex interplay of factors. Understanding these underlying dynamics is key to predicting future shifts in crypto market trends . Several catalysts can trigger a shift: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rate changes, inflation, and geopolitical events can all influence investor risk appetite. During periods of high uncertainty, investors tend to de-risk, moving capital into Bitcoin, which is often seen as a digital store of value. When confidence returns, capital may flow back into higher-risk altcoins. Bitcoin Halving Events: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have preceded significant bull runs for Bitcoin, often initiating a Bitcoin Season before altcoins eventually catch up. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional interest, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs or major corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, can drive up Bitcoin’s price and dominance, pulling capital from altcoins. Technological Innovation & Narratives: Breakthroughs in altcoin ecosystems (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions) or compelling new narratives can ignite investor interest in specific altcoins, potentially leading to an Altcoin Season. However, during Bitcoin Season, these narratives might struggle to gain widespread adoption. Market Sentiment and Fear & Greed Index: Extreme fear often sees capital consolidate into Bitcoin, while extreme greed can lead to speculative altcoin rallies. These factors collectively shape the ongoing tug-of-war between Bitcoin’s foundational strength and altcoins’ innovative potential, dictating the prevailing crypto market trends . Actionable Insights for Cryptocurrency Investing During Bitcoin Season Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 27, how should a savvy investor adjust their cryptocurrency investing strategy? This period calls for a nuanced approach, prioritizing capital preservation and strategic positioning over chasing speculative gains. Strategies to Consider: Focus on Bitcoin (BTC): During Bitcoin Season, allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to BTC is often a prudent move. Bitcoin tends to be more resilient and can act as a better store of value compared to most altcoins during these periods. Evaluate Altcoin Holdings: Review your existing altcoin portfolio. Identify projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Consider reducing exposure to highly speculative or illiquid altcoins that may suffer more significantly. Accumulate During Dips: If you believe in the long-term potential of certain altcoins, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate them at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. However, exercise caution and use dollar-cost averaging. Stablecoin Positioning: Holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins can provide liquidity to capitalize on future opportunities, whether it’s a dip in Bitcoin or the eventual return of Altcoin Season. Research and Due Diligence: Use this time to deepen your understanding of various altcoin projects. When the market eventually shifts, you’ll be better prepared to identify potential winners. Pay attention to technological advancements and genuine adoption rather than just price action. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management practices. Avoid over-leveraging and set stop-loss orders to protect your capital from significant drawdowns, especially with altcoins that can experience rapid declines. Remember, while the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insight into current crypto market trends , it’s just one tool. Combine it with your own research and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: When Might Altcoin Performance Reign Again? While we are firmly in Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is inherently cyclical. The question on many investors’ minds is: what could signal a shift back towards widespread altcoin performance and a new Altcoin Season? Several factors typically precede or accompany a resurgence in altcoin dominance: Bitcoin Price Stability or Consolidation: Often, a strong Altcoin Season begins after Bitcoin has had a significant run-up and then enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital that flowed into BTC to ‘rotate’ back into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Major Altcoin-Specific Catalysts: Significant upgrades (e.g., Ethereum’s EIPs or Layer 2 rollouts), new project launches with strong utility, or major partnerships can spark rallies in specific altcoins that then cascade across the market. Increased Risk Appetite: A general improvement in global economic sentiment and investor confidence can lead to a willingness to take on more risk, benefiting higher-beta altcoins. Decreased Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained downtrend in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart is a strong indicator that altcoins are beginning to outperform. The Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, meaning it confirms a trend that is already underway. Therefore, observing the underlying factors and market sentiment is crucial for anticipating the next shift in crypto market trends . Patience and a well-researched strategy are your best allies in navigating these cycles. Conclusion: Mastering the Seasons of Cryptocurrency Investing The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 27 serves as a vital reminder that the crypto market operates in distinct cycles. We are presently in a definitive Bitcoin Season , a period where Bitcoin’s performance generally outshines that of most altcoins. Understanding this dynamic is not merely academic; it’s fundamental to effective cryptocurrency investing . By recognizing the signals of the index and the broader crypto market trends , investors can adapt their strategies, focusing on capital preservation and strategic accumulation during Bitcoin’s reign, while preparing for the eventual return of robust altcoin performance . Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to the space, staying informed about these market indicators empowers you to make more informed decisions and navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of digital assets with greater confidence.

2025-07-07T07:00:04,"XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important","The XRP price has been holding on pretty tightly to its support level above $2.2 and continues to be a major level of pushback for the bears. This has shown that buyers are beginning to make a comeback at this level amid predictions that it will be the bounce point for the next rally. Regardless of this, a crypto analyst still believes that this support remains at risk as bears continue to push down on the price, and the result could be a major price crash from here. XRP Price Could Stage A Classic Bear Trap While there has been some recovery in the crypto market and, by extension, the XRP price, there has not been enough momentum to show that this is a sustained increase. This is something that crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise alludes to in their latest analysis, warning that it is possible that the digital asset might end up seeing a classic bear trap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The reason behind this is the fact that there have been a number of bearish developments on the XRP price chart that suggest that the price is likely to go down. For one, a Change of Character toward the more bearish side puts sellers in the lead, and this usually signals the start of a bearish downturn. Another development that has rocked the altcoin is an inverse Cup and Handle pattern that is still in the process of playing out. The crypto analyst also explained that these developments, in addition to the break below the key support trendline, suggest that a crash is coming for the XRP price. From here, bears are already applying pressure that could result in a 10% crash. This would push the cryptocurrency back toward the previous support, and according to the analyst’s chart, this lies just above the $2 level. What this means is that a crash from here also puts the altcoin at risk of falling below $2, something that would be incredibly bearish and could lead to freefall. Wait For Confirmation Before Moving MyCryptoParadise outlined that the best way to play this analysis is to wait for confirmation. With the bearish thesis, they explain that it is best to wait for the XRP price to see a “proper pullback” before they enter the market. This would increase the risk-to-reward ratio after the trend direction has been confirmed. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen However, there is also the possibility that the XRP price does not crash from here and that lies at the $2.28 level. The analyst explained that if the price is able to cleanly break above this level and make a successful close above $2.28, then it would invalidate the bearish thesis and mark a continuation of the uptrend. “In such a case, it’s better to stay patient and wait for clearer price action before making any decisions,” the analyst said.

2025-07-07T06:58:15,"Hong Kong to limit the number of stablecoin licenses issued in 2025","Hong Kong may begin issuing stablecoin licenses before the end of 2025. Still, the number will likely remain in the “single digits,” according to Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury. As per the local newspaper Ming Pao , published Monday, Hui said the stablecoin licensing regime is expected to take effect in August. Authorities aim to issue limited licenses within the year, reflecting a cautious but proactive approach to digital asset oversight. Hui said they hope stablecoins can help tackle real-world economic challenges, especially cross-border payments. This is particularly relevant in regions with volatile local currencies or underdeveloped financial systems. He added that fiat-backed stablecoins could lower transaction costs and improve the efficiency of international payments. Hong Kong eyes regional dominance as stablecoin race heats up Initially, Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox and licensing plans targeted Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoins. However, there is growing industry interest in offshore yuan-pegged alternatives. Chinese tech giants JD.com and Ant Group are reportedly lobbying China’s central bank to greenlight such offerings, intensifying the regional stablecoin race . Hui emphasized that any stablecoin involving foreign currencies would require close coordination with relevant jurisdictions. While the current framework allows stablecoins backed by legal tender, regulators must weigh exchange rate impacts and systemic risks when foreign currencies are involved. The regulatory activity in Hong Kong is emerging as the popularity of stablecoins soars worldwide. In the US, a landmark regulatory bill to regulate stablecoins, the GENIUS Act , passed the Senate and is waiting for House review. President Donald Trump has feverishly backed rapid passage. At the same time, China’s central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, recognized that stablecoins and CBDCs have increasingly influenced global payment systems. Although things haven’t been that great for crypto in mainland China (where cryptocurrency trading and mining have been banned for some time now), Hong Kong has been making a name for itself as a crypto haven. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) opened a stablecoin sandbox, drawing key industry participants such as Standard Chartered, Animoca Brands, Hong Kong Telecommunications (HKT), JD Coinlink, and RD InnoTech. The city’s decision to license stablecoins shows its ambition to be a central figure in the future of digital payments across Asia and beyond. Hong Kong sets global standard with new stablecoin licensing law Just a few weeks ago, Hong Kong passed a new stablecoin bill, expanding its cryptocurrency licensing framework as global regulators increasingly move to oversee digital assets. Unlike highly volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world assets like fiat currencies or commodities, including gold. The new legislation targets fiat-referenced stablecoins and introduces a licensing mandate for issuers under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Under the new law, stablecoin issuers must meet a series of requirements, including maintaining full asset reserves and segregating client assets. The HKMA said the framework is designed to “enhance Hong Kong’s existing regulatory framework on virtual-asset (VA) activities, thereby fostering financial stability and encouraging financial innovation.” The authority added that further consultations would be held to finalize regulatory details. The government confirmed that the stablecoin regime is expected to take effect later this year, with a transitional period to help industry participants adapt. This legislation builds on Hong Kong’s 2023 rollout of a broader virtual asset licensing regime, which applies to crypto firms offering services to retail investors. Until recently, stablecoins were not covered under that framework. YeFeng Gong, Risk and Strategy Director at HashKey OTC, the trading division of licensed crypto platform HashKey Group, noted that Hong Kong’s new stablecoin policy sets a global benchmark by mandating full reserve backing, strict redemption guarantees, and HKMA oversight. He added that the policy provides institutional-level assurance for traders and strengthens Hong Kong’s position as a frontrunner in regulated digital finance.

In the High Court, frustrated users are standing up to Zettai, WazirX’s Singapore entity, claiming their unhacked Bitcoin, XRP, TRX, BNB, USDT, and even fiat balances have been wrongly frozen by Zettai, WazirX’s Singapore company. Now, an affidavit by Romy Johnson may become a big turning point for crypto rights. The Big Problem: Frozen Assets At the center of this fight is how Zettai grouped all user assets. According to Romy Johnson’s 40-page affidavit , these are: unhacked coins (Category A), fiat-like INR (Category B), and the hacked ETH/ERC-20 tokens (Category C). But under Singapore’s law, only real debts can be restructured, not user-owned assets held in trust. Users say Zettai crossed the line by using everyone’s coins to push a plan that doesn’t protect innocent holders.

Blockchain records show something odd: the stolen coins were moved using internal multisig wallets that needed multiple approvals. No clear sign of an outside attack has been shown so far. Therefore, this kills Zettai’s excuse that it was an outside hack. Meanwhile, users are now calling out Zettai for hiding key details. They want the names of people who approved these transfers. They also want an audit to check where all the coins went and who should be held responsible. Where the Court Fight Stands Now Singapore’s High Court already rejected Zettai’s first scheme because it hid links to an offshore shell company. Now, Romy Johnson’s affidavit shows this is not just about one exchange. He cites major court cases proving that crypto held in trust belongs to the users, even during bankruptcy. However, the next hearing in WazirX’s ongoing case has now been rescheduled for July 15, 2025 . Will WazirX Return the Money? At the heart of it, this is about protecting user funds. Meanwhile, Zettai claims it will repay users once the new plan is approved. But trust is low.

But Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , the meme world’s rising star, are the three that stand out as the best bets for 30x to 60x returns by the end of the year. Dogecoin (DOGE): The King Returns Dogecoin needs no introduction. DOGE is trading around $0.16, with a robust daily trading volume of $558.93 million and a market cap of $24.61 billion. Technically, DOGE is flashing bullish signals—having just broken out of a prolonged falling wedge pattern on the charts, accompanied by a weekly MACD bullish crossover. Historically, there has been a relationship of 0.67 between DOGE and Bitcoin. This means that as the price of BTC increases, the cost of DOGE typically rises as well. If BTC rises to $180,000, DOGE may increase to between $4.80 and $9.60, representing a 30x to 60x rise from its current value. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Underdog Poised to Explode Trading at $0.00001179 with a daily volume of $101.03 million and a $6.78 billion market cap, SHIB is quietly building momentum. On the technical front, SHIB has recently completed a bullish W-pattern and is forming a textbook inverted head-and-shoulders—a pattern often preceding massive upward breakouts. Its SHIB/BTC trading pair has climbed 3.16% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing its strong correlation with BTC (historically ranging from 0.82 to 0.92). Should BTC skyrocket to $180,000, SHIB could ride the wave to a staggering $0.0007074—up to 60x its current price. For a coin once written off as a joke, SHIB is shaping up to be a serious contender in the meme coin resurgence. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The New Meme King in the Making If DOGE is the king and SHIB the challenger, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the next meme legend ready to storm the throne. What makes Little Pepe different? It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a fully functional Layer 2 blockchain powered by meme magic and serious tech. Built for speed, low fees, and scalability, LILPEPE doesn’t just ride Ethereum’s coattails—it out-memes it, delivering both fun and function in equal measure. Currently in its red-hot presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $2.5 million, with Stage 3 selling out ahead of schedule. The token is now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, a 30% increase from its initial price. With over 2.6 billion LILPEPE tokens sold—71% of the presale allocation—investor confidence is surging. The project is rumored to be backed by several influential anonymous figures who have previously helped catapult major meme coins to success. Their involvement has added significant credibility, driving community excitement to new highs. The most compelling reason to watch LILPEPE is its growth potential. Analysts speculate that if BTC reaches $180,000, LILPEPE could surge to between $0.0715 and $0.13, representing a potential 60x gain from its current presale price. In addition, Little Pepe’s team is building an entire meme-powered ecosystem, positioning it not just as a coin but as a full-blown movement. To mark its meteoric rise and bring the community along for the ride, Little Pepe has launched one of the largest giveaways in the history of meme coins. This $777,000 giveaway campaign has gained over 17,000 entries, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. Final Thoughts: The Meme Coin Moment Is Here With Bitcoin potentially heading for $180,000, we’re on the cusp of another epic altcoin season—and meme coins are once again at the forefront of that narrative. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most unique of them all—a meme coin with utility, community firepower, and early-stage explosiveness that could eclipse both DOGE and SHIB in this cycle. For those looking to ride the next meme coin rocket, Little Pepe isn’t just a contender—it might just be the main event. Presale is live. Meme magic is real. Don’t miss the $LILPEPE wave.

2025-07-07T06:52:48,"Elon Musk’s new ‘America Party’ will embrace Bitcoin, claiming fiat to be ‘hopeless’","Elon Musk plans to establish a new party called ‘America Party’ to challenge the two-party system in the U.S. He claims the party will support Bitcoin, as he deems fiat to be ‘hopeless.’ On July 7, the tech billionaire and social media platform owner declared on his official X account that his new ‘America Party’ would be the solution to the “centrist” problem in the U.S’ two-party system. Replying to another X user, Elon Musk confirmed that the party would embrace Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Will America Party embrace Bitcoin?” asked X user Renato Lima. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” said Elon Musk in his post . Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 The post garnered major support from cryptocurrency and Bitcoin advocates including Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser and Founder of IBC Group and co-founder of NFT Technologies Mario Nawfal. Many crypto figureheads claimed that they would “vote” for Elon Musk’s America Party if it championed Bitcoin. “Crypto could be the strongest tool to fight inflation, and Washington’s addiction to money printing and runaway spending,” said Mario Nawfal in his post . You might also like: Dogecoin rises over 5% after Elon Musk threatens DOGE haters with federal action Director of Bitcoin Strategy at Scientific, Joe Burnett, also voiced out his support for Musk’s views on fiat being a hopeless currency. He stated that digital money could be instrumental in creating economic incentives for smaller more efficient government systems. It’s less about politics and more about creating monetary tools that restructure the economic incentives,” Burnett weighed in, replying to Musk’s earlier post. In response to Musk’s idea to form a third political party, his ally-turned-rival President Donald Trump said that Musk had gone “off the rails” in the past few weeks. He said a third party would only serve to create disruption and chaos to the existing system. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – The System seems not designed for them,” said Trump in a TruthSocial post . What is Elon Musk’s America Party? Earlier this month on July 4th, Musk announced his plans to form the America Party. He launched a poll on X asking whether he should create an independent party to challenge the current two-party system in the U.S. The poll received over 1.2 million votes, with 65.4% voting YES to the America party. “Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!” said Musk in his post . Although the party itself has yet to be fully realized, Musk has stated that the way to carry out an independent party would be to secure two to three Senate sears and around eight to 10 House districts. “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” continued Musk. Earlier this year, Elon Musk and President Donald Trump had a falling out which resulted in a big political blowout between the two men who were once political allies. In June, Musk called Trump’s $3.4 trillion Big, Beautiful Bill a “disgusting abomination” and accused Republican lawmakers of fiscal dishonesty. The Big Beautiful Bill is a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump’s second-term. The bill passed with a House vote of 218 to 214. It includes several items including an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, cuts to health care and food programs, as well as other tax cuts and breaks.
