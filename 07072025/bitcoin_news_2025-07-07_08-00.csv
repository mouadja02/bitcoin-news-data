2025-07-07T05:59:04,"Metaplanet Acquires 2,205 More Bitcoins, Pushing Total Holdings to $1.7B","Japanese firm Metaplanet has expanded its Bitcoin treasury strategy with the purchase of 2,205 additional BTC, the company announced on July 7 . Key Takeaways: Metaplanet bought 2,205 BTC, raising total holdings to 15,555 BTC worth $1.7 billion. BTC Yield jumped 15.1% in one week, adding 2,017 BTC valued at 31.7 billion yen. The firm’s Bitcoin treasury has quadrupled since March, reflecting an aggressive accumulation strategy. The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield Jumps 15.1%, Adds 2,017 BTC in a Week According to company disclosures, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a key metric tracking the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share, rose 15.1% between July 1 and July 7, adding 2,017 BTC worth 31.7 billion yen in the quarter-to-date period. BTC Yield highlights the net Bitcoin growth relative to share dilution, which the firm views as a measure of shareholder accretion. Metaplanet’s steady Bitcoin purchases have been funded through a mix of capital market activities and operating income. Notably, the company executed an early redemption of 6 billion yen from a recent bond issuance, repaying investors with proceeds raised from recent stock acquisition rights exercises. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin buying spree has outpaced traditional corporate approaches to digital assets. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 2,205 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 15,555 BTC* pic.twitter.com/VqKGOwCs6N — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 Since early 2025, Metaplanet has expanded its holdings from under 4,000 BTC in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, quadrupling its position in just four months. The company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy mirrors moves by U.S.-based Strategy but on a Japanese scale. “Metaplanet has acquired 2,205 BTC for ~$238.7 million at ~$108,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 416.6% YTD 2025. As of 7/7/2025, we hold 15,555 $BTC acquired for ~$1.54 billion at ~$99,307 per bitcoin,” CEO Simon Gerovich said in a recent post on X . Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows at least 21 new entities added BTC holdings in the past month alone. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

As one of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms, Bitget has offered a long-term prediction that could surprise even the most optimistic Pi supporters. But is $1,000 really possible? Let’s break it down. Bitget’s Bullish 2030 Prediction According to Bitget Global Research , Pi Coins could climb to $500–$1,000 or more by 2030—but only if a few big things fall into place. This isn’t just a hopeful guess, the forecast is based on the idea that Pi Network becomes a global digital payment platform used for DeFi, shopping, and everyday transactions. To get there, the network needs mass adoption, not just hype. What Needs to Happen? For Pi to reach those heights, five major things must happen or else Bitget says without these, Pi’s price could stay flat, or even drop. Real World Use: Pi needs to become a payment option for everyday transactions, not just in theory, but in stores and platforms globally. Big Partnerships: Collaborating with well-known brands and blockchain players will help Pi gain credibility. User Activity: Growth alone isn’t enough. Millions must actually use the apps and tools built on Pi. Strong Tech: The blockchain must be fast, secure, and scalable to support heavy usage. Utility Over Hype: An open and functioning mainnet is key to moving beyond speculation. Meanwhile, Pi has to prove it’s more than a speculative token, it must offer real solutions. Analysis: Bold, But Not Impossible Bitget analysis suggests that it sounds like a big dream, but crypto history is full of surprises. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum also started with doubters, and look where they are now. As Bitget puts it, real adoption creates real value, and if Pi can offer real-world use, $1,000 by 2030 may not be that impossible. For now, Pi Coin’s future lies in the hands of its core team and loyal “Pioneers.” [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″]",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-price-prediction-2030-bitget-predicts-pi-coin-could-hit-1000/,"EXCHANGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|RESEARCH|BTC","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

The efforts center on sophisticated fraudulent schemes that trick victims into paying small profits and then losing their fortunes through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has seized nearly $400 million worth of digital assets over the past decade, a figure that has not been previously made public. The team uses software, subpoenas and patience to track down digital crimes, not guns or badges. “They send you a photo of a young person, but in reality it's probably an old man in Russia,” GIOC analyst Jamie Lam told a meeting in Bermuda last month, explaining how the scams start: “They send you a photo of someone who looks like they're a young person, but in reality it's probably an old man in Russia.” Fake investment sites offer victims small profits, then disappear as investments grow. Related News: Watch Out: Many Economic Developments and Altcoin Events in the Coming Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List The team can track down the criminals by tracking down the domains of fake platforms, crypto wallets, and sometimes IP addresses leaked through VPN errors. “Sometimes it just takes patience,” Lam says. “Victims often think they see opportunity. They think they’re safe when they use Bitcoin, but that’s not true,” Smith said during training in Bermuda. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch warned: “Technology is great for economic growth, but it’s also open to abuse. You have to have strong investigative powers.” According to FBI data, of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime reported in the US in 2024, $9.3 billion was related to crypto. The elderly suffered the most losses, losing $2.8 billion to fake investment sites alone. The Secret Service is working closely with industry partners to recover stolen funds. Coinbase and Tether have assisted with wallet analysis and asset freezes in some cases. One scam in which $225 million in USDT was recovered was among the largest recoveries ever. *This is not investment advice.

The Tesla CEO, in a thread on X, confirmed that the party will embrace Bitcoin, calling fiat as “hopeless.” Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Musk first confirmed the formation of his new political party on Saturday, following a poll on X. He said that the America Party would address the consistent rise in debts, which has been present irrespective of whichever party is in power. “The America Party is needed to fight the Republican/Democrat Uniparty,” he wrote to his 221.8 million followers . Musk criticised Trump’s 940-page “Big, Beautiful Bill“, which proposes tax breaks and sweeping cuts, warning of job loss and strategic harm, sparking conflict with the Trump administration. “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” he wrote on another thread. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” Meanwhile, Trump posted on Truth Social that a third political party has never succeeded in the United States. He said that Elon Musk has gone completely “off the rails,” becoming a ‘TRAIN WRECK’ in the past weeks. Elon Musk America Party and Bitcoin Relationship – What it Means for BTC Musk noted that his party would support Bitcoin and focus on House and Senate races. Following his confirmation, Bitcoin jumped from $108,735.07 to $109,361.29 and is currently trading at $109.16K at press time. Musk has expressed a long-standing opinion about various cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin and Dogecoin, since 2014. One user called it a “ huge signal ” for Bitcoin, given Musk’s influence on the industry and current backing of BTC on a political level. Further, the community has been speculating over Elon Musk staking Bitcoin silently. The buzz started on July 2, when the crypto-focused handle on X pointed out Musk’s silence on Bitcoin lately.

2025-07-07T05:30:00,"Mercado Bitcoin to Tokenize $200 Million in RWAs on XRPL","Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s leading crypto exchanges, announced it will tokenize $200 million in RWAs on the XRP Ledger. Boston Consulting Group estimates that the tokenized RWA market could hit $19 trillion by 2033.Meanwhile, Hong Kong is expanding its tokenized green bond program and refining its digital asset framework, including new rules for stablecoins and digital asset platforms. In the US, Robinhood’s plan to tokenize equities via its new Ethereum-compatible blockchain could disrupt Wall Street by moving trading on-chain and extending market access to 24/7. Latin American Exchange Joins Tokenization Wave Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced on Friday that it will tokenize $200 million worth of real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to a joint announcement with Ripple, the tokenized assets will include a mix of fixed-income and equity financial instruments. This initiative is part of the trend in the crypto and financial sectors to digitize traditional assets through blockchain technology, despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Press release from Ripple A report by Boston Consulting Group and Ripple projected that the tokenized RWA market could reach a staggering $19 trillion in market capitalization by 2033, thanks to the strong institutional interest in the space. The move by Mercado Bitcoin comes at a time when crypto firms and asset managers are calling for clearer regulatory frameworks, particularly in the United States, to support the growth of tokenized equities and other digital representations of traditional financial assets. RWA tokenization market overview (Source: RWA.xyz ) On the same day, Ondo Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, acquired Oasis Pro , a US-regulated alternative trading system. The goal of the acquisition is to strengthen Ondo's foothold in the RWA space by leveraging Oasis Pro's ability to settle digital securities in both fiat currency and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Centrifuge , a blockchain company specializing in RWAs, unveiled plans to tokenize the S&P 500 stock index, which could bring a major benchmark of the US equity market onto the blockchain. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to authorize the tokenization of stocks and bonds. However, there are still some major regulatory challenges in the way. John Murillo, chief business officer at B2BROKER, warned that tokenized equity instruments currently exist in a regulatory grey area. Unlike traditional stocks, they may not offer direct claims on company assets, voting rights, or access to internal financial disclosures. He advised investors to thoroughly examine the specific terms of any tokenized RWA they consider, and pay very close attention to potential cash flows, dividend rights, legal protections, and smart contract-related risks. Hong Kong Expands Tokenized Bond Strategy Hong Kong is also moving to expand its tokenized bond program with a third batch of tokenized green bonds. This could mean that the government is planning to make such offerings a permanent part of its debt issuance strategy. At the Hong Kong Digital Finance Awards 2025, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui pointed out that the upcoming tokenized bond sale builds on the momentum of two successful issuances in 2023 and 2024. These bonds were recorded and settled by using distributed ledger technology, and authorities are now exploring measures like stamp duty exemptions on tokenized exchange-traded funds to further incentivize adoption. This initiative is part of Hong Kong’s broader digital asset push, as laid out in its newly released Digital Asset Development Policy Declaration 2.0. The government’s updated strategy places a lot of emphasis on the regulation of stablecoins and the promotion of asset tokenization under its “LEAP” framework , which focuses on legal clarity, ecosystem development, real-world use cases, and talent cultivation. As part of this plan, a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers will go into effect on August 1, to help encourage practical adoption of tokenized solutions. Hong Kong’s ‘LEAP’ framework At the same time, public consultations are underway for proposed licensing regulations governing digital asset trading platforms and custodians, with the consultation period set to close by the end of August. Additionally, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) launched the city's first digital asset indexes, offering institutional investors benchmark pricing for Bitcoin and Ethereum during Asian trading hours. To help boost its digital finance ambitions even more, Hong Kong’s financial authorities recently announced plans to introduce digital asset derivatives trading targeted at professional investors. This follows a wave of regulatory progress, including the approval of spot cryptocurrency ETFs, futures contracts, and staking services. In April, licensed exchange HashKey was also cleared to offer staking . To add to this, the region’s Legislative Council passed the Stablecoin Bill in May. This laid the regulatory foundation for a secure and structured environment for digital assets and Web3 innovation. Tokenized Stocks Could Disrupt Wall Street Robinhood’s plan to tokenize stocks through a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain, known as Robinhood Chain, could disrupt traditional financial markets by shifting trading activity away from legacy exchanges like the NYSE. At the EthCC conference, CEO Vlad Tenev introduced the project as a layer 2 blockchain built on Arbitrum Orbit that will allow users to trade tokenized derivatives of stocks directly on-chain. The goal of this initiative is to provide near-instant settlement and extend trading hours to 24/5 initially, with plans for 24/7 trading in the future. By minting token wrappers tied to real equities held by a US broker-dealer, Robinhood will enable users to self-custody their assets or interact with decentralized applications. Galaxy Digital shared in a report released Friday that Robinhood’s move brings assets on-chain, bypassing traditional markets and potentially undermining the liquidity dominance and revenue models of centralized exchanges. The architecture of Robinhood Chain resembles Coinbase’s Base, as it allows the company to control its own sequencer and capture transaction fees across its trading ecosystem. Galaxy estimates that Base earns over $150,000 in daily fees for Coinbase, a model Robinhood may replicate. (Source: Galaxy Digital ) The benefits of tokenization extend beyond just expanded trading hours. Programmable assets could be used as collateral in DeFi applications or automate dividends. Galaxy warned that if established exchanges fail to adapt, they could be reduced to custodians of a less functional version of the same assets, losing relevance as traders migrate to more versatile blockchain-based platforms. However, the model is not without challenges. Around-the-clock trading could increase volatility risks for retail investors by exposing them to unexpected price swings outside standard market hours. Regulatory uncertainty is another obstacle, as the SEC has yet to weigh in on Robinhood’s approach. Currently, access to tokenized stock trading is limited to users in the European Union. Meanwhile, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has already urged the SEC to reject trading of tokenized equities outside the current Regulation NMS framework.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9822/mercado-bitcoin-to-tokenize-200-million-in-rw-as-on-xrpl,"TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T05:30:00,"Ethereum Must Evolve as Buterin Proposes Gas Cap and Decentralization Tests","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a series of proposals aimed at reinforcing the network’s long-term stability and decentralization. Speaking at the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, Buterin emphasized the need for Ethereum and the broader crypto industry to adopt more practical, user-focused safeguards. He also co-authored a new technical proposal, EIP-7983, that would place a protocol-level cap on gas usage for individual transactions to enhance security and compatibility with future technologies. Vitalik Buterin Proposes Ethereum Gas Cap to Boost Network Security and zkVM Compatibility Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum researcher Toni Wahrstätter have introduced a new proposal aimed at fortifying the Ethereum network's resilience and performance by placing a hard cap on the gas consumption of individual transactions. Known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7983 (EIP-7983), the change would set a protocol-level gas ceiling of 16.77 million units (2²⁴) per transaction, a move that could significantly reduce the network’s vulnerability to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and make it more compatible with emerging technologies like zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Currently, Ethereum’s architecture technically allows a single transaction to consume the entire block gas limit — a loophole that presents serious risks to network stability. This has been particularly problematic in scenarios where one transaction monopolizes gas resources, leading to failed transactions and inconsistent block performance. EIP-7983 seeks to mitigate this issue by enforcing a per-transaction gas limit, effectively distributing the gas load across multiple transactions and reducing the risk of a single operation jamming the pipeline. The proposed 16.77 million gas ceiling was selected to support even the most demanding smart contract deployments and DeFi interactions while discouraging inefficient or potentially malicious activity. “By implementing this limit, Ethereum can enhance its resilience against certain DoS vectors, improve network stability, and provide more predictability to transaction processing costs,” the proposal states. Enhancing zkVM Compatibility Beyond the security implications, the gas cap is also aimed at streamlining Ethereum’s compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines, or zkVMs. These next-generation computational models are expected to become a cornerstone of Ethereum scaling and privacy solutions. However, zkVMs currently struggle with processing extremely large transactions due to their architecture, which breaks computations into smaller proofs. By encouraging developers to split gas-intensive transactions into smaller, modular ones, EIP-7983 would make Ethereum more accommodating to zkVMs, potentially accelerating their mainstream adoption. Despite setting a hard cap, the proposal notes that the vast majority of transactions on the Ethereum network already operate well below the proposed threshold. As such, the authors argue that the change would have minimal impact on day-to-day users and developers. However, transactions that do exceed the cap would be rejected outright during block validation. This means that any attempt to exceed the 16.77 million gas limit would be invalidated before inclusion in a block, ensuring the new rule is strictly enforced. The cap itself is distinct from the total block gas limit — a parameter still controlled by validators and miners within the consensus protocol — and is not intended to replace it. EIP-7983 is not an isolated initiative. It follows earlier efforts like EIP-7825, which aimed to improve the predictability of transaction execution. These proposals are part of a broader philosophical shift led by Buterin, who has increasingly advocated for simplifying Ethereum’s base-layer architecture. In a May blog post, Buterin argued that Ethereum had grown too complex, which in turn was creating development bottlenecks and security liabilities. Inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist philosophy, he outlined a vision for restructuring Ethereum across its consensus, execution, and shared components with the goal of creating a leaner and more robust protocol over the next five years. The Future of Ethereum: Identity, Scaling, and Security Buterin’s vision for Ethereum goes far beyond transaction mechanics. In recent months, he has unveiled a host of forward-looking ideas — from partially stateless nodes that could support better scaling, to a digital identity framework called ”pluralistic identity,” which is designed to balance user privacy with verifiable participation in digital systems. The overarching narrative is clear: Buterin wants to ensure Ethereum remains adaptable and scalable while reducing systemic risks and increasing usability. EIP-7983 is yet another brick in that wall — a targeted upgrade aimed at aligning Ethereum with the future demands of a decentralized internet. Whether EIP-7983 gains community support and ultimately becomes part of a future hard fork remains to be seen. But with the growing complexity of Ethereum's ecosystem and the ever-present threat of DoS attacks, the proposal shows the importance of keeping the network resilient, secure, and efficient in the face of exponential growth. Buterin Warns Ethereum Community: Grow Up or Risk Becoming Irrelevant Meanwhile, in a keynote address that resonated like a wake-up call, Buterin urged the crypto industry to ”grow up fast” or risk becoming just another overhyped fad. Speaking to a packed audience at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) , Buterin outlined a stark reality: decentralization must stop being a marketing slogan and start being a provable user guarantee — or face obsolescence. As Ethereum recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary, Buterin’s remarks struck a balance between concern and constructive criticism. He emphasized that the crypto sector stands at an inflection point, where its founding ideals are being tested against the pressures of mass adoption, political endorsement, and increasingly complex technical systems. Back to Basics: Trust, Resilience, and Simplicity Buterin called for a return to Ethereum's core principles — decentralization, trust minimization, and user sovereignty. He warned that too many projects are building systems that fail the very tests that matter. He then laid out a trio of tests that every crypto project should aim to pass if it wants to be truly decentralized: The Walk-Away Test — If the founding company disappears tomorrow, will users still have access to their assets? The Insider Attack Test — How much damage can be done if an insider goes rogue or a front-end is compromised? The Trusted Computing Base Test — How many lines of code must users blindly trust to ensure their funds or data remain safe? These tests aren’t just theoretical metrics. Buterin pointed out that many layer-2 networks, DeFi apps, and so-called decentralized front-ends secretly rely on central points of failure — including backdoors, upgrade buttons, or weak user interfaces that could be hijacked. Buterin didn’t spare even the most hyped sectors of crypto, like zero-knowledge (ZK) solutions and privacy-focused apps. He argued that privacy must evolve from an optional feature to a default setting — something that reduces data leakage automatically rather than relying on user behavior. This line of thought echoes Buterin’s growing emphasis on Ethereum becoming a simpler, more robust system. Ethereum’s Next 10 Years — or Its Last? The urgency in Buterin’s tone wasn’t just for show. With alternative blockchains nipping at Ethereum’s heels — offering faster speeds, lower fees, and often simpler user experiences — the pressure to evolve is mounting. If Ethereum fails to simplify its design, secure its base layer, and deliver real user protections, Buterin warned, it could fade into irrelevance. In a world where governments are crafting crypto regulations, major corporations are jumping into the blockchain space, and digital identity is becoming a battleground, Ethereum’s next moves may define not just its own future, but the future of decentralized tech as a whole. Buterin’s message was clear: maturity isn’t about abandoning ideals — it’s about finally living up to them.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9823/ethereum-must-evolve-as-buterin-proposes-gas-cap-and-decentralization-tests,"ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|TRADING|BTC","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T05:10:07,"Elon Musk Founded His Own Political Party in the US – What Does This Mean for Bitcoin (BTC) and How Will It Affect It?","Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced his new political party, describing the US's national debt burden of over $37 trillion as “a disaster that will lead the country to bankruptcy.” With this formation, which he called the “America Party”, Musk also declared a clear separation from his old friend and re-elected president last year, Donald Trump. The developments brought with them the expectation of a big rise in the cryptocurrency market, especially for Bitcoin. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, financial commentator Lyn Alden drew attention to the dramatic increase in the US budget deficit, using the phrase “Nothing stops this train” in reference to the Breaking Bad series. Alden said that $2 trillion more will be added to the US debt in 2024 alone. Musk has been harshly critical of Trump’s new mega-economic bill, which he calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The bill will increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion and add an additional $3 trillion in debt to the country. Musk lashed out at Trump in his post on the X platform, saying, “This is going to bankrupt the country.” Musk also argued that Trump and the Republicans have failed to keep their promises of “cutting spending” in their election promises last year. Related News: The Altcoin That Earned the Most Decentralized Application Revenue in the Last Three Months Has Been Revealed - It Made a Big Difference Musk’s move and the increasing financial expansion in the US have created excitement in the crypto market. Unity Wallet COO James Toledano commented, “The government printing so much money is weakening the dollar while strengthening Bitcoin’s ‘digital gold’ status.” Crypto investor Lark Davis reminded that Bitcoin usually makes double-digit gains after such huge spending bills, saying, “When Trump signed another huge spending bill at the end of 2020, Bitcoin rose by 38%. If the same pattern repeats, the BTC price could hit $150,000. Because nothing can stop this train.” “All In Podcast” host David Friedberg summarizes the picture as follows: “We are facing a financial emergency in this country, and no one is trying to solve it.” Rapidly rising interest rates following major stimulus packages during the pandemic are making it even more difficult to finance the US’s debt, which has reached $37 trillion. While the increasing public spending and borrowing trend in the US creates uncertainty in financial markets, many investors are turning their eyes back to limited-supply digital assets like Bitcoin. Elon Musk’s new political formation, the “America Party,” shows that this financial turmoil will have not only political but also economic consequences. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T05:07:58,"Dogecoin Pops 6% to Lead Majors Gains as Bitcoin Nears $110K on Fresh Rate-Cut Optimism","Dogecoin (DOGE) surged over 6% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among major cryptocurrencies, as bitcoin (BTC) bounced toward the $110,000 mark on renewed rate-cut hopes and easing fears around looming U.S. tariffs. The rally came after U.S. officials clarified that President Trump’s long-anticipated tariff hikes would not go into effect immediately, giving countries more time to negotiate. The initial July 9 deadline sparked concerns over a sharp deterioration in global trade, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that nations without a deal would likely receive a three-week extension to reach agreements before the new levies take effect on August 1. “Markets are rallying after it was revealed countries will have more time to negotiate before tariffs take effect,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram message. “If we see a soft CPI print on Tuesday, that could open the door for a Fed rate cut later this year.” The clarification helped stabilize risk sentiment heading into a crucial week. Traders are now watching Wednesday’s U.S. inflation data for signals that could support a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve. A lower-than-expected CPI print could boost the case for a rate cut as early as September, helping crypto and risk assets extend their rebound. Bitcoin gained 1.1% over 24 hours to trade above $109,000, while ether (ETH) added 2.5% to reach $2,570. Other majors, including Solana's SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP), Cardano' ADA (ADA), and Tron's TRX (TRX) posted 2%-4% gains, supported by strong inflows and improving sentiment. “The BTC bounce and ETH inflows show traders are rotating into long-term value assets,” said Eugene Cheung, Chief Commercial Officer at OSL, said in a Telegram message. “We expect more investors to seek shelter in crypto as macro volatility builds.” “We’re optimistic that more investors will look to Bitcoin and Ethereum to escape macro volatility and potential inflation increases as the Fed signals high potential to cut interest rates this year,” Cheung added. Dogecoin’s outperformance marks a sharp return of retail enthusiasm, with trading volumes crossing $1.5 billion in the past 24 hours (relatively high for a weekend after an otherwise flat week), as known-backer Elon Musk unveiled plans for an “America Party.” Read more: Elon Musk Says America Party Will Embrace BTC as 'Fiat Is Hopeless'",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/07/dogecoin-pops-6-to-lead-majors-gains-as-bitcoin-nears-110k-on-fresh-rate-cut-optimism,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|ADA|ETH","Markets|Markets|Dogecoin|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

Musk believes the legislation fuels reckless fiscal policy and deepens economic instability. Why Bitcoin Is Central to Musk’s Political Vision In a recent post on X, Musk declared fiat money “ hopeless ,” signaling a bold pivot toward digital assets in political discourse. Bitcoin , in particular, is set to be a cornerstone of the American Party’s platform. Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Musk has long been a vocal advocate of cryptocurrency, with Tesla and SpaceX holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Now, he’s extending that vision into the political sphere, promoting Bitcoin as a tool to combat inflation and resist centralized monetary control. Focus on Congress, Not the Presidency While many speculated Musk may have presidential ambitions, he clarified that his immediate focus will be on Congressional races, not a run for the White House. The American Party aims to support innovation, protect free speech, and reduce excessive regulation—while maintaining a moderate stance on divisive issues. A filing under the name “Elon Reeve Musk” for the “America Party” recently circulated on X, purportedly from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The America Party is the solution https://t.co/KryqdEcqIU — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 6, 2025 However, no such record exists on the official FEC website, and Musk has since denied any involvement with that filing, calling it false. The Musk-Trump Rift Goes Public Tensions between Musk and Trump have escalated rapidly. Following Musk’s announcement, Trump lashed out on Truth Social, labeling Musk a “ TRAIN WRECK ” and accusing him of going “ off the rails .” The clash highlights a deeper divide between the two figures, who were once politically aligned. Musk’s popularity among younger, tech-savvy, and pro-crypto voters is growing—putting him at odds with Trump’s base. In response, Musk accused Trump of abandoning the political center. He launched a poll asking followers whether he should start a new party for the “80 percent in the middle.” After receiving overwhelming support, Musk moved forward with the unofficial launch of the American Party. [post_titles_links postid=”479140″] Backchannel Offers and Political Ambitions Before launching his own party, Musk reportedly received outreach from political figures like Andrew Yang and Libertarian Party Chair Steven Nekhaila, urging him to support their movements. However, Musk remained focused on fighting Trump’s bill and challenging the Republicans who supported it. He later unveiled a loose political strategy, criticizing both Democrats and Republicans as a “ uniparty ” lacking meaningful differences. Though some have speculated about Musk’s presidential ambitions, the U.S. Constitution bars him from running—as he was born in South Africa. This limitation restricts the leadership options of the American Party but hasn’t dampened its momentum.

2025-07-07T02:00:37,"Elon Musk says his America Party is going to be pro-Bitcoin","Elon Musk has declared that the America Party, his new political vehicle, will fully support Bitcoin, saying on X that: “Fiat is hopeless.” This follows the official launch of the America Party two days ago, which came after yet another public escalation of his fight with former best friend President Donald Trump. Saturday night on Truth Social, Trump called Elon a train wreck and said it makes him sad that he is embarrassing himself publicly. Elon had accused Trump of abandoning the center and posted a poll asking his followers if he should form a new party to represent “the 80 percent in the middle.” When the poll closed, about 80% voted yes. So he went ahead and launched it unofficially… at least for now. Elon targets Republican defectors after bill passes Before the announcement, other players tried to pull Elon into their projects. Andrew Yang, speaking to Politico Magazine, said he had wanted to form a political party with Elon or get his support for the Forward Party. Elon had endorsed Yang’s presidential run back in 2020, but no deal was made. Steven Nekhaila, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, also reached out last week, but Elon still didn’t engage. Instead, Elon stayed focused on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the same bill that triggered his split from Trump. As the bill neared a vote in the Senate, Elon promised that if it passed, he would not only move forward with forming the America Party, but also back primary challenges against Republican lawmakers who voted in favor of it. When the bill passed the House of Representatives on July 3, he followed through. He dropped another poll on X, then revealed a loose electoral strategy, blasting both major parties as a single “uniparty” failing to offer real policy differences. Despite Elon’s massive personal fortune, pushing the America Party into the national conversation won’t be easy. The Washington Post pointed out that Elon failed to influence the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election, and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency has damaged his reputation in some circles. Getting ballot access in all states will be a massive legal grind. Public support for him has also dipped, adding more uncertainty to the project. Adding to the complications, Elon was born in South Africa, which makes him constitutionally ineligible to run for the US presidency. He hasn’t said who will lead the America Party or what its internal structure will look like. As of now, it’s just Elon, Bitcoin, and an audience of people tired of choosing between two parties he no longer wants anything to do with. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-07T01:35:20,"Tesla crashes along with gold and S&P 500 as Bitcoin makes highest weekly close ever","Tesla stock opened the week with a red candle, falling to $315.35, a 0.095% dip that lined up with a broader selloff across US equities and metals. The drop hit as Bitcoin blew through resistance and ended the June 29 week with its highest weekly close ever. The action split risk markets in two. Stocks went down, crypto went up. As per usual, the trigger came straight out of Washington after President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that new tariffs will begin August 1, not July 9 as markets had priced in. The news sent US stock futures into a tailspin Sunday night. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 146 points, down 0.32%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.39% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.42%. Trump didn’t make the announcement alone. Standing beside him was Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told reporters, “Tariffs go into effect Aug. 1. But the president is setting the rates, and the deals, right now.” Trump nodded in agreement, ending the market’s weekend hopes. The update came after days of guessing by investors and left Wall Street hanging just as they were coming off a strong week. Bitcoin makes history as ETF inflows build Bitcoin managed to stay above $108,500 before closing Sunday at over $109,000, according to data from CoinGecko. Over the past month, nearly 50,000 BTC moved into US spot ETFs, signaling strong institutional demand. Based on their flow-to-price model, the next major target sits at $117,000. That model has tracked closely with price action in previous cycles, especially during aggressive ETF accumulation. Market analysts are calling it “whale games,” as large buyers quietly accumulate while retail watches from the sidelines. While Bitcoin moved up, metals moved down. Gold, which had gained almost 2% last week, gave back ground and hovered around $3,325 per ounce on Monday. It’s still up over 25% in 2025 and is sitting just under $170 shy of its April record. ETF inflows and central bank demand have kept gold up this year, but short-term traders pulled back after the White House announcement. S&P 500 loses steam after tariff delay creates confusion Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the new tariff date during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” earlier Sunday. “If there’s no deal, tariffs go back to April 2 levels on August 1,” he said. That announcement set expectations that major duties could return unless a breakthrough is made in trade talks. Most investors had planned around tariffs starting this week. That now looks wrong. The original 90-day pause from April’s “reciprocal” tariffs was set to expire Tuesday, with an EU agreement deadline hitting Wednesday. If no deal is struck with the European Union, tariffs up to 50% on EU goods are expected. Last week’s stock rally came from the belief that Trump wouldn’t actually follow through with the most extreme tariff threats. That optimism collapsed. Still, some traders are holding out hope. They believe US firms will beat weak earnings expectations if they can show they’re ready to handle tariffs. The US Dollar Index dipped slightly to 96.90, while China’s Renminbi fell 0.07% to 7.1656. The Japanese Yen also slipped to 0.0069, with a minor move of +0.0000090. Other currencies, including the euro, pound, and ruble, are also trading just below neutral. Silver, unlike gold, ripped to $37.225, the highest price seen in nearly 14 years. That spike stood out in a market dominated by selling pressure.

2025-07-07T01:22:31,"Asia Morning Briefing: Michael Saylor's BTC Buys Aren't Making Up For Slowing Spot Demand, Say Analysts","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins a new trading week, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $109K, up 0.8% in the last week or 4.5% in the last month, according to CoinDesk market data. In an era of continued sizeable BTC buys from Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), sustained BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) inflows , and more companies adopting a BTC treasury strategy , one has to wonder why bitcoin's price hasn't shot past all-time highs. A new report from CryptoQuant spells it out: all of this institutional action isn't making up for a general decline in spot demand for BTC. ""The annual growth of bitcoin demand shows a similar picture: ETFs and MSTR purchases are a portion of bitcoin demand, overall demand contraction is more than offsetting these purchases, and the acceleration of overall demand growth is what drives price rallies,"" CryptoQuant wrote in a recent report. CryptoQuant points out that over the last 30 days, there's been a contraction in demand for BTC to the tune of -895K. To make things worse, compared to December, ETF and MSTR buys are slowing. In the last month of the year, ETFs bought 86,000 BTC and MSTR 171,000, while in the last month, those numbers are down significantly. ETFs only purchased 40K BTC, while MSTR bought 16 K. BTC is stuck in a consolidation phase, and demand isn't there to fuel a breakout, CryptoQuant writes. One additional data point for proof of slowing demand is BTC's nearly empty mempool , which demonstrates how little retail spot demand the market has. The question is if institutional buys continue to slow, how much resistance will it put on BTC's price? SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci is on the record for saying that the BTC treasury trend — a reliable source of demand for bitcoin — will fade. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” Scaramucci said during an interview with Bloomberg last week. “So, you know, it will fade.” “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now,” Scaramucci continued in the interview. “I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies.” Meanwhile, Standard Chartered remains a BTC bull , with the bank maintaining its $200K price target for the world's largest digital asset. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin consolidated above $108,500 over the weekend, then surged from $108,327 to $108,620 in the last hour, with $108,200-$108,300 now supporting the uptrend. ETH: Ethereum rallied from $2,520.45 to $2,558.63 on July 6, with trading volume spiking to 272,352 ETH, finding support at $2,510 amid global economic tensions, while $1.1 billion in June ETH ETF inflows and record whale accumulation signal potential for a breakout despite resistance near $2,600. Gold: Gold surged 1.91% to $3,336.61 last week, driven by a weakening dollar, 91.5% odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, looming tariff threats, and a 73% spike in China’s gold imports Nikkei 225: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.26% after the White House continued with its mixed messages on tariffs.

2025-07-06T23:40:03,"Ondo & Hyperliquid Shine on Infrastructure; XYZVerse Captures Meme-Momentum Amid BTC Bull","As Bitcoin experiences a significant uptick, notable projects in the digital asset realm are emerging at the forefront. Infrastructure platforms are gaining prominence for their groundbreaking solutions, while a fresh player is capturing attention through viral trends. This piece delves into how these entities are influencing the market during this bullish surge. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: Revolutionizing DeFi with Speed and Zero Fees Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform transforming decentralized finance (DeFi). It has built its own Layer 1 blockchain from the ground up, focusing on speed and scalability. With its unique HyperBFT consensus mechanism, transactions are fast and secure.

While many cryptocurrencies face ups and downs, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance could make it an attractive option for those interested in both traditional finance and blockchain innovation.

2025-07-06T22:00:04,"Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz Issues Bold Bitcoin Call","Mike Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has made a bold call to investors in the cryptocurrency space. In response to a post on X, Novogratz claimed that there is growing pressure on Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. This, he maintained, could impact the country’s fiat currency value, hence the need to invest in crypto. Mike Novogratz On Political Interference and Bitcoin as Safe Haven Notably, Novogratz says market participants need to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, as a hedge. He believes that Bitcoin will serve as a safe haven asset for investors if the U.S. dollar weakens due to political pressure on Powell or reckless monetary policy. Given that Bitcoin is decentralized with a limited supply, Novogratz has urged investors to “Buy BTC” as it will become more valuable in the future. According to the Bitcoin advocate, Bill Pulte’s call for Powell’s removal from office, an influential figure with political clout, will not end well. He considers the call to be heading in a financially dangerous direction. Primarily, Novogratz believes that politicizing the Federal Reserve could lead to rate cuts that would negatively impact the dollar. However, such a move to undermine the Fed supports his advocacy for Bitcoin. Is Political Tensions Threatening the Fed’s Independence? For clarity, Jerome Powell’s reluctance to further cut interest rates has sparked hostility towards him. Some Republicans in the U.S. are calling for his resignation . This includes Bill Pulte, who claims there is evidence incriminating Powell. Regardless, Novogratz considers the allegations against Powell as characteristic of a “ Banana Republic move ” which could further weaken the nation’s currency. According to Novogratz, potentially, the move could reduce confidence in U.S. institutions or trigger political instability. Powell had earlier emphasized that interest rate decisions must be based on facts and data, not political predispositions. Amid mounting pressure, some in the financial sector have argued that if Powell gives in, it could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence. Community Reacts to Novogratz’s Call However, reactions have trailed Novogratz’s post on social media. A user, John Lilic, opines that nothing justifies using $2.5 billion for a renovation. Another user, Jefferson, alleged that Powell was not factual with Congress on the renovation and might face grave issues.

2025-07-06T21:45:00,"Bulls vs. Bears: Institutions Pile Up BTC But Price Doesn’t go up, Why?","Over the last thirty days, many institutions have been loading up their bitcoin (BTC) bags. However, these purchases have had no major impact on the price of the leading digital asset. This has sparked concerns among market participants. Many are wondering why BTC has been stuck within a tight range since it hit an all-time high (ATH) in late May. A recent report by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed the reason for the weak price momentum despite persistent institutional demand, which analysts say is currently not enough. BTC Stalls Despite Institutional Demand According to CryptoQuant, BTC purchases from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries belonging to firms like Strategy have declined this year compared to the period from November to December 2024. ETF purchases have decreased from 86,000 BTC in early December to 71,000 BTC in mid-May, and are currently at 40,000 BTC. The trend represents a 53% decline over this period. At the same time, Strategy’s acquisitions have also dropped from 171,000 BTC in December to 16,000 BTC currently. This shows a 90% plunge over the period. Although institutional purchases and ETF flows have kept BTC above $100,000 for a while, further declines could slow price gains. This could be exacerbated by the fact that ETF and institutional buys represent a fraction of the overall BTC demand, which seems to be contracting. At the market’s peak in December, ETF and institutional purchases represented 33% of total Bitcoin demand growth. These entities purchased no more than 257,000 BTC out of the total 771,000 BTC. This indicated that the Bitcoin market had a bigger and unobservable demand coming from other sources. Overall Demand is Contracting Currently, the overall demand for BTC is contracting , having declined by 895,000 BTC over the last 30 days. This metric needs to expand for a sustainable price rally to occur. However, the demand level from institutions right now is not enough to trigger that expansion. CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin’s annual growth chart reflects how ETF and institutional purchases account for only a portion of demand. Apparent demand has also contracted by 857,000 BTC, significantly offsetting the expansion of ETF and institutional demand (377,000 BTC and 371,000 BTC, respectively). “The bottom line is that ETFs and MSTR’s Bitcoin purchase, while overall positive for Bitcoin price gains, are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs,” the market intelligence firm added.

2025-07-06T21:30:15,"XRP Eyes Breakout As Analysts Predict Rally Alongside Real-World Adoption","Despite its choppy price action in the past seven days, the mood in the XRP camp is increasingly bullish. Particularly, XRP is witnessing a wave of bold predictions from several top crypto analysts. This comes just as a major real-world asset tokenization project promises to increase demand and utility for XRP on a global scale by tokenizing $200 million worth of assets on the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s True Value Is Higher Than $110,000, Expert Warns Not Bullish Enough On XRP? Crypto analyst CrediBULL is pushing a bold message to the XRP community: the market is still underestimating the altcoin’s bullish setup. In a post on social media platform X, he noted that XRP is currently going on its eighth month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, which is a feat that few assets in the market can match. He pointed to this extended sideways movement, especially after a strong impulse off the $0.50 level in late 2024, as evidence that XRP is preparing for a continuation of the breakout. Notably, its monthly candlestick chart shows a tight cluster of monthly candles hovering above the $2.00 range. According to CrediBULL, this structure is one of the cleanest in the crypto space, second only to Bitcoin. Image From X: CrediBULL Another major contributor to the current bullish narrative is an analyst known as Ripple Pundit, who projected a 35,000% price surge for XRP the moment Ripple announces a banking license. In his post on the social media platform, he predicted that a regulatory greenlight and the final resolution of XRP’s regulatory overhang with the SEC could trigger a significant increase in price. Similarly, market commentator SMQKE drew attention to the explosive XRP price surge in late 2017 and early 2018, during which Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to XRP’s quick rally from $0.00065 to $2.5. SMQKE noted that the last cycle was merely a glimpse of what’s coming. The next wave of adoption will be global, fully regulated, and built for scale. In his words, “2018 was just a warm-up.” Technical analyst Ali Martinez added further credibility to the bullish case by pointing out the $2.38 level as the next major resistance. This is based on on-chain data from Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows a significant XRP volume concentrated at this price level. If XRP manages to clear this area with strong volume, it would not only overcome heavy resistance but also trigger a cascade of buying interest and a major rally. Image From X: @ali_charts Mercado Bitcoin Tokenization Deal On XRPL XRP’s underlying utility is also gaining traction beyond price charts and predictions. Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest digital asset platforms, recently announced plans to tokenize over $200 million worth of real-world assets (including fixed income and equity instruments) directly on the XRP Ledger.

2025-07-06T20:10:00,"Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Cap to Strengthen Ethereum Security and Stability","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward a new proposal, EIP-7983, which tries to cap the gas usage per transaction at 16.77 million units. The proposal is proposed to make Ethereum more robust against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, increase stability, and enable higher compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Why Ethereum Needs a Gas Cap With Ethereum’s current configuration, one transaction may exhaust the entire block’s gas limit. This makes it a vulnerability wherein one high-demand transaction can jeopardize the network by tying up resources, raising DoS vulnerability and uncertainty. The proposed EIP-7983 attempts to do this by setting a hard cap of 16.77 million gas (2²⁴) per transaction. “By doing so, Ethereum can raise its resistance to some DoS vectors,” the proposal states. Impact on zkVMs and Network Efficiency The proposed limit is not just a security issue—it’s an issue of licensing as well. EIP-7983 will contribute to increasing Ethereum’s compatibility with zkVMs by encouraging developers to split large transactions into small, manageable transactions. Transactions requesting gas over the 16.77 million limit would be rejected at the block validation level so they would never even get onto the network. This measure operates independently of the block-level gas maximum, which remains variable at the hands of validators. Balancing Innovation and Security Buterin and Wahrstätter point out that 16.77 million is a conscious choice of a limit that can serve most current decentralized finance (DeFi) and contract deployment applications with the additional aim of reducing unnecessary risk. While not backward compatible for addresses above the cap, the vast majority of existing Ethereum transactions are already below the threshold, avoiding excessive disruption. EIP-7983 is the culmination of earlier work like EIP-7825, aiming to make Ethereum handling of transactions more predictable and friendlier to users. Simplifying Ethereum’s Future This concept is one of Buterin’s larger plans to simplify Ethereum. In May, he argued in favor of a simplified protocol on the lines of Bitcoin’s minimalism to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use. His five-year plan involves simplifying Ethereum’s execution, consensus, and shared pieces. Alongside, Buterin is exploring new ideas such as “pluralistic identity,” a digital identity system that strives to maintain privacy while enabling equal online engagement.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-gas-strengthen-ethereum/,"ETH|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Ethereum|Regulation|Web3",cryptocompare
