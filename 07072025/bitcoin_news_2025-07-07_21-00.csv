Metaplanet bought the Bitcoin for an average purchase price of around $108,237 per BTC for a total spend of $238.7 million as it continues its aggressive acquisition spree. Metaplanet’s latest investment brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately $1.69 billion based on current market prices, securing its position as Asia’s most audacious corporate Bitcoin adopter. At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at $108,717, having risen by a paltry 0.7% over the last 24 hours. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 2,205 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 15,555 BTC* pic.twitter.com/VqKGOwCs6N — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 According to data tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the Tokyo-listed investment company now ranks as the fifth biggest corporate holder of the world’s largest crypto after recently overtaking Tesla , CleanSpark, and Galaxy Digital . Metaplanet is only trailing behind large crypto firms, such as MARA, Riot, and Strategy. Metaplanet, which rebranded in 2024 from a hotel and technology firm to a dedicated Bitcoin treasury, recently announced that it is looking to accumulate 210,000 BTC, or about 1% of the 21 million supply, by 2027 as it aims to become one of the world’s largest Bitcoin Treasury companies. The firm’s latest BTC buy comes at a time when more companies are looking to invest in the benchmark crypto, partly as a way of boosting their share prices. Over 142 publicly traded firms hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as of publication time. They have raked up a combined $92 billion of the alpha crypto, with Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy’s stockpile roughly two-thirds of that amount. Strategy currently holds over $64 billion worth of Bitcoin . It began buying the world’s oldest cryptocurrency in 2020, pioneering the model that has recently become widely adopted.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/japans-metaplanet-ups-bitcoin-stash-to-15555-btc-rakes-up-another-2205-btc/,"BTC|ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Japan",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T18:45:43,"Goldman Sachs Flips Bearish on US Treasury Yields, Forecasts Fed Rate Cuts Sooner Than Expected: Report","Market strategists at banking giant Goldman Sachs have reportedly lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. In a report seen by Bloomberg , analysts, including George Cole, say that they’re lowering their end-of-year targets for yields and are revising their expectations for Fed cuts in 2025. The analysts say that they see the two and 10-year yields ending 2025 at 3.45% and 4.20%, respectively, dropping from their initial call of 3.85% and 4.50%. Meanwhile, Goldman’s economists originally believed that the Fed would only achieve one rate cut near the end of the year, but are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. Even though strong labor numbers challenged the analysts’ forecast, the Goldman analysts are standing firm on their call, noting that the strong data was distorted by the outsized figure of government hiring and a decline in the labor participation rate. “A benign path to lower short-term rates can dilute a potential source of additional fiscal risk premia and improve the economic appeal [of owning Treasuries.] We see scope for deeper cuts to support lower yields than previously envisioned.” The Financial Times reports that $11 billion in long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt have been dumped in just three months. The Q2 2025 sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off happening back in the second quarter of 2022. Source: The Financial Times PGIM’s top fixed-income strategist, Robert Tipp, says the shift shows investors are wary of rising inflation and increasing government debt. “It’s a volatile environment, with inflation still above target and heavy government supply as far as the eye can see. This is driving a skittishness about the long end of the yield curve, and a general uneasiness.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-07T18:41:57,"Elon Musk Asserts Fiat Is ‘Hopeless’, Confirms His New America Party Will Embrace Bitcoin","Tesla CEO and multipreneur Elon Musk confirmed on Sunday that the ‘America Party’, a pro-tech centrist party he intends to form after his short-lived alliance with US President Donald Trump ended, would accept Bitcoin (BTC). “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” Musk replied to an X user who asked if the America Party would embrace the premier crypto. Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 The so-called America Party was formed out of a public rift between Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’, which Musk has called a “disgusting abomination,” claiming it would erode millions of jobs in the US and cause “immense strategic harm” to the nation. This particular bill is estimated to add a whopping $3.3 trillion to the US national debt over the next decade. Musk questioned Trump’s rationale for forming the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an extra-governmental agency that sought to reduce the US national debt, if he was going to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars. Musk’s Relationship With Crypto Musk’s relationship with cryptocurrencies is well-documented, with SpaceX and Tesla both holding BTC on their corporate treasuries. Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in early 2021, making it one of the first publicly listed companies to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The EV maker currently holds 11,509 BTC , worth approximately $1.2 billion, making it the eighth-largest publicly traded company to hold Bitcoin in its treasury. Bitcoin OG Adam Back recently suggested that Musk should buy 1 million in BTC to “front-run the US government and the Trump family” in their ongoing feud. While Musk already owns some Bitcoin, Back believes that the eccentric centibillionaire’s current allocation is too low for his enormous net worth. The X owner has also been a Dogecoin evangelist over the years. His obsession with shitposting helped boost the biggest and oldest meme coin to a top 10 cryptocurrency. Interestingly, Musk even called himself the “ Dogefather ” ahead of a “Saturday Night Live” skit about the cryptocurrency back in 2021 — sending the coin’s price rocketing higher. DOGE would jump to its current record high price of $0.73 at this time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-asserts-fiat-is-hopeless-confirms-his-new-america-party-will-embrace-bitcoin/,"BTC|FIAT|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

In a new YouTube video, Benjamin Cowen tells his 904,000 subscribers that a Bitcoin price dip below the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) on the weekly timeframe may mark the end of the bull cycle based on historic precedent. “ So long as the 50-week SMA holds, the structure of the mark remains intact. A weekly close below that would call things into question… In this case, we have an indicator that should tell us that the cycle is over whenever we get these weekly closes below the 50-week moving average. It hasn’t happened yet. Now, where is the 50-week SMA? Right now, it’s at around $86,000. It’s between $85,000 and $86,000.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Cowen also says that Bitcoin may test the 50-week SMA in the third quarter of 2025 but hold it as support, indicating the bull cycle may continue. “The argument in this case is that as long as we’re above that [50-week SMA], then the structure of the market, the integrity of the cycle, is intact. And is there a chance we test it again in Q3? Absolutely. We tested it last Q3.

2025-07-07T18:30:57,"Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength As Bulls Reclaim Momentum","A crypto analyst stated that Ethereum continues to show resilience on the daily timeframe as of July 7. After a period of consolidation, ETH is holding above the key support level and maintaining its higher-low structure, and if ETH defends its current range, the path toward higher targets will remain intact. Ethereum Holds Above Key Support Zone In an X post, Believer pointed out that ETH has reclaimed key Fibonacci support at $2,572 and is now grinding higher toward the resistance level. The immediate focus is on flipping $2,605 into support, which would confirm short-term bullish control and open the door toward $2,665, which is the next key resistance level. Technically, the indicators are starting to favor the bulls, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 55.73, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed into positive territory, signaling growing upward momentum. Also, the support is at $2,503, while the resistance is at $2,605, $2,665, and $2,759. Believer notes that bulls want to break the stubborn range above $2,665. He also stated that Patience may soon pay, as signs of accumulation, rising indicators, and price pressing against resistance. Another analyst, Crypto Bureau XLab, also analyzed that Ethereum is coiling for a breakout of an ascending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. A confirmed breakout above $2,720 could ignite a sharp rally toward the $3,150 region with momentum building, which is a bullish continuation pattern. However, XLab warns of a potential rejection scenario, that if ETH fails to break through the $2,720 zone, it could lose short-term bullish momentum, which might send ETH back down to retest deeper support near $2,100 to $2,000 zone, which has previously served as a strong accumulation zone. Breakout Could Trigger Rapid Climb Toward $4,000 Crypto Jaibrah also took to X to reveal that Ethereum is shaping up for a breakout, with a massive cup and handle formation developing on the 3-day chart, a bullish pattern that often precedes explosive moves. ETH is finding support on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbons, showing that the uptrend remains intact and structurally strong. A confirmed breakout above $2,850 will activate the price target at $4,000. Ethereum is also undergoing a significant Bollinger Band Width squeeze on the chart , a reliable signal that shows volatility is about to expand, and these periods of compression often lead to sharp directional moves. The Volume Range Visible Profile (VRVP) reveals a notable volume gap between $2,850 and $3,200, which means there’s little resistance in that zone. If ETH breaks above $2,850, the price could rapidly accelerate toward $3,200 with minimal friction.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-daily-chart-signals-strength/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Ethereum|Believer|Crypto Bureau XLab|Crypto Jaibrah|ETH|ETH Price|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT",cryptocompare

The Singapore-based miner’s total hashrate under management rose to 36.2 exahashes per second (EH/s), up 6.2% month over month. This includes 3.8 EH/s from BitFuFu’s own operations and 32.4 EH/s from third-party suppliers and hosting clients. Power capacity under management climbed 11.8% to 728 megawatts (MW), reaching its highest level yet. Cloud mining continues to be the company’s primary revenue engine, accounting for 387 of the 445 bitcoin mined in June. Self-mining contributed 58 BTC, up 34.9% from May. The firm added 83 BTC to its balance sheet, bringing total bitcoin holdings to 1,792. “June was our most productive month of 2025,” said Chairman and CEO Leo Lu. “Reaching record levels of 36.2 EH/s in hashrate and 728 MW in power capacity, we’re proud of the strong operational momentum.” The company also reported 623,114 registered cloud mining users as of June 30, suggesting sustained demand for its mining-as-a-service platform. BitFuFu’s scale-up effort highlights the industry’s focus on hashrate efficiency and geographic diversification as miners prepare for future network shifts.

2025-07-07T18:17:54,"XRP Proponent Claims Ripple Is a U.S. Government Agency, Shares Proofs","A provocative theory shared by XRP proponent Edo Farina has stirred debate in the crypto space. According to Farina, Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP token, may not be just a private fintech enterprise but a possible extension of U.S. intelligence infrastructure. He supports this claim by highlighting corporate trademark histories, overlapping personnel, and early domain registrations tied to Ripple Communications and OpenCoin. A Trademark Trail from 1991 The foundation of Farina’s argument lies in trademark records. “Ripple Communications, Inc.” was incorporated in Nevada on March 21, 1991—17 years before Bitcoin’s white paper. Public records show that Ripple Labs , Inc., the entity known today for developing XRP, currently holds the trademark originally belonging to Ripple Communications. That trademark was transferred through OpenCoin, Inc.—Ripple Labs’ former name before rebranding. This raises an immediate question: why would a crypto startup inherit trademarks and branding from a 1991 telecom company? While the connection could appear coincidental, Farina insists it hints at a deeper institutional lineage. RIPPLE IS A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY. $XRP The truth behind @Ripple , INSA, and intelligence contractors , and why Ryan Fugger is the key. Ryan Fugger claims the name “Ripple” came from a Grateful Dead song. But the real story? It traces back to U.S. intelligence ties, secret… pic.twitter.com/yyQTmBmD9q — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 7, 2025 Early Digital Footprints and INSA Overlap According to Farina, three key domains—RipplePay, RippleCom, and OpenCoin—were all launched in 2005, reportedly hosted under the same IP block. This was also the year the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) underwent reorganization. Farina suggests that this timeline convergence indicates the quiet development of a broader intelligence-linked fintech infrastructure. Supporting this idea is the involvement of Karen Nussle, listed as a principal at Ripple Communications. The uploaded image shows that she was also listed as a press contact at INSA, using an “@insaonline.org” email address. This strongly suggests a crossover between Ripple Communications and the U.S. intelligence policy space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Suzanne Heckenberg and the Disappearing Entity Another key figure cited is Suzanne Wilson Heckenberg, now President of INSA. According to INSA’s website, she served as Vice President of Marketing for Ripple Communications from September 2010 to October 2012. Her departure coincided with a significant transition: that same month, Ripple.com was acquired, and the Ripple Communications trademark changed hands, eventually ending up under Ripple Labs. After this point, Ripple Communications seemingly disappeared from public records. To Farina, the sequence is too aligned to ignore. He suggests Ripple Communications may have acted as a shell company or soft-launch vehicle for a government-aligned financial infrastructure, later consolidated under Ripple Labs. What Happened to Ryan Fugger? Farina also casts doubt on the official story surrounding Ryan Fugger, the original mind behind RipplePay . Fugger once claimed that the name “Ripple” was inspired by a Grateful Dead song. But if Ripple Communications predates his work by over a decade, and already held the trademark, Farina argues that Fugger’s explanation may have been a public narrative masking institutional involvement. Fugger’s quiet exit from the project only fuels further suspicion. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The draft proposal, EIP-7983, sets a 16.77 million gas limit per transaction. Interestingly, this is a significant change from the current architecture, where a single transaction can consume an entire block’s gas allowance. Developers argue this open-ended design exposes Ethereum to denial-of-service (DoS) risks, inconsistent network load, and slower block verification, especially as the chain supports increasingly complex DeFi and zero-knowledge applications. EIP-7983 By introducing a hard cap, Buterin and Wahrstätter seek to enforce more predictable resource usage without significantly disrupting typical user activity, noting that most transactions currently fall well below the proposed threshold. Transactions of more than the 16.77 million gas cap would be rejected during validation. Such a move would ensure oversized transactions cannot enter blocks, while the block gas limit itself would remain adjustable by validators under existing consensus rules. The authors frame the move as part of a broader effort to simplify Ethereum’s base layer and improve network reliability, which essentially echoes Buterin’s recent calls to streamline protocol design inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist ethos. Easing zkVM Constraints Developers working on zkVMs and parallel execution engines have highlighted difficulties in handling transactions with unpredictable gas sizes. They believe a fixed ceiling could ease engineering constraints and allow better subdivision of workloads across threads. The cap is also expected to reduce the risk of any single transaction monopolizing block resources, thereby improving consistency in execution times and block propagation. While the proposed limit may require some large deployments to split transactions into smaller segments, it aligns with Ethereum’s longer-term goal of supporting modular and provable systems while maintaining user experience. EIP-7983 builds on the now-stagnant EIP-7825 but with a lower ceiling. The proposal is currently in draft status and is now open for community discussion as developers assess its practical impact on the network.

Despite the pause, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy Holds Over $65B in Bitcoin As of July 6, Strategy holds 597,325 BTC, valued at over $65 billion. The average purchase price for these coins is approximately $70,982, with a total acquisition cost of around $42.4 billion. This puts the company’s unrealized profit at roughly $22.6 billion. Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings now represent about 2.8% of the total 21 million Bitcoin supply. The pause in Bitcoin purchases comes after a period of aggressive acquisitions. The Virginia-based company had bought 4,980 BTC for $531.9 million between June 23 and June 29. However, the pace has slowed in recent weeks. This comes as the firm shifted focus from selling common stock to offering perpetual preferred stock to raise capital . In late June, Strategy raised $6.8 billion through its at-the-market equity programs, which included sales of Class A common stock and various types of preferred shares. Strategy’s Long-Term Bitcoin Plan Expands, Draws Mixed Views The company’s capital raising efforts support a long-term plan called the “42/42” program, which aims to raise $84 billion for Bitcoin acquisitions by 2027. This is double the original target under the earlier “21/21” plan. To date, Strategy has raised billions by selling shares and convertible notes, with additional funds still available through its ongoing programs. Furthermore, the firm’s market value has reached $110 billion, which is significantly higher than the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. Some analysts believe this premium is justified due to the company’s strong equity-to-Bitcoin cycle. Others, however, have raised concerns about a possible negative feedback loop from overdependence on Bitcoin valuations. A recent class action lawsuit also claims that Strategy misled investors about its Bitcoin strategy. Quarterly Results Reflect Strong Bitcoin Gains Strategy recently released its second-quarter results. It reported an unrealized gain of $14.05 billion on its BTC holdings. During the second quarter, Strategy also entered into a loan agreement allowing it to borrow up to $31.1 million for capital purchases. Meanwhile, other companies like Metaplanet are adopting similar Bitcoin strategies . Tether-backed Twenty One, Trump Media, and GameStop are among other new entrants following this trend. Following this news, Strategy’s stock closed at $403.99, up by 0.4% on July 5. As of Monday morning, the shares dropped slightly in pre-market trading but are still up by over 34% this year. In comparison, the top coin is up 16.9% since the start of the year, currently trading at $108,346.

2025-07-07T18:05:38,"Citibank Raises Price Target for One Tech Stock That’s in Global Race for AI Infrastructure: Report","Traders at Citi are building conviction for a “Magnificent 7” stock that they say is competing in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. The bank says that a major bump in the demand for AI infrastructure, especially sovereign governments looking to build national plants, is bullish for Nvidia (NVDA), Yahoo Finance reports . Say Citi analysts Atif Malik and Papa Syll, “We believe sovereign demand is already contributing up to billions of dollars in 2025 [and will rise more in 2026].” The analysts note that “essentially every sovereign deal” involves Nvidia, putting the company in a central position in the race for AI infrastructure. “Nvidia has line of sight to tens of gigawatts of sovereign and enterprise AI factory buildouts over the next few years.” Citi is forecasting a 5% growth in Nvidia’s revenue for fiscal year 2027, and 11% in 2028, and has currently raised its price target for NVDA to $190, a 20% rally from current prices. In a recent interview with CNBC, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that despite the tariff war and geopolitical uncertainty, retail investors had been using the trading platform to accumulate most of the classic favorites as before, one of which was NVDA. “And if we look at retail, retail has pretty much continued to buy the names that they were buying previously. So heavy in the AI space with companies like Nvidia, Tesla, electric vehicles, big in crypto and fintech-related companies. So it’s very much long innovation. Some companies like Palantir, obviously in the defense space, continue to be retail favorites, but that was always the case, that’s been the case for many, many years.

2025-07-07T18:00:30,"Bit Digital’s Astounding Pivot: Why Ethereum Staking is the Future for This Crypto Miner","BitcoinWorld Bit Digital’s Astounding Pivot: Why Ethereum Staking is the Future for This Crypto Miner In a move that’s sending ripples through the cryptocurrency world, U.S. Bitcoin miner Bit Digital (Nasdaq: BTBT) has announced a significant strategic shift. The company recently sold 280 BTC, redirecting the proceeds to acquire additional Ethereum, boosting its ETH holdings to an impressive 100,603 ETH. This isn’t just a simple asset reallocation; it signals a fundamental change in Bit Digital’s operational focus, moving away from traditional Bitcoin mining towards the burgeoning world of Ethereum staking and reserves. What does this mean for the future of crypto mining, and why are companies like Bit Digital making such bold decisions? Bit Digital’s Astounding Strategic Pivot: Why the Shift? The news from Bit Digital isn’t just about selling one asset to buy another; it’s a clear indication of a long-term strategic re-evaluation. The company had previously signaled its intention to scale back its Bitcoin mining operations, a business historically defined by intense competition, significant energy consumption, and substantial hardware investment. Their new direction, as reported by Jin10.com, points squarely towards Ethereum staking and building up their ETH reserves. But what drives such a dramatic change for a company synonymous with Bitcoin mining? Several factors likely play into this pivot: Evolving Market Dynamics: The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly shifting. With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via The Merge, the entire ecosystem around ETH has changed, opening new avenues for revenue generation beyond energy-intensive mining. Operational Efficiency: Bitcoin mining is resource-heavy, requiring massive capital expenditure on ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and significant ongoing energy costs. Ethereum staking, on the other hand, offers a potentially more capital-efficient and environmentally friendly way to earn returns on digital assets. Revenue Stability: While mining rewards are subject to network difficulty and Bitcoin’s price volatility, staking can offer more predictable yields, providing a steadier income stream for companies looking to de-risk their operations. Future Growth Potential: Bit Digital may see greater long-term growth and stability in the Ethereum ecosystem, especially as its utility expands with various decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. From Pickaxe to Protocol: The Evolution of Bitcoin Mining For years, Bitcoin mining has been the bedrock of the crypto industry, a process essential for securing the network and validating transactions. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, and the first one to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain and earn newly minted Bitcoin. This Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has been incredibly robust, but it comes with its own set of challenges: Energy Consumption: PoW mining is notoriously energy-intensive, drawing criticism for its environmental impact. This has led to increasing regulatory scrutiny and public pressure. Hardware Dependency: Miners must constantly invest in the latest, most powerful mining rigs, which can be expensive and quickly become obsolete. Centralization Concerns: The sheer cost of entry can lead to mining operations becoming concentrated in the hands of a few large entities or pools, raising decentralization concerns. Price Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is directly tied to the price of BTC. Sharp market downturns can quickly turn profitable operations into loss-making ones. Bit Digital’s decision highlights a growing trend among some miners to explore alternatives or diversify their operations beyond pure PoW mining. This isn’t to say Bitcoin mining is dead, but rather that the industry is maturing, and companies are seeking more sustainable and diversified revenue models. Embracing the Future: The Promise of Ethereum Staking In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work, Ethereum has fully transitioned to Proof-of-Stake, a mechanism where participants (validators) ‘stake’ their ETH as collateral to validate transactions and secure the network. In return, they earn rewards. This is where Ethereum staking comes into play as a compelling alternative for companies like Bit Digital. Here’s why staking is gaining traction: Energy Efficiency: Staking consumes significantly less energy than mining, making it a more environmentally friendly option and aligning with growing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment trends. Passive Income: Stakers earn a yield on their locked ETH, providing a relatively stable and predictable source of income, unlike the more variable nature of mining rewards. Reduced Hardware Costs: Staking requires minimal hardware compared to mining, significantly reducing capital expenditure and ongoing maintenance costs. Network Security: Stakers are incentivized to act honestly, as malicious behavior can lead to their staked ETH being ‘slashed’ (penalized). Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin Mining (PoW) Ethereum Staking (PoS) Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Resource Requirement High energy, specialized hardware (ASICs) ETH capital, minimal hardware Environmental Impact High Low Revenue Source Block rewards (new BTC), transaction fees Staking rewards (ETH) Entry Barrier High (capital for hardware, energy access) Lower (32 ETH for solo, less for pools) Diversifying the Crypto Portfolio: What This Means for Bit Digital By selling a substantial portion of its Bitcoin and investing heavily in Ethereum, Bit Digital is fundamentally reshaping its crypto portfolio . This move isn’t just about switching one digital asset for another; it’s about altering the core business model from a capital-intensive, hardware-dependent operation to one focused on yield generation through asset management and validation services. For Bit Digital, this could mean: Improved Financial Metrics: Potentially higher profit margins due to lower operational costs, and more predictable revenue streams from staking rewards. Enhanced Risk Management: Diversifying away from a sole reliance on Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty could cushion the company against market downturns specific to PoW mining. Strategic Positioning: Bit Digital positions itself as an early mover in the institutional Ethereum staking space, potentially attracting new investors interested in sustainable crypto operations. Asset Growth: With 100,603 ETH, Bit Digital has a significant base from which to generate substantial staking rewards, further growing its Ethereum holdings. This shift reflects a mature understanding of the evolving digital asset landscape and a proactive approach to adapting business strategies to new opportunities. Broader Implications for Digital Assets: A Shifting Landscape? Bit Digital’s pivot is not an isolated incident; it’s a strong signal within the broader world of digital assets . As the crypto industry matures, companies are increasingly looking for sustainable and diversified revenue models. Ethereum’s successful transition to Proof-of-Stake has opened up a new frontier for institutional participation, moving beyond just holding assets to actively participating in network security and earning yields. This trend could lead to several significant implications: Increased Institutional Staking: More traditional mining companies or even new players might follow Bit Digital’s lead, boosting the amount of ETH staked and further securing the Ethereum network. Environmental Focus: The emphasis on energy efficiency in PoS could put more pressure on PoW networks like Bitcoin to address their environmental footprint, potentially accelerating innovation in green mining solutions. Evolution of Crypto Business Models: We might see a proliferation of hybrid models, where companies engage in both traditional mining and staking, or even fully transition to staking-as-a-service providers. Investor Sentiment: This strategic shift could influence how investors view crypto companies, favoring those with more diversified, sustainable, and yield-generating operations. While Bitcoin mining remains a vital component of the crypto ecosystem, the rise of Ethereum staking presents a compelling alternative that many are beginning to explore seriously. Bit Digital is simply at the forefront of this potential paradigm shift. Challenges and Considerations for the Transition While the move to Ethereum staking offers numerous benefits, it’s not without its challenges. Bit Digital will need to navigate complexities such as: Smart Contract Risks: Staking often involves interacting with smart contracts, which, despite rigorous auditing, can carry inherent risks of bugs or vulnerabilities. Slashing Penalties: Validators on the Ethereum network can face penalties (slashing) if they behave maliciously or fail to meet their duties (e.g., prolonged downtime). This requires robust infrastructure and monitoring. Liquidity Management: Staked ETH is locked and may not be immediately accessible, requiring careful liquidity planning, although liquid staking solutions are emerging to mitigate this. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for staking services is still evolving, and companies must stay compliant with new rules. However, the potential rewards of a more stable, less capital-intensive, and environmentally friendlier revenue stream seem to outweigh these challenges for Bit Digital. Actionable Insights for Investors and Other Miners What can we learn from Bit Digital’s bold move? For Investors: Pay attention to how crypto companies are diversifying their revenue streams. Those embracing new, sustainable models like staking might offer more stable long-term growth. Evaluate a company’s entire crypto portfolio, not just its primary mining activity. For Other Miners: This is a wake-up call to explore alternative revenue generation. Consider diversifying your operations, investing in staking, or exploring other yield-generating opportunities within the crypto space. The future of crypto profitability might lie beyond pure PoW. For the Crypto Market: The increasing institutional adoption of staking strengthens the underlying networks and legitimizes these new forms of participation. It’s a sign of a maturing market. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Companies Bit Digital’s strategic pivot from extensive Bitcoin mining to a focus on Ethereum staking and reserves is a landmark decision. It highlights a growing recognition within the industry that sustainable, efficient, and diversified revenue streams are crucial for long-term success in the dynamic world of digital assets. This move not only redefines Bit Digital’s business model but also sets a precedent, signaling a potential broader shift in how crypto companies approach asset management and network participation. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, we can expect more players to explore innovative strategies that leverage the full potential of both established and emerging blockchain technologies.

Recently, Canaan (CAN), a prominent Nasdaq-listed Chinese entity known both as a crypto mining equipment manufacturer and a dedicated mining company, made headlines with its impressive operational update. Despite facing typical industry hurdles, Canaan reported mining 88 BTC in June, bringing its total Bitcoin Holdings to a staggering 1,484 BTC as of June 30. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement about financial resilience and a strategic long-term vision in the realm of Canaan Bitcoin Mining . Canaan Bitcoin Mining: Navigating Challenges, Demonstrating Resilience The journey of Bitcoin mining is rarely without its bumps, and Canaan’s June performance is a testament to its operational robustness. The company successfully mined 88 BTC during the month, a commendable feat considering the inherent volatility and external factors that can impact mining operations. PR Newswire highlighted that this achievement came despite experiencing weather-related disruptions and necessary maintenance activities. These challenges, common in the energy-intensive crypto mining industry , often lead to temporary shutdowns or reduced efficiency. Operational Resilience: Mining 88 BTC amidst disruptions showcases Canaan’s ability to maintain high operational uptime and efficiency, even when faced with adverse conditions. This speaks volumes about their infrastructure and management capabilities. Strategic Planning: The continuous output suggests a well-planned and executed mining strategy, focusing on maximizing production even during periods of external pressure. Industry Context: In an industry where profitability can fluctuate with Bitcoin’s price and energy costs, consistent mining output is a key indicator of a company’s underlying strength. Unpacking Canaan’s Bitcoin Holdings: A Strategic Accumulation Perhaps even more compelling than its monthly mining output is Canaan’s record-breaking Bitcoin Holdings . As of June 30, the company held an impressive 1,484 BTC. This figure is not merely a reflection of past mining success but a deliberate strategic choice to accumulate Bitcoin. For a publicly traded company, holding such a significant amount of a volatile asset like Bitcoin signals profound confidence in its long-term value proposition. What does this accumulation strategy signify? Financial Strength: A substantial Bitcoin treasury provides a robust asset base, enhancing the company’s financial stability and acting as a hedge against fiat currency inflation. Long-Term Vision: By choosing to hold rather than immediately sell mined BTC, Canaan demonstrates a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price appreciation and its role in the global financial landscape. Market Confidence: This strategy can instill confidence among investors, signaling that the company believes in the very asset it helps to create. It aligns Canaan’s interests directly with the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This approach differentiates Canaan from some other mining operations that might liquidate a larger portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover operational expenses or for immediate profits. Canaan’s emphasis on BTC Accumulation Strategy positions it uniquely within the market. The Broader Crypto Mining Industry Landscape: A Dual Role Player Canaan’s position in the market is unique because it operates on two crucial fronts within the crypto mining industry .

The broader industry is characterized by intense competition, rising energy costs, and the ongoing challenge of finding sustainable and affordable power sources. Companies like Canaan, with their integrated approach, are better positioned to navigate these complexities. What Does This BTC Accumulation Strategy Mean for Investors? For investors eyeing the cryptocurrency space, Canaan’s aggressive BTC Accumulation Strategy presents an interesting proposition. It suggests that the company’s financial health is not solely dependent on the fluctuating demand for mining hardware but also on the appreciation of its significant Bitcoin treasury. This strategy can be viewed as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, potentially offering investors exposure to both the industrial side of crypto and direct Bitcoin price movements through their equity. However, it also introduces a degree of volatility tied to Bitcoin’s price swings. While higher Bitcoin prices boost the value of Canaan’s holdings, a significant downturn could impact its balance sheet. This dual exposure requires investors to understand both the operational aspects of a mining company and the inherent risks of holding a volatile digital asset. Conclusion: Canaan’s Strong Position in the Digital Frontier Canaan’s latest operational report paints a clear picture of a company with robust operational capabilities and a forward-thinking financial strategy. Mining 88 BTC in June despite disruptions and accumulating a record 1,484 BTC in Bitcoin Holdings underscores its commitment to the digital asset space.

2025-07-07T17:40:30,"Genius Group Bitcoin: A Bold Leap to 10,000 BTC in Two Years","BitcoinWorld Genius Group Bitcoin: A Bold Leap to 10,000 BTC in Two Years Are you keeping an eye on the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management? The world of finance is witnessing a seismic shift, and companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets to fortify their balance sheets. In a truly captivating move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency and traditional investment sectors, Genius Group (NYSE American: GNS) has announced an audacious increase in its Genius Group Bitcoin treasury goal. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a tenfold leap, from an initial 1,000 BTC to a staggering 10,000 BTC, with an ambitious timeline of just 12 to 24 months. For anyone interested in the convergence of corporate strategy and digital assets, this development is nothing short of fascinating. Understanding the Bold Leap in GNS Bitcoin Strategy What exactly does it mean for a publicly traded company like Genius Group to target such a significant amount of Bitcoin? It signals a profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a strategic asset. Genius Group, known for its entrepreneurial education ecosystem, is now making headlines for its forward-thinking approach to its balance sheet. The decision to escalate their GNS Bitcoin target is a testament to their belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. According to a GlobeNewswire press release, the company aims to achieve this monumental goal through a mix of diverse funding strategies. This isn’t merely about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into the core financial planning of a dynamic enterprise. This strategic pivot reflects a growing trend among innovative companies to diversify their treasury holdings beyond fiat currencies and traditional investments. The Genius Behind Their Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Genius Group isn’t just accumulating Bitcoin; they are actively managing their holdings to generate returns. Since resuming Bitcoin purchases in May, the company has reported an impressive 74% BTC Yield . This figure is particularly striking and highlights a sophisticated approach to digital asset management that goes beyond simple HODLing (holding on for dear life). How might a company achieve such a significant yield on its Bitcoin holdings? There are several methods within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) ecosystems: Staking: Participating in proof-of-stake networks (though Bitcoin itself is proof-of-work, wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) can be staked on other chains). Lending: Lending Bitcoin to exchanges or DeFi protocols for interest. Yield Farming: Providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges in exchange for fees and governance tokens. Covered Calls/Derivatives: Using options strategies to generate income from existing Bitcoin holdings. Strategic Trading: Actively managing a portion of their holdings to capitalize on market movements, though this carries higher risk. Genius Group’s ability to generate a 74% yield suggests a proactive and intelligent Bitcoin Treasury Strategy . This isn’t just about passive accumulation; it’s about maximizing the utility and profitability of their digital assets, potentially turning their treasury into an active profit center. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: A Macro Trend Genius Group’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a significant indicator of a broader macro trend: the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, setting a precedent for others to follow. These early adopters have often cited reasons such as: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate capital from the eroding effects of inflation. Store of Value: Recognizing Bitcoin as a digital gold, a reliable store of value in an uncertain economic climate. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their treasury portfolio. Innovation & Future-Proofing: Embracing emerging technologies and positioning themselves at the forefront of financial innovation.

2025-07-07T17:30:29,"Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target","Bitcoin is currently on the path to holding a strong footing above $109,000 after reclaiming the $108,000 price level in the past seven days. Notably, Bitcoin’s price has gained more than $3,000 over the past week, with bullish momentum building steadily across the broader crypto market. Bitcoin is once again flirting with all-time highs, and popular crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader recently shared a technical analysis on social media that claims Bitcoin has now entered its third parabolic phase. His chart places Bitcoin right on track for another historic climb to crazy price targets even in 2025. Bitcoin Following Familiar Price Schedule According to Merlijn’s analysis, Bitcoin’s current market structure is mimicking its past two parabolic rallies that took place in 2017 and 2021. Just like in previous cycles, Bitcoin’s current price cycle has moved through a prolonged consolidation phase and gradually grinded upward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 52% Increase To $166,000, Analyst Reveals Tight Timeline The next thing now is a vertical breakout. A weekly chart that followed his post on the social media platform X highlighted this trend with three red bowl-shaped curves, each leading into a green “Parabolic Phase” box that represents the final leg of each bull run. The price action so far in 2024 and 2025 has continued to trace this same path. The curve that began forming after the 2022 bottom is now tilting upward sharply. Interestingly, Bitcoin bounced cleanly off the lower arc during its April crash to $74,000, just as it did in 2016 and 2020 before launching into new all-time highs. Crypto analyst Merlijn believes this rebound is the strongest indication yet that the final breakout phase is approaching. No Second Chances: Here’s The Price Target According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s current price structure on the weekly chart has never failed in previous cycles. However, anyone waiting on the sidelines may miss the move entirely. “Bitcoin bounced off the parabolic curve support, momentum is building, and if history rhymes with the biggest burst of the move, this parabolic phase does not give second chances,” he explained. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes History With Highest Monthly Close, But Volume Is Still Bearish The most interesting part of Merlijn’s forecast is the price target itself. Based on the chart he shared, the green parabolic zone for 2025 extends as high as $335,000, representing more than a 205% rally from current levels. The mid-region of the box is around $150,000, making even the conservative price target significantly higher than Bitcoin’s current price. This prediction is based on the magnitude of previous parabolic runs, which saw Bitcoin increase by over 2,000% in 2017 and more than 1,300% from its 2020 lows to its 2021 peak. If the third phase delivers a similar rally, the path to $335,000 may not be far-fetched. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $108,850, having reached an intraday high of $109,574.

2025-07-07T17:21:07,"Unexpected Developments in Solana Spot ETFs – Dates for Potential SEC Approval Begin to Clarify","The approval process for the spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) may accelerate beyond expectations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked potential issuers to resubmit revised S-1s by the end of July, responding to comments. Two sources close to the matter confirmed this development. While the SEC technically has until October 10 to approve or reject such a fund, the Commission is reportedly looking to speed up the process and approve one or more funds well before that date. One of the reasons behind this move is the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF (SSK), which was automatically approved last week. Since the SSK fund is considered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it is automatically approved unless the SEC intervenes. SSK, which started trading last week, became the first Solana staking fund on the market and gained a significant first-mover advantage over other potential Solana ETFs. The SEC previously approved spot Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously in order not to give an advantage to a single product in similar cases. Related News: Elon Musk Founded His Own Political Party in the US - What Does This Mean for Bitcoin (BTC) and How Will It Affect It? “I think the SEC is feeling pressure to approve these ETFs sooner rather than later because of the Rex Shares product that was approved last week,” said a source familiar with the matter. The SEC sent its first official communication to potential issuers in June, instructing them to include language on staking and in-kind trading in their filings. This was the first step in signaling that the SEC had formally begun the process for Solana ETFs. With this development, a much earlier date for approval of the spot Solana ETFs, rather than October, is possible. All eyes are now on the new documents to be filed by the end of July and how the SEC will respond to these ETFs. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T17:20:30,"DDC Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Move: Boosting Holdings to 368 BTC Signals Strategic Shift","BitcoinWorld DDC Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Move: Boosting Holdings to 368 BTC Signals Strategic Shift In a significant move that echoes a growing trend in the corporate world, NYSE-listed e-commerce giant DDC Enterprise has once again made headlines, substantially increasing its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision not only bolsters their digital asset portfolio but also sends a clear signal about the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management. The company’s actions spotlight a powerful shift towards integrating Bitcoin as a core financial asset, sparking conversations across the global business community about the future of corporate finance. What’s Behind DDC Enterprise’s Significant Bitcoin Accumulation? DDC Enterprise’s latest acquisition of 230 more Bitcoin at an average price of $90,764 per BTC has propelled its total holdings to an impressive 368 BTC. This recent purchase, reported by Business Wire, builds on their existing Bitcoin treasury strategy, first initiated in mid-June. The company highlighted a remarkable 48.3% yield increase since their previous acquisition, underscoring a calculated approach to integrating Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a deliberate shift towards a new financial paradigm for the enterprise, demonstrating a long-term conviction in the digital asset’s value proposition. The continued accumulation by DDC Enterprise Bitcoin holdings signifies a deeper integration into their corporate balance sheet, reflecting confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a future-proof asset. Why Are Companies Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? The question on many minds is, why are established companies like DDC Enterprise increasingly turning to Bitcoin for their treasury reserves? The motivations are multi-faceted, reflecting a blend of financial prudence and forward-thinking strategy: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply asset. Its scarcity, capped at 21 million coins, makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has shown significant long-term growth. Companies view it as a high-growth asset that can enhance overall treasury returns, especially compared to traditional low-yield instruments. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin diversifies a company’s balance sheet away from solely fiat-denominated assets. This can reduce overall portfolio risk and provide exposure to a rapidly expanding digital economy. Attracting Innovation: Embracing digital assets can signal a company’s innovative spirit, potentially attracting tech-savvy talent, investors, and customers who align with the digital transformation narrative. Accessibility and Liquidity: With improving institutional infrastructure, acquiring and managing significant Bitcoin holdings has become more accessible and liquid for large corporations. However, this strategy is not without its challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin requires a strong risk management framework. Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions also poses a hurdle, as do the complexities of secure custody and accounting for digital assets. A robust Bitcoin treasury strategy must meticulously address these considerations to mitigate potential downsides. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? DDC Enterprise’s move is part of a larger narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption that has gained considerable momentum in recent years. While MicroStrategy remains the poster child for this trend, having amassed over 200,000 BTC, numerous other public and private companies are following suit, indicating a burgeoning movement in the financial world. MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, demonstrating a long-term conviction despite market fluctuations. Their consistent acquisitions have set a precedent for other publicly traded companies. Tesla: Elon Musk’s Tesla famously added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, albeit with some subsequent sales, highlighting both the potential and the practical considerations for large corporations. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s Block has also made significant Bitcoin purchases, reflecting a commitment to the cryptocurrency as a foundational technology and a key part of their financial services offerings. Other Notable Players: Companies across various sectors, from gaming to financial services, are exploring or actively integrating Bitcoin into their financial operations, viewing it as a strategic asset. This increasing institutional Bitcoin interest is often seen as a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. As more established entities commit capital, it lends credibility and stability to the asset class, potentially paving the way for even wider mainstream acceptance. The ‘domino effect’ suggests that as more companies succeed with their corporate Bitcoin adoption strategy, others will feel compelled to explore similar avenues to remain competitive and innovative in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Navigating the Landscape: Insights for Institutional Bitcoin Investors For any institution considering following DDC Enterprise’s path and delving into institutional Bitcoin investments, careful planning and due diligence are paramount. This isn’t a decision to be taken lightly, but rather one that requires a robust understanding of the digital asset space and its unique characteristics. Risk Assessment and Management: Develop a comprehensive risk management strategy that accounts for Bitcoin’s price volatility, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory shifts. This includes setting clear parameters for allocation and potential hedging strategies. Secure Custody Solutions: Partnering with reputable institutional-grade custodians is crucial for safeguarding significant Bitcoin holdings. Solutions range from multi-signature cold storage to regulated trust companies, ensuring the highest level of security. Accounting and Reporting: Understand the complex accounting implications of holding Bitcoin, which can vary by jurisdiction. Work with specialized auditors and legal counsel to ensure compliance with financial reporting standards and transparent reporting. Long-Term Vision: Corporate Bitcoin adoption is often driven by a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. A short-term trading mindset is generally not suited for treasury management. Board and Stakeholder Education: Educate key stakeholders, including board members and investors, on the rationale behind the Bitcoin treasury strategy, its potential benefits, and associated risks to ensure alignment and support for the initiative. These steps are critical for any company looking to successfully integrate Bitcoin into its balance sheet, moving beyond speculative interest to a foundational treasury asset and navigating the complexities of institutional Bitcoin investment effectively. What Do Increasing Crypto Corporate Holdings Mean for the Market? The growing trend of crypto corporate holdings, exemplified by DDC Enterprise’s expanding portfolio, carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. It suggests a fundamental shift in how corporations view digital assets, moving them from niche investments to legitimate treasury components and influencing market dynamics. Increased Market Stability: Large corporate holdings tend to be long-term, reducing the available supply on exchanges and potentially contributing to price stability by absorbing selling pressure from short-term traders. Enhanced Legitimacy: When established, regulated companies like DDC Enterprise allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it confers a new level of legitimacy and trust on the asset class, making it more palatable for other institutional investors and the general public. Broader Ecosystem Development: The demand from corporations for secure custody, sophisticated trading tools, and clear regulatory frameworks drives innovation and development within the crypto infrastructure, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Mainstream Acceptance: As more companies hold Bitcoin, it normalizes its presence in financial discussions and transactions, accelerating its path towards mainstream acceptance as a global reserve asset. This trajectory points towards a future where Bitcoin is not just an alternative investment but a standard component of well-diversified corporate balance sheets. DDC Enterprise’s proactive stance is a testament to this evolving financial landscape, showcasing the profound impact increasing crypto corporate holdings can have on the market’s maturity and acceptance. DDC Enterprise’s bold decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 368 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the future of corporate treasury management. By embracing Bitcoin, companies like DDC Enterprise are not only seeking to enhance returns and hedge against inflation but are also positioning themselves at the forefront of a global financial revolution. This growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption underscores a paradigm shift, signaling a future where digital assets play a central role in the financial strategies of leading enterprises worldwide. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the pioneering spirit of companies like DDC Enterprise will undoubtedly inspire others to explore the transformative potential of Bitcoin.

The foundation insists it was merely testing the waters, but critics see another case of crypto jumping the gun. On July 7, the TON Foundation scrambled to clarify its role in an unauthorized golden visa initiative after UAE authorities issued a rare joint statement disavowing any involvement. The controversy began on July 5 when a since-deleted X post claimed that staking $100,000 worth of Toncoin ( TON ) could fast-track applicants to a 10-year UAE residency, a pitch that quickly caught fire across crypto circles, even drawing cautious interest from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. By July 6, however, regulators from the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority, and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority had publicly shut down the idea, emphasizing that no such program exists. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON.,” the foundation wrote. You might also like: TRUMP hops to Tron, deepening ties between MAGA memecoins and Justin Sun Behind TON’s retreat: what the foundation what TON said—and what it didn’t The TON Foundation’s attempt to distance itself from the unauthorized golden visa announcement raised more questions than it answered. While the foundation called the initiative “exploratory,” that explanation raised eyebrows, especially when it cited working with a mystery “licensed partner” in blockchain infrastructure. They never named names or explained how this would actually meet the UAE’s notoriously strict crypto regulations – pretty big questions to leave unanswered. In its July 7 statement, the TON Foundation stressed the initiative was in “early stages” and would comply with all laws—a tacit admission it had jumped the gun. The pledge to communicate more “transparently” going forward rang hollow to critics, who noted how crypto projects increasingly push into real-world territory with premature or false claims, often without securing regulatory buy-in. One of the most high-profile skeptics was Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. Based in the UAE himself, CZ briefly entertained the idea when it first surfaced, suggesting BNB Chain could explore a similar route if it proved legitimate. this is real, bnb should do the same — Rich (chill/acc) (@iwantlamboape) July 6, 2025 But within 24 hours of calling the rumored visa program “awesome,” CZ dismissed it as “aggressive and misleading marketing”—a stark reminder that even industry leaders can mistake hype for substance.

2025-07-07T17:03:14,"Without Operational Alpha, Bitcoin Treasury Company Premiums Will Collapse","Listed companies are rapidly transforming into bitcoin treasury vehicles, raising capital to buy BTC and hold it on their balance sheets. With bitcoin increasingly seen as a potential global reserve asset, gaining institutional traction and strong price expectations, this trend might seem sound. But there’s a problem: most of these companies have acquisition plans without a business plan. Why buy at a premium when you can buy bitcoin directly? Almost any investor can buy bitcoin directly, either spot or via ETFs. So why invest through a listed company trading at a significant premium to the net asset value (NAV) of its bitcoin? The short answer is: you shouldn’t, unless the company has a clear strategy for putting its bBitcoin to work in a way investors can't easily replicate. Holding BTC must serve an operational purpose. Otherwise, the company should return the capital and let shareholders buy bitcoin on their own terms. Bitcoin Yield ≠ Business Model To justify premiums, some analysts now use the concept of bitcoin yield , the percentage increase in BTC per share over time. While it’s an interesting KPI to track, it doesn’t justify a premium to NAV on its own. Yes, if a company issues equity at a premium above NAV and buys more BTC, it can increase BTC per share. But if an investor’s goal is to gain the maximum bitcoin exposure per dollar invested, investors should just buy BTC directly. Leveraged long with limited upside To speed up their acquisitions, many treasury companies raise capital through various types of convertible debt. The result is a leveraged long position in bitcoin, with full downside exposure and limited upside. This structure is exactly why creditors have been eager to underwrite such instruments. If bitcoin falls, creditors get repaid in USD, while the company may be forced to sell its BTC holdings to cover the debt. If bitcoin rises, creditors convert their debt into shares at a discount and sell them to capture the upside above the conversion price. That’s upside that would otherwise belong to shareholders. As an investor choosing between buying into a leveraged bBitcoin equity company or simply taking on leverage against your own BTC, you have to ask: Is the reduced upside worth avoiding the work of doing it yourself? If the company also trades at a substantial premium to its underlying bitcoin and lacks any operational plan beyond buying and holding BTC, the answer is likely no. The same applies to other simple risk-taking strategies, such as lending out BTC in exchange for interest; they introduce risk, but do little to justify the premium. A business plan, not just a BTC plan This doesn’t mean all bitcoin treasury companies should trade at or below NAV. But a premium requires more than a funding and acquisition strategy, it requires a business strategy. A strong bitcoin balance sheet can serve as a powerful foundation for an operational business. In finance, balance sheets are the basis for lending, trading, structuring and more, and some of the current nBitcoin treasury companies will likely emerge as financial giants of the future. Brokerage, liquidity provision, collateralized lending and structured products are all examples of operational models that can scale, generate revenue, and justify premium valuations. By contrast, simply raising funds to chase ""bitcoin yield"" is not a business plan. If a pure play treasury company doesn't develop an operational plan, its premium will collapse, and it may eventually be acquired by a firm that does know how to put bitcoin to work. Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. To beat BTC, companies must do more than just buy and hold it. They must figure out how to build a Bitcoin-based business.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/07/without-operational-alpha-bitcoin-treasury-company-premiums-will-collapse,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|EXCHANGE","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T17:03:08,"Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Holdings With New $239M Purchase","Japanese investment company Metaplanet has taken another big step in its Bitcoin (BTC) strategy. In a recent X post , the firm revealed it had purchased an additional 2,205 BTC, worth about $238.7 million. This new purchase has pushed Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings to 15,555 BTC. This move reflects both the company’s ongoing commitment to Bitcoin and a growing trend among institutional investors. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off, Sees Revenue Jumps in Q2 The latest acquisition, bought at an average price of $108,237 per coin, places Metaplanet as the fifth-largest publicly listed company holding the top coin. Meanwhile, U.S.-based software intelligence firm Strategy is topping the list, now owning more than 597,000 BTC. Metaplanet’s focus on building its business around the flagship crypto has shown strong financial results. In Q2 2025, the company reported revenue of nearly 1.1 billion Japanese yen, equal to about $7.6 million. This figure represents a 42.4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. The company states that its goal is to develop a business model that is long-lasting, easily scalable, and efficient to manage, utilizing Bitcoin as its financial foundation. This recent revenue growth indicates that its plan is gaining momentum and attracting attention from both investors and the broader financial market. Metaplanet Sets Ambitious Bitcoin Goal In June, Metaplanet updated its long-term goal for its crypto holdings. The company now aims to own over 210,000 BTC by the end of the year 2027. This is a major target and signals the company’s strong belief in the future value and importance of the digital coin in the global financial system. If Metaplanet reaches this goal, it would become one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. This would place it in a very strong position within the fast-growing world of digital assets. Metaplanet’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy reflects a broader growing trend. Many companies are increasingly treating the top coin not just as an investment, but as a strategic asset. Earlier today, Semsler Scientific purchased 187 BTC for approximately $ 20 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 4,636. Firms like Tether-backed Twenty-First, GameStop, and Trump Media are also among the new entrants following this trend. Market Reaction and Stock Performance Following this news, Metaplanet stock dipped by 1.8% while the market remained open, according to Yahoo Finance data. Despite the slight drop, the company’s share price has performed very well over the past several months. In the past month, Metaplanet’s stock has gone up by almost 14% and has jumped by 339% since the start of the year. This substantial rise indicates that investors are confident in Metaplanet’s focus on Bitcoin. It also means they trust the company to grow and handle its investments carefully.

2025-07-07T16:55:40,"U.S. Secret Service Launches New Crypto Fraud Crackdown Campaign Amid Nearly $400,000,000 Scam Epidemic: Report","The U.S. Secret Service is reportedly launching a new campaign against crypto scams with a new team that specializes in digital financial crimes. Bloomberg reports that the agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) uses software, subpoenas and spreadsheets to identify and go after criminals behind fraudulent crypto scams, including pig butchering operations that offer fake investments to victims. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the GIOC has already seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the last 10 years. The Secret Service itself is already one of the world’s biggest crypto custodians after leading crackdowns on digital currencies such as Liberty Reserve and E-Gold in the 1990s. A team led by lawyer Kali Smith, who directs the Secret Service’s cryptocurrency strategy, is conducting workshops in different countries to train law enforcers and prosecutors to uncover digital crimes. The agency provides the training for free and is particularly interested in jurisdictions where criminals take advantage of weak oversight or residency-for-sale programs. Smith says fraudsters have several misconceptions about cryptocurrencies. “They think they can use Bitcoin and be safe. But that isn’t the case.” The Secret Service has also partnered with Coinbase and other industry insiders like stablecoin issuer Tether, which provided assistance in recent cases with trace analysis and wallet freezes. Fraud involving cryptocurrencies now accounts for the majority of internet crime losses in the US. Last year, Americans reported $9.3 billion in crypto-related scams or more than half of the reported $16.6 billion.

2025-07-07T16:51:51,"ICP Rebounds From Intraday Lows as Support at $4.80 Holds Firm","Internet Computer (ICP) exhibited notable resilience over the past 24 hours, weathering a volatile trading session shaped by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. After falling to $4.78, the token rebounded to nearly $4.85 , ultimately settling at $4.7771, down 0.98% on the day. ICP has respected its key support level at $4.80, which was tested and confirmed multiple times throughout the session, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. This level has become a critical pivot zone for traders eyeing potential upside if broader sentiment continues to improve. Macro factors remain influential across the crypto landscape. While geopolitical tensions have unsettled markets, bitcoin's return to $109,000 during the Asian morning sparked volume increases across multiple assets, including ICP, despite relative price stability. ICP’s ability to bounce from support while absorbing intraday volatility could signal traders' growing confidence. Technical Analysis Highlights ICP traded in a 2.54% range, with prices fluctuating between $4.78 and $4.90 from July 6 at 15:00 UTC to July 7 at 14:00 UTC. Strong resistance at $4.90 was tested twice during evening hours on July 6. Support at $4.80 was validated by repeated bounces and acted as a launch point for upward moves. Between 13:05–14:04 UTC on July 7, ICP rallied 0.62%, from $4.81 to $4.84, confirming bullish momentum. Price consolidated between 13:05–13:20 before a breakout began at 13:21 UTC. A sharp rally between 13:57–13:59 lifted ICP to $4.85, marking a nearly 2% jump. Volume surged during 13:41–13:43 (66,623 ICP) and again at 13:57–13:58 (14,170 ICP), suggesting possible institutional buy-ins.

2025-07-07T16:50:50,"Strategy to raise $4.2b via STRD stock sale to fund new Bitcoin purchases","Bitcoin giant Strategy is preparing to make a massive $4.2 billion Bitcoin purchase, funded with more stock sales. After taking a brief pause in purchases, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is preparing for another massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy. On Monday, July 7, the Bitcoin investment firm announced a $4.2 billion at-the-market stock offering. The company is selling a 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, trading on Nasdaq under the ticker STRD. The stock pays a 10% dividend, has priority over other stocks in liquidations, and has no fixed maturity rate. You might also like: Strategy introduced a new perpetual called Stride (STRD). Some call it genius, others say it has ‘Ponzi vibes’ Strategy will sell these shares over a period of time, at their market price. This is typically done to avoid a large supply shock that could tank the stock’s price. The proceeds of the sales will go toward buying Bitcoin, paying dividends on other preferred shares, and funding its operations. $4.2B sale comes after Strategy’s Bitcoin hiatus The latest purchase comes after a brief hiatus in the weekly reporting period from June 30 and July 9. This was the first week in which Strategy made no Bitcoin purchases since early April, briefly pausing its aggressive BTC accumulation. The last time that Strategy raised capital was on June 10 this year in an underwritten public offering . At the time, the company raised $979.7 million from direct investments from investment banks. These banks bought shares upfront and then sold them to the public. You might also like: 91% chance MSTR enters S&P 500 — and Bitcoin becomes an index asset by proxy So far, Strategy has amassed $64.4 billion worth of Bitcoin, or 597,325 BTC. This accumulation brought $22 billion in unrealized profits, as this BTC was bought for a total of $42.4 billion. The total amount of Strategy’s BTC tokens now makes up nearly 3% of the total supply, making it by far the largest corporate holder. Still, its leveraged Bitcoin purchases are causing some concerns over sustainability, especially if Bitcoin’s price falls substantially.
