2025-07-06T22:00:04,"Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz Issues Bold Bitcoin Call","Mike Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has made a bold call to investors in the cryptocurrency space. In response to a post on X, Novogratz claimed that there is growing pressure on Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. This, he maintained, could impact the country’s fiat currency value, hence the need to invest in crypto. Mike Novogratz On Political Interference and Bitcoin as Safe Haven Notably, Novogratz says market participants need to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, as a hedge. He believes that Bitcoin will serve as a safe haven asset for investors if the U.S. dollar weakens due to political pressure on Powell or reckless monetary policy. Given that Bitcoin is decentralized with a limited supply, Novogratz has urged investors to “Buy BTC” as it will become more valuable in the future. According to the Bitcoin advocate, Bill Pulte’s call for Powell’s removal from office, an influential figure with political clout, will not end well. He considers the call to be heading in a financially dangerous direction. Primarily, Novogratz believes that politicizing the Federal Reserve could lead to rate cuts that would negatively impact the dollar. However, such a move to undermine the Fed supports his advocacy for Bitcoin. Is Political Tensions Threatening the Fed’s Independence? For clarity, Jerome Powell’s reluctance to further cut interest rates has sparked hostility towards him. Some Republicans in the U.S. are calling for his resignation . This includes Bill Pulte, who claims there is evidence incriminating Powell. Regardless, Novogratz considers the allegations against Powell as characteristic of a “ Banana Republic move ” which could further weaken the nation’s currency. According to Novogratz, potentially, the move could reduce confidence in U.S. institutions or trigger political instability. Powell had earlier emphasized that interest rate decisions must be based on facts and data, not political predispositions. Amid mounting pressure, some in the financial sector have argued that if Powell gives in, it could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence. Community Reacts to Novogratz’s Call However, reactions have trailed Novogratz’s post on social media. A user, John Lilic, opines that nothing justifies using $2.5 billion for a renovation. Another user, Jefferson, alleged that Powell was not factual with Congress on the renovation and might face grave issues.

2025-07-06T21:45:00,"Bulls vs. Bears: Institutions Pile Up BTC But Price Doesn’t go up, Why?","Over the last thirty days, many institutions have been loading up their bitcoin (BTC) bags. However, these purchases have had no major impact on the price of the leading digital asset. This has sparked concerns among market participants. Many are wondering why BTC has been stuck within a tight range since it hit an all-time high (ATH) in late May. A recent report by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed the reason for the weak price momentum despite persistent institutional demand, which analysts say is currently not enough. BTC Stalls Despite Institutional Demand According to CryptoQuant, BTC purchases from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries belonging to firms like Strategy have declined this year compared to the period from November to December 2024. ETF purchases have decreased from 86,000 BTC in early December to 71,000 BTC in mid-May, and are currently at 40,000 BTC. The trend represents a 53% decline over this period. At the same time, Strategy’s acquisitions have also dropped from 171,000 BTC in December to 16,000 BTC currently. This shows a 90% plunge over the period. Although institutional purchases and ETF flows have kept BTC above $100,000 for a while, further declines could slow price gains. This could be exacerbated by the fact that ETF and institutional buys represent a fraction of the overall BTC demand, which seems to be contracting. At the market’s peak in December, ETF and institutional purchases represented 33% of total Bitcoin demand growth. These entities purchased no more than 257,000 BTC out of the total 771,000 BTC. This indicated that the Bitcoin market had a bigger and unobservable demand coming from other sources. Overall Demand is Contracting Currently, the overall demand for BTC is contracting , having declined by 895,000 BTC over the last 30 days. This metric needs to expand for a sustainable price rally to occur. However, the demand level from institutions right now is not enough to trigger that expansion. CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin’s annual growth chart reflects how ETF and institutional purchases account for only a portion of demand. Apparent demand has also contracted by 857,000 BTC, significantly offsetting the expansion of ETF and institutional demand (377,000 BTC and 371,000 BTC, respectively). “The bottom line is that ETFs and MSTR’s Bitcoin purchase, while overall positive for Bitcoin price gains, are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs,” the market intelligence firm added.

2025-07-06T21:30:15,"XRP Eyes Breakout As Analysts Predict Rally Alongside Real-World Adoption","Despite its choppy price action in the past seven days, the mood in the XRP camp is increasingly bullish. Particularly, XRP is witnessing a wave of bold predictions from several top crypto analysts. This comes just as a major real-world asset tokenization project promises to increase demand and utility for XRP on a global scale by tokenizing $200 million worth of assets on the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s True Value Is Higher Than $110,000, Expert Warns Not Bullish Enough On XRP? Crypto analyst CrediBULL is pushing a bold message to the XRP community: the market is still underestimating the altcoin’s bullish setup. In a post on social media platform X, he noted that XRP is currently going on its eighth month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, which is a feat that few assets in the market can match. He pointed to this extended sideways movement, especially after a strong impulse off the $0.50 level in late 2024, as evidence that XRP is preparing for a continuation of the breakout. Notably, its monthly candlestick chart shows a tight cluster of monthly candles hovering above the $2.00 range. According to CrediBULL, this structure is one of the cleanest in the crypto space, second only to Bitcoin. Image From X: CrediBULL Another major contributor to the current bullish narrative is an analyst known as Ripple Pundit, who projected a 35,000% price surge for XRP the moment Ripple announces a banking license. In his post on the social media platform, he predicted that a regulatory greenlight and the final resolution of XRP’s regulatory overhang with the SEC could trigger a significant increase in price. Similarly, market commentator SMQKE drew attention to the explosive XRP price surge in late 2017 and early 2018, during which Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to XRP’s quick rally from $0.00065 to $2.5. SMQKE noted that the last cycle was merely a glimpse of what’s coming. The next wave of adoption will be global, fully regulated, and built for scale. In his words, “2018 was just a warm-up.” Technical analyst Ali Martinez added further credibility to the bullish case by pointing out the $2.38 level as the next major resistance. This is based on on-chain data from Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows a significant XRP volume concentrated at this price level. If XRP manages to clear this area with strong volume, it would not only overcome heavy resistance but also trigger a cascade of buying interest and a major rally. Image From X: @ali_charts Mercado Bitcoin Tokenization Deal On XRPL XRP’s underlying utility is also gaining traction beyond price charts and predictions. Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America’s largest digital asset platforms, recently announced plans to tokenize over $200 million worth of real-world assets (including fixed income and equity instruments) directly on the XRP Ledger.

2025-07-06T20:10:00,"Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Cap to Strengthen Ethereum Security and Stability","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward a new proposal, EIP-7983, which tries to cap the gas usage per transaction at 16.77 million units. The proposal is proposed to make Ethereum more robust against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, increase stability, and enable higher compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Why Ethereum Needs a Gas Cap With Ethereum’s current configuration, one transaction may exhaust the entire block’s gas limit. This makes it a vulnerability wherein one high-demand transaction can jeopardize the network by tying up resources, raising DoS vulnerability and uncertainty. The proposed EIP-7983 attempts to do this by setting a hard cap of 16.77 million gas (2²⁴) per transaction. “By doing so, Ethereum can raise its resistance to some DoS vectors,” the proposal states. Impact on zkVMs and Network Efficiency The proposed limit is not just a security issue—it’s an issue of licensing as well. EIP-7983 will contribute to increasing Ethereum’s compatibility with zkVMs by encouraging developers to split large transactions into small, manageable transactions. Transactions requesting gas over the 16.77 million limit would be rejected at the block validation level so they would never even get onto the network. This measure operates independently of the block-level gas maximum, which remains variable at the hands of validators. Balancing Innovation and Security Buterin and Wahrstätter point out that 16.77 million is a conscious choice of a limit that can serve most current decentralized finance (DeFi) and contract deployment applications with the additional aim of reducing unnecessary risk. While not backward compatible for addresses above the cap, the vast majority of existing Ethereum transactions are already below the threshold, avoiding excessive disruption. EIP-7983 is the culmination of earlier work like EIP-7825, aiming to make Ethereum handling of transactions more predictable and friendlier to users. Simplifying Ethereum’s Future This concept is one of Buterin’s larger plans to simplify Ethereum. In May, he argued in favor of a simplified protocol on the lines of Bitcoin’s minimalism to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use. His five-year plan involves simplifying Ethereum’s execution, consensus, and shared pieces. Alongside, Buterin is exploring new ideas such as “pluralistic identity,” a digital identity system that strives to maintain privacy while enabling equal online engagement.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-gas-strengthen-ethereum/,"ETH|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Ethereum|Regulation|Web3",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T20:00:46,"Company Owned by Billionaire Gold Miner May Be Seized by Russian Government for Allegedly Breaching Regulations: Report","The Russian government is attempting to seize a gold mining firm owned by a billionaire accused of breaking a rule that bans public officials from engaging in entrepreneurial activity. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office has filed a lawsuit to seize shares of billionaire Konstantin Strukov’s gold mining company, Yuzhuralzoloto, state-owned media Tass reports . Strukov, who has been a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Chelyabinsk Region for 25 years, while also the deputy chairman of the Legislative Assembly, acquired the firm through a bankruptcy procedure. He was also the company’s CEO between 1997 and June 2001 before he became chairman of the board of directors. The government’s lawsuit alleges that Strukov violated a ban on all public officials from engaging in business activity. The rule also requires politicians to sell all their securities, shares, or stakes in companies before taking office. According to Tass, Yuzhuralzoloto produces over 450,000 ounces of gold per year, which is $1.505 billion annually with a profit of 34 billion rubles – $432.43 million. Prosecutors allege that Strukov frequently takes profits from the mine and transfers them abroad to Montenegro, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Latvia, Estonia and Turkey where he and his family purchased houses, yachts and other luxury items. The Russian government is requesting that 100% of Strukov and his daughter’s ownership of the company be transferred to the state.

2025-07-06T20:00:00,"Sextortion and $400m in Bitcoin: Inside the Secret Service’s crypto war","Now armed with blockchain forensics instead of briefcases of cash, the U.S. Secret Service is quietly becoming one of the most sophisticated crypto crime-fighting units in the world. According to Bloomberg , its Global Investigative Operations Center has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets—stored in a single cold wallet—through operations targeting scams, fraud, and extortion. One recent case illustrates the agency’s evolving reach: after a teenager was sextorted for $600, agents traced the crypto through a money mule to a Nigerian national allegedly responsible for thousands of illicit transactions. The agency, led by investigative analyst Jamie Lam, specializes in digital financial crimes using software, subpoenas, and spreadsheets rather than traditional law enforcement tools. The team traces cryptocurrency fraud through domain registrations, wallet connections, and blockchain analysis. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: BitMine secures $250m, TWL Miner bags $95m Romance scams drive majority of crypto losses Americans reported $9.3 billion in cryptocurrency-related scams in 2024, accounting for more than half of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime losses reported to the FBI. Older victims suffered the largest losses at nearly $2.8 billion, primarily through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service’s Kali Smith, who directs the agency’s cryptocurrency strategy, has conducted training workshops in over 60 countries to help local law enforcement unmask digital crimes. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,'” Smith said during a recent Bermuda training session. Recent cases show the agency’s investigative capabilities. An Idaho teenager received sextortion demands after sending inappropriate photos online, paying $600 before contacting police. Secret Service analysts traced payments through an American money mule to a Nigerian passport holder who had processed $4.1 million across nearly 6,000 transactions. British authorities arrested the suspected extortionist upon landing in England, where he awaits extradition. The case involved reconstructing the crime through screenshots, receipts, and blockchain data analysis. It also underscores how digital sleuthing is redefining modern law enforcement—and how online exploitation has become a billion-dollar crimes. The Secret Service collaborates with cryptocurrency companies for trace analysis and wallet freezes. Coinbase and Tether have publicly acknowledged assisting investigations, with one recovery involving $225 million in USDT linked to romance-investment scams. “We’ve been following the money for 160 years,” said Patrick Freaney, head of the agency’s New York field office. “This training is part of that mission.” Read more: NFT sales jump 10% to $136.5m, CryptoPunks shows 26% pop",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/sextortion-and-400m-in-bitcoin-inside-the-secret-services-crypto-war/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT","News|Blockchain|Crime",cryptocompare

According to Arkham’s analysis, the Bitcoin whale in question is moving its assets from the traditional “1-” address format to the more modern and secure Bech32 address format, which starts with “bc1q-.” This is thought to provide increased security, lower transaction fees, and long-term storage for Bitcoin users. Analysts explained the situation as follows: “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were most likely related to address format upgrades. There is a shift from 1- addresses to bc1q- addresses. There is no indication that the whale is selling.” Related News: Coinbase Executive Responds to Claims That the Largest Ethereum Short Position in History Has Been Opened Address formats have changed over time on the Bitcoin network: Addresses starting with “1-” (P2PKH): Bitcoin's first address format. Although shorter and more widely used, it does not support SegWit (Segregated Witness), which leads to higher transaction fees. Addresses starting with “3-” (P2SH): Provides multi-signature (multisig) and SegWit compatibility, but still does not offer full throughput. Addresses starting with “bc1q-” (Bech32 format): The latest format that supports full SegWit features.

Regulatory activity intensified with U.S. lawmakers announcing an upcoming ""Crypto Week"" and Ripple settling its long-running SEC dispute. On the other hand, FTX is struggling with repayments in 49 regions, including China, which has a pretty strict crypto ban. Let’s find out more. DeFi Graphite Network’s Phonebook MVP is a practical, real-world application of decentralized tech built to introduce transparency and reputation scoring to phone numbers. Business Stablecoin issuer Circle has formally applied to establish a federally regulated national trust bank in the United States, a move aimed at enhancing oversight of its USDC stablecoin reserves and aligning with evolving regulatory frameworks for digital assets.

The FTX Recovery Trust has suspended repayments to creditors in 49 regions where cryptocurrency operations face legal restrictions, with Chinese users accounting for the majority of the disputed claims. Fresh disclosures reveal the Trump family’s cryptocurrency holdings have swelled to over $620 million, with memecoins, token sales, and blockchain ventures rapidly becoming one of the most lucrative segments of their portfolio. Trump-affiliated American Bitcoin has raised $220 million to upgrade its mining infrastructure, expand its Bitcoin treasury, and advance plans for a public listing amid growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency mining. Germany’s largest banking group, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe , will introduce cryptocurrency trading by mid-2026, integrating the service into its flagship banking app while maintaining a cautious stance on digital assets.

2025-07-06T18:45:44,"Bank Insider Admits to Nearly Decade-Long Scheme of Falsifying Loan Applications To Steal Funds: DOJ","A bank insider and his co-conspirator admitted to running a nine-year fraud scheme that falsified loan applications to obtain funds. In a press release, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Illinois says that former Tempo Bank senior loan officer Francis Eversman and construction company owner Gregg Crawford pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in a scheme that spanned between 2011 and 2020. Prosecutors say that Crawford recruited straw purchasers to serve as loan applicants in name only for properties that were often extremely overvalued. His brother-in-law, Eversman, would facilitate the approval process of the loans. Crawford used the proceeds of the loans for purposes other than the purchase of the properties. He also provided fake lease agreements in an effort to show rental income from the properties in question. When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became suspicious of the loans during an audit, Crawford told a straw purchaser to provide the regulator with fraudulent information. FBI Springfield Assistant Special Agent in Charge Karen Marinos says the duo violated the people’s trust by carrying out self-serving schemes to increase their wealth. “Every American citizen deserves to walk into their bank and trust the people behind the counter. In southern Illinois, these people are usually our neighbors and friends, people that we trust with our money and wellbeing. “ Eversman and Crawford will be sentenced on October 14th. They face up to 30 years in prison, five years of supervised release and fines of up to $1 million.

2025-07-06T17:30:48,"NFT Market Heats Up Again as Crypto Rally Boosts Sales","The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market is showing signs of a strong comeback . After a period of slowed momentum, digital collectibles have rebounded with a 10.44% increase in total sales volume, reaching $136.5 million. This marks the second straight week of growth for the sector, signaling renewed interest among traders and collectors. Strong Crypto Prices Support NFT Growth The rise in NFT sales is coinciding with the broader crypto market’s upward trend. Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed to $108,000, while Ethereum (ETH) has also gained 3.6% over the past week. The global crypto market cap is now $3.33 trillion, higher than last week’s $3.21 trillion. This growth in top crypto assets is revitalizing the NFT sector, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers. Although the sales volume has increased, the number of NFT transactions has dropped by nearly 20%. However, the number of buyers stayed the same, and the number of sellers increased by 8.09%. This means that fewer trades are occurring, but the trades that do take place are larger in value. Immutable Leads as Polygon Gains Ground Among all blockchains, Immutable remains the leader in NFT sales. It generated $43.9 million this week, representing a 30% increase from the previous week. Its growth continues to be helped by popular gaming collections. The platform also has very low wash trading, meaning most of the activity is real and organic. Polygon, now known as POL (formerly MATIC), moved into second place with $25 million in sales. That is a 51.53% increase from last week. However, Polygon’s wash trading rose sharply, reaching over $564,000. Ethereum blockchain dropped to third place with $22.5 million in NFT sales, a 8.63% decrease. Wash trading on Ethereum also increased slightly. Still, the Ethereum network remains one of the most used blockchains in the NFT space. Other blockchains, such as Mythos, BNB Chain, and Bitcoin, also remained active. Mythos experienced a slight increase in sales, while BNB saw a corresponding drop. The Bitcoin network reached $8.7 million in sales, representing over 12% growth. In terms of buyers, Polygon saw the highest increase, followed by Bitcoin and Mythos. Gaming NFTs are also gaining ground, with top collections like Guild of Guardians Heroes and The Courtyard seeing strong sales growth. CryptoPunks Reclaim the Spotlight CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most well-known NFT collections , is rising again. It climbed to ninth place with $2 million in sales, and the collection has seen improvements in both activity and user interest. Some CryptoPunks were sold for very high prices. One Punk sold for 150 ETH, equivalent to approximately $389,000. Others sold for between $150,000 and $200,000. This shows that collectors are still willing to pay large amounts for rare NFTs.

2025-07-06T17:00:57,"Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High?","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has not been particularly impressive over the weekend, which has been a somewhat consistent theme of the cryptocurrency market so far in the year 2025. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $108,000 mark, showing signs of indecision amongst the investors. With the coin’s indecisive price action, the conversation has been about when the Bitcoin price will return to its all-time high. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio Below 1: On-Chain Analyst In a July 5 post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost revealed that Bitcoin has continued to flow out of centralized exchanges over the past few months. The online crypto pundit mentioned that this trend reflects the growing confidence of investors in the long term. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio 30DMA, a metric that measures the volume of BTC flowing in and out of centralized exchanges over a period of 30 days. A high ratio (>1) indicates more inflows than outflows into exchanges, signaling increased selling pressure for the premier cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a low ratio (<1) implies that more coins are flowing out of rather than into centralized exchanges. When the Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio has a low value, it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding their coins in the long term. According to Darkfost, the Bitcoin monthly outflow/inflow ratio recently fell to around 0.9, its lowest level since the bear market of 2023. With the metric now beneath the 1 threshold, it means that Bitcoin exchange outflows are dominant, reflecting a strong and sustained demand on the spot market. The on-chain analyst said: As of today, demand remains present as outflows continue to dominate, with a growing number of long-term holders stepping in. Ultimately, Darkfost believes that the confidence being shown in Bitcoin’s long-term promise is expected, considering the growing adoption by major corporations and governments, most notably in the United States. “BTC is gradually evolving into a store of value, increasingly used to strengthen treasury strategies,” the crypto analyst added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,103, reflecting a mere 0.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-06T17:00:08,"Bitcoin Crash? That’s Exactly What ‘Poor Dad’ Kiyosaki Is Hoping For","Bitcoin slipped back after hitting an intra‑week peak of $110,600. It dipped about 1.4% over two days. Yet some big names say this looks more like routine wobble than a crash. Based on reports, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki took to Twitter on July 5 to call out what he called “losers” chasing clicks by warning of a Bitcoin collapse. He argued that these warnings only scare off people who might buy and hold for the long haul. Clickbait Claims On The Rise According to his July 5 tweet, Kiyosaki sees clickbait headlines as more about clicks than facts. He pointed out that some writers and social‑media voices claim BTC has hit its cycle top. They say it could plunge soon. But he thinks those calls are meant to keep everyday investors on the sidelines. He warned that fear‑mongering headlines push short‑term traders to sell too early. Kiyosaki didn’t just criticize. He shared his own plan if Bitcoin does drop sharply. He said he hopes “bitcoin crashes’ and buy more coins at a lower price. CLICK BAIT Losers keeps warning of a Bitcoin crash. They want to frighten off the speculators. I hope Bitcoin crashes. I will only buy more. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 5, 2025 He already added to his stash this week, buying above $100,000 per BTC. That shows his faith in a rebound. Many traders use a similar playbook: buy on weakness to lower their average cost. Bullish Targets Drive Decisions He’s set some big goals. Based on his posts, he expects Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of the year. He also predicts it could reach $1 million over the next five years. He treats a drop as a chance to load up on what he calls “the biggest opportunity in history.” He groups the top crypto alongside gold and silver as must‑have assets. BITCOIN is $84k today. Strongly believe Bitcoin will reach $180k to $200k in 2025. What do you think? — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 20, 2025 Not everyone sees it his way. Some analysts warn that a 10% pullback from a top of $110,600 wouldn’t be unusual. Technical charts show Bitcoin has swung 15% or more in past cycles. Retail investors tend to get nervous. And when they sell, prices can slip further in the short run. Long‑Term View Holds Strong Kiyosaki’s stance echoes that of other big holders. Michael Saylor, the former MicroStrategy CEO, has said people who hold Bitcoin for five years have a good shot at big gains. That view rests on Bitcoin’s supply limit of 21 million coins and growing demand around the world. According to market experts, buying on dips only works if prices recover. It also requires cash ready to deploy and nerves of steel. A deeper sell‑off could test anyone’s plan to add on weakness. Hold Or Fold? Kiyosaki’s headline message is clear: fear sells clicks, but it doesn’t have to dictate your move. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long‑term rise, small pullbacks might be the best times to buy. Whether that works out depends on where prices head next—and on each person’s comfort with risk.

2025-07-06T16:55:34,"Drake Drops New Single Comparing ‘Fake Friends’ to Bitcoin’s Brutal Price Swings","Drake, a renowned rapper and Bitcoin enthusiast, has dropped a new single ahead of an album release with lyrics referring to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The single is released at a time when Bitcoin’s future remains uncertain, particularly regarding regulatory support from the US government. It could very well reach an All-Time High (ATH) in the coming months. Drake’s new single addressed themes of betrayal, fake friends, and conflict. Drake released a new single titled “What did I miss” ahead of an upcoming album release. Bitcoin traders have taken a keen interest in the album due to its lyrics—the new single references Drake’s ongoing feud with rapper Kendrick Lamar. Drake refers to his conflict with Lamar as being similar to the price volatility of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate significantly from one day to the next. Drake is also a keen gambler and has been referred to as the ‘Drake Curse’ due to his unfortunate picks on UFC, NBA, among other high-profile sporting events. Blockwave, a Bitcoin hardware provider, predicted in 2022 that it would use data from previous innovations that scaled over time, such as automobiles, electricity, and the internet, to forecast Bitcoin adoption. Blockwave predicted that Bitcoin would hit 10% adoption by 2030, using the listed scalability models for technological innovation. It is estimated that Bitcoin currently has a global adoption rate of 4%, meaning that approximately 4% of the world’s population holds Bitcoin. Therefore, using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, we can safely assume that Bitcoin will double from 4% to 10%, which corresponds to a roughly 2x increase in adoption. This could lead to a 2x price increase from $100k to $200k if the scalability model of technological innovation holds. This forecast supports the Bitcoin traders who have been pointing to a $200,000 price target. Drake’s reference to Bitcoin’s volatility may be timely if the price continues to make large returns for crypto traders. Drake released the new single during a YouTube stream titled “ICEMAN EPISODE ONE,” where the Canadian rapper addressed the issue of betrayal and feuds. In the stream, Drake plays the character of a worker on his lunch break. The song is about a friend who has betrayed his trust. He describes this as being similar to the price of Bitcoin, which sometimes serves as an ally when the price rises, but then becomes a traitor when the price falls, leaving Drake with less money. He could be describing his relationships as being similar to gambling, with one moment being on top, and then being betrayed when he is down on his luck. His lyrics describe friends who once stood by his side and now hang out with people who are his enemies. He describes friendship like the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate without warning. Bitcoin has been a complicated asset to forecast, changing direction within the blink of an eye and causing much suffering for traders who speculate on margin. The ‘Drake Curse’ refers to the rapper’s history of taking large bets on the NBA and UFC. Drake has lost over $1 million in Bitcoin, betting on NBA games. Drake took a bet on the Dallas Mavericks taking the NBA title. He lost his $ 500,000 Bitcoin bet because the Boston Celtics beat the Mavericks. Within weeks of this failed bet, Drake bet another $500k on the Edmonton Oilers winning the NHL Cup. However, the Panthers beat the Oilers, adding another Loss to Drake’s gambling tally. Maybe Drake could release his gambling blockchain that gives all proceeds to a ‘0% admin fees’ charity such as GiveDirectly? This would transform Drake’s gambling losses into charity donations. The more he loses, the more he gives. The UFC has been of great interest to the Canadian rapper. His most notable loss was betting $450,000 on Israel Adesanya to defeat Dricus du Plessis in 2024. However, he has had some notable successes, such as betting on Alexander Volkanovski to beat Diego Lopes. This was a good bet because Volkanovski had experienced some major losses and appeared to be on the verge of retirement. However, recently, Drake bet on Oliveira beating Topuria, which cost him $ 200,000. Topuria achieved a knock-out in the first round, which would have been very disappointing for Drake to watch. Drake, therefore, has a lot of experience with Bitcoin and gambling, earning the title ‘Drake Curse’. The reference to Bitcoin in his latest song is a reflection of how cryptocurrencies have become a mainstream phenomenon, no longer a fringe movement.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/drake-drops-new-single-comparing-fake-friends-to-bitcoins-brutal-price-swings/,"BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:55:24,"Analyst Unveils Crypto Catalysts for ‘Jubilant July,’ Says Altcoins Will Likely ‘Cook’ for Next Few Weeks","A crypto strategist with a history of timely Bitcoin ( BTC ) calls believes that the digital asset market will flourish this month. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. “It’s the start of a new quarter and a new month. It’s also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let’s also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.” As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. “If you’re bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.” Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he’s keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. “I do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like… sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week’s lows as a point we shouldn’t lose on most of these… I think we see others play out something like drawn below.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.

2025-07-06T16:55:00,"Top 3 catalysts for Bitcoin and altcoins this week","Bitcoin and most altcoins remained in a tight range last week, despite rising exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and top US indices, such as the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, reaching a record high. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose above $110,000 for the first time in a month and then pared back those gains, ending the week at $108,000. The market capitalization of all coins ended the week at $3.30 trillion. Here are some of the top catalysts for Bitcoin and most altcoins. Tariff deadline The most important catalyst for the stock and crypto markets will be the end of President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on tariffs, slated for July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with a few countries, including Vietnam, China, and the U.K. Other top trading partners — Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea — may revert to the high tariffs he announced in April. A restart of his “retaliatory tariffs” will likely be bearish for Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market. For example, Bitcoin price plunged to $74,000 after the Liberation Day speech , and then bounced back after he announced the 90-day pause. You might also like: XLM price at risk as Stellar Lumens’ funding rate crashes FOMC minutes Bitcoin and altcoins are also expected to react to the Federal Open Market Committee minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday. These minutes, for the May 6-7, 2025 meeting, will provide more information about the last meeting, in which officials left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The Fed minutes will provide hints on when officials expect to cut interest rates, which would be bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. Still, the odds of a rate cut in July have decreased recently due to the strong nonfarm payrolls data. The data showed that the economy added over 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%. Most traders anticipate the bank to cut rates in September if inflation data continues falling. Bitcoin price potential breakout The other key catalyst for Bitcoin and the crypto market will be the potential BTC breakout. The chart below shows that Bitcoin has remained below the all-time high of $111,900 in the past few weeks. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin has also formed a bullish flag pattern, shown in black, and a cup-and-handle pattern. These two patterns often result in greater gains over time. Therefore, a breakout this week could push it to its all-time high, leading to further gains among altcoins. The other top catalysts in the crypto market include upcoming token unlocks by prominent altcoins such as Aptos ( APT ), Flare ( FLR ), and Ethereum Name Service.

In the past week, the price of Bitcoin and altcoins has barely moved. Bitcoin is up just 0.6%, Ethereum by 2%, and most of the altcoin market has stayed flat. Some meme coins managed double-digit gains, but overall, it’s been a slow, sideways market. Historically, this kind of price action often happens before a big breakout, and all attention is now on what Congress will decide in the coming days. Why Crypto Week Matters During Crypto Week, U.S. lawmakers will discuss and possibly pass several important bills related to cryptocurrency: The Clarity Act: This bill will finally create clear rules for how crypto assets are traded, invested, and regulated in the U.S. The Stablecoin Bill (Genius Act): Focused on regulating dollar-backed stablecoins, it has already passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House as well. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: A bill aimed at blocking government-controlled digital currencies that could invade financial privacy. While some bills, like the Stablecoin Act, are likely to move quickly, others like the Clarity Act, which deals with more complex areas like DeFi, staking, and crypto taxes, might take longer to finalize. Why This Could Trigger a Market Pump Alongside these bills, the U.S. government recently approved a massive $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. This move means more money could flood the financial system, which historically tends to benefit risk assets like crypto. Plus, crypto-friendly policies and clear rules can attract new institutional investors and bringing fresh capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Ethereum’s Big Moment Is Coming While Bitcoin has been surging for months, analysts say Ethereum is about to get its turn. Big names like Bitwise predict that Ethereum ETFs and tokenized assets built on the Ethereum network could see massive growth in the second half of 2025. New projects like Robinhood’s blockchain network and the rise of tokenized stocks and stablecoins on Ethereum’s platform are expected to fuel demand for ETH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-and-altcoins-could-break-out-as-as-u-s-prepares-for-historic-crypto-week/,"ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:30:17,"This technological phenomenon is the worst case scenario for Bitcoin","The debate about the longevity of Bitcoin has been ongoing for years. Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there’s another answer. Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. Let’s be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. Bitcoin is an asset class—other altcoins aren’t included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap. Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there’s a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. Quantum computing isn’t the Bitcoin killer Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton’s laws can’t fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc. Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power. But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins? Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer . All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent. P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won’t be able to spend the Bitcoins—because transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them. The technological phenomenon that could catalyze Bitcoin’s demise NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It’s considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity — wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second. According to a YouGov poll , around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel–Iran conflict , along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years. If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” In such a scenario, one would not be wrong to assume that Bitcoin was not spared.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-will-die-technological-phenomenon/,"BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MINING","OP-ED|Bitcoin|BTC|USD",cryptocompare

Recent market fluctuations have generated a lot of fearful controversy whether the bull cycle has topped out or not. While some institutional investors are still holding strong with optimism of one last leg up, many traders are pessimistic as they panic for a potential price crash. As a matter of fact, the overall market is technically reaching an extremely overbought condition as several meme coins enter a mini bearish phase since the start of the year. Although Bonk and Pengu have regained momentum and continued to show strength amid the latest market drops. Few Meme Coins Defying Market Odds Aside from Bonk and Pengu, which have consistently charted major gains for a week, many meme coins are seriously bleeding out today as Bitcoin loses footings again after almost retesting its recently marked all-time high (ATH). Other meme coins that follow trends are Fartcoin, Useless Coin and AI Agents. Moderate gains from Turbo, Pepe and Shiba have also put their prices in a green zone over the past hours, although they may record losses if Bitcoin’s price continues to drop. Few Binance Alpha tokens, and most especially assets on Dex are not left behind in the daily posting gain as they registered a significant profit at the time of writing. What To Expect With The Current Market Behaviour The fate of the entire market lies in Bitcoin’s future direction. However, if BTC calms or even resumes bullish, the meme coin market may see a strong recovery with Doge and others rising back above their key monthly high. Otherwise, a huge breakdown can be expected in the long term. Further drops in the flagship asset could lead to a serious decline of meme coins in the future with Pengu and Bonk joining the ride. But as of now, they appear to be footing a new bullish phase. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-06T16:08:30,"Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP Rise as Bessent Hints at Trade Deals Before Liberation Day Tariff Deadline","Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin (DOGE) rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550. In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. ""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent said, per Reuters . Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. ""We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000. The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/06/btc-doge-xrp-rise-as-bessent-hints-at-trade-deals-before-liberation-day-tariff-deadline,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|DOGE|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:06:52,"Bitcoin bulls price in new all-time highs in H2 2025, with big money breakout on the horizon","Bitcoin is staring down the second half of 2025 with a clear target: new all-time highs. According to CNBC, large firms have already begun piling more of the crypto onto their balance sheets while Capitol Hill inches closer to passing long-delayed legislation. The price climbed about 30% in Q2, even though most traders called it a consolidation phase. The reason? Monthly returns kept fading, and the coin barely moved from its tight range for most of the quarter. But that didn’t stop it from racking up a 15% gain in H1, even if that’s weaker than the 45% jump during the same period last year. Still, Bitcoin’s staying power above $100,000 since May 9 is keeping bulls aggressive. The coin traded at $108,000 on Sunday, about 3% short of its May record at $111,999, per CoinGecko data . Devin Ryan, who heads financial tech research at Citizens, said, “There’s still an acceleration coming here around ETF adoption… there’s more money coming into those.” Ryan said people are still moving from owning nothing to owning some, adding that the old walls around Bitcoin access are disappearing. “We’re moving closer to the end of the consolidation,” he said. “The path is higher from here.” Public companies set up for massive Bitcoin inflows A group of firms now known as Bitcoin treasury companies is driving that push. These are publicly traded companies that either already hold Bitcoin as a main asset or are planning to. Some of them, including Nakamoto, Twenty One, and Strive Asset Management, are going through mergers with other listed companies to raise capital by offering equity and using it to buy Bitcoin. Steven Lubka, the VP of investor relations at Nakamoto, told CNBC that a lot of that capital hasn’t even touched the market yet. “They’re waiting on SEC approval on the mergers, so there’s way more money that’s coming, that’s trying to buy Bitcoin but has not currently bought it,” Lubka said. “We have not yet seen the full impact of even just the money that’s already lined up.” Lubka said adoption isn’t the only driver right now. The broader macro setup is turning bullish too. He pointed to rising fiscal spending, surging stock prices, and a White House under Donald Trump that appears supportive of crypto. “Bitcoin’s maturity as an asset class intersects with a huge amount of capital coming in through new financialization vehicles,” Lubka said, referring to the treasury companies. “You’re going to see a ton of fiscal spending, and you also have an administration that’s pro-Bitcoin,” he added. “These four factors are going to intersect together to produce a pretty material bull market.” Legislation and Fed drama add fuel for Q3 surge Bitcoin’s next leg higher could be helped by Washington. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said the political landscape could play a major role in the third quarter. If President Trump replaces Jerome Powell as Fed chair, markets could start betting on earlier rate cuts, which may boost investor confidence in the central bank’s independence. Kendrick also flagged a potential law: the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill now working its way through Congress. He believes it could pass in Q3 and trigger a ton of new retail demand. “It could encourage more retail investors to make their first investments in crypto, with Bitcoin the prime beneficiary,” Kendrick wrote in a research note last week. But not everyone’s completely calm. Kendrick said prices could get messy around late September because of fears tied to Bitcoin’s four-year cycle. In that cycle, the coin usually dumps around 18 months after a halving, when the rate of new supply is slashed. The last halving happened in April 2024, which puts that potential correction window directly into H2. Still, Kendrick isn’t backing off his forecast. He believes the current demand, especially from ETFs and treasury companies, will be enough to hold up the price even if some long-term holders start unloading. “The key this time will be whether increased ETF and Bitcoin treasury flows are enough to offset any other selling by long-term holders,” Kendrick said. “We think they will be.” By Kendrick’s estimate, Bitcoin could rise to $135,000 by the end of Q3, and then finish the year at $200,000. He expects that once investors stop worrying about another cycle repeat, the crypto will keep rising. “Once market concerns about this have passed, we expect Bitcoin to continue to rise to our end-Q4 forecast,” he wrote.

2025-07-06T16:00:00,"UK crypto crackdown: Harsher fines incoming for non-compliant traders","Britain’s crypto traders may soon face more than just market volatility—starting in January, failure to share personal details with trading platforms could cost them £300 each. The UK government is tightening its grip on the crypto economy with new tax compliance rules that require users to provide identifying information to exchanges and platforms. The Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, designed to close loopholes and capture unpaid capital gains, is expected to raise £315 million by April 2030. The fines—targeting both individual holders and non-compliant service providers—are part of a broader push to bring digital assets under traditional financial oversight and align UK regulations more closely with U.S. policy than the EU’s approach. According to the Daily Mail , holders of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and other cryptocurrencies must supply accurate information to exchanges and platforms they use for trading. Service providers that fail to report transaction details and tax reference numbers will also face penalties. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: BitMine secures $250m, TWL Miner bags $95m ‘I’m not going to apologise’: Chancellor Reeves Exchequer Secretary James Murray MP stated the rules will help “crack down on tax dodgers as we close the tax gap.” The minister emphasized that comprehensive reporting will ensure “tax dodgers have nowhere to hide” while generating revenue for essential public services including healthcare and law enforcement. The new framework forms part of broader government efforts to increase tax compliance across digital asset transactions. Current UK tax rules require cryptocurrency holders to pay capital gains tax on profits, but enforcement has been limited by reporting gaps. The timing coincides with Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s refusal to rule out future tax increases following recent welfare reform reversals. Reeves defended the government’s fiscal approach, stating, “I’m not going to apologise for making sure the numbers add up.” The tax compliance measures complement the UK’s broader cryptocurrency regulatory framework, with draft legislation published in April 2025. This brings crypto exchanges, dealers, and stablecoin issuers under traditional financial services oversight.

UK authorities are extending existing financial regulations to crypto firms through phased implementation expected to be complete by 2026. The first phase focuses on stablecoins while the second phase will expand to broader cryptoasset categories and activities. Key rules and requirements are already being implemented throughout 2025. Cryptocurrency service providers will need to implement customer data collection systems and regular reporting procedures to avoid penalties. The compliance burden may increase operational costs for smaller exchanges and trading platforms. Users trading on non-compliant platforms or failing to provide required documentation face direct financial penalties. The £300 fine structure creates clear incentives for voluntary compliance while generating revenue from non-compliant actors. Chancellor Reeves acknowledged that recent policy reversals have been “damaging” but maintained that fiscal responsibility requires comprehensive tax collection.

That’s a long way from Blockware’s forecast that 10% could be on board by 2030. Those numbers show that while the buzz is loud, real wallets holding Bitcoin remain few. For many, Bitcoin is still a headline rather than a habit. State Level Moves Shift Policy Last month, Texas became the first US state to set up a public Bitcoin stockpile. Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21, creating a standalone fund run by state’s comptroller. That setup keeps the reserve out of the normal state treasury, so it can’t be raided for other expenses. A follow‑up bill, HB 4488, cements its legal protection, making sure the fund stays intact no matter what. Not every state has pushed ahead. In May, Florida dropped its crypto legislation, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana and Oklahoma in pulling back. Arizona’s House Bill 1025, despite getting farther than any similar measure, was vetoed by US President Donald Trump on May 3.

In a new op-ed for Time , Jones says that while we can celebrate technological progress, there should also be consideration, or even “vigorous debate,” of the societal cost of game-changing technologies like AI. The Tudor Investment Corporation founder references a recent warning from Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, who said AI could eliminate about half of all entry level white collar jobs in the next one to five years. Even if Amodei is only half correct, Jones says such a transformation would create “unprecedented social upheaval.” “If we follow the playbook of the last 45 years where over 92% of productivity gains went to shareholders over workers, and if Amodei is even half right on his unemployment prediction, you can bet we will face unprecedented social upheaval. In the worst-case scenario, the safety-net strains that high unemployment will place on states and municipalities will force many into bankruptcy. The federal government won’t be a good backstop because with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120% it won’t have the borrowing power it once did. Bond markets will tank and take stocks with them.” The investor calls for several responses to AI, including a federal law requiring AI content to be watermarked so it’s clear it’s AI-generated. Otherwise, Jones says “humans will become irrelevant in the world we are headed for if we don’t demand human authenticity.” Jones also calls for a bipartisan commission that addresses issues of productivity sharing, as well as bilateral talks with China to “start establishing shared AI safety protocols to protect the entire world from mistakes and bad actors.” “None of this is radical. It’s rational. The unemployment data on entry-level jobs is a call to action.

2025-07-06T14:30:55,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (IBIT) Just Two Spots Away From Being Firm’s Top Revenue-Generating ETF: Bloomberg Analyst","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is already generating substantial revenue for the world’s largest asset manager, despite being on the market for less than two years. In a new post on the social media platform X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas says that IBIT needs to grow its fund’s assets by less than $10 billion to rank as BlackRock’s top revenue-generating exchange-traded fund (ETF). “IBIT is now the third-highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock out of 1,197 funds, and is only $9 billion away from being #1. Just another insane stat for a 1.5-year-old (literally an infant) ETF. Here’s the top 10 list for BlackRock (aside, how about the forgettable IWF at the top spot, who knew?).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X Based on the analyst’s data, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETF is already producing an estimated revenue of $191 million per year at $76.314 billion in fund assets while charging 25 basis points annually to investors. Balchunas appears to posit that if the net assets of the fund grow by $9 billion, IBIT will produce an annual revenue of about $213 million, enough to surpass the revenue generated by IWF. BlackRock’s IWF or iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF offers exposure to US firms whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has been around since May 2000 and is generating $211 million in yearly revenue, charging 19 basis points per year to investors. Meanwhile, the firm’s iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) – which gives investors exposure to a broad range of equities trading in the European, Australian, Asian and Far Eastern markets – was launched in 2001 and is generating $207 million in revenue annually with an expense ratio of 0.32%. As of Thursday’s close, IBIT is trading at $62.19.
