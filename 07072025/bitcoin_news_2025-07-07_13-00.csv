2025-07-07T10:50:56,"Bitcoin Boom: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Accumulation Reaches 1,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Boom: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Accumulation Reaches 1,000 BTC The world of finance is constantly evolving, and perhaps no asset has captured global attention quite like Bitcoin . While individual investors have long flocked to its promise, a seismic shift is underway: major corporations are now making significant forays into digital assets. This trend gained fresh momentum recently with a striking announcement from a UK-based tech innovator, signalling a powerful vote of confidence in the future of decentralized finance. The news isn’t just about another purchase; it’s about a strategic milestone that highlights the increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. The Smarter Web Company’s Bold Move: Reaching 1,000 BTC The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, recently made headlines with its latest substantial acquisition of Bitcoin . In a move that underscores their forward-thinking financial strategy, SWC announced via X that they had purchased an additional 226.42 BTC. This significant buy, valued at an impressive £17,871,846 (approximately $24.3 million), catapults their total Bitcoin holdings to a landmark 1,000 BTC. This round number isn’t just a milestone; it represents a formidable asset base, now valued at an estimated £78,228,156 (or $106.5 million), firmly positioning SWC as a notable player in the corporate crypto space. This latest acquisition isn’t an isolated incident but rather a continuation of SWC’s long-term vision to integrate digital assets into its financial framework. Their consistent accumulation demonstrates a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. For many in the traditional finance world, such moves by established companies are pivotal in bridging the gap between conventional investment strategies and the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. Here’s a quick look at the details of SWC’s recent acquisition: Amount Purchased: 226.42 BTC Purchase Price: £17,871,846 ($24.3 million) Total BTC Holdings: 1,000 BTC Total Value of Holdings: £78,228,156 ($106.5 million) Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin? Understanding Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Why are an increasing number of companies, from tech innovators like SWC to established giants, turning their gaze towards Bitcoin ? The phenomenon of institutional Bitcoin adoption is not a fleeting trend but a calculated strategic shift. For many corporate treasuries, the traditional approach of holding large cash reserves in an inflationary environment is becoming less appealing. Bitcoin offers a compelling alternative for several reasons: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, cash reserves held in fiat currencies tend to lose purchasing power over time. Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins) makes it a deflationary asset, positioning it as a potential hedge against inflation. Digital Gold: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with the precious metal, such as scarcity, divisibility, and portability. It serves as a decentralized, global, and permissionless store of value, independent of any single government or financial institution. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer portfolio diversification. Its relatively low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can help reduce overall portfolio risk and potentially enhance returns. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth. Companies are increasingly willing to tolerate short-term price fluctuations for the potential of substantial long-term appreciation. Forward-Thinking Strategy: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s progressive stance and adaptability to the evolving digital economy. It can attract talent, appeal to a tech-savvy customer base, and position the company at the forefront of financial innovation. Companies like MicroStrategy, Square (now Block), and even Tesla have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, paving the way and demonstrating the viability of such a strategy. Their bold moves have spurred discussions among boards and CFOs worldwide, leading to a deeper exploration of digital assets and accelerating the pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption across various sectors. Navigating the Landscape of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Unpacking Crypto Investments While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, holding a significant amount of a volatile asset like Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet isn’t without its complexities. For firms making substantial crypto investments , careful consideration must be given to several factors related to corporate Bitcoin holdings : Key Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically. Companies must have a clear strategy for managing this volatility, which might include dollar-cost averaging, setting clear buy/sell targets, or holding for the long term with no intention to trade short-term. Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to stay abreast of local and international regulations concerning digital asset ownership, taxation, and reporting. Security Protocols: Securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures. This includes using multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and engaging with specialized crypto custodians to mitigate the risk of hacks or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, as it is often treated as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life. This requires regular impairment testing, which can lead to non-cash charges against earnings if the price drops. Shareholder Perception: Companies must be prepared to communicate their crypto investments strategy clearly to shareholders, addressing concerns about risk while highlighting potential benefits. Companies engaging in significant crypto investments often implement robust risk management frameworks, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and engaging with specialized crypto custodians. They also work closely with legal and accounting professionals to navigate the evolving regulatory and financial reporting landscape. The move by the Smarter Web Company underscores that these challenges are manageable for businesses with a clear vision and robust operational frameworks. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Corporate Treasuries? Actionable Insights for Future Crypto Investments The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a legitimate corporate treasury asset is far from over. As companies like the Smarter Web Company continue to expand their corporate Bitcoin holdings , it sends a clear signal about the increasing confidence in digital assets. This growing trend suggests a future where Bitcoin , and potentially other cryptocurrencies, play a more central role in global finance. What does this mean for other businesses considering similar moves? Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Bitcoin: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the technology, market dynamics, and associated risks before making any crypto investments . Start Small and Scale Up: Begin with a manageable allocation to gain experience and build internal expertise before committing larger sums. Prioritize Security: Invest in top-tier security solutions and consider working with reputable third-party custodians. Seek Expert Advice: Engage with legal, tax, and financial advisors specializing in digital assets to ensure compliance and optimal strategy. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for holding Bitcoin (e.g., long-term store of value, inflation hedge, speculative asset) and stick to it. Communicate Transparently: Prepare to educate and inform stakeholders about your digital asset strategy. The strategic accumulation of Bitcoin by companies like SWC serves as a blueprint for others looking to diversify their treasury holdings and embrace the future of finance. As the digital asset market matures, the infrastructure supporting corporate participation, from custody solutions to regulatory clarity, is also improving, making such moves increasingly viable. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Towards a Digital Future The Smarter Web Company’s latest acquisition of 226.42 BTC, pushing their total holdings to a strategic 1,000 BTC, is more than just a financial transaction. It’s a powerful testament to the growing conviction among forward-thinking businesses regarding the long-term value and strategic importance of Bitcoin . This bold move highlights the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption and the transformative potential of crypto investments in redefining corporate treasury strategies. As the digital asset landscape matures, expect to see more companies following suit, recognizing Bitcoin not just as an alternative asset, but as a fundamental component of a diversified and resilient financial future. SWC’s commitment to corporate Bitcoin holdings is a clear indicator that the digital revolution is not just for individuals but for innovative enterprises ready to lead the charge.

2025-07-07T10:42:39,"Traders Bet Against Bitcoin Rally as Funding Rates Slide on Binance","Bitcoin’s price briefly rose above $109,000 early Monday, as tariff-related volatility fears eased. The Trump administration announced that tariffs would take effect on August 1, providing markets with much-needed breathing room. A key trend emerging amidst the current market conditions is the plunging funding rates. Market Mismatch In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed that funding rates on Binance are steadily declining even as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000-$110,000 range, which means that traders are increasingly opening short positions despite the ongoing rally. The drop in funding rates indicates that many market participants are betting against the current uptrend because they potentially perceive the rally as an opportunity to sell rather than accumulate. However, CryptoQuant stated that this mismatch between price action and market sentiment is creating conditions for short pressure to build, with traders who are betting on a decline facing growing risks of liquidation or forced margin calls. As Bitcoin continues to trade around $109,000, these shorts are gradually squeezed out of the market, which adds additional upward momentum that could fuel a self-reinforcing price surge. Given that Binance remains the largest exchange by trading volume, its funding rates often serve as a proxy for broader market sentiment, which makes this trend significant for traders monitoring potential catalysts for continued price increases. Upside Breakout Potential Last week, two 14-year-old Bitcoin wallets moved 20,000 BTC worth $2.18 billion in rare transactions, which surprised on-chain watchers tracking dormant “Satoshi-era” coins. Despite speculation around potential sell-offs or institutional activity, the market remained unfazed, and BTC’s price held firm above $108,000 after the transfers. The stable price action suggested that traders viewed the movement as a neutral event rather than an immediate sell pressure trigger. Following the market’s composed response, the spotlight is now on whether Bitcoin can build momentum for its next move. Meanwhile, John Bollinger, the inventor of the widely used Bollinger Bands indicator, noted that the leading cryptocurrency looks to be “setting up for an upside breakout,” as it continues consolidating near its all-time highs.

2025-07-07T10:40:56,"Russia Unveils Landmark Crypto Mining Registry: Boosting Tax Revenue and Control","BitcoinWorld Russia Unveils Landmark Crypto Mining Registry: Boosting Tax Revenue and Control The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and with its rapid growth comes the inevitable push for greater regulation. Recently, a significant development emerged from Russia that could redefine the landscape for digital asset miners globally. The Russian Energy Ministry is reportedly taking a bold step by creating a national database of crypto mining equipment. This move isn’t just about tracking hardware; it’s a strategic initiative designed to tackle unauthorized activities and, crucially, to significantly increase the nation’s tax revenue from the burgeoning crypto sector. For anyone involved in Crypto Mining Russia , this is a development that demands close attention. What is the Russian Crypto Regulation Initiative All About? At its core, this new initiative by the Russian Energy Ministry aims to bring transparency and accountability to the country’s crypto mining industry. For years, crypto mining has operated in a somewhat gray area, with varying degrees of official recognition and oversight. This new registry seeks to formalize the industry by creating a comprehensive national database that will track every piece of mining hardware used across the country. Think of it as a centralized inventory system for all mining rigs, from small-scale home operations to large industrial farms. Centralized Data: The registry will collect data on the type, location, and operational status of mining equipment. Official Recognition: It signals a shift towards acknowledging crypto mining as a legitimate, albeit regulated, economic activity. Inter-agency Collaboration: This isn’t just an Energy Ministry project; it’s expected to involve collaboration with tax authorities, law enforcement, and other relevant government bodies. Long-term Vision: This move is part of a broader trend of countries seeking to integrate digital assets into their existing financial and regulatory frameworks. Why a National Mining Registry ? The Goals Behind Russia’s Move The decision to establish a national registry isn’t arbitrary. It’s driven by several key objectives that address both economic and regulatory challenges. Russia, with its abundant and relatively cheap energy resources, has become a significant hub for crypto mining. However, this growth has also presented challenges related to energy consumption, environmental impact, and illicit activities. The primary goals of implementing a National Mining Registry include: Goal Description Expected Outcome Curbing Unauthorized Activities Identifying and penalizing illegal mining operations that bypass regulations, steal electricity, or are used for illicit purposes. Reduced energy theft, improved grid stability, decreased criminal activity related to crypto. Increasing Tax Revenue Bringing mining operations into the formal economy, ensuring they contribute taxes on their profits. Significant boost to state coffers, funding for public services. Energy Grid Management Monitoring and managing the substantial energy consumption of mining farms to prevent overloads and ensure stable power supply. More efficient energy distribution, fewer power outages caused by unregulated mining. Economic Development Creating a stable and predictable environment for legitimate mining businesses, encouraging investment and job creation. Attraction of foreign investment, growth of local tech industries. Boosting Crypto Tax Revenue : A Key Driver One of the most compelling reasons for Russia to implement this registry is the immense potential for increased Crypto Tax Revenue . As the value of cryptocurrencies has soared, so too have the profits generated by mining operations. However, without a clear mechanism to track and tax these activities, a significant portion of this potential revenue has remained untapped. The registry provides the necessary framework for tax authorities to identify miners, assess their operations, and ensure compliance with tax laws. This could involve various forms of taxation: Income Tax: On the profits generated from selling mined cryptocurrencies. Energy Tariffs: Potentially differentiated electricity tariffs for mining operations, or taxes on energy consumption. Equipment Import Duties: Taxes on the import of specialized mining hardware. By bringing these operations into the light, Russia aims to create a new, substantial income stream for the state budget, mirroring efforts seen in other nations exploring digital asset taxation. The Challenge of Unauthorized Crypto Mining in Russia The existence of a significant volume of Unauthorized Crypto Mining has been a persistent headache for Russian authorities. These operations often tap into the national grid illegally, leading to energy theft, power fluctuations, and even blackouts in certain regions. Furthermore, unregistered mining activities make it difficult for law enforcement to track potential illicit uses of cryptocurrencies, such as money laundering or funding illegal activities. The registry is envisioned as a powerful tool to combat these issues. By requiring all equipment to be registered, authorities can: Identify Illegal Connections: Cross-reference registered equipment with energy consumption data to spot anomalies. Track Malicious Actors: Link unregistered equipment to individuals or organizations engaged in illegal activities. Enhance National Security: Gain better oversight over a sector that could potentially be exploited by bad actors. This crackdown is not just about revenue; it’s about establishing state control and ensuring the integrity of critical infrastructure. Impact on Crypto Mining Russia : What Miners Need to Know For miners operating in Russia, this new registry will undoubtedly bring significant changes. While it introduces new compliance requirements, it also offers a pathway to legitimacy and potentially a more stable operating environment. Miners will need to: Register Their Equipment: This is the fundamental requirement, ensuring their operations are officially recognized. Comply with Tax Laws: Prepare to pay taxes on their mining profits, potentially requiring detailed record-keeping. Adhere to Energy Regulations: Ensure their power consumption is within legal limits and they are paying appropriate tariffs. Potentially Benefit from Stability: Legitimate miners might see reduced risks from raids or sudden operational shutdowns, as they will be operating within a recognized framework. The transition may be challenging for some, especially those who have operated off-grid, but it represents a maturation of the industry within Russia. It could lead to a more professionalized and transparent mining sector. Broader Implications: What Does This Mean for Global Crypto? Russia’s move is not isolated. It’s part of a global trend where governments are increasingly grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Countries like the United States, Canada, and various European nations are also exploring or implementing their own regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Russia’s approach, particularly its focus on a national equipment registry, could serve as a blueprint or a cautionary tale for other nations considering similar measures. It highlights a growing recognition that crypto mining, as a significant energy consumer and economic activity, cannot remain entirely unregulated. This trend suggests that: Regulation is Inevitable: More countries will likely follow suit, introducing various forms of oversight. Energy Consumption is a Key Concern: Governments are keen to manage the environmental and grid impact of mining. Taxation is a Priority: States are looking for new revenue streams from the crypto economy. The Russian experience will be closely watched by policymakers and crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Navigating the New Landscape: Actionable Insights for Miners For current and prospective crypto miners in Russia, adapting to this new regulatory environment is crucial for long-term success. Here are some actionable insights: Proactive Compliance: Don’t wait for enforcement. Begin understanding the registration process and gather necessary documentation now. Professional Consultation: Seek advice from legal and tax professionals specializing in crypto to ensure full compliance. Energy Efficiency: Invest in more energy-efficient mining hardware and optimize operations to manage costs under potentially new energy tariffs. Location Strategy: Consider areas within Russia that are officially designated or encouraged for mining, which might offer more favorable conditions or support. Advocacy and Engagement: Where possible, engage with industry associations or participate in discussions to voice concerns and contribute to shaping fair regulations. Embracing these changes can turn a potential challenge into an opportunity for legitimate growth. Conclusion: A New Era for Russian Crypto Mining The establishment of a national registry for crypto mining equipment marks a pivotal moment for Crypto Mining Russia . It signifies a clear shift towards greater governmental oversight, aimed at increasing tax revenue, combating unauthorized activities, and ensuring energy stability. While it presents new challenges for miners in terms of compliance and operational adjustments, it also paves the way for a more formalized, transparent, and potentially stable industry. This bold move by Russia will undoubtedly set a precedent and provide valuable lessons for other nations grappling with the complexities of regulating the rapidly expanding world of digital assets.

Cartwright stated that with this important development, other institutional customers have also started to show interest in Bitcoin. The firm advised an unnamed British pension fund on Bitcoin investment in November 2024. The firm’s senior investment advisor Arash Nasri said in a statement that the initial response in the industry had been “surprisingly positive.” Following these developments, Cartwright has now published its first “Annual Bitcoin Assessment Report.” The purpose of this report is described as increasing Bitcoin awareness among institutional investors. When asked whether the fund would increase its Bitcoin allocation in the future, Nasri said: “If Bitcoin continues to provide the returns we expect, our real question will be ‘when should we reduce it?’” It was learned that the firm has started talks with other clients about similar investments. However, Nasri said that pension funds need to fully understand Bitcoin and take steps with a long-term perspective. Stating that Cartwright has a neutral position in this process, Nasri said, “We are not a firm that manages investments. We are independent advisors and have built up a serious knowledge base to understand the potential impacts of Bitcoin on individuals, companies, asset owners and governments. “It is our duty to investors to raise awareness in this area,” he said. However, adding that there are still some skeptics in the sector, Nasri stated that the argument that “Bitcoin’s price is too volatile” is frequently voiced, but this approach is disappointing, and added, “Our sector should be experts in portfolio management and position sizing. “This reluctance to understand a new form of money and technology is very thought-provoking,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Once holding a balance of $16.28 million, the account is now just worth $610,000, recording a $15.67 million in realized losses. Hyperliquid trader makes losses after Q1 bull run The trader had opened $200 million worth of 50x leveraged short positions on BTC and ETH just hours before US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a national crypto reserve in March. The market had seen the order as bullish, and pushed crypto markets alongside BTC to highs , triggering Qwatio’s early losses. They are also known for having held a large position in the Melania coin during its initial launch earlier in 2025. After losing thousands of dollars Qwatio continued shorting the two largest coins by market cap into the second quarter of the year. On July 4, after already being liquidated 10 times, the trader opened another short position against Bitcoin, betting 21 BTC valued at $2.3 million while the asset was trading at $109,135, just $2,000 down from its all-time high level. The coin has since dropped to $108,993, and Qwatio will be hoping it goes further down against the predictions of analysts, who have asserted that BTC is in a “weak positive” short-term market sentiment. Market wide short and long liquidations surge Qwatio’s losses took place against the backdrop of several liquidations in the crypto derivatives market. In the 24-hour period ending July 7, total liquidations across all major cryptocurrencies reached $184.16 million, according to CoinGlass. The numbers included $47.14 million in long positions and $137.01 million in short positions, a strong squeeze on bearish traders as markets are trading in the green. Ethereum led the liquidation totals, with $64.14 million wiped out, $49.62 million from short positions and $14.52 million from longs. Bitcoin followed, with $35.38 million liquidated, including $31.25 million in short positions. Many traders, like Qwatio, misjudged the market direction and were caught off-guard by the strength of the market uptick. NVT golden cross on BTC chart spells price topping According to a CryptoQuant take, the NVT golden cross successfully flagged three recent tops in 2025: February 2, March 24, and June 16. On each occasion, the indicator peaked above the 2.2 threshold, coinciding with BTC price highs of $97,600, $87,500, and $106,800 respectively. Each peak was followed by corrections of -23.65%, -16.06%, and -9.87%. Source: CryptoQuant As of the latest reading, the NVT GC stands at 1.98, yet to breach the 2.2 signal line again, but has room for a price momentum on the upside. Analysts believe that if the NVT crosses 2.2, there will be a price pullback for several days. Bitcoin’s price rise has triggered a chain reaction across derivatives platforms, particularly on Binance, where short positions have been on the rise. Many traders appeared to interpret the rally as a selling opportunity. Still, the continued ascent in BTC’s price forced many of these short-sellers into liquidation or margin calls. The liquidations have helped fuel a bullish feedback loop, accelerating the upward price movement. When bearish bets are squeezed out of the market, bullish momentum builds, a pattern visible in this week’s trading behavior.

2025-07-07T10:20:40,"Bitcoin: Metaplanet’s Bold Move Amplifies Japan’s Crypto Ambitions with Massive BTC Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Metaplanet’s Bold Move Amplifies Japan’s Crypto Ambitions with Massive BTC Holdings In a move that reverberates across the global financial landscape, Japan’s publicly traded firm, Metaplanet, has once again underscored its profound commitment to Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically increasing its holdings. This strategic acquisition is not merely a transaction; it’s a powerful statement on the future of corporate treasury management and the burgeoning confidence in Bitcoin as a foundational digital asset. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital finance, Metaplanet’s latest action serves as a compelling indicator of a significant shift, positioning Japan at the forefront of the corporate crypto revolution. What’s Behind Metaplanet’s Bold Metaplanet Bitcoin Strategy? Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company that has swiftly become a prominent name in the digital asset space, recently announced a monumental addition to its balance sheet. The company acquired an additional 2,205 BTC for 34.487 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $237.8 million. This substantial purchase brings the firm’s total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 15,555 BTC. This aggressive accumulation strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy, the leading corporate Bitcoin holder, signaling a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Metaplanet’s pivot towards Bitcoin is driven by several key factors: Inflation Hedge: In an era of global economic uncertainty and currency devaluation, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply, making it an attractive hedge against inflation. Long-Term Store of Value: Recognized as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s robust network and increasing adoption solidify its position as a reliable store of value over the long term. Strategic Diversification: By integrating Bitcoin into its treasury, Metaplanet diversifies its assets away from traditional financial instruments, potentially enhancing its financial resilience. To illustrate the rapid growth of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin portfolio, consider the following hypothetical progression: Date of Announcement BTC Acquired (Approx.) Total BTC Holdings (Approx.) Value (USD Approx.) May 2024 (Initial) 1,000 1,000 $60M June 2024 1,177 2,177 $70M July 2024 233 2,410 $15.8M August 2024 2,205 15,555 $237.8M Note: The table above uses hypothetical prior acquisition figures to demonstrate growth leading up to the most recent announcement, as only the latest total is specified in the original content. Why is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Gaining Momentum Globally? Metaplanet’s aggressive stance is not an isolated incident but rather a significant component of a broader global trend: the accelerating rate of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . Companies across various sectors are re-evaluating their traditional treasury strategies, increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable, even superior, alternative to holding vast amounts of cash or low-yield bonds. Benefits Driving Adoption: Protection Against Fiat Debasement: As central banks continue quantitative easing, the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes. Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a compelling alternative. Enhanced Shareholder Value: Companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated that a strategic allocation to Bitcoin can significantly enhance shareholder value over time, attracting a new class of investors. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s willingness to innovate and adapt to the evolving digital economy, appealing to tech-savvy talent and customers. Access to Global Liquidity: Bitcoin’s 24/7 global market provides unparalleled liquidity, allowing for large transactions with relative ease. Challenges and Considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, which introduces risk for corporate balance sheets. However, long-term holders often view these fluctuations as temporary. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing compliance challenges for corporations. Accounting Treatment: Accounting standards for digital assets can be complex, requiring careful consideration and specialized expertise. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Beyond Metaplanet, other notable companies that have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury include Tesla, Block (formerly Square), Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Platforms, among others. These pioneers are setting a precedent, demonstrating that Bitcoin is maturing into a legitimate corporate asset. Is Japan Becoming a Hub for Japan Bitcoin Investments? Japan has a unique relationship with cryptocurrencies. As one of the earliest adopters and regulators of digital assets, it has experienced both the highs and lows of the crypto market, including the infamous Mt. Gox incident. However, recent developments suggest a renewed and more positive stance, positioning Japan as a potential leader in Japan Bitcoin Investments and broader Web3 innovation. The Japanese government and financial regulators have shown increasing openness towards fostering a robust Web3 ecosystem. This includes clearer guidelines for stablecoins, efforts to integrate NFTs, and a general push to make Japan a more attractive environment for crypto businesses. Metaplanet’s substantial Bitcoin acquisition is a direct reflection of this evolving sentiment within the country’s corporate sector. Several factors make Japan an interesting case for Bitcoin adoption: Forward-Thinking Regulation: Despite past challenges, Japan has established some of the world’s most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for crypto exchanges and assets, providing a level of clarity that can encourage institutional participation. Economic Context: Japan’s long history of low interest rates and recent depreciation of the Yen might make alternative assets like Bitcoin more appealing for corporate treasuries seeking better returns or inflation protection. Technological Prowess: Japan’s deep-rooted technological infrastructure and innovative spirit create fertile ground for the adoption of new digital financial paradigms. Metaplanet’s commitment could serve as a powerful catalyst, encouraging other Japanese corporations to explore similar strategies, potentially transforming the nation into a significant hub for corporate Bitcoin holdings in Asia. The Broader Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Holdings The continuous accumulation of Bitcoin by entities like Metaplanet has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market, particularly concerning Institutional Bitcoin adoption. When a publicly traded company makes such a significant investment, it sends a powerful signal to the broader financial world. Key Impacts: Legitimization: Large-scale corporate investments lend credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative asset. This can encourage more conservative institutions to consider exposure. Supply Shock Potential: As more Bitcoin is acquired by long-term holders and corporate treasuries, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially contributing to upward price pressure in the long run, assuming demand remains strong or increases. Increased Market Maturity: The entry of institutional players brings greater professionalism, sophisticated financial products (like ETFs), and more robust infrastructure to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Reduced Volatility (Long-Term): While large purchases can cause short-term price movements, a growing base of long-term institutional holders can contribute to overall market stability as less Bitcoin is actively traded. The ‘Bitcoinization’ of corporate balance sheets is a trend that is only just beginning. As more companies witness the success and strategic advantages gained by pioneers like Metaplanet, the domino effect could lead to an unprecedented wave of institutional capital flowing into the digital asset space, fundamentally reshaping global finance. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Metaplanet’s latest move offers valuable insights for various stakeholders: For Investors: Pay close attention to corporate treasury strategies. Companies adopting Bitcoin may offer a unique investment thesis, combining traditional business models with exposure to a rapidly appreciating asset class. Researching firms with significant Bitcoin holdings could uncover new opportunities. For Businesses: Evaluate your own treasury management. Is holding vast amounts of cash truly the most efficient strategy in today’s economic climate? Explore the potential benefits and risks of adding Bitcoin or other digital assets to your balance sheet, consulting with financial and legal experts. For Policymakers and Regulators: The increasing corporate adoption highlights the urgent need for clear, consistent, and forward-looking regulatory frameworks that can foster innovation while protecting investors. Japan’s proactive approach could serve as a model. Metaplanet’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to a strategic vision that sees Bitcoin not as a speculative asset, but as a robust, long-term store of value and a cornerstone of modern corporate finance. This bold move by a prominent Japanese company signals a growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. As the world grapples with economic shifts and technological advancements, companies like Metaplanet are charting a new course, demonstrating the profound potential of Bitcoin to redefine wealth preservation and growth strategies in the 21st century. The ripple effects of such decisions are poised to shape the future of global investment, making this an exciting time for anyone observing the evolution of finance.

2025-07-07T10:18:07,"Three crypto tokens set for 25x growth based on new 2025 market forecasts","Crypto’s backdraft after Bitcoin’s surge often sets the stage for the real fireworks: altcoins launching and leading the next wave. With fresh market momentum and several narrative-driven catalysts gaining steam, this cycle could be framed by a handful of tokens poised for exponential growth. Three names in particular are igniting speculators and strategists alike. Each represents a unique approach to utility, community, or blockchain infrastructure—but all share one thing in common: strong conditions have aligned to support the possibility of 25x returns before the end of 2025. Crypto’s next chapter is beginning to write itself, and it isn’t following the old playbook. As Bitcoin and Ethereum attract institutional capital and major headlines, a few smaller tokens are emerging with real momentum and eye-popping upside potential. Amid a fresh wave of analysts’ optimism, three projects stand out as early-stage plays offering the kind of explosive returns that define life-changing investments. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Who would’ve guessed that a meme coin could eclipse its predecessors not just in popularity but in technological depth? Little Pepe , known by its ticker LILPEPE, has been quietly rewriting playbooks. Unlike typical memecoins, it’s built as a Layer‑2 EVM chain tailored specifically for meme-token innovation. The presale progress illustrates the fervor: the first three stages sold out in rapid succession, triggering Stage Four at $0.0013 per token. There are several reasons why Little Pepe could deliver 25x or more. First, it combines ultra-low fees and fast finality with a launchpad designed for new meme tokens, completing a novel ecosystem rooted in utility. Anti-bot mechanisms guard fairness at launch, while zero tax reduces friction for traders. More importantly, it isn’t just about memes—it’s about infrastructure. Little Pepe is building a meme-first blockchain, not a meme-only token. This positions it as a rare sliver of both culture and engineering, with ambitions for centralized exchange listings on the horizon and community-driven marketing initiatives, including a $777,000 giveaway. This narrative gives credence to longer-term forecasts. With community hype fueling presale momentum and technical substance underscoring foundation, a 25x growth from today’s price doesn’t feel like a stretch—it feels realistic. Sui (SUI) Sui is building a reputation as one of the most advanced Layer 1 blockchains available. Following the growth in transaction volume and developer activity, SUI has delivered a notable increase, approximately 16% in just the last week. That wasn’t luck; it was progress. SUI’s architecture is based on parallel execution and an object-centric data model, enabling finality in under two seconds and gas fees close to negligible. Developers launching gaming, DeFi, and social apps are increasingly attracted to this environment. Additionally, the network is exploring sponsored transactions and zero-knowledge login solutions to make Web3 accessible to mainstream users. If adoption escalates faster than projections anticipated—especially in gaming and DeFi—25x returns would place SUI among the top-earning coins of the year. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo currently hovers around $0.77, up 17% over seven days. That’s not just swing-trader noise; it reflects the burgeoning adoption of P2P interaction without intermediaries. A 25x growth would bring ONDO into the $15–20 range. That may sound steep, but considering the improved permissionless protocol and fixed yield loans, ONDO could trade well above its current valuation. Why 25x is not just fantasy Little Pepe’s ecosystem is built around community frenzy backed by blockchain technology. Sui is gathering developer and institutional attention faster than people expected. Ondo is at the epicenter of on-chain DeFi. These tokens are not just vapors; they’re founded on solid utility, partnership, and tangible progress. Investors willing to accept low risk can diversify and act now, as the potential for portfolio gains in 2025 is enormous. A final word on bullish momentum It’s easy to dismiss meme coins or niche utility tokens as speculative noise. But history says otherwise: 25–50x moves require more than hype; they need culture, infrastructure, community, and the crypto trio of LILPEPE, SUI, and ONDO embody these requirements. With Bitcoin drawing the spotlight and Ethereum evolving, the next phase of this cycle rewards tokens that blend relevance with utility, and fast. Timing isn’t everything, but in crypto, timing plus vision equals opportunity. If 25x moves are your target, these three name-grouped tokens may be the frontline contenders. Buckle in—this ride looks unlike anything yet seen.

2025-07-07T10:17:24,"Top Reasons Why Solana (SOL) Price is Poised to Surge This July","The post Top Reasons Why Solana (SOL) Price is Poised to Surge This July appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Solana (SOL) price is approaching a critical technical juncture as price action tightens within a narrowing range, signalling an impending breakout. With momentum building beneath the surface and volatility coiling, traders are closely watching for a decisive move that could shape the asset’s short-term trajectory. As price continues to hover near key structural levels, the current setup presents a compelling opportunity for both bulls and bears. Now the question arises whether the bears will regain the dominance, regardless of a huge bullish setup in the wider perspective! Why Solana (SOL) Price is Poised to Rise Earlier this week, the REX-Osprey Solana ETF went live, which also offered staking. This presented strong exposure to the token as it witnessed over $67 million in trading within two days of its launch. This implies easy institutional access, adding a new source of demand and reducing volatility with capital getting locked in staking. Apart from this progress, here are the other factors that may lift up the SOL price rally. Massive On-Chain Growth The XRP total value locked (TVL) has jumped from around $2 billion in early 2024 to over $8.6 billion. Besides, Solana leads in daily active addresses, which is around 3.3 million and transaction throughput, surpassing Ethereum on some metrics. Moreover, the SOL-based dApps like Jupiter, MarginFi, Kamino, and Drift could also drive record usage in the DeFi & DePIN sectors. Developer Activity & Innovation Solana remains one of the most developer-active blockchains, second only to Ethereum in GitHub commits. Besides, the innovations like Blazingly fast L1 throughput, Sealevel parallel execution, and local fee markets enhance performance. This creates a long-term moat against competitors like Avalanche and Near Protocol. Solana Use Cases Solana staking has been at the edge, with over 65% of SOL being staked, which reduces the liquid supply and adds yield appeal for long-term holders. With more than 7% staking APY, investors have incentives to lock tokens, which lowers selling pressure and enhances scarcity. On the other hand, Solana Mobile (Saga), Solana Pay (Visa Integration), and in-store crypto payments position it as the Web3 infrastructure chain. Strong Correlation to Bitcoin & Favourable Regulatory Climate Bitcoin’s post-halving cycles have resulted in major price jumps among the other altcoins, including Solana. Usually, the high-performance Layer-1 tokens like SOL undergo massive upswings, outperforming past rallies, if the BTC price enters the discovery phase. On the other hand, the token is gaining traction in regulated financial products, and the absence of active enforcement actions and increasing ETF/derivatives availability could improve investor confidence. Will Solana (SOL) Price Reach $200 in July? Solana price seems to be closely following the other altcoins like XRP and BNB, which set up a bullish case and further rise without making any noise. The bulls are currently facing a tough time in surpassing the local resistance zone between $152.51 and $154.43. They have been failing to breach above the zone since the start of the month, and hence, a successful attempt may turn the tables for the SOL price rally. As seen in the above chart, the Solana price has been trading within an ascending triangle and is very far from the apex. After rebounding from the local lows, the pullback aftermath of breaking the neckline of the head & shoulder pattern, the price is facing tough resistance. While the CMF has risen above 0, signalling a strong inflow of money into the platform. On the other hand, the DMI levels have been juggling along the average range since the start of the month. This suggests there is some scope for uncertainty over the SOL price in the short term. The long-term price action still remains bullish, with multiple events lined up, along with the market conditions changing in the coming days. Bitcoin price is believed to rise and mark new highs in the coming days; with this, the top 10 altcoins, including Solana, are expected to kick-start a new upswing.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-solana-sol-price-is-poised-to-surge-this-july/,"SOL|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|NEAR","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

In a recent tweet, Pippen revealed a personal list of cryptocurrencies he’s keeping an eye on. And it’s not just Bitcoin. His list includes a mix of established assets and meme coins, like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). As crypto adoption continues to rise, Pippen’s growing interest shows how digital assets are gaining traction beyond the tech crowd. Bitcoin is my #1 but I'm building my watch list. What coins are you watching? I got my picks… $ETH $SOL $BNB $XRP $Ball aka @Game5Ball $ADA $DOGE $SHIB $LINK $CRO What else you got? Drop your crypto picks. — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 6, 2025 A Slam Dunk of Top Coins: What’s on Pippen’s Watchlist? Pippen still considers Bitcoin the top crypto, but his watchlist is wide-ranging. He named several well-known coins including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple’s XRP, Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Cronos (CRO), and a lesser-known token called BALL. He also added fan favorites Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). His picks show a mix of utility-based projects and community-driven tokens. It’s a list that reflects the kind of diversity most retail investors are aiming for today. That Time Satoshi Visited Pippen… In a Dream Pippen has mentioned crypto before. A few years back, he tweeted that Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, visited him in dreams to deliver BTC price predictions. Those predictions didn’t come true, but the tweets earned him attention in the crypto space. While that story was more playful than serious, his latest tweet shows real curiosity toward the crypto market, especially altcoins like XRP, which is used in cross-border payments, and popular tokens like DOGE and SHIB that thrive on community hype. The Gold Asteroid Debate Pippen’s tweet comes at a time when Bitcoin’s scarcity is being talked about again. That’s thanks to fresh reports about Psyche 16, an asteroid that could hold gold worth around $70 quintillion. Bitcoin advocates like JAN3 CEO Samson Mow and trader Willy Woo used the moment to remind people that Bitcoin’s supply is fixed at 21 million coins, no matter what. Mow tweeted: There is zero #Bitcoin on Psyche 16. https://t.co/VSiqDPX6ta — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 6, 2025 Blockstream CEO Adam Back echoed this point, explaining that Bitcoin is different. Its supply can’t be inflated, and new coins are only mined through computation. Pippen’s Tweet Lights Up Crypto Twitter Pippen’s post quickly caught the attention of the crypto community. Many praised his list, with one user calling it a “ banger list. ” Altcoin fans, especially those holding ADA, ETH, and XRP, were thrilled to see their tokens on his radar. Others jumped in with suggestions. Some encouraged Pippen to look into newer tokens like Curve (CRV), and others backed his inclusion of Solana (SOL) for its growing role in the DeFi and NFT space. Is Pippen Becoming a Crypto Voice? Pippen’s support for Bitcoin isn’t surprising, but his interest in altcoins shows he’s paying attention to the broader market. By naming XRP, ETH, SHIB, and DOGE, he’s signaling that he sees potential in more than just the original cryptocurrency. Whether other athletes will follow his lead remains to be seen.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/nba-legend-scottie-pippen-reveals-top-11-crypto-picks-xrp-btc-shib-and-more/,"BTC|SHIB|XRP|DOGE|ETH","News",cryptocompare

XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term?

In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely, XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. Source: TradingView On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . Meanwhile, another positive development in July first week reveals that Ripple has applied for a U.S. banking license, enhancing credibility. The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The last 15-day momentum is backed by growing investors’ interest, and positive developments fuel a rise in exchange outflow. Also, the technical tools on the XRP price chart show money inflows rising with CMF at 0.09, RSI above median at 56, MACD and histogram went bullish, indicating a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025.

2025-07-07T10:07:04,"Pop Mart’s first investor admits he has a ‘fondness for Bitcoin’","Mai Gang, the first investor of global Chinese toy giant Pop Mart talks about how he holds a ‘special fondness for Bitcoin’ despite the ban on cryptocurrency in his home country. In an interview with Xiao Yuzhu FM, the angel investor of Chinese toy firm Pop Mart famous for its “blind box” marketing strategy talked about his tendency to choose projects that others might deem uncommon or even unusual at the time. The same can be said about Bitcoin ( BTC ). Even before he graduated university, Gang was already putting some of his pocket money into BTC back when the cryptocurrency was still in its early stages. At the time, BTC had not grown as mainstream as it has now. “Bitcoin is a very important experience in my career. Once, during a forum for alumni of Renmin University, the host asked me why I have a special fondness for Bitcoin, while various big names like chief economists have not grasped or seen it?” said Gang in a translated interview. When he was still studying finance, banking and economic principles in university, he learned about the blockchain and Bitcoin in particular. He considered the concept to be “extremely simple” to grasp, yet not a lot of investors seemed to be aware of its potential. “Understanding [Bitcoin] does not require you to have a PhD. I think the pursuit, questioning, and persistence in essential issues are very rare and important,” said Gang. You might also like: Elon Musk’s new ‘America Party’ will embrace Bitcoin, claiming fiat to be ‘hopeless’ Despite naysayers and non-believers, Gang Mai kept believing in his choice to invest in Pop Mart before it grew into a company with a $42.80 billion market cap. It is currently the 517th most valuable company globally by market cap, according to data from CompaniesMarketCap.com. “Regardless of whether others applaud or believe you, you believe in yourself and have remained steadfast,” said Gang in a translated interview about his role in Pop Mart’s success. “You all think I’m different, but I’m not saying I have to be different from everyone else. Whether I’m different from you or not, it doesn’t matter. What’s important is what I believe in,” he continued. Back in 2014, Gang Mai predicted that Bitcoin would become a vital tool in the “great power game.” When asked to describe the cryptocurrency in just two sentences, he said that he considered Bitcoin to be the “perfect currency” that mathematicians, geeks, and network scientists have simulated using distributed algorithms. In addition, he views it as an asset that can be maintained through harnessing computing power coming from extremely powerful hardware.

Key Takeaways: Crypto funds saw a 12th week of inflows, pushing assets under management to a record $188 billion. Bitcoin ETFs have drawn $14.5 billion in net inflows this year, with trading volume topping $1 trillion since launch. Ethereum inflows are accelerating faster than Bitcoin’s, signaling rising investor interest in ETH. Buoyed by rising prices, assets under management surged to a record $188 billion, while trading volumes held steady at $16.3 billion, matching the year’s average, according to a Monday report from CoinShares . The United States dominated regional activity with $1 billion in new inflows, dwarfing Germany’s $38.5 million and Switzerland’s $33.7 million. Funds Canada and Brazil See Outflows Canada and Brazil bucked the trend, recording outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively, reflecting weaker investor sentiment. Bitcoin products pulled in $790 million, a slower pace compared to recent weeks’ $1.5 billion average, suggesting investors may be treading carefully as BTC nears its all-time highs. As reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in net inflows across Wednesday and Thursday after a brief setback on Tuesday that saw $342.2 million in outflows. Year-to-date, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have now attracted $14.5 billion in net inflows and control nearly $128 billion in assets under management, led by IBIT’s $73.6 billion.

Ethereum continued its impressive run, notching an 11th straight week of inflows with $226 million added. Over this period, Ethereum’s average weekly inflows have represented 1.6% of its assets under management, double the pace of Bitcoin’s 0.8%, signaling a growing tilt toward ETH among digital asset investors. Analysts See 95% Odds of Solana, XRP, Litecoin ETF Approvals Last week, Balchunas and Seyffart assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. While the final deadlines for individual altcoin ETFs arrive in October, the analysts predict 90% approval odds for other tokens like Dogecoin and Cardano by year-end, but note Sui and Tron ETFs face more regulatory uncertainty with only 60% and 50% odds, respectively. In April, Balchunas revealed that more than 70 cryptocurrency ETFs are currently awaiting review by the SEC. The lineup features a broad range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin, including XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and various crypto derivatives.

On July 7, The Blockchain Group, Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury Company listed on Euronext Growth Paris, has confirmed the completion of three strategic capital raises totaling approximately €11 million, enabling the acquisition of 116 Bitcoin ( BTC ). On July 1, the company announced and has now finalized an “ATM-type” equity issuance to institutional investor TOBAM. This raise brought in ~€1 million at a price of approximately €5.251 per share, which was immediately deployed to purchase 11 BTC. In parallel, The Blockchain Group’s Luxembourg subsidiary executed two €5 million convertible bond issuances. The first was subscribed by TOBAM at a conversion price of €5.174 per share, funding the purchase of 52 BTC for roughly €4.8 million. The second was subscribed by Blockstream CEO Adam Back , allowing the acquisition of 53 BTC for about €4.9 million. These three rounds cumulatively brought in ~€11 million and enabled the firm to purchase 116 BTC at an average acquisition price around €94,827 per BTC. As a result, The Blockchain Group and its Luxembourg unit now hold a total of 1,904 BTC, acquired for a cumulative €172 million, with an average entry price of approximately €90,332 per BTC.

2025-07-07T10:00:59,"Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical","Ethereum is trading above the $2,500 level, showing notable strength despite recent volatility across the broader crypto market. Since early May, ETH has been trapped in a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, struggling to establish a clear trend as both bulls and bears wait for confirmation. However, recent price action suggests growing momentum, with bulls maintaining control above key support zones. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis pointing to a decisive moment ahead for Ethereum. According to Runefelt, a breakout above the $2,700 resistance level is essential to ignite an impulsive move toward higher levels. Without that breakout, ETH risks remaining range-bound or revisiting lower demand zones. The current market structure, combined with positive sentiment surrounding altcoins and growing institutional interest in Ethereum, contributes to the optimism. Still, the coming days will be critical. A sustained move above $2,700 could open the door for a rally toward $3,000 and beyond, while failure to break out may delay Ethereum’s next major leg up. As Bitcoin trades just below its all-time highs, Ethereum’s next move could also determine the short-term trajectory for the altcoin market at large. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Recovery Altcoins have been stuck in a prolonged bear market since 2022, with many tokens still trading well below their all-time highs. Amid this challenging backdrop, Ethereum has emerged as the leader of a potential recovery. Since its April lows, ETH has more than doubled in price, surging over 100% and reclaiming key support levels above $2,500. This sharp rebound suggests that a new bullish phase for Ethereum—and potentially the broader altcoin market—could be in the early stages. However, the optimism is tempered by growing macroeconomic risks. Recent U.S. data has raised concerns about systemic fragility, with rising Treasury yields and persistent inflation fueling uncertainty across risk assets. Investors remain cautious as higher yields could limit liquidity flows into crypto, particularly into speculative altcoins. According to Carl Runefelt, Ethereum’s price structure is approaching a critical point. He highlights that ETH is currently trading within a rising wedge pattern—a bearish formation that often precedes a sharp pullback. Runefelt warns that if Ethereum fails to break decisively above the $2,700 resistance level soon, the price may reject and fall toward lower support, potentially leading to a drastic correction. For now, Ethereum remains range-bound between $2,400 and $2,700. A confirmed breakout above the upper boundary could fuel continued bullish momentum and trigger a broader altcoin rally. But failure to hold current levels, especially with bearish macro pressure building, could signal that the recent gains were a temporary relief rally. Ethereum’s next move will likely define the near-term direction for the entire altcoin sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Wyckoff Accumulation Hints At Explosive Q3 – $4K Level In Sight ETH Faces Key Resistance Amid Rising Momentum Ethereum is showing strength as it trades at $2,574.70, gaining over 2.2% in the last session. As shown in the 3-day chart, ETH has remained range-bound since early May, fluctuating between the $2,400 support and the $2,700 resistance. The latest move above the 50-day and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), currently at $2,226 and $2,644, respectively, signals growing bullish momentum. However, Ethereum still faces a significant challenge near the 200-day SMA, currently sitting at $2,791, right below the critical $2,800 liquidity level. The price has tested this resistance zone multiple times without success, suggesting that a strong breakout above $2,700–$2,800 is needed to initiate an impulsive move higher. Volume remains stable, and ETH’s ability to hold recent gains hints at continued accumulation, but a lack of decisive follow-through could signal buyer exhaustion. Related Reading: No Room For Bears: Bitcoin Bullish MACD, Monthly Close Fuel Bullish Outlook If bulls manage to reclaim $2,800, it would open the door toward $3,000 and confirm a breakout from the multi-month range. On the downside, a failure to hold $2,500 could trigger a drop back toward $2,400 or even $2,200 if broader market conditions deteriorate. For now, ETH remains in a pivotal zone, and its next major move will likely determine broader altcoin momentum.

2025-07-07T09:55:42,"Best Cryptocurrencies to Load Up On This July Before They Moon","The countdown to the next market breakout has already begun, and July is shaping up to be a defining moment for crypto investors. While Bitcoin (BTC) holds steady at the top, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking the spotlight as a breakout new token that’s being hailed as the best crypto to buy in 2025. The project is priced at $0.03 at its fifth stage of presale, over 60% now sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed 100% ROI gain at listing. The project has already raised over $11.8 million and brought over 12800 investors so far. Mutuum Finance is quickly rising as a no-brainer for anyone searching for the best crypto coin to buy before the next wave hits. Bitcoin Holds Near $110K Amid ETF-Fueled Optimism Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $109,922, trading close to its all-time highs with strong backing from institutional inflows, ETF investing into BTC has reached nearly $50 billion, lifting investor confidence. Despite some caution, technical analysts warn of bearish divergences near the $110K resistance zone, the broader narrative remains bullish. Long-term holders have realized over $2.4 billion in profits recently, yet on-chain metrics suggest this may signal healthy market rotation rather than capitulation. With the potential to clear $110K and test the $112K–$114K range ahead, Bitcoin looks poised for another leg up this July. Still, some investors balancing large-cap exposure are also placing small bets on newcomers like Mutuum Finance, currently in its presale phase. Mutuum Finance Crosses $11,800,000 in Presale With its revolutionary two-way lending framework, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted over 12,800 investors and collected $11.8 million. MUTM is priced at $0.03, but will continue higher in the upcoming stages and launch at $0.06. This guarantees a 2x return to every phase 5 investor. Mutuum Finance Smarter Lending Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, delivering customers huge returns and complete control over transactions, respectively. These lending protocols deliver end-to-end hassle-free DeFi experience most appropriate to user requirements and safer, more transparent, and more configurable than the conventional centralized lending products. CertiK-Audited and Set to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A smart contract audit by CertiK has confirmed that the codebase meets high levels of transparency and safety, giving investors and users peace of mind. To further complement its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently working on creating an Ethereum-based, fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD. As opposed to the algorithmic models, which can depeg, the currently developed stablecoin will be designed to bring long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance’s $100K Giveaway and $50K Bug Bounty Program The project is already audited by CertiK and paving the way for massive adoption, and the investors who buy in today will reap big at launch. To top it all off, the platform is organizing a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky participants will get $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. In order to further emphasize its commitment to safeguarding its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, offering $50,000 USDT in rewards. The program has a four-level level of severity, which is critical, major, minor, and low and no level of vulnerability is excluded but is rather well-rewarded. As July kicks off, Bitcoin may be grabbing headlines near its $110K mark, but the real momentum is building beneath the surface. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the best altcoins to load up on before the next bull leg takes off. Already in Phase 5, over $11.8 million has been raised and 12,800+ investors have joined the presale, which is now more than 60% sold out. Priced at just $0.03, buyers at this stage are guaranteed a 100% ROI at listing, with even more upside projected once Phase 6 raises the price to $0.035.

The move marks one of the largest tokenization efforts by a Latin American institution on XRPL, according to a press release. The tokenization of real-world assets is projected to surge from approximately $0.6 trillion in 2025 to nearly $19 trillion by 2033, according to a 2025 report by Ripple and Boston Consulting Group. Mercado Bitcoin is already a significant player in the private credit asset tokenization space, having tokenized over brazilian real $1 billion (approximately $185 million). The company also connects its ecosystem to a network widely adopted by over 70 central banks, regulators, and major financial institutions globally, the press release stated. Ripple, a key contributor to the XRPL, is supporting Mercado Bitcoin's integration. The two companies have previously collaborated, with Mercado Bitcoin using Ripple Payments for cross-border treasury flows between Brazil and Portugal, and listing RLUSD, an enterprise-grade, USD-denominated stablecoin, on its exchange. ""Mercado Bitcoin’s integration with the XRPL shows how public blockchain infrastructure is being trusted by institutions and is becoming a reliable foundation for bringing regulated financial products to the market,” said Silvio Pegado, managing director, LATAM at Ripple in a statement. “With the kind of infrastructure the XRPL offers, it’s now possible to bring these assets on-chain in a way that meets institutional expectations for cost, speed, and compliance.""

Indicators are now pointing to an imminent price surge. How soon could this take place? US spending about to push assets higher As Bitcoin jockeys for position, ready for a potential incoming surge, the passing of President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on Thursday, with the promise of $5 trillion in new spending, is likely to provide plenty of fuel for Bitcoin’s next upward trajectory. The amount of new money that can hit the US economy could be akin to that of the vast wall of money that was printed by the US administration during the Covid pandemic. Rightly or wrongly, given the gargantuan pile of debt that the US already has outstanding, the incoming tsunami of money from the US, plus increasing levels of global liquidity, should push all assets very much higher. $BTC back above the bull flag - but not spiking yet Source: TradingView As seen on the 4-hour time frame, the $BTC price is back above the upper trendline of the bull flag. Granted that it’s still not surging, and that the Stochastic RSI is rolling back over, a big pump to the upside may not happen for a little while yet. The price is following an ascending trendline (faint dotted line) but it would not be a surprise if $BTC fell through this and continued to roll along the upper bull flag trendline for a period, although the setup is looking very bullish and a spike higher could come at any time. A retest of the bull flag breakout? Source: TradingView The daily time frame reveals how the price has moved back out of the flag and could be about to test the top of the bull flag upper trendline. Bulls will be hoping that this is a successful test and not another fakeout. To make the test, the price would need to come down to around $108,500. This could also allow the price to remain above the ascending trendline. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI has the indicator line pointing downward, but this may be to allow another retest of the yellow moving average line. Staying above this line, and getting above the 70.00 level will be key. Bullish weekly close provides platform for imminent surge Source: TradingView The weekly time frame view shows that a candle body has opened above the upper trendline of the bull flag. While this is very bullish, just as bullish is the cross back up of the indicators on the Stochastic RSI. This comes at the same time as a cross up on the 2-week time frame. With price action looking very positive, and indicators also closing the last week with bullish signals, it would seem as though it’s just a matter of time before the next Bitcoin price surge.

At this point, officials advised the public to remain vigilant and informed about investment opportunities. Authorities finally reminded that the “Regulation on Preventing and Dealing with Illegal Fundraising” prohibits the state from collecting any kind of illegal funds. And he said people should report any schemes or incidents involving cryptocurrency to authorities if they hear about them. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T09:44:18,"Bitcoin Whales Scoop Up BTC as Price Nears Record High in Sign of Growth Expectations","Bitcoin (BTC) whales, investors who already hold in excess of 10,000 BTC, are buying up more of the largest cryptocurrency in a sign of confidence in further upside even as the price sits just a few percent below its all-time high around $112,000. The whales have shifted into aggressive accumulation mode over the past few days, as have wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. Smaller holders, however, appear to be reducing their exposure, according to Glassnode's Trend Accumulation Score. Whales are often considered to be the ""smart money"" because they have so much at stake. The smaller investors range from sub-1 BTC wallets to those holding between 10 and 100 BTC and have mostly been selling or distributing their holdings over the past couple of months. The contrast, which comes as the bitcoin price sits around $109,000 potentially signals a transfer of coins from retail to institutional or high-net-worth investors. The accumulation trend score confirms strong buying interest started building shortly after bitcoin hit a local low near $76,000 in mid-April. That's further evidence the whales' accumulation near record price levels could be a bullish signal and they may be positioning for future growth.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/07/bitcoin-whales-scoop-up-btc-as-price-nears-record-high-in-sign-of-growth-expectations,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","Markets|Whale|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T09:39:10,"XLM Price Prediction Experts Now Watching Bitcoin Solaris: LBank Listing and Price Rollback Create Perfect Entry","There’s something poetic about watching a coin rise just as another stagnates. While XLM price forecasts continue to trickle in with cautious optimism, Bitcoin Solaris has stormed into the spotlight with an announcement that’s shaking the charts. Between a confirmed LBank exchange listing and a 72-hour rollback event that slices its price nearly in half, BTC-S isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a contender rewriting the rules of wealth creation in crypto, and it’s doing it with precision, speed, and style. Stellar Moves, But Not So Stellar Momentum To be fair, XLM still has its place in the ecosystem. Analysts project it may climb steadily, reaching $0.47 in 2025 and $1.61 by 2030. That’s not bad. It’s the kind of long-term pace that investors appreciate for stability, not fireworks. Stellar Lumens excels at cross-border payments and remains relevant in fintech discussions. But while it treads carefully toward the future, Bitcoin Solaris is already lighting the launchpad. The momentum shift is clear. XLM is following a roadmap. BTC-S is building its own highway. Bitcoin Solaris: High-Speed, Hands-Free, and Headed to LBank Bitcoin Solaris is what happens when crypto dreams finally meet practical tech. The project blends the security of Proof of Work with the scalability of Delegated Proof of Stake in a dual-layer structure that has already hit 10,000 transactions per second in testnet, with finality in just 2 seconds. And that’s just the beginning: It’s fully smart contract capable, ready for DeFi, enterprise, and beyond. The Solaris Nova App, through its exciting release, will allow users to mine directly from their smartphones. A validator rotation system improves decentralization and energy use without compromising on speed. Real-world use cases are already mapped across healthcare, logistics, IoT, and gaming. But what’s turning heads right now is the LBank listing and the shocking Rollback Event. Just as BTC-S approached $11 in its presale, the team announced a limited rollback, dropping the price to just $5 for 72 hours. In a market flooded with hype, this bold move cuts through the noise. It rewards early believers and opens the door for thousands more. You can check the latest performance and unlock mining rewards with the Bitcoin Solaris mining calculator . Why Everyone Is Talking About It Influencers and crypto communities aren’t just noticing Bitcoin Solaris, they’re dissecting it: A detailed breakdown by Token Empire outlines why this isn’t just another layer-one. Token Galaxy explains how the mobile-first experience may onboard millions. Crypto League highlights the technical edge and transparent development process. Combine that with a double audit from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and you get one of the most well-reviewed ecosystems before launch. And the conversation is growing fast on Telegram and X , where new users are jumping in by the minute. BTC-S Slashes Its Price Back to $5 Phase 11 Just Flipped the Game Presale Madness and the $5 Reset Here’s where it gets wild. Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 11 of its presale. The regular token price is $11, with a launch price locked at $20, representing a clean 150% potential upside. But for a very limited 72-hour window, buyers can grab tokens at just $5 during the rollback event. It’s a rare moment when timing and innovation intersect this perfectly. The presale itself has already: Raised more than $6.3 million. Onboarded over 13,900 unique participants. Become one of the fastest-selling and most anticipated presales in recent memory. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. These wallets are ideal for claiming your holdings, not for purchasing during the presale. Built to Scale, Designed for Impact BTC-S isn’t just offering short-term returns. The architecture is built for sustained use and developer-friendly growth. Cross-chain bridges are being built for Ethereum and Solana interoperability. The upcoming Solaris Nova App integrates mining with team tracking and real-time performance. Smart contracts are optimized for fast execution with lower energy costs. Validator selection is automated, improving decentralization without sacrificing throughput. According to the official Bitcoin Solaris roadmap , the project will continue evolving through 2025 and beyond, including plans for quantum-resistant upgrades, an enterprise onboarding wave, and global partnerships. Final Verdict While XLM holds its ground as a slow-burn utility token, Bitcoin Solaris is a launch-ready rocket. With a real product, a growing community, dual-consensus mechanics, and a price rollback event that seems custom-built for entry, BTC-S is making it incredibly hard to ignore. We’ve seen trends before. But this one is different. It’s fast, accessible, and purpose-driven. The LBank listing will be the spark. The 72-hour rollback may be the ignition. Don’t be the person watching the countdown after liftoff.

2025-07-07T09:32:12,"Investing in MUTM: price predictions & why it’s a top crypto to buy now","The crypto market is heating up, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is grabbing attention fast. Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, this DeFi project has raised $11,800,000 and sold over 580 million tokens. With 12,800 holders already on board, investor demand is soaring. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tokens at $0.03 in this phase, a steal compared to its $0.06 launch price. As investors hunt for the best crypto to buy now, this project’s unique lending model and solid security make it a standout. Phase 5 is over 65% filled, so the window to grab tokens at this price is closing quickly. Mutuum Finance: a top crypto investment opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaking up decentralized lending on the Ethereum blockchain. Its dual-model system blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending for flexibility. The P2C setup uses smart contracts to adjust interest rates based on market shifts. This keeps things stable for users. Meanwhile, the P2P option lets lenders and borrowers negotiate directly, perfect for volatile assets. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is crafting a USD-pegged stablecoin, fully collateralized for reliability. This will boost liquidity and cut reliance on external tokens. For those eyeing a strong crypto investment, this mix of innovation and utility is hard to ignore. Moreover, its focus on user control sets it apart in the crowded crypto market. MUTM price predictions and Bitcoin’s 2013 surge Crypto prices can skyrocket, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) might follow a familiar path. Take Bitcoin in 2013 as a clue. It climbed from $13.28 in January to $1,156.00 by December, a wild 8,600% ROI in 11 months. Adoption and market buzz fueled that rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could mirror this with its fresh lending approach and growth plans. In 2026, its token might hit $5, then climb to $15 by 2028, possibly reaching $30 by 2030. That’s a potential 1,000x leap from today’s $0.03 price. The logic? Its stablecoin, Layer 2 scaling, and lending features could draw massive users, spiking demand. Crypto predictions like these hinge on utility, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has plenty. In addition, its $0.06 launch price locks in a 100% ROI for early buyers now. Security and community boost for Mutuum Finance Safety matters in crypto investments, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers. The team has finalized a Certik audit, earning a 95.00 security score. No flaws turned up in the smart contracts, and zero incidents hit in the last 90 days. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also rolled out a Bug Bounty Program with Certik, dangling $50,000 in rewards. Prizes split across critical, major, minor, and low tiers, encouraging sharp-eyed coders to test it. Beyond security, the project is igniting community excitement with a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners snag $10,000 in MUTM each, needing just a $50 presale buy-in to join. Plus, a dashboard tracks the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for sticking around. Consequently, trust and engagement are soaring, key drivers for crypto prices. Why MUTM stands out as the best crypto to buy now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a bold path in the crypto market. Its lending innovation, tight security, and community perks signal big potential. Right now, Phase 5 tokens sell at $0.03, but Phase 6 jumps to $0.035, a 16.7% hike. At launch, the $0.06 price doubles your money from today’s buy-in. Post-launch, a climb to $5 could mean a 165x return, blending short-term gains with long-term promise. The stablecoin and Layer 2 upgrades add fuel to this fire. As the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends real use with high rewards. Join the presale before Phase 5 fills up and secure your spot in this rising star.

2025-07-07T09:31:22,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Bitcoin ETF inflows plunge by 65%","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a significant slowdown in inflows over the past week, according to data from SoSoValue. The 12 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted $769.6 million, marking a steep 65% decline from the previous week’s $2.22 billion. Daily flow data showed an uneven pattern. The week opened with $102.14 million in net inflows on Monday, but quickly reversed as Tuesday posted net outflows of $342.25 million. Inflows rebounded midweek with $407.78 million on Wednesday and $601.94 million on Thursday, the strongest single-day total since May. US markets were closed Friday in observance of Independence Day. Even as inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs slowed, early stage projects like Bitcoin Pepe showed resilience as it nears the end of its presale. BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK 21Shares lead weekly gains Among individual issuers, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest weekly inflows at $336.8 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $248.4 million, while ARK 21Shares’ ARKB brought in $160 million. Additional funds, including those from Bitwise (BITB), Invesco (BTCO), Franklin Templeton (EZBC), Valkyrie (BRRR), and VanEck (HODL)—along with minor inflows into Grayscale’s new Bitcoin funds- contributed a combined $109.2 million. However, these gains were partially offset by $84.9 million in outflows from Grayscale’s legacy fund, GBTC. Profit-taking and strong jobs report dampen sentiment The sharp decline in weekly ETF inflows is attributed in part to profit-taking activity. As Bitcoin approached its all-time high near $111,960, some investors opted to lock in gains ahead of the holiday weekend. This cautious stance limited short-term momentum in crypto investment products. Macroeconomic data also influenced sentiment. The US labour market showed resilience in June, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 147,000 , exceeding expectations of 110,000. The stronger-than-expected report reduced hopes for an imminent interest rate cut in July, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios and scale back exposure to risk assets, such as Bitcoin. Trump’s Tax Bill Disappoints Crypto Advocates Market sentiment was further affected by the Senate passage of former President Donald Trump’s comprehensive tax and spending package, known as the “ One Big Beautiful Bill .” While the bill introduced broad fiscal reforms, it excluded previously proposed crypto-specific tax provisions that had been backed by pro-crypto lawmakers. These omissions, particularly regarding staking and mining, disappointed industry participants seeking regulatory clarity and tax relief. Bitcoin Pepe fuses meme culture with Bitcoin and Solana infrastructure Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a unique player in the cryptocurrency landscape by merging the viral nature of meme-driven assets with a development strategy rooted in Bitcoin infrastructure. Operating as a Layer 2 solution, the project leverages Bitcoin’s robust security while aiming to achieve scalability on par with high-performance networks like Solana. This dual approach distinguishes Bitcoin Pepe from other meme-themed cryptocurrencies. As a meme-focused Layer 2 network built atop Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe is expanding its footprint through a range of strategic partnerships. These collaborations span multiple sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralised finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure. The goal is to create an ecosystem where the BPEP token provides both cultural appeal and cross-chain utility. These initiatives are designed to boost adoption and increase the project’s visibility. Interest from institutional players and the broader cryptocurrency community is gaining traction, particularly around the development of the PEP-20 token standard. Investor enthusiasm is reflected in the project’s presale, which has raised more than $16.297 million to date. Further momentum is gained from confirmed listings on cryptocurrency exchanges MEXC and BitMart. The team is planning to make its final listing announcement on July 31.

2025-07-07T09:30:00,"Russia Launches Registry to Track and Tax Crypto Miners","The goal of the registry is to help identify illegal operators evading taxes and misusing electricity. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Energy alongside the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development, the initiative follows reports that only 30% of miners have registered with authorities since crypto mining laws were introduced in late 2024. The registry supports enforcement in regions where mining is banned and complements proposed legislation to increase penalties for illegal mining operations. In the US, crypto taxation is also a hot topic. Bill Miller IV argues that Bitcoin should not be taxed like traditional assets due to its decentralized infrastructure, which he says eliminates the need for state-backed ownership enforcement. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill to modernize crypto tax rules, proposing exemptions for small transactions, staking rewards, and donations. Russia Moves to Regulate Crypto Mining Russia is ramping up its efforts to regulate its crypto mining sector by launching a national registry of crypto mining rigs. This move is spearheaded by the Russian Ministry of Energy in coordination with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development, and its main goal is to identify and control illegal mining operations that evade taxes and exploit the power grid. According to state media RIA Novosti , the compiled registry has already been sent to regions experiencing heightened mining activity. The initiative follows concerns that were raised by Ivan Chebeskov, a Russian Finance Ministry official, who pointed out in June that only 30% of miners registered with the Federal Tax Service since the introduction of crypto mining laws in late 2024. Authorities are now working to integrate the remaining 70% of miners into the legal framework. (Source: TASS ) Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko believes that the registry is a crucial step toward legalizing the industry and applying appropriate regulation and taxation, as well as curbing illegal electricity consumption. Russia first announced plans to create the registry in February, especially to support enforcement in areas where crypto mining is banned. Since November, the country has been enforcing legislation that defines and regulates mining businesses , with a six-year ban imposed on mining activities in ten regions until March of 2031 to prevent blackouts. Additionally, the Ministry of Digital Development is drafting new legislation to increase fines for illegal mining operations tenfold—from 200,000 rubles to 2 million rubles, which is equivalent to about $25,500. Enforcement efforts have already resulted in the shutdown of several illicit mining farms, including one discovered in a garage in Bataysk and another that was concealed in a truck siphoning electricity from a remote village in the Pribaikalsky region. Bill Miller IV Says Bitcoin Shouldn’t Be Taxed While Russia is zeroing in on tax evaders, chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners Bill Miller IV believes governments have no rightful claim to tax Bitcoin. He argues that the digital asset operates independently of state infrastructure for managing property rights. On the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell, Miller said Bitcoin’s blockchain automates the enforcement of ownership, eliminating the need for the traditional administrative mechanisms that justify taxation in other asset classes like real estate. Miller explained that taxes on assets like property typically support systems that track and enforce ownership. In contrast, Bitcoin relies entirely on its decentralized ledger to record and verify transactions, meaning the government plays no role in maintaining or authenticating its ownership records. He said that since governments didn’t create Bitcoin and don’t secure its property rights, taxing it in the same manner as state-backed assets lacks justification. He also commented on the speculative idea that was floated earlier this year that capital gains taxes on certain US-based cryptocurrencies could be eliminated. This was reportedly proposed by Eric Trump. While Miller is very skeptical about whether such a policy will actually materialize, he pointed to the lack of a wash sale rule on Bitcoin as a unique and favorable aspect for investors. Bill Miller IV When asked about the possibility of Bitcoin being subjected to an annual property tax, similar to real estate, Miller said it’s uncertain but sees a strong case against it due to Bitcoin’s self-regulating nature. He also shed some light on the broader challenges asset managers face regarding Bitcoin investment by pointing to unresolved issues around taxation and how certain transactions can be classified as “bad income” under existing regulations. Miller concluded that the ongoing tax uncertainties prove just how early Bitcoin still is in its journey toward mainstream acceptance. Senator Lummis Pushes New Crypto Tax Relief Bill Meanwhile, US Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a draft bill that is aimed at modernizing the country’s tax code to better accommodate digital assets, following the failure of crypto-related amendments to make it into the recent budget package. The bill proposes several changes, including a de minimis exemption that would allow people to exclude capital gains from taxation on digital asset transactions of $300 or less, with an annual cap of $5,000. Lummis’ crypto tax bill Lummis is a very vocal supporter of the crypto industry, and also proposed tax exemptions for crypto lending agreements and digital assets donated to charity. In addition, the legislation would defer taxation on mining and staking rewards until the assets are actually sold. This will greatly simplify tax compliance for those participating in blockchain consensus mechanisms. She described the bill as a common-sense approach that is designed to eliminate outdated bureaucracy and reduce the risk of inadvertent tax violations. It could also allow Americans to fully participate in the digital economy. The standalone bill represents Lummis’ renewed effort to push forward pro-crypto legislation after the latest federal spending bill passed without addressing digital assets. With this proposal, she plans to fulfill her commitment to the crypto community and correct what many see as a growing disconnect between outdated tax policies and changing blockchain technologies. The lack of clear tax guidelines has become a major source of frustration for US crypto investors, particularly regarding the treatment of decentralized finance protocols and non-custodial platforms. These platforms do not involve traditional intermediaries or centralized control, and pose unique challenges under existing tax frameworks. Lawmakers have responded by introducing amendments to other crypto-related bills, like the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, to exempt developers of these protocols from being treated as money transmitters and subjected to extensive reporting obligations. While lawmakers work to finalize the federal spending bill, efforts are still underway to include meaningful crypto provisions before it reaches President Donald Trump’s desk. Lummis’ draft bill is now a central piece in the push to establish a fair and forward-thinking regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9824/russia-launches-registry-to-track-and-tax-crypto-miners,"REGULATION|MINING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T09:29:56,"Best crypto to buy now as Elon Musk says his party will support Bitcoin","Bitcoin climbed above $109,000 early Monday, supported by gains across major cryptocurrencies and a calming of near-term market fears following the Trump administration’s decision to delay the upcoming tariff deadline. BTC, along with Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), is showing renewed strength as the crypto market starts the week on a positive note. The rebound followed a successful retest on Friday of Bitcoin’s prior breakout level at $108,355, with the price edging higher over the weekend. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading near $109,000. If the current momentum holds, the rally could extend toward the May 22 all-time high of $111,980. Continued strength is also observed in early stage project, Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has raised over $16 million. Elon Musk’s ‘America Party’ to support Bitcoin Elon Musk confirmed on Sunday that his newly launched political platform, the America Party, will support bitcoin. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” Musk said in a post on X, responding to a user who asked whether the party would back the cryptocurrency. Elon Musk @elonmusk · Follow Replying to @RenatoLima_X Fiat is hopeless, so yes 6:41 am · 7 Jul 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The announcement follows Musk’s official unveiling of the America Party on Saturday, after a poll on X gauged public interest in breaking away from the traditional two-party system. In his post, Musk said, “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” The launch of the America Party comes amid Musk’s escalating public fallout with former ally President Donald Trump. The dispute centres on the recently signed $3.4 trillion “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping spending package Musk has condemned for ballooning the US deficit. Bitcoin Pepe continues climb Improving regulatory clarity, expanding adoption, and growing political support in the US are expected to bring greater transparency to altcoins and meme coins, potentially reshaping investor sentiment across the digital asset ecosystem. As oversight strengthens, the market appears to be shifting from pure speculation toward utility-driven narratives—opening the door for technically ambitious projects that blend cultural relevance with real-world use cases. Among them is Bitcoin Pepe, positioned as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network. The project seeks to combine Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana-like scalability, offering a more durable proposition than traditional meme tokens dependent solely on hype. Since its February launch, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has steadily attracted capital from high-risk, high-reward investors, raising over $16.2 million to date. The BPEP token is currently priced at $0.0437, with an increase expected once contributions exceed $17.07 million. BPEP is set to be listed on BitMart and MEXC, with a final listing announcement scheduled for July 31—milestones that continue to drive investor attention as the presale enters its final phase.

Систематическое актуализация данных о порядке верификации помогает игрокам миновать недоразумений и ускоряет процесс перевода денег на карту или электронный кошелек. Методы внесения средств на счета: полный список Чтобы зачисления баланса в виртуальном казино геймерам доступен широкий выбор способов. Пластиковые и дебетовые карточки остаются самыми распространенным методом благодаря своей простоте использования и оперативности платежей. Впрочем, для игроков, кто выбирает более анонимные способы, доступны электронные кошельки, такие как Skrill и Neteller. Данные платформы предоставляют возможность оперативно переводить средства без личных сведений. Кроме того, криптовалюты, включая биткоин и эфир, завоевывают признание среди пользователей благодаря своей надежности и необходимости платить банкам. Оные предоставляют мгновенные переводы и инкогнито, что притягивает пользователей для клиентов mostbet, ценящих конфиденциальность. Не нужно упускать из виду о таких традиционных методах, как банковские переводы и предварительно оплаченные карты. Несмотря на то, что эти методы могут требовать более продолжительное время для обработки, данные методы сохраняются как надежными и комфортными для игроков, которые выбирают более традиционные методы к денежным транзакциям в казино. Эксплуатация карт финансовых учреждений Кредитные карточки продолжают быть одним из самых популярных методов оплаты в интернет-казино. Ихние универсальность и достоверность делают ихнюю оптимальным вариантом для многих пользователей. Применение карт Виза и Мастеркард обеспечивает возможность не только моментально увеличивать баланс, но и снимать призовые с минимальными комиссиями. Особенное фокус следует уделить сохранности: множество игорных заведений используют SSL-криптографию для охраны данных, что гарантирует безопасность транзакций. Тем не менее, не каждые карты одинаково пригодны для азартных игр. Отдельные финансовые учреждения способны блокировать транзакции, связанные с азартных игр, из-за внутренних политик или правовых норм государства. В аналогичных ситуациях предлагается применять другие варианты, такие как онлайн-кошельки или криптовалюты. Это не только предоставляет дополнительный степень анонимности, а также помогает обходить потенциальные барьеры со стороны банковских организаций. Оплата через сотовых провайдеров Срочные транзакции: Зачисление аккаунта выполняется почти мгновенно, что обеспечивает игрокам не терять время. Практичность: Не требуется нужды вписывать протяженные цифры карточек или реквизиты банка. Безопасность: Индивидуальные информация сохраняются секретными, поскольку абсолютно все операции проходят через мобильного оператора. На этом самом следует принимать во внимание определенные ограничения. Например, предельная сумма операции может быть ниже по сравнению с альтернативными способами оплаты. Кроме того не все операторы принимают такие транзакции, в связи с этим нужно предварительно уточнить возможность использования данной услуги у своего оператора. Для осуществления расчета посредством мобильного оператора необходимо: Определить соответствующий вариант расчета в финансовом разделе интернет-казино. Введите контактный номер мобильного телефона и сумму пополнения. Подтвердить перевод с помощью шифра, какой придет в SMS. Таким путём, расчёты через сотовых операторов даёт игрокам способность оперативно и защищённо управлять своими деньгами в интернет-казино без ненужных забот. Пополнение в цифровой валюте Вклад в цифровой валюте становится все более распространенным среди пользователей интернет-казино. Криптовалюты предлагают исключительные преимущества, такие как конфиденциальность и скоростные транзакции. В сравнении с сравнении с традиционных методов оплаты, вроде банковские переводы или кредитные карты, криптовалютные депозиты осуществляются сразу, что позволяет игрокам сразу же начать игру. Для внесения баланса через крипту необходимо иметь цифровой кошелёк. Клиент обязан подобрать гэмблинг-платформу, принимающее криптовалюту, и перейти в секцию кассы. Здесь выбирается нужная монета, например, Bitcoin либо Ethereum. Впоследствии указанного система генерирует индивидуальный адрес для трансфера активов. Следует удостовериться в корректности местоположения, так как операции в блокчейне окончательны. Преимущества применения цифровых валют охватывают не только оперативность и анонимность, но и уменьшенные издержки. Во противоположность от классических денежных структур, в которых платы могут составлять нескольких процентов от суммы транзакции, при применении криптовалют они минимальны или вовсе отсутствуют. Данное делает криптодепозиты привлекательными для геймеров, намеревающихся сократить свои расходы на ставки. Минимальные вклады: сумма и требования Малые вложения занимают важную позицию в выборе онлайн казино, главным образом для новичков, которые не стремятся сразу ставить на кон значительными средствами. Самая низкая величина депозита может варьироваться от 1 до 10 у.е., в зависимости от платформы. Некоторые игровые клубы представляют эксклюзивные условия для первых геймеров, понижая порог входа до минимальных значений. Это дает возможность пользователям исследовать функции и внешний вид без значительных денежных затрат. Условия наименьшего пополнения ещё зависят от подобранного способа оплаты. Например, при применении виртуальных счетов или криптографических валют минимум суммы могут быть скромнее по сравнению с банковскими картами. Важно учитывать, что самый низкий вклад не всегда удовлетворяет требованиям активации премий: некоторые предложения нуждаются в более крупных взносов для включения. Поэтому прежде чем внесением счета следует тщательно изучить все оферты и акции казино, чтобы оптимально распоряжаться своими деньгами. Вывод выигрышей: пределы и время рассмотрения заявок В процессе снятия призов из онлайн казино игроки часто сталкиваются с ограничениями и сроками обработки заявок. Часто, игорные заведения задают суточные, семидневные или ежемесячные пределы на снятие средств. Например, различные площадки позволяют обналичивать до $5,000 в семь дней. Это действие проводится для гарантирования денежной безопасности и предотвращения фрода. Впрочем отдельные привилегированные игроки способны рассчитывать на более высокие лимиты благодаря их положению. Временные рамки обслуживания заявок обусловлены от множества условий, включая выбранный способ снятия средств. Электронные счета, вроде Skrill или Neteller, в большинстве случаев проводятся оперативнее — в течение 24 часов. Во то время, когда финансовые транзакции могут занимать вплоть до 5 рабочих суток. Важно помнить, что всякий заявка процедурируется через процедуру верификации, чтобы гарантировать аутентичность информации пользователя. Эта операция способна увеличить суммарное промежуток выжидания, тем не менее эта операция нужна для гарантирования сохранности сделок. Азартные автоматы: обновления и ретро автоматы Слот-машины слоты продолжают быть среди самых востребованных увлечений в мире интернет-казино. В прошлые периоды разработчики игровых приложений активно внедряют технологии, создавая новинки, которые поражают представление. Например, однорукие бандиты с компонентами расширенной реальности и технологией ""Megaways"" стали настоящим успехом среди пользователей. Данные игры, предоставляемые на таких сайтах, например, мостбет, обеспечивают тысячи шансов на выигрыш и интересный геймплей, который привлекает внимание на протяжении продолжительного периода. Тем не менее, ретро игровые автоматы не утрачивают своей популярности. Большинство пользователи продолжают предпочитать традиционные автоматы с тремя барабанами и символами фрукты, которые ассоциируются с ностальгией по классическим казино. Особенно популярны подобные автоматы, такие как ""Book of Ra"" и ""Sizzling Hot"", какие находятся в лидерах благодаря простоте правил и высокой вероятности успеха. Необходимо заметить, что ретро игровые автоматы обычно имеют более высоким процентом возврата игроку (RTP), что делает их привлекательными для начинающих игроков и профессионалов. Развлечения с неповторимыми вознаграждениями Игровая отрасль все еще восхищать геймеров, предоставляя эксклюзивные привилегии, которые выступают решающим фактором при подборе виртуальной площадки. Многие игорных заведений предлагают уникальные предложения, какие не только повышают шансы на выигрыш, но и делают процесс игры более увлекательным. Например, определенные сайты дают вознаграждения за создание аккаунта без депозита, что дает возможность игрокам проверить везение без финансовых вложений. Такие предложения нередко сопровождаются бесплатными вращениями или возможностью участвовать в специальным турнирам. Иные казино интегрируют прогрессивные механизмы лояльности, где игроки могут накапливать поинты за каждую ставку и менять их на настоящие средства или важные подарки. Ящики с неожиданностями также получают известность: раскрывая их, пользователи могут заполучить рандомные вознаграждения, от безвозмездных бетов до девайсов. Такой способ обеспечивает геймерский процедуру более взаимодействующим и захватывающим. Важно подчеркнуть, что перед активацией всякого бонуса следует тщательно изучить требования его применения, чтобы избежать неприятных сюрпризов в будущем. Слоты с прогрессивными джекпотами Слоты с прогрессивными джекпотами являются одним из самых популярных форматов досуга в интернет-казино, например, мостбет казино. Данные слоты отличаются по сравнению с обычных слотов в том, что доля от каждой ставки прибавляется к совокупному джекпоту, который может достигать миллионов долларов. Это превращает такие чрезвычайно притягательными для игроков, желающих о крупном выигрыше. Примером подобных игровых автоматов может служить Mega Moolah, знаменитый своими высочайшими выплатами, и mostbet тоже предоставляет массу подобных возможностей. Для игры в развлечении на игровых машинах с увеличивающимся джекпотом, участникам предлагается делать max бет. Это обстоятельство объясняется с причиной, что только максимальная бет дает возможность заявить права на выигрыш джекпота, как и в мостбет казино. Тем не менее следует осознавать про финансовой самоконтроле и задавать лимиты на свои ставки, чтобы избежать перерасхода. В некоторых игровых автоматах вы можете наблюдать актуальный величину куша на экране, что вносит ещё один аспект азарта и вовлеченности в процесс игры.

Например, в колесе фортуны есть возможность определиться с выбором между европейской и штатовской вариантами. Это позволяет игрокам подогнать ход игры в соответствии с свои пристрастия и планы. Также, живые ведущие в интернет-казино переживают жесткий отбор и подготовку для поддержания справедливости и компетентности в каждой раздаче.

Необходимо подчеркнуть, что эти развлечения часто имеют более значительный минимальный порог ставок по сравнению с классическими онлайн-играми, что делает их интересными для искушенных игроков. Плюшки и распродажи: варианты и промо-коды Премии и предложения в виртуальных казино — это отличный метод привлечь новых пользователей и сохранить увлечение постоянных игроков. Среди более распространённых акций можно выделить приветственные вознаграждения, которые могут достигать 100% с первого взноса. Данное указывает, что в момент внесении счета на тысячу рублей, игрок получает еще тысячу рублей в виде дополнения. Необходимо помнить, что эти вознаграждения как правило имеют требованиями по отыгрышу, которые предполагают ставок на определенную сумму перед снятием денег.

Чтобы воспользоваться купон-кодом, необходимо вписать этот код в особое поле при регистрации или внесении денег. Следует отметить, что купон-коды содержат лимитированный период активности и могут относиться к конкретным акциям или играм.

Это содействует предотвратить ошибок и задействовать все возможности для наращивания шансов на выигрыш. Взвешенный подход к подбору опций позволит не только получить удовольствие от игрой, но и существенно приумножить свой игровой баланс. Кешбэк для постоянных геймеров Частые геймеры в интернет-казино могут воспользоваться кэшбеком, который возвращает процент израсходованных финансов обратно на счет. Такое в частности выгодно предназначено для тех, кто регулярно играет и желает уменьшить свои расходы. Кэшбэк как правило составляет от 5% и до 20% из потерь за установленный интервал, например, неделю или тридцать дней. Следует иметь в виду, что условия получения кэшбэка могут варьироваться в отношении к конкретного казино, поэтому необходимо внимательно прочитать правила и условия программы. Активировать кешбэк доступно с помощью профиль пользователя пользователя либо автоматически при соблюдении всех требований. Часто гэмблинг-платформы, вроде мостбет казино, предоставляют эксклюзивные вознаграждения для привилегированных пользователей, в том числе расширенный кэшбэк процент или дополнительные привилегии. Данное помогает не только отыграть кусок потерь, и испытать больше кайфа от процесса. Тем не менее важно иметь в виду о правилах по прокрутке, которые могут действовать к возврату денег, прежде чем их удастся обналичить. Бонусы за регистрацию первого пользователя Начинающие участники виртуальных казино нередко сталкиваются с заманчивыми оферами в виде премий за подписку. Указанные премии предоставляют шанс новым пользователям стартовать развлечение с дополнительными средствами или бесплатными вращениями, что заметно улучшает шансы на успех. Важно учитывать, что эти предложения обычно идут с правилами по вейджеру, которые следует соблюсти перед кэшаутом. Имеется несколько видов бонусов за регистрацию: Премия на вклад: игрок приобретает фиксированный процент от начального депозита аккаунта. Бездепозитный бонус: выдается без необходимости внесения средств. Бесплатные вращения: безоплатные раскрутки на конкретных игровых автоматах. При выборе казино mostbet необходимо принять во внимание на статус ресурса и требования начисления поощрений. Надежные игорные заведения предоставляют четкие условия, а также обеспечивают поддержку игроков для решения потенциальных проблем. Нужно также помнить, что каждый приз имеет период активности, и его следует активировать в указанный период, чтобы не упустить шанс на его использование. Мобильное софт и адаптивность веб-страницы Мобильные приложения и мобильные сайты играют ключевую роль в сфере интернет-казино, обеспечивая клиентам легкий доступ к играм и сервисам. Адаптивность интерфейса дает возможность геймерам удовольствоваться любимыми слотами и настольными играми с разных гаджетов, будь то телефон или планшет. Это достигается благодаря универсальному дизайну, что самостоятельно регулируется под размер экрана. Следует заметить, что отзывчивые сайты обеспечивают более оперативное загружаемое время и адаптированы для различных веб-обозревателей, что делает их предпочтительным выбором для многих посетителей. С альтернативной стороны, портативные аппы предоставляют эксклюзивные функции, такие как push-уведомления, которые оповещают геймеров о новых бонусах и акциях. Программы зачастую имеют более плавной графикой и взаимодействием с гаджетом пользователя, что улучшает общий геймплейный опыт. Согласно данным недавних исследований, больше 70% юзеров выбирают использовать аппы для смартфонов для доступа к онлайн-казино благодаря их практичности и быстродействию.

2025-07-07T09:26:26,"UK’s Smarter Web Company Acquires $24M Worth of Bitcoin, Holdings Reach 1,000 BTC","The Smarter Web Company, a London-listed technology firm, has announced the acquisition of an additional 226.42 Bitcoin for approximately £17.87 million ($24 million). Key Takeaways: Smarter Web bought 226 more BTC, bringing total holdings to 1,000 BTC worth over £78 million. The company’s year-to-date BTC Yield has surged 26,242%, reflecting its aggressive treasury strategy. Other UK firms are also expanding Bitcoin holdings despite uncertain local crypto regulations. The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,000 BTC, solidifying its position among UK-listed firms with sizable crypto treasuries. The average purchase price for the new batch was £78,932 ($107,726) per Bitcoin, slightly above the company’s overall average purchase price of £78,228 ($106,766). Smarter Web’s Bitcoin Holdings Surpass £78 Million After Latest Purchase With the acquisition, Smarter Web’s cumulative Bitcoin investment now totals over £78 million. The company reported impressive treasury yields, noting a year-to-date BTC Yield of 26,242% and a 30-day BTC Yield of 530%, reflecting the aggressive accumulation strategy laid out in its “10 Year Plan.” As of this month, Smarter Web has around £42.3 million in net cash available for potential future Bitcoin purchases, underscoring its commitment to expanding its crypto reserves.

JUST IN: The Smarter Web Company purchased 226.42 BTC and now has a total of 1,000 BTC pic.twitter.com/p1IkEkLGL2 — NLNico (@btcNLNico) July 7, 2025 Last week, the company raised £41.2 million ($56.59 million) just days after making headlines with a $20 million purchase of nearly 197 Bitcoin. Of the total funds, £36.27 million ($49.8 million) came from the bookbuild, while an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) was raised through subscription. Smarter Web’s directors emphasized that acquisitions will continue where opportunities align with the company’s expansion goals. The company’s announcement comes as more publicly listed firms adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, signaling a growing trend of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency despite ongoing market volatility. Meanwhile, other UK firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin bets amid Britain’s unclear regulatory stance on digital assets. Vinanz, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, has acquired 37.72 BTC , bringing its total holdings to nearly 59 BTC. In April, investment firm Abraxas Capital made waves with a Bitcoin purchase exceeding $250 million.

2025-07-07T09:19:27,"Bitcoin's Potential Bull Market Resistance: $115K or $223K?","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. The consensus in the bitcoin BTC market remains bullish even though the price has held above $100,000 every day bar one for two months, with analysts' projections for resistance levels ranging from $140,000 to over $200,000. One way to identify such levels is to use trendlines, which are price chart lines connecting major highs and lows. They provide visual cues about momentum and direction, helping traders identify support and resistance levels. Connecting the 2017 bull-market high of around $20,000 and the 2021 high of nearly $70,000 and extending the line forward can help highlight the level where selling pressure might emerge. As of the time of writing, this trendline indicates resistance at approximately $115,300, according to the data source TradingView. The same trendline capped upside in December and January, paving the way for a correction that saw prices drop to a low of $75,000 in April. Log-scaled resistance at $220K That said, the above chart is a linear-scaled or arithmetic-scaled monthly chart. It shows the absolute price changes, a feature that makes it suitable for analyzing short-term trends. The potential resistance price, however, may be less reliable than that derived from the long-scaled chart, which compresses significant percentage moves, making trendlines and resistance levels more precise and more meaningful. Connecting the 2017 and 2021 highs on the log-scaled monthly chart aligns the resistance at approximately $223,000, rather than $115,000. The log-scaled trendline resistance is likely more consistent with the exponential growth pattern of bitcoin's past bull markets.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/07/bitcoin-s-potential-bull-market-resistance-usd115k-or-usd223k,"MARKET|TRADING|BTC","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Technical Analysis|News",cryptocompare

Most altcoins are in the green on a daily scale, with ETH closing down to $2,600 and XRP nearing $2.3. BTC Taps Multi-Day Peak The landscape around bitcoin has been quite stagnant since the start of the month. Recall that BTC traded at around $108,000 on July 1 but slipped in the following days to $105,000. The bulls managed to defend that level and didn’t allow a further breakdown. Just the opposite, the asset started to regain traction almost immediately and surged by several grand to a multi-week peak of roughly $110,500. While it seemed that BTC is preparing to break out of its consolidation phase and aim for a new all-time high, its progress stalled and was pushed south to a familiar ground of around $108,000. It didn’t make a move during the weekend until late Sunday evening when it finally started to pump. The culmination, at least for now, transpired earlier today when bitcoin tapped a multi-day peak of $109,600. It faced another minor rejection there and now sits just under $109,000. Its market cap has risen to $2.165 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is below 63% now. BTCUSD.

Dogecoin has taken the main stage from the biggest alts, surging by over 5% to over $0.17. AAVE has jumped the most from the mid-cap alts and now sits at $286. TON is among the few exceptions, having dropped by nearly 6% on a 24-hour scale after the UAE denied previous Toncoin claims about a golden visa partnership.
