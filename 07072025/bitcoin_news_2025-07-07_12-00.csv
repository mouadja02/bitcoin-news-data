2025-07-07T09:55:42,"Best Cryptocurrencies to Load Up On This July Before They Moon","The countdown to the next market breakout has already begun, and July is shaping up to be a defining moment for crypto investors. While Bitcoin (BTC) holds steady at the top, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking the spotlight as a breakout new token that’s being hailed as the best crypto to buy in 2025. The project is priced at $0.03 at its fifth stage of presale, over 60% now sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed 100% ROI gain at listing. The project has already raised over $11.8 million and brought over 12800 investors so far. Mutuum Finance is quickly rising as a no-brainer for anyone searching for the best crypto coin to buy before the next wave hits. Bitcoin Holds Near $110K Amid ETF-Fueled Optimism Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering around $109,922, trading close to its all-time highs with strong backing from institutional inflows, ETF investing into BTC has reached nearly $50 billion, lifting investor confidence. Despite some caution, technical analysts warn of bearish divergences near the $110K resistance zone, the broader narrative remains bullish. Long-term holders have realized over $2.4 billion in profits recently, yet on-chain metrics suggest this may signal healthy market rotation rather than capitulation. With the potential to clear $110K and test the $112K–$114K range ahead, Bitcoin looks poised for another leg up this July. Still, some investors balancing large-cap exposure are also placing small bets on newcomers like Mutuum Finance, currently in its presale phase. Mutuum Finance Crosses $11,800,000 in Presale With its revolutionary two-way lending framework, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted over 12,800 investors and collected $11.8 million. MUTM is priced at $0.03, but will continue higher in the upcoming stages and launch at $0.06. This guarantees a 2x return to every phase 5 investor. Mutuum Finance Smarter Lending Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, delivering customers huge returns and complete control over transactions, respectively. These lending protocols deliver end-to-end hassle-free DeFi experience most appropriate to user requirements and safer, more transparent, and more configurable than the conventional centralized lending products. CertiK-Audited and Set to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A smart contract audit by CertiK has confirmed that the codebase meets high levels of transparency and safety, giving investors and users peace of mind. To further complement its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently working on creating an Ethereum-based, fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the USD. As opposed to the algorithmic models, which can depeg, the currently developed stablecoin will be designed to bring long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance’s $100K Giveaway and $50K Bug Bounty Program The project is already audited by CertiK and paving the way for massive adoption, and the investors who buy in today will reap big at launch. To top it all off, the platform is organizing a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky participants will get $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. In order to further emphasize its commitment to safeguarding its platform, Mutuum Finance has introduced its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, offering $50,000 USDT in rewards. The program has a four-level level of severity, which is critical, major, minor, and low and no level of vulnerability is excluded but is rather well-rewarded. As July kicks off, Bitcoin may be grabbing headlines near its $110K mark, but the real momentum is building beneath the surface. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the best altcoins to load up on before the next bull leg takes off. Already in Phase 5, over $11.8 million has been raised and 12,800+ investors have joined the presale, which is now more than 60% sold out. Priced at just $0.03, buyers at this stage are guaranteed a 100% ROI at listing, with even more upside projected once Phase 6 raises the price to $0.035. Secure your tokens now before Phase 5 sells out.

Accordingly, the Shenzhen government of China said in an official statement that cryptocurrencies and stablecoins have recently attracted widespread interest and warned investors against possible fraud cases. The Shenzhen Office of the Special Task Force for Prevention and Control of Illegal Financial Activities issued a warning titled “Beware of the Risks of Illegal Fundraising in the Name of Stablecoins and Other Instruments.” The statement noted that recently, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies have received widespread attention from the market and that they have been misused. The statement said that some illegal organizations are illegally raising funds using concepts such as stablecoins and digital assets and are engaged in illegal fundraising, fraud, money laundering and other illegal activities. At this point, officials advised the public to remain vigilant and informed about investment opportunities. Authorities finally reminded that the “Regulation on Preventing and Dealing with Illegal Fundraising” prohibits the state from collecting any kind of illegal funds. And he said people should report any schemes or incidents involving cryptocurrency to authorities if they hear about them. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T09:39:10,"XLM Price Prediction Experts Now Watching Bitcoin Solaris: LBank Listing and Price Rollback Create Perfect Entry","There’s something poetic about watching a coin rise just as another stagnates. While XLM price forecasts continue to trickle in with cautious optimism, Bitcoin Solaris has stormed into the spotlight with an announcement that’s shaking the charts. Between a confirmed LBank exchange listing and a 72-hour rollback event that slices its price nearly in half, BTC-S isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a contender rewriting the rules of wealth creation in crypto, and it’s doing it with precision, speed, and style. Stellar Moves, But Not So Stellar Momentum To be fair, XLM still has its place in the ecosystem. Analysts project it may climb steadily, reaching $0.47 in 2025 and $1.61 by 2030. That’s not bad. It’s the kind of long-term pace that investors appreciate for stability, not fireworks. Stellar Lumens excels at cross-border payments and remains relevant in fintech discussions. But while it treads carefully toward the future, Bitcoin Solaris is already lighting the launchpad. The momentum shift is clear. XLM is following a roadmap. BTC-S is building its own highway. Bitcoin Solaris: High-Speed, Hands-Free, and Headed to LBank Bitcoin Solaris is what happens when crypto dreams finally meet practical tech. The project blends the security of Proof of Work with the scalability of Delegated Proof of Stake in a dual-layer structure that has already hit 10,000 transactions per second in testnet, with finality in just 2 seconds. And that’s just the beginning: It’s fully smart contract capable, ready for DeFi, enterprise, and beyond. The Solaris Nova App, through its exciting release, will allow users to mine directly from their smartphones. A validator rotation system improves decentralization and energy use without compromising on speed. Real-world use cases are already mapped across healthcare, logistics, IoT, and gaming. But what’s turning heads right now is the LBank listing and the shocking Rollback Event. Just as BTC-S approached $11 in its presale, the team announced a limited rollback, dropping the price to just $5 for 72 hours. In a market flooded with hype, this bold move cuts through the noise. It rewards early believers and opens the door for thousands more. You can check the latest performance and unlock mining rewards with the Bitcoin Solaris mining calculator . Why Everyone Is Talking About It Influencers and crypto communities aren’t just noticing Bitcoin Solaris, they’re dissecting it: A detailed breakdown by Token Empire outlines why this isn’t just another layer-one. Token Galaxy explains how the mobile-first experience may onboard millions. Crypto League highlights the technical edge and transparent development process. Combine that with a double audit from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and you get one of the most well-reviewed ecosystems before launch. And the conversation is growing fast on Telegram and X , where new users are jumping in by the minute. BTC-S Slashes Its Price Back to $5 Phase 11 Just Flipped the Game Presale Madness and the $5 Reset Here’s where it gets wild. Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 11 of its presale. The regular token price is $11, with a launch price locked at $20, representing a clean 150% potential upside. But for a very limited 72-hour window, buyers can grab tokens at just $5 during the rollback event. It’s a rare moment when timing and innovation intersect this perfectly. The presale itself has already: Raised more than $6.3 million. Onboarded over 13,900 unique participants. Become one of the fastest-selling and most anticipated presales in recent memory. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. These wallets are ideal for claiming your holdings, not for purchasing during the presale. Built to Scale, Designed for Impact BTC-S isn’t just offering short-term returns. The architecture is built for sustained use and developer-friendly growth. Cross-chain bridges are being built for Ethereum and Solana interoperability. The upcoming Solaris Nova App integrates mining with team tracking and real-time performance. Smart contracts are optimized for fast execution with lower energy costs. Validator selection is automated, improving decentralization without sacrificing throughput. According to the official Bitcoin Solaris roadmap , the project will continue evolving through 2025 and beyond, including plans for quantum-resistant upgrades, an enterprise onboarding wave, and global partnerships. Final Verdict While XLM holds its ground as a slow-burn utility token, Bitcoin Solaris is a launch-ready rocket. With a real product, a growing community, dual-consensus mechanics, and a price rollback event that seems custom-built for entry, BTC-S is making it incredibly hard to ignore. We’ve seen trends before. But this one is different. It’s fast, accessible, and purpose-driven. The LBank listing will be the spark. The 72-hour rollback may be the ignition. Don’t be the person watching the countdown after liftoff.

2025-07-07T09:30:00,"Russia Launches Registry to Track and Tax Crypto Miners","The goal of the registry is to help identify illegal operators evading taxes and misusing electricity. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Energy alongside the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development, the initiative follows reports that only 30% of miners have registered with authorities since crypto mining laws were introduced in late 2024. The registry supports enforcement in regions where mining is banned and complements proposed legislation to increase penalties for illegal mining operations. In the US, crypto taxation is also a hot topic. Bill Miller IV argues that Bitcoin should not be taxed like traditional assets due to its decentralized infrastructure, which he says eliminates the need for state-backed ownership enforcement. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill to modernize crypto tax rules, proposing exemptions for small transactions, staking rewards, and donations. Russia Moves to Regulate Crypto Mining Russia is ramping up its efforts to regulate its crypto mining sector by launching a national registry of crypto mining rigs. This move is spearheaded by the Russian Ministry of Energy in coordination with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development, and its main goal is to identify and control illegal mining operations that evade taxes and exploit the power grid. According to state media RIA Novosti , the compiled registry has already been sent to regions experiencing heightened mining activity. The initiative follows concerns that were raised by Ivan Chebeskov, a Russian Finance Ministry official, who pointed out in June that only 30% of miners registered with the Federal Tax Service since the introduction of crypto mining laws in late 2024. Authorities are now working to integrate the remaining 70% of miners into the legal framework. (Source: TASS ) Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko believes that the registry is a crucial step toward legalizing the industry and applying appropriate regulation and taxation, as well as curbing illegal electricity consumption. Russia first announced plans to create the registry in February, especially to support enforcement in areas where crypto mining is banned. Since November, the country has been enforcing legislation that defines and regulates mining businesses , with a six-year ban imposed on mining activities in ten regions until March of 2031 to prevent blackouts. Additionally, the Ministry of Digital Development is drafting new legislation to increase fines for illegal mining operations tenfold—from 200,000 rubles to 2 million rubles, which is equivalent to about $25,500. Enforcement efforts have already resulted in the shutdown of several illicit mining farms, including one discovered in a garage in Bataysk and another that was concealed in a truck siphoning electricity from a remote village in the Pribaikalsky region. Bill Miller IV Says Bitcoin Shouldn’t Be Taxed While Russia is zeroing in on tax evaders, chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners Bill Miller IV believes governments have no rightful claim to tax Bitcoin. He argues that the digital asset operates independently of state infrastructure for managing property rights. On the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell, Miller said Bitcoin’s blockchain automates the enforcement of ownership, eliminating the need for the traditional administrative mechanisms that justify taxation in other asset classes like real estate. Miller explained that taxes on assets like property typically support systems that track and enforce ownership. In contrast, Bitcoin relies entirely on its decentralized ledger to record and verify transactions, meaning the government plays no role in maintaining or authenticating its ownership records. He said that since governments didn’t create Bitcoin and don’t secure its property rights, taxing it in the same manner as state-backed assets lacks justification. He also commented on the speculative idea that was floated earlier this year that capital gains taxes on certain US-based cryptocurrencies could be eliminated. This was reportedly proposed by Eric Trump. While Miller is very skeptical about whether such a policy will actually materialize, he pointed to the lack of a wash sale rule on Bitcoin as a unique and favorable aspect for investors. Bill Miller IV When asked about the possibility of Bitcoin being subjected to an annual property tax, similar to real estate, Miller said it’s uncertain but sees a strong case against it due to Bitcoin’s self-regulating nature. He also shed some light on the broader challenges asset managers face regarding Bitcoin investment by pointing to unresolved issues around taxation and how certain transactions can be classified as “bad income” under existing regulations. Miller concluded that the ongoing tax uncertainties prove just how early Bitcoin still is in its journey toward mainstream acceptance. Senator Lummis Pushes New Crypto Tax Relief Bill Meanwhile, US Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a draft bill that is aimed at modernizing the country’s tax code to better accommodate digital assets, following the failure of crypto-related amendments to make it into the recent budget package. The bill proposes several changes, including a de minimis exemption that would allow people to exclude capital gains from taxation on digital asset transactions of $300 or less, with an annual cap of $5,000. Lummis’ crypto tax bill Lummis is a very vocal supporter of the crypto industry, and also proposed tax exemptions for crypto lending agreements and digital assets donated to charity. In addition, the legislation would defer taxation on mining and staking rewards until the assets are actually sold. This will greatly simplify tax compliance for those participating in blockchain consensus mechanisms. She described the bill as a common-sense approach that is designed to eliminate outdated bureaucracy and reduce the risk of inadvertent tax violations. It could also allow Americans to fully participate in the digital economy. The standalone bill represents Lummis’ renewed effort to push forward pro-crypto legislation after the latest federal spending bill passed without addressing digital assets. With this proposal, she plans to fulfill her commitment to the crypto community and correct what many see as a growing disconnect between outdated tax policies and changing blockchain technologies. The lack of clear tax guidelines has become a major source of frustration for US crypto investors, particularly regarding the treatment of decentralized finance protocols and non-custodial platforms. These platforms do not involve traditional intermediaries or centralized control, and pose unique challenges under existing tax frameworks. Lawmakers have responded by introducing amendments to other crypto-related bills, like the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, to exempt developers of these protocols from being treated as money transmitters and subjected to extensive reporting obligations. While lawmakers work to finalize the federal spending bill, efforts are still underway to include meaningful crypto provisions before it reaches President Donald Trump’s desk. Lummis’ draft bill is now a central piece in the push to establish a fair and forward-thinking regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9824/russia-launches-registry-to-track-and-tax-crypto-miners,"REGULATION|MINING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Key Takeaways: Smarter Web bought 226 more BTC, bringing total holdings to 1,000 BTC worth over £78 million. The company’s year-to-date BTC Yield has surged 26,242%, reflecting its aggressive treasury strategy. Other UK firms are also expanding Bitcoin holdings despite uncertain local crypto regulations. The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,000 BTC, solidifying its position among UK-listed firms with sizable crypto treasuries. The average purchase price for the new batch was £78,932 ($107,726) per Bitcoin, slightly above the company’s overall average purchase price of £78,228 ($106,766). Smarter Web’s Bitcoin Holdings Surpass £78 Million After Latest Purchase With the acquisition, Smarter Web’s cumulative Bitcoin investment now totals over £78 million. The company reported impressive treasury yields, noting a year-to-date BTC Yield of 26,242% and a 30-day BTC Yield of 530%, reflecting the aggressive accumulation strategy laid out in its “10 Year Plan.” As of this month, Smarter Web has around £42.3 million in net cash available for potential future Bitcoin purchases, underscoring its commitment to expanding its crypto reserves. Smarter Web, which offers web design, development, and online marketing services, views Bitcoin as central to its long-term financial strategy. Since 2023, the company has accepted Bitcoin payments and believes the asset is key to the future of global finance.

Of the total funds, £36.27 million ($49.8 million) came from the bookbuild, while an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) was raised through subscription. Smarter Web’s directors emphasized that acquisitions will continue where opportunities align with the company’s expansion goals. The company’s announcement comes as more publicly listed firms adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, signaling a growing trend of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency despite ongoing market volatility. Meanwhile, other UK firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin bets amid Britain’s unclear regulatory stance on digital assets. Vinanz, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, has acquired 37.72 BTC , bringing its total holdings to nearly 59 BTC. In April, investment firm Abraxas Capital made waves with a Bitcoin purchase exceeding $250 million. Metaplanet Acquires 2,205 More BTC On Monday, Japanese firm Metaplanet also expanded its Bitcoin treasury strategy with the purchase of 2,205 additional BTC. The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Meanwhile, skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

Most altcoins are in the green on a daily scale, with ETH closing down to $2,600 and XRP nearing $2.3. BTC Taps Multi-Day Peak The landscape around bitcoin has been quite stagnant since the start of the month. Recall that BTC traded at around $108,000 on July 1 but slipped in the following days to $105,000. The bulls managed to defend that level and didn’t allow a further breakdown. Just the opposite, the asset started to regain traction almost immediately and surged by several grand to a multi-week peak of roughly $110,500. While it seemed that BTC is preparing to break out of its consolidation phase and aim for a new all-time high, its progress stalled and was pushed south to a familiar ground of around $108,000. It didn’t make a move during the weekend until late Sunday evening when it finally started to pump. The culmination, at least for now, transpired earlier today when bitcoin tapped a multi-day peak of $109,600. It faced another minor rejection there and now sits just under $109,000. Its market cap has risen to $2.165 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is below 63% now. BTCUSD.

Ethereum has neared $2,600 after a 2.6% daily jump, SOL is above $150 following a 3% surge, while HYPE is close to $40 after a similar increase . Dogecoin has taken the main stage from the biggest alts, surging by over 5% to over $0.17. AAVE has jumped the most from the mid-cap alts and now sits at $286. TON is among the few exceptions, having dropped by nearly 6% on a 24-hour scale after the UAE denied previous Toncoin claims about a golden visa partnership.

2025-07-07T08:56:02,"Elon Musk Backs Bitcoin in America Party Launch, Market Reacts","The post Elon Musk Backs Bitcoin in America Party Launch, Market Reacts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The world’s richest man says Bitcoin will be part of the official platform of his new “America Party,” sending BTC close to the $110,000 mark earlier today. The move comes just days after Musk broke away from the Republican Party over a controversial budget bill pushed by Donald Trump. When asked if his new party would support Bitcoin, Musk replied: “Fiat is hopeless so yes.” That one sentence was enough to set off a fresh wave of excitement in the market. This is big news. Here’s what you should know. Bitcoin Gets Political Musk’s statement is already being seen as a major moment for Bitcoin in U.S. politics. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, called it “massive,” saying Musk had officially made Bitcoin part of the America Party’s platform. This is massive. Elon has officially declared that Bitcoin will be a part of the new party platform for @AmericaPartyX . pic.twitter.com/sJkJbVtvWB — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) July 7, 2025 The Republican Party has also been pushing pro-crypto policies, but Musk’s entry could shift the conversation further. After all, he’s putting it on a political agenda. And that could change a lot for the crypto industry, perhaps more than what Trump has already been able to do. Dogecoin Jumps As expected, Dogecoin (DOGE) also reacted. The meme coin, often backed by Musk, jumped nearly 6% after the news. Bitcoin, meanwhile, saw a steady climb toward $110K. It’s worth noting: Tesla still holds over 11,500 BTC, valued at more than $1.2 billion, making it one of the top corporate holders of Bitcoin. What Happened Between Trump and Musk? This Bitcoin announcement is also tied to a deeper story – Musk’s growing feud with Donald Trump. He recently slammed Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a major tax and budget policy expected to add $3.3 trillion to the U.S. debt. Musk called the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” and argued it would kill jobs and hurt the country’s future. Important to note is that the bill would kill the EV Mandate, which is essential for a company like Tesla. Trump even threatened Musk with sending him back to South Africa. I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 1, 2025 It was recently passed by Congress despite Musk’s protests. After a poll that drew over 1.2 million votes, Musk officially announced the launch of the America Party, saying the U.S. needs a political movement that “actually cares about the people.” Trump responded by attacking Musk, calling the move “ridiculous”. Will Musk Run for President? Now let’s be clear – Trump just secured a second term in December 2024. So, Musk isn’t headed for the Oval Office anytime soon. But if the America Party gains momentum, especially by 2026 or 2028, Musk could turn Bitcoin into a serious political issue in the U.S. That would bring both opportunities and challenges for crypto. On one hand, it could drive more adoption and awareness. On the other, it could also lead to tighter regulations as crypto becomes part of national politics. Bottom line: when Musk speaks, markets listen.

2025-07-07T08:53:21,"Worldcoin Price Fluctuates While Bitcoin Solaris Announces LBank Listing and 72-Hour Price Rollback","In a week dominated by volatility, Worldcoin made headlines with sudden price dips that left holders holding their breath. But just as some investors were bracing for another wave of uncertainty, a different kind of crypto announcement stormed into the spotlight. Bitcoin Solaris, the high-speed, mobile-first blockchain project, confirmed its listing on LBank and dropped a surprise announcement that’s already sending shockwaves through Live Coin Watch Data. A 72-hour price rollback to just $5, timed perfectly before the listing, has traders scrambling for a piece of what’s quickly becoming the most talked-about coin in the market. Worldcoin Wavers, BTC-S Surges Worldcoin has certainly built its name on big ideas. With ambitions tied to global identity systems and eye-scanning devices, it captured attention early. But that attention often comes with price swings that make even seasoned traders a little nervous. While the project deserves credit for tackling ambitious goals, recent fluctuations have raised more questions than confidence. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is proving that speed, simplicity, and surprise can go a long way. Instead of pushing futuristic narratives, it’s delivering something tangible, immediate, and exciting, especially with a limited-time rollback that feels more like a flash sale than a crypto event. A New Era of Mining That Fits in Your Pocket Forget bulky hardware and soaring electricity bills. Bitcoin Solaris is ushering in a new era of mobile-first mining that anyone can access with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. Designed for efficiency and scalability, the app allows users to mine directly from their smartphones, no rigs, no overheating, just pure convenience. It’s already turning heads among GPU-weary veterans who want passive income without the pain. And the best part? The current mining model is backed by a high-throughput network capable of up to 100,000 TPS through its Solaris Layer. That’s not just fast, that’s lightning in blockchain form. You can even estimate your mining potential with the official Bitcoin Solaris calculator , giving users clear projections on earnings before they get started. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here. Core Features Setting BTC-S Apart What’s making Bitcoin Solaris the darling of Live Coin Watch this week isn’t just hype or the LBank listing . It’s the tech stack under the hood. Here’s why analysts and investors are jumping in: Dual-layer consensus model combining PoW for security and DPoS for performance. Validator rotation every 24 hours ensures decentralization and avoids monopolies. Dynamic block sizes up to 32MB and block time of 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer. Advanced smart contract support using Rust, compatible with Solana’s dev tools. Energy efficiency improved by over 99 percent compared to traditional mining. Crypto’s Next Giant Isn’t a Clone It’s Bitcoin Solaris Some of the most active crypto influencers are covering it too, including: A feature breakdown from Token Empire that highlights the speed and accessibility of the project. Token Galaxy showcasing the potential of the mobile mining model. Crypto Vlog analyzing the technical architecture in depth. And behind the scenes, Bitcoin Solaris has passed not one, but two audits one from Cyberscope and another from Freshcoins . That means trust isn’t just implied, it’s verified. The Presale Storm and the $5 Rollback With over 13,900 users already onboard and more than $6.3 million raised, the Bitcoin Solaris presale has already outpaced expectations. The presale is currently in Phase 11 with a price of $11 per token. However, for just 72 hours, the team is rolling back the price to $5, giving both new buyers and hesitant watchers a rare window to jump in before it returns to $11 and heads toward its $20 launch target. It’s rare to see a presale offer a rollback like this, and rarer still when the fundamentals are this strong. The 72-hour countdown isn’t just about pricing, it’s a test of who’s ready to take action. Less than 4 weeks remain before the listing. Already one of the shortest and fastest-moving presales in the market. Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. Built to Scale and Built to Last The architecture behind Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just flashy, it’s solid. With a Base Layer throughput of up to 3,000 TPS and a Solaris Layer pushing performance to 100,000 TPS, the system can handle mass adoption. Cross-layer transactions are synchronized through secure block commitments, while validator rotation prevents centralization and keeps the network fair. More importantly, the token distribution is smart and sustainable. With a fixed 21 million BTC-S cap, the tokenomics ensures long-term growth and community control: 66.66% allocated for mining 20% reserved for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for marketing, staking rewards, ecosystem development, and community rewards each 0.33% for the team and advisors This guarantees that the majority of BTC-S remains in the hands of actual users and miners, not locked behind private deals. Final Thoughts Bitcoin Solaris is pulling off what most projects only dream of. With a real-use mobile mining app on the horizon, dual-consensus security, and a high-speed blockchain that doesn’t compromise on decentralization, BTC-S is on a collision course with mainstream success. And with the LBank listing confirmed and a surprise price rollback live for just 72 hours, the timing couldn’t be better. Whether you're a seasoned miner tired of chasing hash rates or a new investor looking for a smarter way in, this is your moment. When the dust settles, you’ll either be part of the Bitcoin Solaris movement, or wishing you had been.

2025-07-07T08:49:57,"Elon Musk’s America Party to Accept Bitcoin for Political Donations","Tesla CEO and tech billionaire Elon Musk has confirmed that his newly launched political party, the America Party, will accept Bitcoin, marking a significant step for crypto in US politics. When asked on X if his party would embrace BTC, Musk simply replied , “Fiat is hopeless, so yes.” Musk is no stranger to Bitcoin, with Tesla holding 11,509 BTC worth around $1.26 billion , making it the ninth-largest publicly traded company with Bitcoin reserves. Tesla initially purchased $1.5 billion in BTC under Musk’s leadership in 2021, signaling early institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency. While Musk has often voiced support for Dogecoin, his embrace of Bitcoin for political donations places the cryptocurrency at the center of a growing conversation about campaign finance and decentralized money in US elections. Bitcoin for Political Leverage Samson Mow, founder of Jan3, noted that Musk’s decision could give him an edge over President Donald Trump in their ongoing public feud. Mow suggested that Tesla should resume accepting Bitcoin for vehicle purchases and that Musk’s SpaceX could consider offering discounts to customers who pay with BTC. In the past, Musk has shown a complicated relationship with Bitcoin. In 2021, he argued that Bitcoin’s price was “too high,” leading to a dip in its value. He also rejected the idea of using Bitcoin on Mars due to slow transaction times but later entertained the use of a localized Lightning Network to enable faster payments. Feud with Trump Deepens Amid America Party Launch Musk’s decision to form the America Party follows a heated disagreement with Trump over the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which Musk labeled “destructive.” The bill is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and Musk questioned how Trump’s initiatives could reduce the debt while simultaneously increasing it by trillions. After more than 1.24 million people voted on Musk’s poll, with nearly two-thirds in favor, he announced the creation of the America Party, stating that the US “needs a party that actually cares about the people.” He further criticized the US system as a “one-party system” when it comes to wasteful spending. In response, Trump has warned that Musk’s new party could fracture the Republican vote in the 2026 US midterm elections, escalating the tension between the two figures as Musk positions himself as a disruptive political force willing to bring Bitcoin into the heart of American politics.

According to the firm’s latest disclosure , it purchased an additional 2,205 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for roughly $237.9 million (34.49 billion yen). The tokens were obtained at an average cost of 15.64 million yen per bitcoin, approximately $107,800, now bringing its total holdings to 15,555 BTC. The latest purchase marks the firm’s largest single-day purchase since commencing its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, funded by a mix of bond issuances and stock warrant exercises. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 2,205 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 15,555 BTC* pic.twitter.com/VqKGOwCs6N — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 Just days prior to this acquisition, Metaplanet redeemed 6 billion yen worth of bonds issued in late June, using proceeds from newly exercised warrants. The company has consistently followed this approach, raising capital and converting it directly into Bitcoin to expand its treasury holdings. So far, the Tokyo-based firm has now spent a total of 225.8 billion yen, around $1.6 billion, on Bitcoin since beginning its treasury strategy, with an average cost basis of 14.5 million yen per BTC. This continues to build momentum toward its bigger goal of reaching 30,000 BTC by the end of the year, 100,000 BTC by 2026, and 210,000 BTC by 2027.

2025-07-07T08:48:46,"Dogecoin jumps 8% as Musk launches pro-crypto political party, calls fiat ‘hopeless’","The digital assets industry displayed bullishness on Monday as the global crypto market cap surged 1.80% in the past day to $3.37 trillion. While altcoins targeted breakouts, Dogecoin has taken the lead, fueled by political developments. The original meme coin outshone top cryptos as it climbed from yesterday’s $0.1632 to an intraday peak of $0.1762 – a 7.97% increase within the past day. Tesla CEO stirs crypto and political sectors Elon Musk lit the crypto markets over the weekend with the formation of a new “America Party” political group . The party targets radical changes, including challenging the current US two-party system and supporting crypto, particularly Bitcoin. Musk’s move to launch a political party came a day after President Trump passed the “ Big Beautiful Bill ,” adding $5 trillion to the US debt ceiling and government spending. In response, the Tesla CEO conducted a poll on X asking whether a new political party was an option, and 65.5% of more than 1.2 million voters supported the move. Musk’s follow-up post declared the party launch. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom. Musk’s political movement taps Bitcoin as “fiat is hopeless” The CEO grabbed attention again after responding to a user who asked whether the America Party would embrace Bitcoin. He confirmed that the political group will support Bitcoin with a sharp and bold reply. Elon Musk @elonmusk · Follow Replying to @RenatoLima_X Fiat is hopeless, so yes 4:11 AM · Jul 7, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The remarks triggered bullish sentiments across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin gained 1.45% to $109,600, whereas Dogecoin, Musk’s favorite meme token, displayed revived momentum with an 8% price increase. Dogecoin-Musk links rekindled While the billionaire mentioned Bitcoin, his history with the meme DOGE caught attention. Elon Musk has been a long-time supporter of Dogecoin, even propelling it to ATH in 2021. Furthermore, the meme token attracted attention after Musk formed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to help Trump reduce government waste. However, he stepped down recently, ending his partnership with Trump’s administration. Now, with the new pro-crypto political party, attention has shifted to Dogecoin. While Musk’s post references Bitcoin, the meme token could influence the America Party’s monetary agenda, especially as it attracts crypto-savvy individuals and the younger generation. Dogecoin price outlook The meme token trades at $0.1742 after a slight slide from intraday peaks. Meanwhile, the 255% surge in daily trading volume confirms renewed interest in Dogecoin. Technical indicators support buyer resurgence on the altcoin. For instance, the 4H MACD displays green histograms after a bullish crossover with the signal line. Source: TradingView Additionally, the RSI at 40 indicates an upward momentum for Dogecoin. Nevertheless, DOGE trades below the 50 Exponential Moving Average on the 1D chart, indicating seller control. While the America Party awaits official registration with the FEC (Federal Election Commission), Musk’s mission has already made a political and economic impact. The CEO plans to leverage his influence to transform politics and money.

Analyst Warns of Massive Sell-Off Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Veteran crypto trader Capo of Crypto has just doubled down on his warning that Bitcoin could soon see a huge drop to as low as $70,000. Despite Bitcoin staying above $100K for now, Capo says big hidden moves and fresh global risks could break this key level and spark a massive sell-off. Here’s why he’s not backing down from his bearish call and what could trigger the next big shake-up. Altcoins Fallen 30% – 50% While Bitcoin has managed to hover around $108,000, most altcoins have already seen heavy losses, falling 30% to 50% from their May peaks. According to Capo, this drop was no surprise , he called it perfectly and has continued to add to his short trades, especially focusing on altcoins he believes have more downside ahead. But here’s where it gets more interesting: Bitcoin is still holding above $100,000, mainly due to institutional investors accumulating BTC for their reserves, which creates steady buying pressure. However, he finds it odd that with all this buying, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t soared higher. “Something feels off,” he says, suggesting that bigger whales may be quietly selling at these levels. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Come Alive Adding to the uncertainty, several old Bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era have suddenly become active, moving over 80,000 BTC, worth nearly $8.7 billion, after 14 years. It’s unclear if these coins will be sold, but Capo sees this as a sign that large holders might be distributing, not accumulating, at current prices. Bitcoin To Drop To $70k, IF! What makes Capo even more bearish is his view that if Bitcoin breaks below the $100K level clearly, it could soon drop to the next support area around $92K–$93K. Making this even worse, a deeper slip could drag BTC to $60K–$70K, and altcoins might collapse another 50%–80% in a panic sell-off. China–Taiwan Tensions Loom Large One trigger he points to is the China–Taiwan conflict, which he says is quietly reaching a dangerous point. Any disruption in Taiwan’s vital chip supply could shake global markets and push investors to panic, and crypto won’t be safe. As of now, bitcoin is shying away from its all-time high, currently trading around $108,912 , reflecting a rise of 1% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.16 trillion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-crash-to-70k-analyst-warns-of-massive-sell-off-ahead/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T08:30:02,"Chartist Slams Misleading Dogecoin Analysis: ‘Focus On This Instead’","Technical analyst Kevin, better known on X as @Kev_Capital_TA, rekindled debate over Dogecoin’s market structure on Sunday when he urged traders to ignore the “non-stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes” and to concentrate on the two signals that have guided the meme-coin’s price for more than two years. “Not much has changed for Dogecoin here,” he wrote. “Don’t let the other analysts on this platform flood you with non stop TA on DOGE for engagement purposes. We know what to watch for here.” Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Kevin’s view hinges on the weekly chart he posted on 26 June. At that time, Dogecoin (DOGE) was hovering near $0.166—and, according to his chart, sitting directly on an ascending support cluster that has defined every major move since the 2022 bear-market washout. “Looking at Dogecoin on the weekly time frame,” he said, “you can see that ever since the bear market breakout on the weekly RSI back in 2022, any time DOGE has hit that level again—which has happened five times now—Doge has gone on to see major bounces. A failure of this weekly RSI level along with a failure of the $0.143-$0.127 level would be the line in the sand between longer term bearish price action or continued bull.” Related Reading: The $1 Dogecoin Dream Is Alive: Chartist Lays Out Parabolic Scenario The chart shows Dogecoin sitting just millimetres above a confluence of the green 0.382 Fibonacci retracement ($0.13778), the upper boundary of a falling trend line that has been in force since May 2021 and the weekly 200 SMA and EMA. Previously, Kevin stated via X: “Weekly 200 SMA and EMA are must holds for Dogecoin along with the macro .382 and down trending support.” Beneath lies the horizontal “line in the sand” at $0.143-$0.127—a zone Kevin has ring-fenced with bold yellow trend lines. Below the price pane, the weekly Relative Strength Index tells an equally focused story. Kevin has drawn a white band just above the 40-line; the yellow RSI profile has now tapped that band five times. Each tag coincided with a price trough circled in orange on the main chart. The oscillator’s simple moving average (plotted in magenta) has curled below 50 but remains above the 40-support, keeping the pattern intact. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst—Here’s The Target Overhead, Kevin’s chart maps a hierarchy of Fibonacci checkpoints: the 0.5 retracement at $0.18988 (red), the tightly stacked 0.618 ($0.26169) and 0.65 ($0.28548) (yellow), and the 0.786 ($0.41317) (blue). Two large violet supply boxes—one between $1.00 and $1.30 and another around $2.20 and $2.70—represent possible bull run targets. Kevin refrains from forecasting how quickly those zones might come into play, emphasising instead that holding the current support cluster is the single prerequisite for any higher-time-frame bullish thesis. The analyst also zoomed out to the broader digital-asset landscape in a Sunday follow-up. “The biggest moves for #Altcoins have yet to occur,” he argued, tying potential break-outs to macro-economic easing. “If the macro leads us to further easing and the market sniffs that out … then the ingredients will be in place for a massive move higher on Alts. Altcoins have always required the proper ingredients to make a sustained out-performance over #BTC for months. We’re closer than many understand; we just need a few more things to fall into place.” For now, Kevin’s message is stripped to its essentials: watch the weekly RSI band and the $0.143-$0.127 price shelf. As long as both survive, the chartist sees no reason to overhaul his structural bias—no matter how crowded the Dogecoin commentary stream becomes. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.172.

U.S. President Donald Trump wasted no time slamming the move, calling Musk’s latest political venture a “train wreck” and warning it could splinter the Republican vote in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Trump Slams Musk for Going ‘Off the Rails’ Trump didn’t hold back in his criticism, posting on Truth Social that Musk had gone “off the rails,” calling his political aspirations a “train wreck.” He warned that third-party efforts historically don’t succeed in the U.S. due to the rigid two-party system. “The system seems not designed for them,” Trump noted. The president’s skepticism is backed by past failures. Ross Perot, another billionaire outsider, gained nearly 19% of the popular vote in 1992 but failed to win a single electoral college vote. His Reform Party did see one win, Jesse Ventura’s 1998 gubernatorial victory in Minnesota, but even that fizzled out as Ventura left the party shortly after. These examples reinforce Trump’s belief that Musk’s political path may be short-lived. Musk Launches ‘America Party’ to Fight the GOP and Dems Just hours before Trump’s comments, Musk confirmed via X that he had officially launched the America Party. The announcement came in response to Congress passing Trump’s controversial tax-and-spending bill. Musk had warned he’d retaliate by launching a party if the bill went through, and he made good on the threat. Filings linked to the American Party began appearing with the Federal Election Commission. Musk later clarified that at least one of these was fake, and doubts remain about the authenticity of others. The Bill That Fueled the Feud The clash between Trump and Musk largely centers around the “ One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,” which Musk called a “disgusting abomination.” The bill, estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, undermines the mission of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency , where Musk served briefly. Before the bill passed, Musk vowed to oust any GOP lawmaker who supported it, a threat he now seems prepared to act on. [post_titles_links postid=”479146″] Rising Fears of a GOP Split I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG and Thomas Massie will join the new “America Party” to spite President Trump. — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) July 5, 2025 Trump loyalists are growing increasingly worried that Musk’s America Party could split the Republican vote, threatening their slim majority in Congress. Influencer Laura Loomer even suggested that Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie may consider defecting. Such moves could divide conservative voters and hand electoral wins to Democrats in tightly contested districts. Musk’s Tactical Play: Flipping Key Seats Rather than launching a presidential campaign, Musk appears to be playing the long game. He stated that his party will “laser-focus” on 2–3 Senate seats and 8–10 House districts. In today’s polarized political environment, even a handful of wins could give Musk’s party the leverage to block legislation and reshape Congressional dynamics.

The America Party aims to “give back freedom” to voters and challenge the “uniparty” system. Its platform includes reducing national debt, responsible spending, modernizing the military with AI, accelerating AI adoption, less regulation (especially in energy), free speech, pro-natalist policies, and generally centrist policies. How realistic is Musk’s plan to disrupt the two-party system with the America Party? Political experts are highly skeptical of Musk’s plan to disrupt the two-party system. Historically, third parties face immense organizational, institutional, and cultural barriers in the U.S. While Musk has vast resources, building a viable national party is a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, and his focus may wane. Are the Federal Election Commission filings for the America Party legitimate? Multiple reports indicate that Elon Musk has filed a Statement of Organization with the FEC to launch the “America Party,” listing Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja as treasurer. While early claims of fake filings circulated, recent news confirms an official filing allows the party to begin raising and spending money for federal elections.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trump-slams-elon-musks-america-party-as-a-gop-killing-train-wreck/,"REGULATION|DOGE|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Purchase Details CEO Simon Gerovich announced the news on Monday via an X post . He revealed that the outfit acquired the Bitcoin for $238.7 million at an average price of $108,237 each. As of July 7, the company now holds a total of 15,555 BTC, which were procured for around $1.54 billion at $99,307 per unit. Metaplanet tracks the success of its Bitcoin strategy using a metric called BTC Yield that measures how much value is being added per share over time. Gerovich shared that the company has achieved a BTC Yield of 416.6% so far in 2025. The firm has been following an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy in recent months. This latest purchase comes after it picked up 1,234 BTC for $133 million on June 26 and another 1,111 BTC worth $118 million just days before that. It also spent $117 million on 1,112 BTC on June 16, which pushed its holdings to 10,000 BTC. With 15,555 BTC, Metaplanet has now surpassed Cleanspark Inc. and Galaxy Digital to become the fifth-largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. The company plans to grow its holdings to 30,000 BTC by the end of the year and aims for 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would put its ownership of Bitcoin at 1% of the king cryptocurrency’s total supply. Elsewhere, Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company also said it has secured 116 BTC for $12.6 million on July 7. The Blockchain Group now holds a total of 1,904 BTC, valued at approximately $203 million. The France-based firm also reported a year-to-date BTC Yield of 1,348.8%. Capital Market Activities Metaplanet’s stock has seen some modest gains following the news. The shares are currently trading at ¥1,568 each. According to Google Finance data , this figure marks a 1.49% increase over the last 24 hours. The stock has also risen by 1,854% since last year. The Tokyo-listed company funds its Bitcoin purchases through stock and bond issuances. On June 16, it issued $210 million in zero-coupon straight bonds to EVO Fund, with all proceeds going toward BTC. Later that month, it announced the release of its 19th Series of Ordinary Bonds valued at around $190 million. Earlier in June, the outfit also completed the early redemption and full repayment of its 16th, 17th, and 18th Series bonds for $281 million using proceeds from the exercise of its stock acquisition rights.

2025-07-07T08:10:10,"Bitcoin price prediction: here’s why BTC will explode higher soon","Bitcoin price could be on the verge of a multi-year breakout in the coming days as numerous factors align. BTC was trading at $108,955 on Monday, a few points below the all-time high of $111,900. Here are some of the top reasons why it may stage a strong surge this year. Bitcoin price has strong technicals The first main reason why Bitcoin price may stage a strong surge is that it has formed numerous bullish patterns. The daily chart shows that it bottomed at $74,558 in April and then bounced back to an all-time high of $111,900. Bitcoin price has formed a highly bullish cup-and-handle pattern, comprising of a horizontal resistance level and a rounded bottom. This pattern also has a handle section, comprising of a descending channel. Furthermore, the handle section occurred after the coin surged, indicating that it is part of a bullish flag pattern. Similar to the cup-and-handle pattern, the bullish flag typically yields additional gains over time. Bitcoin price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. It has also moved slightly above the upper side of the flag section, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued rising. Therefore, the BTC price is likely to experience a strong bullish breakout, with the initial target level set at $112,000. A break above that level will indicate further upside, potentially reaching over $145,000. This target price is established by first measuring the cup’s depth, which, in this case, is about 30%. After this, one then measures the same distance from the cup’s upper side, bringing the target price at above $140,000. Bitcoin price chart Long-term chart points to more BTC price gains The all-time chart suggests more Bitcoin price gains in the coming months if it breaks above the ascending trendline. This chart shows that Bitcoin has formed two rounded bottoms in the past few years. The first one formed between December 2017 and April 2021. The other rounded bottom formed between November 2021 and January 2025. Bitcoin remains slightly below the ascending trend line that connects the highest swings sinc 2017. Therefore, a move above that eight-year trendline will indicate further gains, potentially reaching $200,000 and beyond. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView BTC price has strong fundamentals Further, Bitcoin has strong fundamentals that may drive its price much higher in the coming months. As with all assets, the price movement is usually dependent on demand and supply. While the demand trajectory is slowing, the reality is that more investors are accumulating the coin. A good example of this is in the ETF space, where inflows have surged in the past few months. Data shows that BTC ETF inflows have increased in the last four consecutive months and are slowly approaching the $50 billion milestone. The iShares Bitcoin ETF is nearing the $80 billion asset mark. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF now holds over $22 billion in assets, while Grayscale’s GBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB have over $20 billion and $5.3 billion in assets, respectively. The rising Bitcoin ETF inflows are happening at a time when the supply continues to plunge. Mining activity has slowed as the difficulty rate has surge after last year’s halving event. Bitcoin supply on exchanges Furthermore, the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued to fall in the past few months. Additionally, Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill , the soaring US public debt, and upcoming interest rate cuts are likely to boost risky assets, such as Bitcoin and stocks.

The Bitcoin ( BTC ) staking protocol Babylon Genesis has unveiled its 2025 roadmap, outlining a series of milestones that will mark the completion of Babylon’s core staking infrastructure and open the door to BTCFi-native applications such as lending, trading, and stablecoins. This summer, the protocol will launch testnet support for multi-staking, allowing a single BTC position to secure multiple networks simultaneously. The initial integrations include Ethereum rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum, as well as various Cosmos chains. Alongside the multi-staking testnet, Babylon is also preparing to launch its Ethereum Virtual Machine testnet, enabling developers to deploy DeFi applications directly on Babylon Genesis using familiar Ethereum tooling. In Q4, both multi-staking and EVM functionality will go live on mainnet, alongside RPC upgrades, faster block times, and integrations with IBC and LayerZero. Babylon Genesis will also onboard a suite of BTCFi dApps, positioning itself as the execution layer for Bitcoin-native DeFi. In parallel, Babylon Labs continues R&D on a native Bitcoin liquidity layer using BitVM, aiming to enable trustless cross-chain BTC use. The first real-world applications of this work are expected to launch in Q1 2026.

This followed an earlier Phase 1 rollout in August last year, which introduced self-custodial BTC staking via Bitcoin contracts, allowing users to retain full control over their BTC while participating in network security. According to DefiLlama , Babylon currently ranks second among restaking protocols by TVL, with $19.81 billion locked, trailing only EigenLayer. The April launch also marked the debut of the BABY token, which is currently trading at $0.05073, up 9% in the past 24 hours, likely driven by the recent roadmap release.

2025-07-07T08:00:44,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows: A Monumental $769.6M Week for US Spot Crypto Investments","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows: A Monumental $769.6M Week for US Spot Crypto Investments The world of digital assets is buzzing, and for good reason. Last week, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a truly monumental surge, attracting a staggering $769.60 million in net inflows. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these significant movements is crucial for anyone keen on digital asset investment. What’s Driving the Surge in Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The recent explosion in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflects a confluence of factors that are reshaping the investment landscape. Since their approval in January, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have provided a regulated and accessible pathway for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This ease of access has been a game-changer. Several key elements are contributing to this remarkable momentum: Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are increasingly allocating capital to these regulated products, viewing them as a legitimate and less volatile way to diversify portfolios. The substantial inflows suggest that big money is making its move. Market Sentiment: A generally positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, fueled by its inherent scarcity and the upcoming halving event, creates an optimistic environment. Investors are anticipating potential price appreciation, making ETFs an attractive entry point. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Regulatory Clarity: The very existence of these ETFs, sanctioned by the SEC, provides a level of regulatory clarity and legitimacy that was previously absent, reducing perceived risks for cautious investors. According to data from SoSoValue, the $769.60 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week underscores this robust demand, highlighting a sustained appetite for exposure to the leading cryptocurrency through traditional investment vehicles. The Rise of the Spot Bitcoin ETF: A Game Changer? The introduction of the Spot Bitcoin ETF has been widely hailed as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin’s future price, a spot ETF directly holds Bitcoin, providing a more direct and often preferred form of exposure for investors. This distinction is vital for understanding its impact. How has the Spot Bitcoin ETF become such a significant player? Accessibility: For many, buying and securing actual Bitcoin can be complex. ETFs simplify this by allowing investors to buy shares through their existing brokerage accounts, just like stocks or mutual funds. Regulation and Security: Operating under stringent regulatory oversight, these ETFs offer a layer of investor protection and security that direct crypto holdings might not. This appeals to a broader base of investors who prioritize compliance and safety. Diversification: Fund managers can now easily add Bitcoin exposure to diversified portfolios, making it a more integrated part of traditional finance. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Market volatility, regulatory shifts, and the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency remain factors that investors must consider. However, the sheer volume of inflows suggests that the benefits are currently outweighing these concerns for a significant portion of the investment community. Ethereum ETF’s Moment: Are Ethereum ETFs Catching Up? While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, its younger sibling, Ethereum, is also making significant strides in the ETF space. Last week, U.S. Ethereum ETFs recorded impressive net inflows of $219.19 million. This indicates a growing recognition of Ethereum’s unique value proposition and its pivotal role in the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems. Here’s why Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational blockchain platform for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and smart contracts. Investing in ETH ETFs offers exposure to this expansive and innovative ecosystem. Staking Potential: The transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades) introduced staking, allowing ETH holders to earn rewards by helping secure the network. While direct ETF staking is still evolving, the underlying asset’s utility adds to its appeal. Diversification within Crypto: For investors looking beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum provides a crucial diversification option within the digital asset space, offering exposure to a different set of use cases and growth drivers. The inflows into Ethereum ETFs, though smaller than Bitcoin’s, are significant and suggest that investors are increasingly comfortable with Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable digital asset. The regulatory path for spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. is still unfolding, but the positive sentiment surrounding these inflows could pave the way for broader adoption. Navigating Crypto Market Trends: What Do These Inflows Mean? The substantial inflows into both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are more than just financial figures; they are powerful indicators of evolving crypto market trends . These movements signal a profound shift in how traditional finance views and interacts with digital assets. What are the broader implications for the crypto market? Price Impact: Increased demand through ETFs can exert upward pressure on the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, as fund managers acquire the underlying assets to back the ETF shares. Market Maturity: The consistent inflows suggest a maturing market, moving beyond speculative retail trading to more structured and long-term investment strategies. Legitimacy and Trust: The success of these ETFs enhances the overall legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of mainstream investors and regulators, potentially leading to further integration into global financial systems. Investor Behavior: The data offers insights into investor sentiment, showing a clear preference for regulated, easy-to-access investment products, which could influence future product development in the crypto space. These trends indicate that cryptocurrencies are no longer niche assets but are becoming integral components of a diversified investment portfolio, attracting capital from various investor segments globally. Digital Asset Investment: The Future is Here? The impressive performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs points towards a future where digital asset investment is not just an alternative, but a core component of global finance. The ease of access provided by ETFs is breaking down barriers, inviting a new wave of capital into the crypto ecosystem. What does the future hold for digital asset investment? Expansion to Other Altcoins: The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for ETFs tracking other major altcoins, further broadening the scope of regulated crypto investment products. Increased Institutional Involvement: As more traditional financial giants enter the space, we can expect even larger capital allocations and more sophisticated investment strategies. Regulatory Evolution: Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are likely to continue refining their approaches to digital assets, potentially leading to more comprehensive frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring investor protection. Technological Integration: The convergence of traditional finance with blockchain technology will likely accelerate, leading to new financial products and services that leverage the best of both worlds. The journey of digital assets from a niche technology to a mainstream investment class is well underway. The strong inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are not just a snapshot of last week’s performance; they are a powerful testament to the growing conviction that digital assets are here to stay, shaping the future of finance. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investment The remarkable $769.60 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with significant gains for Ethereum ETFs, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital asset investment. These figures are more than just statistics; they represent a surging tide of institutional and retail confidence, signaling the maturation of the crypto market and its increasing integration into traditional finance. The accessibility, regulatory clarity, and security offered by these ETF products are clearly resonating with investors, driving unprecedented capital into the space. As the crypto market trends continue to unfold, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge, it’s evident that digital assets are solidifying their position as legitimate and compelling components of a modern investment portfolio. This era promises continued innovation, broader adoption, and exciting opportunities for those ready to embrace the future of finance.

2025-07-07T07:53:07,"XRP Price Prediction 2025—What if it Fails to Break the $2.5 Resistance? Will it Fall Below $2 in July?","The post XRP Price Prediction 2025—What if it Fails to Break the $2.5 Resistance? Will it Fall Below $2 in July? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price faced a strong push during the weekend, propelling the price above the consolidation. The token formed a lower low, then rebounded and was expected to break through the resistance threshold, which was preventing a strong bullish move. This move comes when the Ripple CTO claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin founder, had stacked a huge number of XRP. In the times when the likelihood of an XRP bull run persists and insane targets of more than $10 or $100 or more are being set, the question arises whether it can make it back to $3. XRP Price Stuck Within an Equilibrium The XRP price has not displayed any major price action since the start of 2025; rather, it has remained consolidated below $2.8. Although the token bounced off the $2.2 support zone, it is showing fewer signs of a breakout above $2.3, which could result in an extended consolidation within the pattern. On the other hand, the token has failed to attract the volume that it possessed during the November 2024 breakout. Hence, the XRP price is feared to maintain a slow & steady consolidation for some more time. The XRP price is finding strong support at the 50-day MA at $2.22, while a resistance is at the 200-day MA at $2.36. Whenever the 200-day MA acts as a resistance to achieve, the crypto is believed to remain under bullish influence, which is substantiated by the rising RSI. Interestingly, the daily RSI has never been to the overbought or oversold zone, suggesting less participation of both the bulls and the bears. However, both are preventing the price from either rising above the resistance or plunging below the local support. What’s Next? Will the XRP Price Reach $5 in 2025? In the broader perspective, the token continues to remain within a massive bullish pattern and still has more room to consolidate as the apex is not nearby. Even if the price failed to rise above the resistance or face a pullback, the bulls could help the token to reach the apex of the decisive symmetrical triangle, with $2 being a strong base. Once the token reaches these levels, a breakout could be imminent, and below are the factors that could influence the XRP price rally to a new ATH. A Favorable Outcome in the Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit : A decisive court ruling for Ripple Labs could eliminate regulatory uncertainty and allow US-based exchanges to relist the token. Increased Institutional Adoption : RippleNet, with its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services, is being adopted by financial institutions for worldwide cross-border payments and hence offering a real-world utility and demand for XRP. XRP Ledger (XRPL) Developments : New technical upgrades such as hooks( smart contracts), sidechains, or the automated market maker (AMM) integration could make XRPL more competitive and attract developers and liquidity. Ripple’s Global Expansion : Ripple’s aggressive expansion into Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America gives XRP broader exposure to high-growth payment corridors. Overall Crypto Market Rally : In a broader bull market driven by macro trends or ETF approvals, XRP could benefit from rising investor sentiment Considering the market conditions and the probable events occurring in the second half of 2025, it is very tough for the XRP price to reach $5, but the token may rise above $3.5 and try hard to reach $4, marking a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-prediction-2025-what-if-it-fails-to-break-the-2-5-resistance-will-it-fall-below-2-in-july/,"TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T07:50:47,"Jack Dorsey Unleashes Revolutionary Decentralized Messaging App Bitchat","BitcoinWorld Jack Dorsey Unleashes Revolutionary Decentralized Messaging App Bitchat The digital world is constantly evolving, and at its forefront are innovators challenging the status quo. One such pioneer, Jack Dorsey , the visionary co-founder of Twitter and Block, is once again making waves, this time with a groundbreaking venture into the realm of private communication. His latest project, a decentralized messaging app named Bitchat, has just launched its beta version, promising a radical shift in how we connect online. This isn’t just another messaging app; it’s a bold statement about privacy, freedom, and true peer-to-peer interaction in the burgeoning Web3 space. Jack Dorsey’s Vision: Redefining Digital Communication with Bitchat For years, Jack Dorsey has been a vocal proponent of decentralization, blockchain technology, and the importance of open protocols. His past endeavors, from co-founding Twitter to leading Square (now Block) into the Bitcoin ecosystem, consistently reflect a commitment to empowering individuals and reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries. Bitchat emerges as a natural extension of this philosophy. Cointelegraph reported on the beta rollout, highlighting its core promise: an encrypted communication environment that operates independently of traditional internet infrastructure. This means your messages aren’t just encrypted; they aren’t stored in a centralized database susceptible to breaches or censorship. It’s a significant departure from the WhatsApps and Telegrams of the world. Why a Decentralized Messaging App Now? In an era dominated by concerns over data privacy, surveillance, and corporate control over personal information, the timing for a truly decentralized messaging app like Bitchat couldn’t be more pertinent. Centralized platforms, while convenient, often come with hidden costs: your data. They collect vast amounts of information, making it vulnerable to hacks, government requests, and targeted advertising. A decentralized approach aims to eliminate these risks by distributing data across a network, putting control back into the hands of the users. This fundamental shift is what makes projects like Bitchat so compelling for anyone concerned about their digital footprint. Understanding Bitchat’s Core: Peer-to-Peer Messaging and Encrypted Communication At its heart, Bitchat is built on the principles of peer-to-peer messaging . This architecture allows users to communicate directly with each other without routing messages through a central server. Think of it like direct mail, but digital and instantaneous. This design choice inherently enhances privacy and censorship resistance. If there’s no central server to shut down or compromise, it becomes significantly harder for external entities to interfere with communication. Beyond its peer-to-peer nature, Bitchat emphasizes encrypted communication . While many mainstream apps offer end-to-end encryption, Bitchat takes it a step further by combining it with a decentralized infrastructure. This means: No Central Data Storage: Messages are not held on a server, drastically reducing the risk of large-scale data breaches. Enhanced Privacy: Without a central authority, there’s no single point for data collection or monitoring. Censorship Resistance: The distributed nature makes it incredibly difficult for any single entity to block or censor messages. Reduced Reliance on Internet Infrastructure: As stated in its whitepaper, Bitchat aims to function even without traditional internet connectivity, suggesting innovative routing mechanisms that could leverage mesh networks or other alternative communication channels. This is a game-changer for regions with unreliable internet or during times of crisis. This combination of features positions Bitchat not just as a secure alternative but as a foundational piece for the future of private digital interaction. The Promise of Web3 Communication: Beyond Traditional Social Media Web3 communication represents a paradigm shift from the centralized models of Web2. It’s about ownership, decentralization, and user empowerment. Bitchat aligns perfectly with this ethos. While the current beta focuses on messaging, the underlying technology could pave the way for a new generation of social interactions that are resistant to the whims of corporate policies or government censorship. Imagine a social media platform where you truly own your data, your identity, and your content, and where communities can flourish without fear of deplatforming. This is the broader vision that projects like Bitchat contribute to. Key differences between Web2 and Web3 communication models: Feature Web2 Communication (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook) Web3 Communication (e.g., Bitchat) Data Storage Centralized servers owned by companies Decentralized network, distributed across user nodes Control Company controls data, access, and content policies User controls their data and communication Privacy Dependent on company policies; data often collected Enhanced by design; minimal data collection Censorship Vulnerable to company or government censorship Highly resistant to censorship Infrastructure Reliance Heavy reliance on traditional internet service providers Aims for independence from traditional internet Bitchat’s Beta: What Does It Mean for Early Adopters? The launch of the Bitchat beta is an exciting development, but what does it entail for those eager to try it out? A beta version typically means the app is in its early stages of development, and users should expect potential bugs, limited features, and a focus on testing core functionalities. For early adopters, this is an opportunity to provide crucial feedback that will shape the app’s future. It’s also a chance to be at the forefront of a movement aiming to redefine digital privacy. Challenges for a new decentralized app often include: User Adoption: Overcoming the network effect of established platforms. Scalability: Ensuring the decentralized network can handle a large volume of users and messages efficiently. User Experience: Making the app as intuitive and user-friendly as its centralized counterparts. Security Audits: Rigorous testing to ensure the encryption and decentralization mechanisms are truly robust. Jack Dorsey’s involvement brings significant attention and credibility, which can help Bitchat overcome some of these initial hurdles. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, inviting developers and privacy advocates to scrutinize and contribute to its evolution. What’s Next for Encrypted Communication and Beyond? The arrival of Bitchat signals a growing trend towards more secure and private forms of encrypted communication . As concerns about data breaches and surveillance continue to mount, demand for solutions that offer true privacy will only increase. Bitchat, with its unique approach to peer-to-peer, decentralized, and infrastructure-agnostic communication, could set a new standard. This development isn’t just about messaging; it’s part of a larger movement to build a more resilient, private, and user-controlled internet. Whether Bitchat becomes the dominant force in this new paradigm or simply paves the way for others, its launch is a significant milestone. It challenges us to rethink our assumptions about digital communication and empowers us to demand greater control over our online lives. In conclusion, Jack Dorsey’s beta launch of Bitchat is more than just a new app; it’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of the internet towards decentralization and user empowerment. By offering a truly private, peer-to-peer, and encrypted communication environment, Bitchat aims to provide a vital alternative to centralized platforms. As the Web3 landscape continues to unfold, innovations like Bitchat are crucial steps towards a future where digital interactions are defined by freedom, privacy, and user control. It’s an exciting time for anyone who believes in the power of decentralization to reshape our digital world.
