2025-07-07T07:53:07,"XRP Price Prediction 2025—What if it Fails to Break the $2.5 Resistance? Will it Fall Below $2 in July?","The post XRP Price Prediction 2025—What if it Fails to Break the $2.5 Resistance? Will it Fall Below $2 in July? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price faced a strong push during the weekend, propelling the price above the consolidation. The token formed a lower low, then rebounded and was expected to break through the resistance threshold, which was preventing a strong bullish move. This move comes when the Ripple CTO claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin founder, had stacked a huge number of XRP. In the times when the likelihood of an XRP bull run persists and insane targets of more than $10 or $100 or more are being set, the question arises whether it can make it back to $3. XRP Price Stuck Within an Equilibrium The XRP price has not displayed any major price action since the start of 2025; rather, it has remained consolidated below $2.8. Although the token bounced off the $2.2 support zone, it is showing fewer signs of a breakout above $2.3, which could result in an extended consolidation within the pattern. On the other hand, the token has failed to attract the volume that it possessed during the November 2024 breakout. Hence, the XRP price is feared to maintain a slow & steady consolidation for some more time. The XRP price is finding strong support at the 50-day MA at $2.22, while a resistance is at the 200-day MA at $2.36. Whenever the 200-day MA acts as a resistance to achieve, the crypto is believed to remain under bullish influence, which is substantiated by the rising RSI. Interestingly, the daily RSI has never been to the overbought or oversold zone, suggesting less participation of both the bulls and the bears. However, both are preventing the price from either rising above the resistance or plunging below the local support. What’s Next? Will the XRP Price Reach $5 in 2025? In the broader perspective, the token continues to remain within a massive bullish pattern and still has more room to consolidate as the apex is not nearby. Even if the price failed to rise above the resistance or face a pullback, the bulls could help the token to reach the apex of the decisive symmetrical triangle, with $2 being a strong base. Once the token reaches these levels, a breakout could be imminent, and below are the factors that could influence the XRP price rally to a new ATH. A Favorable Outcome in the Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit : A decisive court ruling for Ripple Labs could eliminate regulatory uncertainty and allow US-based exchanges to relist the token. Increased Institutional Adoption : RippleNet, with its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services, is being adopted by financial institutions for worldwide cross-border payments and hence offering a real-world utility and demand for XRP. XRP Ledger (XRPL) Developments : New technical upgrades such as hooks( smart contracts), sidechains, or the automated market maker (AMM) integration could make XRPL more competitive and attract developers and liquidity. Ripple’s Global Expansion : Ripple’s aggressive expansion into Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America gives XRP broader exposure to high-growth payment corridors. Overall Crypto Market Rally : In a broader bull market driven by macro trends or ETF approvals, XRP could benefit from rising investor sentiment Considering the market conditions and the probable events occurring in the second half of 2025, it is very tough for the XRP price to reach $5, but the token may rise above $3.5 and try hard to reach $4, marking a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/xrp-price-prediction-2025-what-if-it-fails-to-break-the-2-5-resistance-will-it-fall-below-2-in-july/,"TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T07:50:47,"Jack Dorsey Unleashes Revolutionary Decentralized Messaging App Bitchat","BitcoinWorld Jack Dorsey Unleashes Revolutionary Decentralized Messaging App Bitchat The digital world is constantly evolving, and at its forefront are innovators challenging the status quo. One such pioneer, Jack Dorsey , the visionary co-founder of Twitter and Block, is once again making waves, this time with a groundbreaking venture into the realm of private communication. His latest project, a decentralized messaging app named Bitchat, has just launched its beta version, promising a radical shift in how we connect online. This isn’t just another messaging app; it’s a bold statement about privacy, freedom, and true peer-to-peer interaction in the burgeoning Web3 space. Jack Dorsey’s Vision: Redefining Digital Communication with Bitchat For years, Jack Dorsey has been a vocal proponent of decentralization, blockchain technology, and the importance of open protocols. His past endeavors, from co-founding Twitter to leading Square (now Block) into the Bitcoin ecosystem, consistently reflect a commitment to empowering individuals and reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries. Bitchat emerges as a natural extension of this philosophy. Cointelegraph reported on the beta rollout, highlighting its core promise: an encrypted communication environment that operates independently of traditional internet infrastructure. This means your messages aren’t just encrypted; they aren’t stored in a centralized database susceptible to breaches or censorship. It’s a significant departure from the WhatsApps and Telegrams of the world. Why a Decentralized Messaging App Now? In an era dominated by concerns over data privacy, surveillance, and corporate control over personal information, the timing for a truly decentralized messaging app like Bitchat couldn’t be more pertinent. Centralized platforms, while convenient, often come with hidden costs: your data. They collect vast amounts of information, making it vulnerable to hacks, government requests, and targeted advertising. A decentralized approach aims to eliminate these risks by distributing data across a network, putting control back into the hands of the users. This fundamental shift is what makes projects like Bitchat so compelling for anyone concerned about their digital footprint. Understanding Bitchat’s Core: Peer-to-Peer Messaging and Encrypted Communication At its heart, Bitchat is built on the principles of peer-to-peer messaging . This architecture allows users to communicate directly with each other without routing messages through a central server. Think of it like direct mail, but digital and instantaneous. This design choice inherently enhances privacy and censorship resistance. If there’s no central server to shut down or compromise, it becomes significantly harder for external entities to interfere with communication. Beyond its peer-to-peer nature, Bitchat emphasizes encrypted communication . While many mainstream apps offer end-to-end encryption, Bitchat takes it a step further by combining it with a decentralized infrastructure. This means: No Central Data Storage: Messages are not held on a server, drastically reducing the risk of large-scale data breaches. Enhanced Privacy: Without a central authority, there’s no single point for data collection or monitoring. Censorship Resistance: The distributed nature makes it incredibly difficult for any single entity to block or censor messages. Reduced Reliance on Internet Infrastructure: As stated in its whitepaper, Bitchat aims to function even without traditional internet connectivity, suggesting innovative routing mechanisms that could leverage mesh networks or other alternative communication channels. This is a game-changer for regions with unreliable internet or during times of crisis. This combination of features positions Bitchat not just as a secure alternative but as a foundational piece for the future of private digital interaction. The Promise of Web3 Communication: Beyond Traditional Social Media Web3 communication represents a paradigm shift from the centralized models of Web2. It’s about ownership, decentralization, and user empowerment. Bitchat aligns perfectly with this ethos. While the current beta focuses on messaging, the underlying technology could pave the way for a new generation of social interactions that are resistant to the whims of corporate policies or government censorship. Imagine a social media platform where you truly own your data, your identity, and your content, and where communities can flourish without fear of deplatforming. This is the broader vision that projects like Bitchat contribute to. Key differences between Web2 and Web3 communication models: Feature Web2 Communication (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook) Web3 Communication (e.g., Bitchat) Data Storage Centralized servers owned by companies Decentralized network, distributed across user nodes Control Company controls data, access, and content policies User controls their data and communication Privacy Dependent on company policies; data often collected Enhanced by design; minimal data collection Censorship Vulnerable to company or government censorship Highly resistant to censorship Infrastructure Reliance Heavy reliance on traditional internet service providers Aims for independence from traditional internet Bitchat’s Beta: What Does It Mean for Early Adopters? The launch of the Bitchat beta is an exciting development, but what does it entail for those eager to try it out? A beta version typically means the app is in its early stages of development, and users should expect potential bugs, limited features, and a focus on testing core functionalities. For early adopters, this is an opportunity to provide crucial feedback that will shape the app’s future. It’s also a chance to be at the forefront of a movement aiming to redefine digital privacy. Challenges for a new decentralized app often include: User Adoption: Overcoming the network effect of established platforms. Scalability: Ensuring the decentralized network can handle a large volume of users and messages efficiently. User Experience: Making the app as intuitive and user-friendly as its centralized counterparts. Security Audits: Rigorous testing to ensure the encryption and decentralization mechanisms are truly robust. Jack Dorsey’s involvement brings significant attention and credibility, which can help Bitchat overcome some of these initial hurdles. The whitepaper details the technical architecture, inviting developers and privacy advocates to scrutinize and contribute to its evolution. What’s Next for Encrypted Communication and Beyond? The arrival of Bitchat signals a growing trend towards more secure and private forms of encrypted communication . As concerns about data breaches and surveillance continue to mount, demand for solutions that offer true privacy will only increase. Bitchat, with its unique approach to peer-to-peer, decentralized, and infrastructure-agnostic communication, could set a new standard. This development isn’t just about messaging; it’s part of a larger movement to build a more resilient, private, and user-controlled internet. Whether Bitchat becomes the dominant force in this new paradigm or simply paves the way for others, its launch is a significant milestone. It challenges us to rethink our assumptions about digital communication and empowers us to demand greater control over our online lives. In conclusion, Jack Dorsey’s beta launch of Bitchat is more than just a new app; it’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of the internet towards decentralization and user empowerment. By offering a truly private, peer-to-peer, and encrypted communication environment, Bitchat aims to provide a vital alternative to centralized platforms. As the Web3 landscape continues to unfold, innovations like Bitchat are crucial steps towards a future where digital interactions are defined by freedom, privacy, and user control. It’s an exciting time for anyone who believes in the power of decentralization to reshape our digital world.

Analyst Michael van de Poppe Predicts 76% Surge in Coming Months appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The total altcoin market cap currently stands at $1.16 trillion, reflecting a decline of 23.63% from this year’s peak. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index sits at just 29, signaling that Bitcoin continues to dominate the market . Yet, according to top crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, altcoins may be on the verge of a major breakout. Altcoin Market Overview At the start of 2025, the altcoin market cap was around $1.34 trillion. It reached a peak of $1.51 trillion on January 17, before declining 42.12% by April 8. Despite recovering by 43.6% between April 9 and May 13, the market hasn’t fully bounced back. Since May 8, the market has moved sideways, ranging between $1.01 trillion and $1.26 trillion, indicating consolidation and potential buildup for the next move. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Say? The Altcoin Season Index helps identify whether it’s currently Altcoin season or Bitcoin season. According to the index: Altcoin season = 75% of top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin in the last 90 days Bitcoin season = 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin Currently, only 29 coins out of the top 100 have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 30 days. That confirms we’re in a Bitcoin season, not altcoin season—yet. Bitcoin has surged 36.65% in the last 30 days, dominating the market. Some top-performing altcoins in the same timeframe include: SYRUP : +451.69% PENGU : +268.71% HYPE : +233.70% VIRTUAL : +230.65% SPX : +193.91% WIF : +154.32% AAVE : +115.40% Michael van de Poppe: Alt Season May Be Closer Than You Think In a recent post on X, Michael van de Poppe pointed out that the Altcoin Season Index typically bottoms out in June, historically signaling the start of strong altcoin performance in the second half of the year “We’re still in the middle of the crypto bull market, and with Quantitative Easing expected to ease, the macro environment looks favorable for altcoins to rally again,” Poppe explained . [post_titles_links postid=”479140″] Can This Alt Season Outperform Q4 2023? Poppe also compared the current setup with the Q4 2023 altcoin rally. Back then, the market cap rose from $120.7 billion to $213.43 billion, marking a 76.85% increase. If history repeats, Poppe suggests we could witness another 76% or higher surge in the upcoming altcoin season.

Altcoin Season, or Altseason, is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in price growth. This typically occurs as capital rotates from a consolidating Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to rapid and substantial gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that determines if it’s “Altcoin Season” or “Bitcoin Season” by comparing the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A score above 75 indicates Altcoin Season, while a score below 25 (currently around 27) signals Bitcoin Season, meaning Bitcoin is dominating the market. How is the overall crypto market performing today? As of July 7, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed to slightly positive movements. Bitcoin is trading around $109,000, with slight gains. The total crypto market capitalization is growing, with a slight increase over the last week, though altcoin performance is mixed, with some gaining and others declining. What are the top-performing altcoins today? Altcoins showing strong recent activity include Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, and TRON. Broader trends indicate that meme coins (such as SYRUP, PENGU, HYPE, and WIF) and specific Layer 1s (such as AAVE, VIRTUAL, and SPX) have also seen significant gains over the past 30 days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/altcoin-season-loading-analyst-michael-van-de-poppe-predicts-76-surge-in-coming-months/,"ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|AAVE","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-07T07:10:00,"US Tariffs Unleash Dire Global Economic Uncertainty: What it Means for Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld US Tariffs Unleash Dire Global Economic Uncertainty: What it Means for Crypto Markets The global economic landscape is bracing for a significant shift as the United States prepares to implement new rounds of US Tariffs . This isn’t just about trade; it’s a seismic event with far-reaching implications that could ripple through traditional financial markets and, crucially, reshape the burgeoning cryptocurrency ecosystem. For anyone invested in digital assets, understanding these geopolitical tremors is paramount. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement on Truth Social signals a critical juncture, setting the stage for a period of heightened uncertainty and potential volatility. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how might crypto offer a unique hedge in these turbulent times? Understanding the New US Tariffs and Their Scope The U.S. President’s declaration marks a decisive move in international trade policy. Starting precisely at 16:00 UTC on July 7, tariff letters will be dispatched to various countries worldwide. This initial phase, while significant, is overshadowed by a more pointed measure: an additional 10% tariff specifically targeting nations perceived as supporting the anti-American policies of the BRICS alliance. This isn’t a blanket tariff but a targeted economic pressure point, designed to compel a re-evaluation of international allegiances and trade practices. To grasp the full weight of these US Tariffs , it’s essential to consider a few key aspects: The ‘July 7’ Deadline: This specific date and time act as a clear line in the sand, indicating a rapid implementation rather than a protracted negotiation period. Businesses, supply chains, and governments have a very short window to prepare. Targeted Application: The distinction between general tariff letters and the specific 10% tariff on BRICS supporters highlights a strategic, rather than purely economic, motivation. It’s a blend of trade policy and foreign policy, aiming to exert influence on geopolitical alignments. Precedent and Escalation: Donald Trump’s previous presidency was marked by significant use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool. This new announcement suggests a continuation, and potentially an escalation, of that approach, indicating a willingness to disrupt established trade norms to achieve specific political objectives. These tariffs are not merely taxes on imported goods; they are instruments of economic statecraft, designed to alter trade flows, incentivize domestic production, and pressure foreign governments. Their ripple effects are complex, touching everything from consumer prices to corporate profit margins and, ultimately, global economic stability. The BRICS Alliance: A Catalyst for Global Trade War? The mention of the BRICS Alliance is not incidental; it’s central to understanding the strategic intent behind these new tariffs. BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has recently expanded to include countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, signaling a growing bloc of nations seeking to challenge the existing global order, particularly the dominance of the U.S. dollar and Western-led institutions. The U.S. administration’s accusation of ‘anti-American policies’ from BRICS supporters can encompass a wide range of actions, including: De-dollarization Efforts: BRICS nations are actively pursuing trade in local currencies, reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar, which Washington views as undermining its economic leverage. Geopolitical Alignments: Support for nations or policies deemed adversarial to U.S. interests, such as closer ties with Russia or China on critical international issues. Economic Competition: Practices perceived as unfair trade advantages or intellectual property theft, particularly from economic powerhouses within the BRICS bloc. This targeted tariff approach could indeed ignite a more intense Global Trade War . When one major economic power imposes tariffs, the targeted nations often retaliate with their own tariffs, creating a cycle of escalating trade barriers. This tit-for-tat dynamic can severely disrupt international commerce, leading to higher costs for consumers, reduced corporate profits, and slower economic growth worldwide. The BRICS nations, with their collective economic might and growing geopolitical ambition, are unlikely to simply absorb these tariffs without a response, setting the stage for a potentially protracted and damaging economic conflict. What Does This Mean for Global Trade War Dynamics? The imposition of new US Tariffs , especially those aimed at countries aligned with BRICS, fundamentally alters the dynamics of the ongoing Global Trade War . It’s an escalation that moves beyond specific product categories or industries, venturing into the realm of geopolitical alignment and economic coercion. The immediate consequences could be widespread: Area of Impact Potential Outcome Supply Chains Disruption, re-routing, and increased costs as companies seek tariff-free alternatives or absorb duties. This could lead to longer lead times and less efficient production. Consumer Prices Higher prices for imported goods as tariffs are often passed on to consumers. This contributes to inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power. Corporate Profitability Reduced margins for companies reliant on international trade, particularly those importing from or exporting to targeted nations. Some businesses may struggle to remain competitive. Economic Growth Overall dampening of global economic growth due to reduced trade volumes, increased uncertainty, and investment hesitancy. This isn’t just about tariffs on steel or aluminum anymore; it’s about the broader implications for international cooperation and the rules-based global trading system. The more countries engage in retaliatory tariffs, the greater the risk of a full-blown trade war that could spiral into a global recession. Companies that have optimized their supply chains for efficiency and cost-effectiveness over decades will now face immense pressure to re-evaluate and potentially onshore production, leading to significant capital expenditure and potentially higher prices for goods. The Broader Economic Impact Beyond Borders The Economic Impact of these escalating trade tensions will undoubtedly extend far beyond the immediate parties involved. When major economies impose tariffs, it creates a domino effect across interconnected global markets. Consider the following ripple effects: Currency Fluctuations: Trade disputes often lead to currency volatility. Countries facing tariffs might see their currencies weaken as exports become less competitive, while the imposing country’s currency might strengthen, making its exports more expensive. This can create instability in foreign exchange markets, impacting international investments and capital flows. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. When these goods are essential components for domestic industries or consumer products, the cost is often passed on to the end-user, contributing to inflation. This can erode real wages and reduce consumer spending power, further dampening economic activity. Investment Uncertainty: Businesses thrive on predictability. A prolonged Global Trade War creates immense uncertainty, making companies hesitant to invest in new projects, expand operations, or hire more staff. This reduction in investment can stifle innovation and long-term economic growth. Impact on Developing Nations: Smaller, developing economies, often reliant on global supply chains and stable trade relationships, are particularly vulnerable. They may lack the economic resilience to absorb higher import costs or find alternative markets for their exports, potentially leading to economic hardship and social unrest. Furthermore, these tariffs could accelerate the trend towards economic decoupling, where nations strategically reduce their interdependence to mitigate geopolitical risks. While this might be seen as a national security benefit by some, it carries the significant cost of reduced global efficiency, innovation, and overall prosperity. The long-term Economic Impact could reshape global alliances and trade routes for decades to come. How Will This Reshape the Crypto Market Impact? While the immediate focus of US Tariffs and a potential Global Trade War is on traditional goods and services, the cryptocurrency market is not immune to these macroeconomic shifts. In fact, it might be uniquely positioned to react, both positively and negatively, to such turbulence. The Crypto Market Impact could manifest in several ways: Potential Upsides for Crypto: Hedge Against Traditional Market Volatility: In times of economic uncertainty and stock market instability, investors often seek safe-haven assets. While Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has increased, it can still act as a diversification tool. If trade wars lead to significant downturns in equity markets, some capital might flow into cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, seen by some as ‘digital gold.’ Inflationary Hedge: If tariffs lead to higher inflation in fiat currencies, the fixed supply nature of many cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, could make them attractive as an inflation hedge. People might seek to preserve their purchasing power by converting fiat into crypto. De-dollarization Acceleration: The BRICS alliance’s push for de-dollarization could be intensified by these tariffs. If countries seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar for international trade, this could inadvertently boost interest in decentralized digital currencies or even spur the development and adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as alternative settlement layers. Increased Adoption in Targeted Regions: Countries heavily impacted by tariffs or facing economic sanctions might see increased adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means to circumvent traditional financial systems or access global markets. This has been observed in regions with high inflation or restrictive capital controls. Potential Downsides and Challenges for Crypto: Overall Market Contagion: Cryptocurrencies, while distinct, are still part of the broader financial ecosystem. A severe global economic downturn caused by trade wars could lead to a general risk-off sentiment, causing investors to liquidate all assets, including crypto, to cover losses or maintain liquidity. Regulatory Scrutiny: As geopolitical tensions rise, governments might increase scrutiny and regulation of cryptocurrencies, viewing them as potential tools for sanctions evasion or capital flight. This could lead to stricter KYC/AML requirements or even outright bans in some jurisdictions. Reduced Disposable Income: If tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and reduced economic growth, people will have less disposable income, which could translate to less capital flowing into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the Crypto Market Impact will depend on the severity and duration of the trade conflict, as well as the specific reactions of central banks and governments. While cryptocurrencies offer unique properties that could serve as a hedge, they are not immune to global economic shocks. Investors will need to monitor developments closely and consider how these macro trends align with their long-term investment strategies. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Investors In an environment shaped by evolving US Tariffs and a looming Global Trade War , investors across all asset classes, including crypto, must adopt a proactive and informed approach. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Crypto Investors: Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin and Ethereum are foundational, consider diversifying into other promising altcoins that might have unique use cases or less correlation with traditional markets. However, avoid over-diversification into highly speculative assets. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the potential for increased volatility, employing a DCA strategy can mitigate risk. Instead of making a single large investment, invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations. This averages out your purchase price over time. Stay Informed and Research: The crypto market is highly sensitive to news, particularly macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Follow reputable news sources, understand the fundamentals of your chosen assets, and be aware of regulatory changes. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of extreme volatility, parking some capital in stablecoins can provide a temporary refuge from market swings, allowing you to re-enter when conditions stabilize or opportunities arise. Understand the Macro Landscape: Don’t view crypto in isolation. The impact of the BRICS Alliance , the Economic Impact of tariffs, and broader global events will inevitably influence crypto prices. A holistic understanding is key. Broader Investment Considerations: Review Supply Chains: For businesses and investors in traditional sectors, understanding the vulnerability of supply chains to tariff disruptions is crucial. Companies with diversified manufacturing bases or domestic alternatives might fare better. Monitor Inflation: Keep a close eye on inflation data. Persistent inflationary pressures due to tariffs could influence central bank policies, impacting interest rates and overall market liquidity. Geopolitical Risk Assessment: Incorporate geopolitical risk into your investment analysis. Companies or sectors with significant exposure to countries involved in trade disputes might face headwinds. This period of heightened trade tensions underscores the importance of resilience and adaptability in investment strategies. While challenges abound, new opportunities can also emerge for those who are well-prepared and willing to look beyond conventional wisdom. The ongoing Global Trade War could inadvertently accelerate the shift towards decentralized finance and alternative economic models, creating a fascinating landscape for the future of money. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For The announcement of new US Tariffs and the targeted pressure on the BRICS Alliance marks a significant turning point in global economic relations. The path forward is fraught with uncertainty, and several key indicators will determine the ultimate Economic Impact and subsequent Crypto Market Impact : 1. Retaliatory Measures: The immediate reaction of the targeted nations will be crucial. Will they impose their own tariffs? Will they seek to strengthen economic ties within the BRICS bloc, potentially accelerating de-dollarization efforts? The nature and scale of these retaliations will dictate the severity of the Global Trade War . 2. Supply Chain Adjustments: Businesses worldwide will be scrambling to adjust their supply chains. Watch for shifts in manufacturing locations, sourcing strategies, and logistics. Companies that can adapt quickly will be more resilient. 3. Inflation and Consumer Behavior: Monitor inflation rates in major economies. If tariffs lead to significant price increases, consumer spending could decline, further impacting economic growth. Central banks’ responses to these inflationary pressures will also be critical. 4. Geopolitical Developments: Beyond trade, observe the broader geopolitical landscape. Any further escalation of tensions or shifts in alliances could have profound implications for global stability and market sentiment. 5. Crypto Market Trends: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action and its correlation with traditional assets. Look for signs of increased institutional adoption or retail interest in crypto as a hedge against economic instability. The performance of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and stablecoins in this environment will also be telling. The unfolding scenario is a complex interplay of economics, politics, and technology. For those in the cryptocurrency space, this period could either be a test of resilience or an unprecedented opportunity for growth and mainstream adoption, as the traditional financial system grapples with profound structural shifts. Conclusion: Navigating a New Era of Global Trade and Digital Finance The U.S. decision to deliver new US Tariffs starting July 7, particularly the targeted 10% tariff on countries supporting the anti-American policies of the BRICS Alliance , heralds a new, more uncertain chapter in global economic relations. This aggressive stance is poised to escalate the ongoing Global Trade War , triggering a profound Economic Impact that will ripple across continents, affecting supply chains, consumer prices, and corporate profitability. For the cryptocurrency ecosystem, this geopolitical and economic upheaval presents a unique duality of challenges and opportunities. While traditional markets may face increased volatility and downturns, the unique characteristics of digital assets could position them as potential hedges against inflation and traditional financial instability, leading to a significant Crypto Market Impact . Investors must remain vigilant, informed, and adaptable, recognizing that the interplay between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets is becoming increasingly intertwined. As nations navigate these turbulent waters, the world watches to see how this crucial move will reshape the future of trade, international cooperation, and the evolving role of digital currencies.

2025-07-07T07:06:50,"Bitcoin ETF weekly inflows fall 65%, market cools after $110K BTC rally","Weekly inflows into the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant drop last week as fading Fed rate cut hopes and Trump’s newly passed budget bill tempered investor appetite. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $769.6 million over the past week, a 65% drop from the prior week when these investment products drew in $2.22 billion. The week began with $102.14 million in net inflows on Monday, followed by significant outflows of $342.25 million on Tuesday. Momentum reversed midweek, with inflows of $407.78 million on Wednesday and $601.94 million on Thursday, the highest single-day inflow since May. Markets remained closed on Friday in observance of the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Among the issuers, BlackRock’s IBIT led with $336.8 million in weekly inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $248.4 million and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $160 million. Other funds, including Bitwise’s BITB, Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and VanEck’s HODL, along with minor inflows into Grayscale’s new BTC funds, added another $109.2 million in combined inflows. These were partially offset by net outflows of $84.9 million from Grayscale’s legacy GBTC. You might also like: Tron eyes new local highs after 13B transactions and RSI surge The sharp decline in inflows is partly attributed to profit-taking activity, as Bitcoin approached its all-time high near $111,960. Investors are likely locked in gains ahead of the holiday weekend, limiting directional conviction and reducing short-term flows into crypto investment vehicles. Broader macroeconomic developments also weighed on sentiment. The June U.S. jobs report came in stronger than expected, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 147,000 versus consensus estimates around 110,000. As the report weakened hopes for a July rate cut , investors started rebalancing their exposure to assets such as Bitcoin. Simultaneously, market sentiment was impacted by the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, a comprehensive tax and spending package that cleared the Senate on July 1. Although the bill included fiscal reforms, it failed to include crypto-related tax provisions that had been proposed by pro-crypto lawmakers, including favorable treatment for staking and mining activities. This disappointed segments of the crypto industry, who had hoped for regulatory clarity and tax relief. Following the Senate vote, Bitcoin briefly dropped to $105,000 on July 2, as the investors digested the bill’s implications on the crypto industry. However, the asset swiftly rebounded above $110,000, a day later, after President Trump announced a new trade deal with a key ASEAN partner, restoring some investor confidence. As of press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $109,000, showing little change on the day and hovering just 2.5% below its all-time high. Despite lingering concerns over U.S. tariffs, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. Standard Chartered recently reaffirmed its Q3 target of $135,000 for Bitcoin and reiterated its year-end forecast of $200,000, citing continued institutional demand and constrained exchange supply. Other analysts, including those at Bernstein and BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes, have set even more aggressive targets between $200,000 and $250,000 by year-end, contingent on ETF inflows and global liquidity conditions.

2025-07-07T07:00:56,"Elon Musk Bitcoin: The Revolutionary Future of Political Crypto Adoption","BitcoinWorld Elon Musk Bitcoin: The Revolutionary Future of Political Crypto Adoption The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing once again, thanks to a bold declaration from none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In a move that could reshape the intersection of technology and governance, Musk has indicated that his newly formed ‘America Party’ is poised to accept Bitcoin . This isn’t just a headline; it’s a potential game-changer for the digital asset landscape and political fundraising, signaling a fascinating shift in how political movements might operate in the digital age. Elon Musk Bitcoin: A Bold New Era for Digital Currency? Elon Musk, a figure synonymous with innovation and disruption, has once again sent ripples through the financial world. His recent statement on X, confirming that his ‘America Party’ would embrace Bitcoin , was succinct yet profound: ‘Fiat is hopeless, so yes.’ This direct response to a query about the party’s stance on cryptocurrency immediately highlights Musk’s long-standing skepticism towards traditional fiat currencies and his strong belief in the decentralized nature of digital assets. His personal endorsement carries immense weight, given his influence across technology, finance, and social media. What does this mean for the future trajectory of Elon Musk Bitcoin interactions and the broader cryptocurrency market? Musk’s perspective on fiat currencies isn’t new. He has often expressed concerns about inflation and the centralized control inherent in traditional financial systems. His embrace of Bitcoin, therefore, aligns perfectly with his techno-libertarian leanings and his vision for a more decentralized future. This announcement could inspire other public figures and political organizations to seriously consider cryptocurrency as a viable financial tool, pushing the boundaries of traditional campaign finance. The America Party Bitcoin Stance: What Does It Signify? While details about the ‘America Party’ itself remain nascent, its stated intention to accept Bitcoin is a significant development. Traditionally, political campaigns and parties rely heavily on fiat donations, navigating complex regulations and banking systems. By signaling an openness to cryptocurrency, the ‘America Party’ could be pioneering a new model for political financing. This move could potentially: Attract a tech-savvy donor base: Appealing directly to individuals and communities already invested in the digital economy and seeking innovative ways to support political causes. Increase transparency: Blockchain transactions are inherently public, potentially offering a new level of transparency in political donations, though privacy concerns for individual donors would also need addressing through appropriate protocols. Reduce transaction fees: Compared to traditional payment processors, cryptocurrency transactions can sometimes offer lower fees, benefiting both donors and the party by maximizing the impact of each contribution. Enable global reach: Facilitating donations from supporters worldwide, bypassing traditional cross-border banking hurdles and expanding the potential donor pool significantly. The adoption of an America Party Bitcoin policy sets a precedent that other political entities might eventually consider, especially as digital literacy and crypto adoption continue to grow globally. This could be a test case for how a political movement leverages cutting-edge financial technology. Is Political Crypto Adoption the Next Frontier? The idea of political entities embracing cryptocurrency is not entirely new, but a high-profile figure like Elon Musk championing it could accelerate its mainstream acceptance. Political crypto adoption presents both exciting opportunities and considerable challenges for parties, donors, and regulators alike. Benefits of Crypto in Politics: Efficiency and Speed: Cryptocurrency transactions can be processed quickly, potentially speeding up fundraising efforts and allowing for rapid deployment of funds for campaign activities. Innovation Showcase: Demonstrates a forward-thinking approach, appealing to a demographic interested in technological advancement and modern solutions to traditional problems. Empowerment: Offers a direct way for individuals to contribute, potentially bypassing intermediaries and giving donors more control over their contributions. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing compliance risks and requiring careful navigation of campaign finance laws. Volatility: The fluctuating value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could impact the real-world value of donations, making budgeting and financial planning more complex for campaigns. Security Concerns: Managing and securing crypto assets requires specialized knowledge and robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public Perception: Overcoming skepticism or lack of understanding among the general public about cryptocurrencies remains a hurdle, requiring education and clear communication. Traceability vs. Anonymity: While blockchain is transparent, the pseudonymity of crypto addresses can complicate donor identification for regulatory purposes, necessitating robust KYC/AML procedures. A comprehensive table outlining potential pros and cons of political crypto adoption could further illustrate these points, comparing it with traditional fundraising methods and highlighting the specific legal and logistical hurdles. The Expanding Horizon of Bitcoin Acceptance Musk’s statement further solidifies a growing trend of Bitcoin acceptance across various sectors. From major corporations like Tesla (which previously accepted Bitcoin for vehicle vehicle purchases and holds significant amounts on its balance sheet) to small businesses and even entire nations (El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender), the cryptocurrency is steadily gaining traction beyond its early adopter base. This increasing mainstream integration points to a future where digital assets play a more central role in commerce and finance. For political organizations, accepting Bitcoin could not only broaden their donor base but also signal an alignment with a digitally progressive future. The practical implications of widespread Bitcoin acceptance include the development of more user-friendly payment gateways, increased liquidity in the market, and greater public awareness. As more entities, both commercial and political, embrace Bitcoin, its utility as a medium of exchange and a store of value is reinforced, contributing to its long-term stability and growth. This trend suggests a gradual but persistent shift in how value is transferred and perceived globally. The Future of Fiat: Is It Truly Hopeless? Elon Musk’s dismissive ‘Fiat is hopeless’ comment is perhaps the most provocative part of his statement. It reflects a growing sentiment among cryptocurrency proponents who view traditional government-issued currencies as inherently flawed due to inflation, central bank control, and opaque monetary policies. While fiat currencies remain the backbone of the global economy, concerns about their long-term stability and fairness are increasingly voiced. The rise of cryptocurrencies, designed to be decentralized and often deflationary (or at least with controlled supply), offers an alternative vision. The debate around the future of fiat versus cryptocurrencies is complex. Fiat currencies are backed by government trust and legal tender laws, providing a degree of stability and widespread acceptance for daily transactions. However, their value can be eroded by inflation and government policies. Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, offer characteristics like decentralization, transparency, and often a capped supply, which appeal to those wary of traditional systems. Whether the future of fiat is truly ‘hopeless’ remains a subject of intense debate, but Musk’s powerful endorsement of Bitcoin certainly adds fuel to the fire, pushing conversations about monetary policy and economic systems into new territory and challenging conventional wisdom. A Revolutionary Step Forward? Elon Musk’s declaration that his ‘America Party’ will accept Bitcoin is more than just a fleeting news item; it’s a significant indicator of the evolving relationship between digital assets and the political sphere. It highlights the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, the potential for innovative fundraising models, and the ongoing debate about the long-term viability of traditional fiat currencies. As the world watches how this unfolds, one thing is clear: the intersection of technology, finance, and politics is becoming increasingly dynamic, with Bitcoin poised to play a crucial role in shaping its future. This move could indeed be a revolutionary step towards a more digitally integrated political landscape, setting a precedent for how future political campaigns are funded and how citizens engage with their chosen representatives.

2025-07-07T07:00:50,"Altcoin Season Index: Unpacking the Crypto Market’s Powerful Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index: Unpacking the Crypto Market’s Powerful Bitcoin Season Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market? The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric for understanding market dynamics, stands at 27 as of 00:30 UTC on July 7. This particular number isn’t just a data point; it’s a clear signal that the broader cryptocurrency market is currently entrenched in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . For anyone engaged in cryptocurrency investing , understanding what this means is paramount to navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool provided by CoinMarketCap (CMC), designed to offer a snapshot of market sentiment and performance. It helps investors gauge whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or the vast universe of altcoins. But how exactly is this index calculated, and what do its numbers truly represent? The Core Metric: The index specifically tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. This 90-day window provides a robust, short-to-medium term view of market leadership. Performance Comparison: The key to the index is its comparative nature. It doesn’t just look at how altcoins are doing in isolation; instead, it measures how many of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) during the specified period. Defining the Seasons: The index has a range from 1 to 100, with specific thresholds indicating different market phases: Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin. A higher index score, typically above 75, points to a strong Altcoin Season. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. An index score of 25 or below, like our current 27, firmly places us in Bitcoin’s territory. No Dominant Season: Scores between 26 and 74 generally indicate a more balanced market, or a period where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins show overwhelming dominance. Understanding these definitions is crucial for any investor looking to make informed decisions about their altcoin performance and overall portfolio strategy. Navigating Bitcoin Season: What Does it Mean for Your Portfolio? With the Altcoin Season Index at 27, the message is clear: Bitcoin is currently leading the charge. But what are the practical implications of a Bitcoin Season for your cryptocurrency investing strategies? During Bitcoin Season, we typically observe several key market behaviors: Bitcoin’s Dominance Grows: Bitcoin tends to absorb a larger share of the total crypto market capitalization. This often happens as capital flows from altcoins into Bitcoin, or new capital entering the market opts for the perceived safety and liquidity of BTC. Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, struggle to gain significant traction against Bitcoin. While some might see minor pumps, sustained rallies are less common, and many may even bleed value when measured against BTC. Flight to Quality: Investors often view Bitcoin as the less risky asset within the crypto space, especially during periods of uncertainty or consolidation. This can lead to a ‘flight to quality’ where funds move from more speculative altcoins into Bitcoin. Market Consolidation: Bitcoin Season can sometimes coincide with periods of market consolidation or even correction, where Bitcoin acts as a relative safe haven compared to the higher volatility of altcoins. For investors, this often means a strategic shift is warranted. Rather than chasing every altcoin pump, a focus on Bitcoin or a more cautious approach to altcoin exposure might be beneficial. This period is less about explosive altcoin performance and more about Bitcoin establishing or reinforcing its market position. Why Do Crypto Market Trends Shift Between Seasons? The cyclical nature of the crypto market, oscillating between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons, is driven by a complex interplay of factors. Understanding these underlying dynamics is key to predicting future shifts in crypto market trends . Several catalysts can trigger a shift: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rate changes, inflation, and geopolitical events can all influence investor risk appetite. During periods of high uncertainty, investors tend to de-risk, moving capital into Bitcoin, which is often seen as a digital store of value. When confidence returns, capital may flow back into higher-risk altcoins. Bitcoin Halving Events: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have preceded significant bull runs for Bitcoin, often initiating a Bitcoin Season before altcoins eventually catch up. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional interest, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs or major corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, can drive up Bitcoin’s price and dominance, pulling capital from altcoins. Technological Innovation & Narratives: Breakthroughs in altcoin ecosystems (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions) or compelling new narratives can ignite investor interest in specific altcoins, potentially leading to an Altcoin Season. However, during Bitcoin Season, these narratives might struggle to gain widespread adoption. Market Sentiment and Fear & Greed Index: Extreme fear often sees capital consolidate into Bitcoin, while extreme greed can lead to speculative altcoin rallies. These factors collectively shape the ongoing tug-of-war between Bitcoin’s foundational strength and altcoins’ innovative potential, dictating the prevailing crypto market trends . Actionable Insights for Cryptocurrency Investing During Bitcoin Season Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 27, how should a savvy investor adjust their cryptocurrency investing strategy? This period calls for a nuanced approach, prioritizing capital preservation and strategic positioning over chasing speculative gains. Strategies to Consider: Focus on Bitcoin (BTC): During Bitcoin Season, allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to BTC is often a prudent move. Bitcoin tends to be more resilient and can act as a better store of value compared to most altcoins during these periods. Evaluate Altcoin Holdings: Review your existing altcoin portfolio. Identify projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Consider reducing exposure to highly speculative or illiquid altcoins that may suffer more significantly. Accumulate During Dips: If you believe in the long-term potential of certain altcoins, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate them at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. However, exercise caution and use dollar-cost averaging. Stablecoin Positioning: Holding a portion of your portfolio in stablecoins can provide liquidity to capitalize on future opportunities, whether it’s a dip in Bitcoin or the eventual return of Altcoin Season. Research and Due Diligence: Use this time to deepen your understanding of various altcoin projects. When the market eventually shifts, you’ll be better prepared to identify potential winners. Pay attention to technological advancements and genuine adoption rather than just price action. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management practices. Avoid over-leveraging and set stop-loss orders to protect your capital from significant drawdowns, especially with altcoins that can experience rapid declines. Remember, while the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insight into current crypto market trends , it’s just one tool. Combine it with your own research and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: When Might Altcoin Performance Reign Again? While we are firmly in Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is inherently cyclical. The question on many investors’ minds is: what could signal a shift back towards widespread altcoin performance and a new Altcoin Season? Several factors typically precede or accompany a resurgence in altcoin dominance: Bitcoin Price Stability or Consolidation: Often, a strong Altcoin Season begins after Bitcoin has had a significant run-up and then enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital that flowed into BTC to ‘rotate’ back into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Major Altcoin-Specific Catalysts: Significant upgrades (e.g., Ethereum’s EIPs or Layer 2 rollouts), new project launches with strong utility, or major partnerships can spark rallies in specific altcoins that then cascade across the market. Increased Risk Appetite: A general improvement in global economic sentiment and investor confidence can lead to a willingness to take on more risk, benefiting higher-beta altcoins. Decreased Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained downtrend in Bitcoin’s market dominance chart is a strong indicator that altcoins are beginning to outperform. The Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator, meaning it confirms a trend that is already underway. Therefore, observing the underlying factors and market sentiment is crucial for anticipating the next shift in crypto market trends . Patience and a well-researched strategy are your best allies in navigating these cycles. Conclusion: Mastering the Seasons of Cryptocurrency Investing The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 27 serves as a vital reminder that the crypto market operates in distinct cycles. We are presently in a definitive Bitcoin Season , a period where Bitcoin’s performance generally outshines that of most altcoins. Understanding this dynamic is not merely academic; it’s fundamental to effective cryptocurrency investing . By recognizing the signals of the index and the broader crypto market trends , investors can adapt their strategies, focusing on capital preservation and strategic accumulation during Bitcoin’s reign, while preparing for the eventual return of robust altcoin performance . Whether you’re a seasoned trader or new to the space, staying informed about these market indicators empowers you to make more informed decisions and navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of digital assets with greater confidence.

2025-07-07T07:00:04,"XRP Price Risks Breakdown To Next Support Level, Why $2.28 Is Important","The XRP price has been holding on pretty tightly to its support level above $2.2 and continues to be a major level of pushback for the bears. This has shown that buyers are beginning to make a comeback at this level amid predictions that it will be the bounce point for the next rally. Regardless of this, a crypto analyst still believes that this support remains at risk as bears continue to push down on the price, and the result could be a major price crash from here. XRP Price Could Stage A Classic Bear Trap While there has been some recovery in the crypto market and, by extension, the XRP price, there has not been enough momentum to show that this is a sustained increase. This is something that crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise alludes to in their latest analysis, warning that it is possible that the digital asset might end up seeing a classic bear trap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The reason behind this is the fact that there have been a number of bearish developments on the XRP price chart that suggest that the price is likely to go down. For one, a Change of Character toward the more bearish side puts sellers in the lead, and this usually signals the start of a bearish downturn. Another development that has rocked the altcoin is an inverse Cup and Handle pattern that is still in the process of playing out. The crypto analyst also explained that these developments, in addition to the break below the key support trendline, suggest that a crash is coming for the XRP price. From here, bears are already applying pressure that could result in a 10% crash. This would push the cryptocurrency back toward the previous support, and according to the analyst’s chart, this lies just above the $2 level. What this means is that a crash from here also puts the altcoin at risk of falling below $2, something that would be incredibly bearish and could lead to freefall. Wait For Confirmation Before Moving MyCryptoParadise outlined that the best way to play this analysis is to wait for confirmation. With the bearish thesis, they explain that it is best to wait for the XRP price to see a “proper pullback” before they enter the market. This would increase the risk-to-reward ratio after the trend direction has been confirmed. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Will Surge 35,000% When These Two Things Happen However, there is also the possibility that the XRP price does not crash from here and that lies at the $2.28 level. The analyst explained that if the price is able to cleanly break above this level and make a successful close above $2.28, then it would invalidate the bearish thesis and mark a continuation of the uptrend. “In such a case, it’s better to stay patient and wait for clearer price action before making any decisions,” the analyst said.

2025-07-07T06:58:15,"Hong Kong to limit the number of stablecoin licenses issued in 2025","Hong Kong may begin issuing stablecoin licenses before the end of 2025. Still, the number will likely remain in the “single digits,” according to Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury. As per the local newspaper Ming Pao , published Monday, Hui said the stablecoin licensing regime is expected to take effect in August. Authorities aim to issue limited licenses within the year, reflecting a cautious but proactive approach to digital asset oversight. Hui said they hope stablecoins can help tackle real-world economic challenges, especially cross-border payments. This is particularly relevant in regions with volatile local currencies or underdeveloped financial systems. He added that fiat-backed stablecoins could lower transaction costs and improve the efficiency of international payments. Hong Kong eyes regional dominance as stablecoin race heats up Initially, Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox and licensing plans targeted Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoins. However, there is growing industry interest in offshore yuan-pegged alternatives. Chinese tech giants JD.com and Ant Group are reportedly lobbying China’s central bank to greenlight such offerings, intensifying the regional stablecoin race . Hui emphasized that any stablecoin involving foreign currencies would require close coordination with relevant jurisdictions. While the current framework allows stablecoins backed by legal tender, regulators must weigh exchange rate impacts and systemic risks when foreign currencies are involved. The regulatory activity in Hong Kong is emerging as the popularity of stablecoins soars worldwide. In the US, a landmark regulatory bill to regulate stablecoins, the GENIUS Act , passed the Senate and is waiting for House review. President Donald Trump has feverishly backed rapid passage. At the same time, China’s central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, recognized that stablecoins and CBDCs have increasingly influenced global payment systems. Although things haven’t been that great for crypto in mainland China (where cryptocurrency trading and mining have been banned for some time now), Hong Kong has been making a name for itself as a crypto haven. Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) opened a stablecoin sandbox, drawing key industry participants such as Standard Chartered, Animoca Brands, Hong Kong Telecommunications (HKT), JD Coinlink, and RD InnoTech. The city’s decision to license stablecoins shows its ambition to be a central figure in the future of digital payments across Asia and beyond. Hong Kong sets global standard with new stablecoin licensing law Just a few weeks ago, Hong Kong passed a new stablecoin bill, expanding its cryptocurrency licensing framework as global regulators increasingly move to oversee digital assets. Unlike highly volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world assets like fiat currencies or commodities, including gold. The new legislation targets fiat-referenced stablecoins and introduces a licensing mandate for issuers under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Under the new law, stablecoin issuers must meet a series of requirements, including maintaining full asset reserves and segregating client assets. The HKMA said the framework is designed to “enhance Hong Kong’s existing regulatory framework on virtual-asset (VA) activities, thereby fostering financial stability and encouraging financial innovation.” The authority added that further consultations would be held to finalize regulatory details. The government confirmed that the stablecoin regime is expected to take effect later this year, with a transitional period to help industry participants adapt. This legislation builds on Hong Kong’s 2023 rollout of a broader virtual asset licensing regime, which applies to crypto firms offering services to retail investors. Until recently, stablecoins were not covered under that framework.

2025-07-07T06:54:45,"WazirX Users Take Legal Action Over Frozen Crypto Funds in Singapore","The post WazirX Users Take Legal Action Over Frozen Crypto Funds in Singapore appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The battle over frozen crypto is heating up inside a Singapore courtroom, where WazirX users are demanding answers and their money back. In the High Court, frustrated users are standing up to Zettai, WazirX’s Singapore entity, claiming their unhacked Bitcoin, XRP, TRX, BNB, USDT, and even fiat balances have been wrongly frozen by Zettai, WazirX’s Singapore company. Now, an affidavit by Romy Johnson may become a big turning point for crypto rights. The Big Problem: Frozen Assets At the center of this fight is how Zettai grouped all user assets. According to Romy Johnson’s 40-page affidavit , these are: unhacked coins (Category A), fiat-like INR (Category B), and the hacked ETH/ERC-20 tokens (Category C). But under Singapore’s law, only real debts can be restructured, not user-owned assets held in trust. Users say Zettai crossed the line by using everyone’s coins to push a plan that doesn’t protect innocent holders. THREAD: Why WazirX Users Are Fighting Back in Singapore Court A 25-part breakdown of Romy Johnson’s 40-page affidavit representing “Category A” users whose unhacked crypto assets remain unjustly frozen by Zettai Pte Ltd. https://t.co/BVHshdbhq9 #WazirX #WazirXScam pic.twitter.com/fJkQKNTmQs — TOOFAAN (@TOOFAANARMY) July 6, 2025 The Hack That May Not Be a Hack Things get more confusing because the so-called hack might not even be real. Blockchain records show something odd: the stolen coins were moved using internal multisig wallets that needed multiple approvals. No clear sign of an outside attack has been shown so far. Therefore, this kills Zettai’s excuse that it was an outside hack. Meanwhile, users are now calling out Zettai for hiding key details. They want the names of people who approved these transfers. They also want an audit to check where all the coins went and who should be held responsible. Where the Court Fight Stands Now Singapore’s High Court already rejected Zettai’s first scheme because it hid links to an offshore shell company. Now, Romy Johnson’s affidavit shows this is not just about one exchange. He cites major court cases proving that crypto held in trust belongs to the users, even during bankruptcy. However, the next hearing in WazirX’s ongoing case has now been rescheduled for July 15, 2025 . Will WazirX Return the Money? At the heart of it, this is about protecting user funds. Meanwhile, Zettai claims it will repay users once the new plan is approved. But trust is low.

2025-07-07T06:53:02,"If Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $180,000, These 3 Meme Coins Could Go Parabolic, Expect Big Gains By Year-End","The post If Bitcoin (BTC) Hits $180,000, These 3 Meme Coins Could Go Parabolic, Expect Big Gains By Year-End appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Suppose BTC breaks the $180,000 barrier; in that case, a significant amount of money and interest will likely flow into the altcoin arena, especially meme currencies, which have historically generated huge returns during bullish cycles. But Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , the meme world’s rising star, are the three that stand out as the best bets for 30x to 60x returns by the end of the year. Dogecoin (DOGE): The King Returns Dogecoin needs no introduction. DOGE is trading around $0.16, with a robust daily trading volume of $558.93 million and a market cap of $24.61 billion. Technically, DOGE is flashing bullish signals—having just broken out of a prolonged falling wedge pattern on the charts, accompanied by a weekly MACD bullish crossover. Historically, there has been a relationship of 0.67 between DOGE and Bitcoin. This means that as the price of BTC increases, the cost of DOGE typically rises as well. If BTC rises to $180,000, DOGE may increase to between $4.80 and $9.60, representing a 30x to 60x rise from its current value. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Underdog Poised to Explode Trading at $0.00001179 with a daily volume of $101.03 million and a $6.78 billion market cap, SHIB is quietly building momentum. On the technical front, SHIB has recently completed a bullish W-pattern and is forming a textbook inverted head-and-shoulders—a pattern often preceding massive upward breakouts. Its SHIB/BTC trading pair has climbed 3.16% in the past 24 hours, reinforcing its strong correlation with BTC (historically ranging from 0.82 to 0.92). Should BTC skyrocket to $180,000, SHIB could ride the wave to a staggering $0.0007074—up to 60x its current price. For a coin once written off as a joke, SHIB is shaping up to be a serious contender in the meme coin resurgence. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The New Meme King in the Making If DOGE is the king and SHIB the challenger, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the next meme legend ready to storm the throne. What makes Little Pepe different? It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a fully functional Layer 2 blockchain powered by meme magic and serious tech. Built for speed, low fees, and scalability, LILPEPE doesn’t just ride Ethereum’s coattails—it out-memes it, delivering both fun and function in equal measure. Currently in its red-hot presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $2.5 million, with Stage 3 selling out ahead of schedule. The token is now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, a 30% increase from its initial price. With over 2.6 billion LILPEPE tokens sold—71% of the presale allocation—investor confidence is surging. The project is rumored to be backed by several influential anonymous figures who have previously helped catapult major meme coins to success. Their involvement has added significant credibility, driving community excitement to new highs. The most compelling reason to watch LILPEPE is its growth potential. Analysts speculate that if BTC reaches $180,000, LILPEPE could surge to between $0.0715 and $0.13, representing a potential 60x gain from its current presale price. In addition, Little Pepe’s team is building an entire meme-powered ecosystem, positioning it not just as a coin but as a full-blown movement. To mark its meteoric rise and bring the community along for the ride, Little Pepe has launched one of the largest giveaways in the history of meme coins. This $777,000 giveaway campaign has gained over 17,000 entries, with 10 lucky winners set to receive $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens. Final Thoughts: The Meme Coin Moment Is Here With Bitcoin potentially heading for $180,000, we’re on the cusp of another epic altcoin season—and meme coins are once again at the forefront of that narrative. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the most unique of them all—a meme coin with utility, community firepower, and early-stage explosiveness that could eclipse both DOGE and SHIB in this cycle. For those looking to ride the next meme coin rocket, Little Pepe isn’t just a contender—it might just be the main event. Presale is live. Meme magic is real. Don’t miss the $LILPEPE wave.

Replying to another X user, Elon Musk confirmed that the party would embrace Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Will America Party embrace Bitcoin?” asked X user Renato Lima. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” said Elon Musk in his post . Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 The post garnered major support from cryptocurrency and Bitcoin advocates including Bitcoin Advocate Max Keiser and Founder of IBC Group and co-founder of NFT Technologies Mario Nawfal. Many crypto figureheads claimed that they would “vote” for Elon Musk’s America Party if it championed Bitcoin. “Crypto could be the strongest tool to fight inflation, and Washington’s addiction to money printing and runaway spending,” said Mario Nawfal in his post . You might also like: Dogecoin rises over 5% after Elon Musk threatens DOGE haters with federal action Director of Bitcoin Strategy at Scientific, Joe Burnett, also voiced out his support for Musk’s views on fiat being a hopeless currency. He stated that digital money could be instrumental in creating economic incentives for smaller more efficient government systems. It’s less about politics and more about creating monetary tools that restructure the economic incentives,” Burnett weighed in, replying to Musk’s earlier post. In response to Musk’s idea to form a third political party, his ally-turned-rival President Donald Trump said that Musk had gone “off the rails” in the past few weeks. He said a third party would only serve to create disruption and chaos to the existing system. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – The System seems not designed for them,” said Trump in a TruthSocial post . What is Elon Musk’s America Party? Earlier this month on July 4th, Musk announced his plans to form the America Party. He launched a poll on X asking whether he should create an independent party to challenge the current two-party system in the U.S. The poll received over 1.2 million votes, with 65.4% voting YES to the America party. “Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!” said Musk in his post . Although the party itself has yet to be fully realized, Musk has stated that the way to carry out an independent party would be to secure two to three Senate sears and around eight to 10 House districts. “Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” continued Musk. Earlier this year, Elon Musk and President Donald Trump had a falling out which resulted in a big political blowout between the two men who were once political allies. In June, Musk called Trump’s $3.4 trillion Big, Beautiful Bill a “disgusting abomination” and accused Republican lawmakers of fiscal dishonesty. The Big Beautiful Bill is a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump’s second-term. The bill passed with a House vote of 218 to 214. It includes several items including an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, cuts to health care and food programs, as well as other tax cuts and breaks.

2025-07-07T06:40:51,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars: Unveiling Optimistic Market Sentiment","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars: Unveiling Optimistic Market Sentiment Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? If you’re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, you’ve likely noticed a palpable shift in the atmosphere. The latest update from Alternative, a prominent software development platform, reveals that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed to a significant 73 as of July 7. This seven-point jump from the previous day firmly plants the market in the ‘Greed’ zone, signaling a surge in positive crypto market sentiment . But what exactly does this number mean for your digital assets, and how should you interpret this growing optimism? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Your Market Compass The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful psychological barometer designed to help investors gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index provides a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful (0-24), fearful (25-49), neutral (50), greedy (51-74), or extremely greedy (75-100). A score of 73, as we see now, clearly places us firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. Why is such an index crucial? Because market emotions can be powerful drivers of price action. When investors are fearful, they often sell, driving prices down. Conversely, when greed takes over, buying pressure intensifies, pushing prices higher. As legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” The index attempts to quantify these often-irrational human behaviors. What Factors Drive This Crucial Index? The index isn’t based on a single factor but rather a sophisticated amalgamation of six distinct components, each weighted to reflect its impact on overall market sentiment. Understanding these components is key to truly grasping the index’s implications: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current cryptocurrency volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on upward price movements, can indicate a surge in greed, as investors rush to buy. Conversely, high volatility during downturns often signals panic and fear. Currently, a more controlled but still significant upward volatility might be contributing to the greed score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum in the cryptocurrency space, primarily focusing on Bitcoin. High buying volumes accompanying strong price increases typically indicate healthy bullish sentiment and growing greed. Conversely, low volume on price increases or high volume on price drops can suggest weakness or fear. The current index suggests robust buying interest. Social Media (15%): By analyzing social media platforms (primarily Twitter), the index gauges the sentiment around various cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. It looks at the number of posts, hashtags, and the general tone of discussions. An increase in positive sentiment and high engagement often correlates with rising greed, as more people discuss and promote their holdings. Surveys (15%): Historically, this component included weekly polls asking investors about their market outlook. While currently paused, these surveys provided a direct measure of retail investor sentiment. When active, a high percentage of bullish responses would contribute to a higher greed score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during times of uncertainty (fear), as investors move capital from riskier altcoins back into the perceived stability of Bitcoin. However, in a strong bull market, rising Bitcoin dominance can also signify Bitcoin leading the charge, pulling the rest of the market up, contributing to overall greed. The current increase in the index suggests Bitcoin’s strength is perceived positively. Google Trends (10%): This component analyzes search query data for terms related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Spikes in searches for terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “Bitcoin price prediction” can indicate growing public interest and potential FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), contributing to a higher greed score. Conversely, searches for “Bitcoin crash” or “sell crypto” would indicate fear. Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 73 Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? A score of 73 places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone, just shy of ‘Extreme Greed.’ This suggests that investors are feeling increasingly confident and optimistic about the market’s future performance. Such periods are often characterized by: Increased Buying Pressure: More individuals are willing to buy cryptocurrencies, even at higher prices, driven by the belief that prices will continue to rise. Reduced Selling Pressure: Holders are less likely to sell their assets, anticipating further gains. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New money often flows into the market as people see prices climbing and don’t want to be left behind. Potential for Overvaluation: While not a direct indicator of overvaluation, prolonged periods of extreme greed can sometimes lead to asset prices detaching from their fundamental value, creating bubbles. The current score reflects a general positive outlook, possibly fueled by recent price stability, specific project developments, or broader macroeconomic factors. It’s a sign that the collective consciousness of the crypto community is leaning towards bullishness, indicating a strong positive crypto market sentiment . Navigating Cryptocurrency Volatility: Strategies for the ‘Greed’ Phase While a high ‘Greed’ score can be exhilarating, it also warrants caution. History has shown that periods of extreme greed often precede market corrections or consolidations. Here’s how you can navigate the current environment, keeping cryptocurrency volatility in mind: Strategy Description Why it’s relevant in ‘Greed’ Profit-Taking Consider taking a portion of your profits off the table, converting them into stablecoins or fiat. Secures gains before a potential downturn; reduces exposure to high volatility. Rebalancing Portfolio Adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level. Sell overperforming assets to buy underperforming ones. Ensures you’re not overexposed to any single asset that might be overheated. Setting Stop-Loss Orders Automate selling your assets if their price drops to a certain level. Protects against sudden, sharp corrections common after periods of high greed. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Out Instead of selling everything at once, sell small portions of your holdings at regular intervals. Reduces the risk of trying to time the market peak; smooths out your average selling price. It’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It tells you how people feel , not necessarily what will happen next. Always combine this insight with your own research, technical analysis, and fundamental understanding of the projects you invest in. Beyond the Index: The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Market Momentum While the overall Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view, diving deeper into its components, particularly Bitcoin dominance and market momentum , offers additional layers of insight. These two factors, contributing a combined 35% to the index, are crucial for understanding the market’s underlying health. Bitcoin Dominance: The King’s Influence Bitcoin, as the first and largest cryptocurrency, often dictates the broader market’s direction. Its dominance, or its market cap percentage relative to the total crypto market, can tell us a lot. In a ‘Greed’ phase like the current one, a rising Bitcoin dominance often means that capital is flowing into Bitcoin first, leading the charge. This can be a healthy sign, as a strong Bitcoin often pulls altcoins up with it, albeit with a delay. Conversely, a falling Bitcoin dominance during a bull market might signal an ‘altcoin season,’ where investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into smaller, potentially higher-gain altcoins. The current index score, influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, suggests that Bitcoin is playing a key role in fostering this optimistic environment. Market Momentum: The Engine of Growth The market momentum component, powered by trading volume, is essentially the market’s engine. When prices are rising on high volume, it signifies strong conviction among buyers. This momentum can be self-reinforcing; as prices go up, more people want to join, further increasing volume and pushing prices higher. However, it’s also a double-edged sword. When momentum starts to wane, or if prices rise without corresponding volume, it can be a warning sign that the current trend might be unsustainable. The fact that momentum contributes significantly to the current ‘Greed’ score suggests that there’s substantial capital flowing into the market, underpinning the recent price increases. Understanding the interplay between these factors provides a nuanced perspective. For instance, if the index is high due to strong Bitcoin dominance and market momentum, it suggests a more robust, institutionally-led optimism. If it’s driven primarily by social media buzz with less underlying volume, it might indicate a more speculative, retail-driven rally that could be less sustainable. Challenges and Considerations: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Foolproof? While an invaluable tool, it’s important to acknowledge that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not infallible. No single indicator can perfectly predict the future of a complex and rapidly evolving market like cryptocurrency. Here are some limitations to keep in mind: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current and recent sentiment, not future sentiment. By the time the index hits ‘Extreme Greed,’ a market top might be near, or conversely, by the time it hits ‘Extreme Fear,’ the bottom might have already passed. Primarily Bitcoin-Centric: While it considers the broader market, its calculations are heavily weighted towards Bitcoin’s performance and data. This means it might not perfectly reflect the sentiment for specific altcoins or niche sectors of the crypto market. Doesn’t Account for Macro Events: Sudden, unforeseen global economic shifts, regulatory crackdowns, or black swan events can dramatically impact the market regardless of the index’s current reading. The index reacts to these events, but doesn’t predict them. Psychological Biases Persist: Even with the index, individual investors are still prone to their own biases. Knowing the market is ‘greedy’ doesn’t automatically prevent one from succumbing to FOMO or making impulsive decisions. Therefore, use the index as a complementary tool alongside your own fundamental analysis of projects, technical analysis of price charts, and awareness of broader economic and regulatory landscapes. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Conclusion: Empowering Your Crypto Journey The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear signal of an increasingly optimistic crypto market sentiment . Driven by factors like sustained market momentum , controlled cryptocurrency volatility , and strong Bitcoin dominance , this surge in confidence presents both opportunities and potential pitfalls. While the excitement is palpable, smart investors will use this information to inform their strategies, rather than being swept away by emotion. Understanding the underlying components of the index, and acknowledging its limitations, empowers you to make more informed decisions in this dynamic and exhilarating market.

Since then, the sellers have remained in control of the price , pushing it back down toward the $0.57 level, where mounting support has begun to form. If this level holds, then it could carry some bullish implications for the cryptocurrency. Cardano Breaking Out Of Descending Triangle One setback that has plagued the Cardano price over the last few months is the fact that following the sell-offs, the altcoin found itself inside a descending triangle. This descending triangle has now persisted for months as the cryptocurrency continues to trade within it, according to crypto analyst melikatrader94 on the TradingView website. The analysis focuses on the Cardano price being unable to break out of this big descending triangle over the last few months, leading to its suppressed price action. The analyst even pointed out the March rally, but explained that this was a breakout that eventually failed. This meant that Cardano continued to trade inside this bearish descending triangle . Fast forward to the present, though, and things seem to be looking up for the altcoin. The analyst pointed out that it is now showing some bullish divergence on the chart , which is usually evidence that sellers are running out of steam and buyers are starting to catch up. As a result, the support has been mounting above $0.57, and bulls have held quite strong. Now, if this support continues to hold, the crypto analyst predicts that the Cardano price could see another leg-up . The initial targets remain conservative at $0.67-$0.70. Nevertheless, hitting these targets would mean that the bulls are starting to take back control of the price. The Bearish Thesis For ADA Just as there is a bullish scenario for the Cardano price, there is also the possibility that it doesn’t go as expected. There is an invalidation level for this forecast, and that lies at the $0.53 support. This level has already proven to be a strong support point for Cardano. Thus, losing it to the bears would trigger further price crashes. Melikatrader explains that if this $0.53 level fails, then the entire setup is actually off the table . It would mean a continuation of trading inside the descending triangle, with much lower targets as the triangle continues to widen in the absence of a breakout.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-price-seller-0-57/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano Price",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T06:27:08,"How Will Bitcoin Perform in the Second Half of the Year? Will It Rise or Fall? Experts Answer","Some investors expect Bitcoin to break out of its consolidation phase and reach new record highs in the second half of the year. Behind this optimistic expectation are the acceleration of corporate treasury purchases, strong cash inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and cryptocurrency legislation advancing in the US Congress. Bitcoin rose nearly 30% in the second quarter, but the period has been labeled “consolidation.” Bitcoin’s gains have diminished month-on-month after trading in a narrow price range for three months. The cryptocurrency gained 15% in the first half of the year, a more subdued performance compared to the 45% rise in the same period last year. But analysts say the real rise may be starting now. Bitcoin, which had largely traded above $100,000 since May 9, was trading at $108,000 today, about 3% below the record of $111,999 reached in May. “We are still seeing an acceleration in ETF adoption. Institutional treasuries are just starting to develop Bitcoin strategies, and we expect more money to flow through these channels,” said Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens Bank. According to Ryan, there is increasing individual and institutional interest in Bitcoin, and this trend points to strong upside potential. Another element that plays a significant role in this rise is “Bitcoin treasury companies.” Firms like Nakamoto, Twenty One and Strive Asset Management are raising capital to buy Bitcoin through stock issuances by merging with public companies. “There are mergers that are pending SEC approval. So there is a lot more money waiting to buy Bitcoin that hasn’t bought yet,” said Steven Lubka, Vice President of Investor Relations at Nakamoto. Related News: Watch Out: Many Economic Developments and Altcoin Events in the Coming Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Lubka says that not only institutional demand, but also new fiscal stimulus expected from Washington and record-breaking stock markets will contribute to Bitcoin’s rise. “On the one hand, Bitcoin is becoming a more mature asset class, and on the other hand, a large amount of capital is flowing into this area with the financialization process,” Lubka says, arguing that the current administration’s positive attitude towards Bitcoin will also be a major catalyst. According to Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, regulatory developments in the US could also support Bitcoin for the rest of the year. Markets could price in expectations of an earlier rate cut if President Donald Trump appoints a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Additionally, the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill expected to pass Congress, could boost interest in Bitcoin, especially among individual investors. Kendrick noted that some investors may be concerned about Bitcoin’s four-year cycle toward the end of September. Noting that previous cycles have seen prices fall about 18 months after each halving, Kendrick said institutional inflows could offset those effects this time around. Bitcoin could reach $135,000 by the end of the third quarter and $200,000 by the end of the year, according to Standard Chartered’s estimate. “Once the market gets over these cyclical fears, we expect Bitcoin to continue its rise,” Kendrick said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T06:20:39,"Trump Trade Deals: Unveiling the Crucial Impact of August 1st Tariff Increases","BitcoinWorld Trump Trade Deals: Unveiling the Crucial Impact of August 1st Tariff Increases Cryptocurrency Markets are often highly sensitive to shifts in global economics and geopolitics. When significant announcements emerge from major political figures, the digital asset space takes notice. Recently, former U.S. President Donald Trump made a statement that has captured attention: new trade agreements have been established, and importantly, tariffs on other countries are set to increase starting August 1st. This declaration, reported by Watcher Guru on X, could signal a renewed focus on protectionist trade measures, potentially sending ripples across the global economy and, by extension, influencing your crypto portfolio. Let’s delve into the implications of this significant Trade Policy Update . Unpacking the Latest Trump Trade Deals Announcement The announcement from Donald Trump regarding new trade agreements and impending Tariff Increases on August 1st comes at a pivotal time for the global economy. While specific details of these ‘new trade deals’ were not immediately elaborated upon in the initial report, the mere mention suggests a potential shift in international economic relations. Trump’s past presidency was characterized by an assertive approach to trade, marked by the imposition of tariffs on goods from countries like China and the renegotiation of existing agreements such as NAFTA (rebranded as USMCA). This latest statement, if implemented, could indicate a return to a more protectionist stance, aiming to prioritize domestic industries and potentially reshape supply chains. For businesses and consumers globally, such a move could introduce new costs and complexities. The uncertainty surrounding these potential actions often translates into market volatility, which is something that Cryptocurrency Markets , known for their sensitivity to external economic factors, tend to react to. Understanding the broader context of these proposed Trump Trade Deals is essential for anticipating their economic fallout. The Mechanics of Tariff Increases: What Does August 1st Mean for You? Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. Governments use them for various reasons: to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, to generate revenue, or as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations. When a country imposes Tariff Increases , it makes imported goods more expensive, which can have several direct and indirect consequences: Higher Consumer Prices: Businesses often pass on the increased cost of tariffs to consumers, leading to higher prices for goods ranging from electronics to clothing. Disruption of Supply Chains: Companies that rely on imported components or raw materials may face increased costs or be forced to seek new suppliers, leading to supply chain inefficiencies. Retaliatory Tariffs: Countries targeted by tariffs may impose their own tariffs in response, escalating trade disputes into full-blown trade wars. This can further complicate international trade and hurt export-oriented industries. Reduced Trade Volume: The overall volume of international trade may decrease as goods become more expensive or less competitive across borders. The August 1st deadline provides a specific timeline for businesses to prepare for these changes. Companies may scramble to import goods before the deadline or adjust their sourcing strategies. The anticipation of these increases can create market jitters, influencing investor behavior across traditional financial markets and potentially spilling over into the Cryptocurrency Markets . Analyzing the Global Economic Impact on Traditional Markets Any significant Trade Policy Update , particularly one involving widespread Tariff Increases , has the potential to create a substantial Global Economic Impact . Historically, trade wars have been shown to slow economic growth, increase inflation, and reduce corporate profits. Here’s how such policies typically affect traditional markets: Stock Market Volatility: Industries heavily reliant on international trade, such as manufacturing, technology, and automotive, can see their stock prices fluctuate significantly. Investor confidence can erode, leading to broader market sell-offs. Currency Fluctuations: Trade tensions can lead to currency depreciation or appreciation as investors react to perceived economic strengths or weaknesses of different nations. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which can contribute to overall inflation within an economy. Central banks might then face difficult decisions regarding interest rates. Reduced Global Growth: A prolonged period of trade disputes can dampen global economic growth by disrupting supply chains, reducing investment, and creating uncertainty. For example, during previous trade disputes, companies often reported lower earnings due to increased costs and reduced demand. This broad economic uncertainty can lead investors to seek safe-haven assets, or conversely, to pull back from riskier investments, a trend that directly influences the sentiment within Cryptocurrency Markets . The Ripple Effect: How Trump’s Trade Policy Update Could Influence Cryptocurrency Markets The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that significant economic shifts, such as those caused by a major Trade Policy Update , inevitably find their way to the crypto space. While digital assets often operate independently of traditional banking systems, they are not immune to macroeconomic forces. Here’s how Trump’s announcement could impact Cryptocurrency Markets : Increased Volatility: Economic uncertainty often translates to increased volatility in crypto. Investors may move funds in or out of digital assets based on their risk appetite during turbulent times. Safe-Haven Narrative Revisited: Bitcoin has, at times, been touted as a digital safe haven, similar to gold. In periods of geopolitical or economic instability, some investors might flock to Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market downturns or currency devaluation. However, this narrative is not always consistent, and Bitcoin can also experience sell-offs during broad market fear. Capital Flows: As traditional markets react to Tariff Increases and trade disputes, capital may shift. Some investors might move funds into crypto if they perceive it as a viable alternative or a way to escape inflation in fiat currencies. Conversely, if economic downturns are severe, liquidity crunches could lead to sell-offs in all asset classes, including crypto. Impact on Stablecoins and CBDCs: Heightened trade tensions could accelerate discussions around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as nations seek more control over their financial systems. Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the U.S. dollar, might see increased usage as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance, though their stability could also be tested if the underlying fiat currency experiences significant pressure. The overall sentiment driven by a potential trade war can lead to unpredictable movements. Digital asset investors should monitor not just crypto-specific news but also global economic indicators. Navigating Potential Tariff Increases: Strategies for Digital Asset Holders Given the potential for a renewed focus on Tariff Increases and their broader economic implications, what can digital asset holders do to navigate this environment? Proactive measures can help mitigate risks and potentially identify opportunities: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, trade negotiations, and economic indicators. Reliable news sources like Watcher Guru and other financial news outlets are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: While tempting to go all-in on a single asset, a diversified crypto portfolio can help spread risk. Consider a mix of established assets (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) and potentially some altcoins with strong fundamentals. Understand Risk Tolerance: Before making any moves, assess your personal risk tolerance. Trade wars can lead to significant market swings, and it’s important to only invest what you are comfortable losing. Consider Stablecoins: During periods of high volatility, parking some capital in stablecoins can offer a temporary refuge from market fluctuations, allowing you to re-enter when conditions stabilize or opportunities arise. Long-Term Perspective: For many crypto investors, a long-term strategy often weathers short-term market turbulence better. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends rather than daily price movements driven by macroeconomic headlines. The impact of these proposed Trump Trade Deals will unfold over time, and a well-informed, strategic approach is key for anyone involved in Cryptocurrency Markets . What’s Next for Global Trade and Your Digital Assets? The announcement from Donald Trump about new trade deals and Tariff Increases set for August 1st introduces a fresh layer of uncertainty into the global economic landscape. While the precise details and full scope of these actions remain to be seen, their potential to create a significant Global Economic Impact is undeniable. From disrupted supply chains to shifts in investor sentiment, the ripple effects will be felt across traditional markets and, crucially, within Cryptocurrency Markets . As digital asset holders, understanding this evolving Trade Policy Update is not just academic; it’s practical. The interconnectedness of global finance means that even news about trade agreements can influence the volatility and direction of your crypto investments. Staying vigilant, diversifying your portfolio, and maintaining a long-term perspective will be vital strategies as these economic narratives continue to develop. The coming months will reveal the true extent of these trade adjustments and how the resilient world of digital assets adapts to them.

2025-07-07T06:10:38,"UAE Golden Visa: Crucial Reports Debunked for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld UAE Golden Visa: Crucial Reports Debunked for Crypto Investors The world of digital assets is constantly buzzing with innovation, investment, and, sometimes, misinformation. Recently, a particular rumor sent ripples through the global cryptocurrency community: the tantalizing prospect of securing a coveted UAE Golden Visa simply by holding virtual assets. This idea, which promised long-term residency in one of the world’s most dynamic economic hubs for crypto investors, understandably captured widespread attention. However, official sources in the United Arab Emirates have now stepped forward to set the record straight. The Emirates News Agency reported a joint statement from the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), unequivocally dismissing these online reports as false. This crucial clarification emphasizes that eligibility for the Golden Visa is based on specific, official criteria that currently do not include crypto investors. So, what does this mean for the crypto community, and what are the actual pathways to living and working in the UAE? Understanding the Prestigious UAE Golden Visa Program Before diving deeper into the denial, it’s essential to understand what the UAE Golden Visa truly represents. Launched in 2019, this long-term residence permit is a cornerstone of the UAE’s strategy to attract global talent, investors, and entrepreneurs. It allows foreign nationals to live, work, or study in the UAE with significant benefits, including: Long-term Residency: Visas are typically issued for 5 or 10 years, renewable automatically. Self-Sponsorship: Holders do not require a national sponsor for their visa. Family Inclusion: The visa extends to family members, including spouses and children, and even executive directors and advisors. Freedom of Movement: Holders can stay outside the UAE for extended periods without their visa being invalidated. Exclusive Benefits: These can include special discounts, health services, and other perks designed to enhance the quality of life for long-term residents. The program is designed to attract individuals who can contribute significantly to the UAE’s economy and society. Current eligibility categories typically include: Investors (in public investments, real estate) Entrepreneurs Specialized Talents (doctors, scientists, artists, athletes, innovators) Outstanding Students and Graduates Humanitarian Pioneers Frontline Heroes The emphasis is on tangible contributions, established wealth in traditional assets, or recognized expertise in critical sectors. Debunking the Myth: What This Means for Crypto Investors UAE The recent denial by the ICP, SCA, and VARA serves as a critical reminder that while the UAE is indeed a progressive hub for virtual assets, its residency programs operate under distinct, established guidelines. The joint statement was clear: ‘golden visas are granted based on official criteria that exclude crypto investors.’ Why did this rumor gain traction? It’s likely a confluence of factors: UAE’s Crypto-Friendly Image: The UAE, particularly Dubai, has actively positioned itself as a global leader in the virtual assets space, attracting major crypto firms and fostering innovation. This positive reputation might have led to assumptions about broader benefits for crypto holders. Desire for Residency: Many crypto investors, seeking favorable regulatory environments and high-quality living standards, naturally look towards jurisdictions like the UAE. Misinterpretation of Policies: Some might have confused the UAE’s support for virtual asset businesses and innovation with direct visa pathways for individual crypto wealth. It’s important to differentiate between the UAE’s forward-thinking approach to regulating virtual assets as an industry and the specific criteria for immigration. While the nation welcomes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and fosters a vibrant ecosystem, this does not automatically translate into golden visa eligibility based solely on crypto holdings. Navigating the Dubai Crypto Landscape: A Hub, But With Rules Despite the golden visa clarification, the UAE’s commitment to becoming a leading global hub for virtual assets remains unwavering. Dubai Crypto initiatives, in particular, have garnered international acclaim. Entities like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), established in Dubai, are at the forefront of creating a robust and clear regulatory framework for virtual assets. This includes: Licensing Frameworks: VARA issues licenses for various virtual asset activities, including exchanges, broker-dealers, and custody services. Investor Protection: Regulations aim to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Innovation Support: The framework seeks to foster innovation while managing risks. The UAE’s strategy is to attract legitimate virtual asset businesses and talent, encouraging them to set up operations within its jurisdiction. This creates jobs, stimulates the economy, and positions the UAE as a digital economy leader. However, this support for the industry is distinct from individual immigration policies. Investors looking to participate in the Dubai Crypto scene can certainly do so, but their path to residency will follow established immigration channels, not necessarily through their digital asset portfolios directly. Understanding Virtual Assets Regulation in the UAE The role of VARA, alongside the SCA and ICP, in issuing this joint statement highlights the coordinated effort by UAE authorities to provide clarity and prevent misinformation. The robust framework for Virtual Assets Regulation is a testament to the UAE’s methodical approach: The UAE’s approach to virtual assets is multifaceted, aiming to balance innovation with investor protection and financial stability. This comprehensive regulatory environment, rather than a loose interpretation of visa rules, is what truly defines the UAE’s stance on crypto. Legitimate UAE Residency Requirements for Aspiring Expats For individuals, including crypto investors, who aspire to live and work in the UAE, there are numerous established and legitimate pathways to residency. It’s vital to focus on these official routes rather than unverified rumors. Common UAE Residency Requirements include: Employment Visa: Obtaining a job with a UAE-based company is one of the most common ways to secure residency. Property Investor Visa: Investing in real estate above a certain value (typically AED 750,000 or AED 2 million, depending on the visa type) can qualify for a long-term residency. Entrepreneur Visa: Individuals who establish a new business in the UAE that meets specific criteria can apply for this visa. Freelance Visa: Dubai offers a specific freelance visa for certain professions, allowing individuals to work independently. Retirement Visa: For those over 55 who meet specific financial criteria. Student Visa: For individuals enrolled in accredited educational institutions in the UAE. For crypto investors specifically, if their wealth is primarily in virtual assets, they would need to convert these assets into a form that meets the criteria for existing visa categories, such as investing in qualifying real estate or establishing a legitimate, licensed business in the UAE that aligns with entrepreneurial visa requirements. Simply holding crypto assets does not, at present, qualify one for a Golden Visa. Conclusion: Clarity in a Dynamic Landscape The recent denial by UAE authorities regarding golden visas for crypto investors serves as a vital reminder to always seek information from official and verified sources. While the UAE remains a pioneering force in the global virtual assets landscape, attracting businesses and fostering innovation through clear Virtual Assets Regulation , its residency programs operate under specific, established criteria. The UAE Golden Visa is a prestigious offering designed for specific categories of individuals, and currently, holding cryptocurrencies is not a direct pathway to eligibility. For aspiring expats and Crypto Investors UAE -bound, the message is clear: explore the many legitimate avenues for residency, such as employment, traditional investment, or entrepreneurship. The UAE continues to be a welcoming and dynamic environment, but navigating its opportunities requires adherence to its well-defined rules and regulations.

Key Takeaways: Metaplanet bought 2,205 BTC, raising total holdings to 15,555 BTC worth $1.7 billion. BTC Yield jumped 15.1% in one week, adding 2,017 BTC valued at 31.7 billion yen. The firm’s Bitcoin treasury has quadrupled since March, reflecting an aggressive accumulation strategy. The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield Jumps 15.1%, Adds 2,017 BTC in a Week According to company disclosures, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a key metric tracking the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share, rose 15.1% between July 1 and July 7, adding 2,017 BTC worth 31.7 billion yen in the quarter-to-date period. BTC Yield highlights the net Bitcoin growth relative to share dilution, which the firm views as a measure of shareholder accretion. Metaplanet’s steady Bitcoin purchases have been funded through a mix of capital market activities and operating income. Notably, the company executed an early redemption of 6 billion yen from a recent bond issuance, repaying investors with proceeds raised from recent stock acquisition rights exercises. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin buying spree has outpaced traditional corporate approaches to digital assets. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 2,205 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 15,555 BTC* pic.twitter.com/VqKGOwCs6N — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 7, 2025 Since early 2025, Metaplanet has expanded its holdings from under 4,000 BTC in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, quadrupling its position in just four months. The company’s Bitcoin-focused strategy mirrors moves by U.S.-based Strategy but on a Japanese scale. “Metaplanet has acquired 2,205 BTC for ~$238.7 million at ~$108,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 416.6% YTD 2025. As of 7/7/2025, we hold 15,555 $BTC acquired for ~$1.54 billion at ~$99,307 per bitcoin,” CEO Simon Gerovich said in a recent post on X . Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows at least 21 new entities added BTC holdings in the past month alone. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

The latest purchase was made at an average price of 15.64 million yen per bitcoin, totaling approximately 34.49 billion yen ($213 million). That pushes Metaplanet’s aggregate BTC investment to 225.82 billion yen ($1.38 billion), with a blended average purchase price of 14.52 million yen per BTC. Metaplanet utilizes a custom metric, called BTC Yield, to track shareholder value in relation to dilution.

2025-07-07T05:54:21,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2030: Analyst Predicts Pi Coin Could Hit $1,000","The post Pi Network Price Prediction 2030: Analyst Predicts Pi Coin Could Hit $1,000 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network, the mobile mining project that turned millions into casual crypto miners once again in the spotlight after Pi Coin reaching a value of $1,000 is catching fire again, this time, with research backing from Bitget Global. As one of the world’s largest crypto trading platforms, Bitget has offered a long-term prediction that could surprise even the most optimistic Pi supporters. But is $1,000 really possible? Let’s break it down. Bitget’s Bullish 2030 Prediction According to Bitget Global Research , Pi Coins could climb to $500–$1,000 or more by 2030—but only if a few big things fall into place. This isn’t just a hopeful guess, the forecast is based on the idea that Pi Network becomes a global digital payment platform used for DeFi, shopping, and everyday transactions. To get there, the network needs mass adoption, not just hype. What Needs to Happen? For Pi to reach those heights, five major things must happen or else Bitget says without these, Pi’s price could stay flat, or even drop. Real World Use: Pi needs to become a payment option for everyday transactions, not just in theory, but in stores and platforms globally. Big Partnerships: Collaborating with well-known brands and blockchain players will help Pi gain credibility. User Activity: Growth alone isn’t enough. Millions must actually use the apps and tools built on Pi. Strong Tech: The blockchain must be fast, secure, and scalable to support heavy usage. Utility Over Hype: An open and functioning mainnet is key to moving beyond speculation. Meanwhile, Pi has to prove it’s more than a speculative token, it must offer real solutions. [post_titles_links postid=”479140″] Analysis: Bold, But Not Impossible Bitget analysis suggests that it sounds like a big dream, but crypto history is full of surprises. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum also started with doubters, and look where they are now. As Bitget puts it, real adoption creates real value, and if Pi can offer real-world use, $1,000 by 2030 may not be that impossible. For now, Pi Coin’s future lies in the hands of its core team and loyal “Pioneers.” [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Will Pi Network’s Pi Coin ever be worth money? Yes, Pi Coin is already trading and has a market value, currently around $0.46 USD (July 2025). Its potential for significant future worth depends on widespread real-world utility, major exchange listings, and continued ecosystem development. Does the Pi Network have a long-term future? The Pi Network has a potential future if it achieves mass adoption for everyday transactions, secures major partnerships, maintains active user engagement, develops robust and scalable technology, and demonstrates genuine utility beyond mere speculation. Its recent Open Mainnet launch is a step forward. Can Pi Coin realistically reach $1,000 in value? While Bitget Global Research predicts Pi Coin could reach $500–$1,000 or more by 2030, this is considered an optimistic forecast. It hinges on unprecedented global adoption, extensive real-world use cases, and strong market demand. Many other predictions are more conservative, ranging from a few dollars to a few hundred.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-price-prediction-2030-bitget-predicts-pi-coin-could-hit-1000/,"EXCHANGE|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|RESEARCH|BTC","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-07T05:51:08,"U.S. Secret Service Releases Data on Cryptocurrency Fraud for the First Time – Warning Issued","The United States Secret Service is ramping up its global crackdown on cryptocurrency scams that have proliferated around the world. The efforts center on sophisticated fraudulent schemes that trick victims into paying small profits and then losing their fortunes through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has seized nearly $400 million worth of digital assets over the past decade, a figure that has not been previously made public. The team uses software, subpoenas and patience to track down digital crimes, not guns or badges. “They send you a photo of a young person, but in reality it's probably an old man in Russia,” GIOC analyst Jamie Lam told a meeting in Bermuda last month, explaining how the scams start: “They send you a photo of someone who looks like they're a young person, but in reality it's probably an old man in Russia.” Fake investment sites offer victims small profits, then disappear as investments grow. Related News: Watch Out: Many Economic Developments and Altcoin Events in the Coming Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List The team can track down the criminals by tracking down the domains of fake platforms, crypto wallets, and sometimes IP addresses leaked through VPN errors. “Sometimes it just takes patience,” Lam says. “Victims often think they see opportunity. They think they’re safe when they use Bitcoin, but that’s not true,” Smith said during training in Bermuda. Bermuda Governor Andrew Murdoch warned: “Technology is great for economic growth, but it’s also open to abuse. You have to have strong investigative powers.” According to FBI data, of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime reported in the US in 2024, $9.3 billion was related to crypto. The elderly suffered the most losses, losing $2.8 billion to fake investment sites alone. The Secret Service is working closely with industry partners to recover stolen funds. Coinbase and Tether have assisted with wallet analysis and asset freezes in some cases. One scam in which $225 million in USDT was recovered was among the largest recoveries ever. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-07T05:48:05,"“Fiat Is Hopeless”: Elon Musk Says ‘America Party’ Will Embrace Bitcoin","Elon Musk has proposed his new political vehicle ‘America Party’, amid a feud with President Trump, confirming that the alternative to the Democratic-Republican duopoly will support Bitcoin. The Tesla CEO, in a thread on X, confirmed that the party will embrace Bitcoin, calling fiat as “hopeless.” Fiat is hopeless, so yes — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2025 Musk first confirmed the formation of his new political party on Saturday, following a poll on X. He said that the America Party would address the consistent rise in debts, which has been present irrespective of whichever party is in power. “The America Party is needed to fight the Republican/Democrat Uniparty,” he wrote to his 221.8 million followers . Musk criticised Trump’s 940-page “Big, Beautiful Bill“, which proposes tax breaks and sweeping cuts, warning of job loss and strategic harm, sparking conflict with the Trump administration. “When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” he wrote on another thread. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.” Meanwhile, Trump posted on Truth Social that a third political party has never succeeded in the United States. He said that Elon Musk has gone completely “off the rails,” becoming a ‘TRAIN WRECK’ in the past weeks. Elon Musk America Party and Bitcoin Relationship – What it Means for BTC Musk noted that his party would support Bitcoin and focus on House and Senate races. Following his confirmation, Bitcoin jumped from $108,735.07 to $109,361.29 and is currently trading at $109.16K at press time. Musk has expressed a long-standing opinion about various cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin and Dogecoin, since 2014. One user called it a “ huge signal ” for Bitcoin, given Musk’s influence on the industry and current backing of BTC on a political level. Further, the community has been speculating over Elon Musk staking Bitcoin silently. The buzz started on July 2, when the crypto-focused handle on X pointed out Musk’s silence on Bitcoin lately. Another user suggested that perhaps Musk was just “ quietly stacking BTC .” The post “Fiat Is Hopeless”: Elon Musk Says ‘America Party’ Will Embrace Bitcoin appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/fiat-is-hopeless-elon-musk-says-america-party-will-back-bitcoin/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|DOGE|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Elon Musk|Politics",cryptocompare
