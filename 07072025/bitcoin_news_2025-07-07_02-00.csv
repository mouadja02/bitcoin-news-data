2025-07-06T23:40:03,"Ondo & Hyperliquid Shine on Infrastructure; XYZVerse Captures Meme-Momentum Amid BTC Bull","As Bitcoin experiences a significant uptick, notable projects in the digital asset realm are emerging at the forefront. Infrastructure platforms are gaining prominence for their groundbreaking solutions, while a fresh player is capturing attention through viral trends. This piece delves into how these entities are influencing the market during this bullish surge. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse‚Äôs potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project‚Äôs estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings ‚Äì If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth ‚Äì Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions ‚Äì If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Hyperliquid: Revolutionizing DeFi with Speed and Zero Fees Hyperliquid is a new blockchain platform transforming decentralized finance (DeFi). It has built its own Layer 1 blockchain from the ground up, focusing on speed and scalability. With its unique HyperBFT consensus mechanism, transactions are fast and secure. A standout feature is its decentralized exchange for perpetual futures trading without gas fees. This means users can trade quickly without extra costs. What sets Hyperliquid apart is its fully on-chain order book, offering more transparency and security. The team behind it comes from top institutions like Harvard, Caltech, and MIT, bringing a wealth of expertise.

Its focus on efficiency and transparency sets it apart in the DeFi space. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain for All Ondo Finance is changing how people access financial products. By blending the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology, Ondo tokenizes stable, income-generating real-world assets. This means high-grade financial products become accessible to more people. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products, and a technology arm that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Together, they enhance the functionality and scalability of Ondo's offerings, making them more efficient and accessible. In today's market, where trust and security are important, Ondo stands out. It works with reputable partners like BlackRock and uses Coinbase for asset custody. Their product, USDY, combines the stability of a stablecoin with the added benefit of yield, backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. This approach provides non-US investors with high-quality, regulated, and transparent financial products. While many cryptocurrencies face ups and downs, Ondo's focus on real-world assets and compliance could make it an attractive option for those interested in both traditional finance and blockchain innovation. Conclusion Though HYPE and ONDO have merit, XYZVerse distinguishes itself as a sports-focused memecoin targeting massive growth and community engagement, potentially becoming a cultural icon.

2025-07-06T22:00:04,"Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Mike Novogratz Issues Bold Bitcoin Call","Mike Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has made a bold call to investors in the cryptocurrency space. In response to a post on X, Novogratz claimed that there is growing pressure on Jerome Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. This, he maintained, could impact the country‚Äôs fiat currency value, hence the need to invest in crypto. Mike Novogratz On Political Interference and Bitcoin as Safe Haven Notably, Novogratz says market participants need to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, as a hedge. He believes that Bitcoin will serve as a safe haven asset for investors if the U.S. dollar weakens due to political pressure on Powell or reckless monetary policy. Given that Bitcoin is decentralized with a limited supply, Novogratz has urged investors to ‚ÄúBuy BTC‚Äù as it will become more valuable in the future. According to the Bitcoin advocate, Bill Pulte‚Äôs call for Powell‚Äôs removal from office, an influential figure with political clout, will not end well. He considers the call to be heading in a financially dangerous direction. Primarily, Novogratz believes that politicizing the Federal Reserve could lead to rate cuts that would negatively impact the dollar. However, such a move to undermine the Fed supports his advocacy for Bitcoin. Is Political Tensions Threatening the Fed‚Äôs Independence? For clarity, Jerome Powell‚Äôs reluctance to further cut interest rates has sparked hostility towards him. Some Republicans in the U.S. are calling for his resignation . This includes Bill Pulte, who claims there is evidence incriminating Powell. Regardless, Novogratz considers the allegations against Powell as characteristic of a ‚Äú Banana Republic move ‚Äù which could further weaken the nation‚Äôs currency. According to Novogratz, potentially, the move could reduce confidence in U.S. institutions or trigger political instability. Powell had earlier emphasized that interest rate decisions must be based on facts and data, not political predispositions. Amid mounting pressure, some in the financial sector have argued that if Powell gives in, it could compromise the Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence. Community Reacts to Novogratz‚Äôs Call However, reactions have trailed Novogratz‚Äôs post on social media. A user, John Lilic, opines that nothing justifies using $2.5 billion for a renovation. Another user, Jefferson, alleged that Powell was not factual with Congress on the renovation and might face grave issues.

2025-07-06T21:45:00,"Bulls vs. Bears: Institutions Pile Up BTC But Price Doesn‚Äôt go up, Why?","Over the last thirty days, many institutions have been loading up their bitcoin (BTC) bags. However, these purchases have had no major impact on the price of the leading digital asset. This has sparked concerns among market participants. Many are wondering why BTC has been stuck within a tight range since it hit an all-time high (ATH) in late May. A recent report by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed the reason for the weak price momentum despite persistent institutional demand, which analysts say is currently not enough. BTC Stalls Despite Institutional Demand According to CryptoQuant, BTC purchases from U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries belonging to firms like Strategy have declined this year compared to the period from November to December 2024. ETF purchases have decreased from 86,000 BTC in early December to 71,000 BTC in mid-May, and are currently at 40,000 BTC. The trend represents a 53% decline over this period. At the same time, Strategy‚Äôs acquisitions have also dropped from 171,000 BTC in December to 16,000 BTC currently. This shows a 90% plunge over the period. Although institutional purchases and ETF flows have kept BTC above $100,000 for a while, further declines could slow price gains. This could be exacerbated by the fact that ETF and institutional buys represent a fraction of the overall BTC demand, which seems to be contracting. At the market‚Äôs peak in December, ETF and institutional purchases represented 33% of total Bitcoin demand growth. These entities purchased no more than 257,000 BTC out of the total 771,000 BTC. This indicated that the Bitcoin market had a bigger and unobservable demand coming from other sources. Overall Demand is Contracting Currently, the overall demand for BTC is contracting , having declined by 895,000 BTC over the last 30 days. This metric needs to expand for a sustainable price rally to occur. However, the demand level from institutions right now is not enough to trigger that expansion. CryptoQuant stated that Bitcoin‚Äôs annual growth chart reflects how ETF and institutional purchases account for only a portion of demand. Apparent demand has also contracted by 857,000 BTC, significantly offsetting the expansion of ETF and institutional demand (377,000 BTC and 371,000 BTC, respectively). ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that ETFs and MSTR‚Äôs Bitcoin purchase, while overall positive for Bitcoin price gains, are not sufficient to drive prices to fresh all-time highs,‚Äù the market intelligence firm added.

2025-07-06T21:30:15,"XRP Eyes Breakout As Analysts Predict Rally Alongside Real-World Adoption","Despite its choppy price action in the past seven days, the mood in the XRP camp is increasingly bullish. Particularly, XRP is witnessing a wave of bold predictions from several top crypto analysts. This comes just as a major real-world asset tokenization project promises to increase demand and utility for XRP on a global scale by tokenizing $200 million worth of assets on the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs True Value Is Higher Than $110,000, Expert Warns Not Bullish Enough On XRP? Crypto analyst CrediBULL is pushing a bold message to the XRP community: the market is still underestimating the altcoin‚Äôs bullish setup. In a post on social media platform X, he noted that XRP is currently going on its eighth month of consolidation above its previous all-time high monthly close, which is a feat that few assets in the market can match. He pointed to this extended sideways movement, especially after a strong impulse off the $0.50 level in late 2024, as evidence that XRP is preparing for a continuation of the breakout. Notably, its monthly candlestick chart shows a tight cluster of monthly candles hovering above the $2.00 range. According to CrediBULL, this structure is one of the cleanest in the crypto space, second only to Bitcoin. Image From X: CrediBULL Another major contributor to the current bullish narrative is an analyst known as Ripple Pundit, who projected a 35,000% price surge for XRP the moment Ripple announces a banking license. In his post on the social media platform, he predicted that a regulatory greenlight and the final resolution of XRP‚Äôs regulatory overhang with the SEC could trigger a significant increase in price. Similarly, market commentator SMQKE drew attention to the explosive XRP price surge in late 2017 and early 2018, during which Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen briefly became one of the wealthiest individuals in the world due to XRP‚Äôs quick rally from $0.00065 to $2.5. SMQKE noted that the last cycle was merely a glimpse of what‚Äôs coming. The next wave of adoption will be global, fully regulated, and built for scale. In his words, ‚Äú2018 was just a warm-up.‚Äù Technical analyst Ali Martinez added further credibility to the bullish case by pointing out the $2.38 level as the next major resistance. This is based on on-chain data from Glassnode‚Äôs UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which shows a significant XRP volume concentrated at this price level. If XRP manages to clear this area with strong volume, it would not only overcome heavy resistance but also trigger a cascade of buying interest and a major rally. Image From X: @ali_charts Mercado Bitcoin Tokenization Deal On XRPL XRP‚Äôs underlying utility is also gaining traction beyond price charts and predictions. Mercado Bitcoin, one of Latin America‚Äôs largest digital asset platforms, recently announced plans to tokenize over $200 million worth of real-world assets (including fixed income and equity instruments) directly on the XRP Ledger.

2025-07-06T20:10:00,"Vitalik Buterin Proposes Gas Cap to Strengthen Ethereum Security and Stability","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrst√§tter have put forward a new proposal, EIP-7983, which tries to cap the gas usage per transaction at 16.77 million units. The proposal is proposed to make Ethereum more robust against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, increase stability, and enable higher compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Why Ethereum Needs a Gas Cap With Ethereum‚Äôs current configuration, one transaction may exhaust the entire block‚Äôs gas limit. This makes it a vulnerability wherein one high-demand transaction can jeopardize the network by tying up resources, raising DoS vulnerability and uncertainty. The proposed EIP-7983 attempts to do this by setting a hard cap of 16.77 million gas (2¬≤‚Å¥) per transaction. ‚ÄúBy doing so, Ethereum can raise its resistance to some DoS vectors,‚Äù the proposal states. Impact on zkVMs and Network Efficiency The proposed limit is not just a security issue‚Äîit‚Äôs an issue of licensing as well. EIP-7983 will contribute to increasing Ethereum‚Äôs compatibility with zkVMs by encouraging developers to split large transactions into small, manageable transactions. Transactions requesting gas over the 16.77 million limit would be rejected at the block validation level so they would never even get onto the network. This measure operates independently of the block-level gas maximum, which remains variable at the hands of validators. Balancing Innovation and Security Buterin and Wahrst√§tter point out that 16.77 million is a conscious choice of a limit that can serve most current decentralized finance (DeFi) and contract deployment applications with the additional aim of reducing unnecessary risk. While not backward compatible for addresses above the cap, the vast majority of existing Ethereum transactions are already below the threshold, avoiding excessive disruption. EIP-7983 is the culmination of earlier work like EIP-7825, aiming to make Ethereum handling of transactions more predictable and friendlier to users. Simplifying Ethereum‚Äôs Future This concept is one of Buterin‚Äôs larger plans to simplify Ethereum. In May, he argued in favor of a simplified protocol on the lines of Bitcoin‚Äôs minimalism to make it more efficient, secure, and easier to use. His five-year plan involves simplifying Ethereum‚Äôs execution, consensus, and shared pieces. Alongside, Buterin is exploring new ideas such as ‚Äúpluralistic identity,‚Äù a digital identity system that strives to maintain privacy while enabling equal online engagement.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-gas-strengthen-ethereum/,"ETH|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Ethereum|Regulation|Web3",cryptocompare

The Russian Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office has filed a lawsuit to seize shares of billionaire Konstantin Strukov‚Äôs gold mining company, Yuzhuralzoloto, state-owned media Tass reports . Strukov, who has been a deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Chelyabinsk Region for 25 years, while also the deputy chairman of the Legislative Assembly, acquired the firm through a bankruptcy procedure. He was also the company‚Äôs CEO between 1997 and June 2001 before he became chairman of the board of directors. The government‚Äôs lawsuit alleges that Strukov violated a ban on all public officials from engaging in business activity. The rule also requires politicians to sell all their securities, shares, or stakes in companies before taking office. According to Tass, Yuzhuralzoloto produces over 450,000 ounces of gold per year, which is $1.505 billion annually with a profit of 34 billion rubles ‚Äì $432.43 million. Prosecutors allege that Strukov frequently takes profits from the mine and transfers them abroad to Montenegro, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Latvia, Estonia and Turkey where he and his family purchased houses, yachts and other luxury items. The Russian government is requesting that 100% of Strukov and his daughter‚Äôs ownership of the company be transferred to the state.

2025-07-06T20:00:00,"Sextortion and $400m in Bitcoin: Inside the Secret Service‚Äôs crypto war","Now armed with blockchain forensics instead of briefcases of cash, the U.S. Secret Service is quietly becoming one of the most sophisticated crypto crime-fighting units in the world. According to Bloomberg , its Global Investigative Operations Center has seized nearly $400 million in digital assets‚Äîstored in a single cold wallet‚Äîthrough operations targeting scams, fraud, and extortion. One recent case illustrates the agency‚Äôs evolving reach: after a teenager was sextorted for $600, agents traced the crypto through a money mule to a Nigerian national allegedly responsible for thousands of illicit transactions. The agency, led by investigative analyst Jamie Lam, specializes in digital financial crimes using software, subpoenas, and spreadsheets rather than traditional law enforcement tools. The team traces cryptocurrency fraud through domain registrations, wallet connections, and blockchain analysis. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: BitMine secures $250m, TWL Miner bags $95m Romance scams drive majority of crypto losses Americans reported $9.3 billion in cryptocurrency-related scams in 2024, accounting for more than half of the $16.6 billion in total internet crime losses reported to the FBI. Older victims suffered the largest losses at nearly $2.8 billion, primarily through fake investment platforms. The Secret Service‚Äôs Kali Smith, who directs the agency‚Äôs cryptocurrency strategy, has conducted training workshops in over 60 countries to help local law enforcement unmask digital crimes. ‚ÄúSometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‚ÄòWow, we didn‚Äôt even realize that this is occurring in our country,'‚Äù Smith said during a recent Bermuda training session. Recent cases show the agency‚Äôs investigative capabilities. An Idaho teenager received sextortion demands after sending inappropriate photos online, paying $600 before contacting police. Secret Service analysts traced payments through an American money mule to a Nigerian passport holder who had processed $4.1 million across nearly 6,000 transactions. British authorities arrested the suspected extortionist upon landing in England, where he awaits extradition. The case involved reconstructing the crime through screenshots, receipts, and blockchain data analysis.

According to Arkham‚Äôs analysis, the Bitcoin whale in question is moving its assets from the traditional ‚Äú1-‚Äù address format to the more modern and secure Bech32 address format, which starts with ‚Äúbc1q-.‚Äù This is thought to provide increased security, lower transaction fees, and long-term storage for Bitcoin users.

In a press release, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of Illinois says that former Tempo Bank senior loan officer Francis Eversman and construction company owner Gregg Crawford pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in a scheme that spanned between 2011 and 2020. Prosecutors say that Crawford recruited straw purchasers to serve as loan applicants in name only for properties that were often extremely overvalued. His brother-in-law, Eversman, would facilitate the approval process of the loans. Crawford used the proceeds of the loans for purposes other than the purchase of the properties. He also provided fake lease agreements in an effort to show rental income from the properties in question. When the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became suspicious of the loans during an audit, Crawford told a straw purchaser to provide the regulator with fraudulent information. FBI Springfield Assistant Special Agent in Charge Karen Marinos says the duo violated the people‚Äôs trust by carrying out self-serving schemes to increase their wealth. ‚ÄúEvery American citizen deserves to walk into their bank and trust the people behind the counter. In southern Illinois, these people are usually our neighbors and friends, people that we trust with our money and wellbeing. ‚Äú Eversman and Crawford will be sentenced on October 14th.

2025-07-06T18:30:56,"Ethereum Reserves On Binance Hits 2023 Level ‚Äî What Happened Last Time?","After a dismal outing in the first quarter of 2025, the price of Ethereum put up a strong resurgent performance in the subsequent three months. While its price has somewhat slowed in recent weeks, the acclaimed ‚Äúking of altcoins‚Äù is in a much better position than it was three months ago. However, Ethereum‚Äôs recently found position seems to be at risk, according to the latest on-chain revelation. Recent data shows that ETH investors seem to be moving their tokens away from long-term storage and rather onto centralized trading platforms. Bullish Perspective On Rising ETH Reserves On Binance In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst BorisVest shared that the Ethereum reserves on Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume, have been swelling over the past few weeks. According to the crypto pundit, the exchange now holds over 4% of ETH‚Äôs total circulating supply. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the Ethereum reserves on Binance have not risen to this level since May 2023. Typically, the flow of ETH tokens to centralized exchanges ‚Äî which usually offer trading services ‚Äî suggests that the assets are being positioned to be offloaded or sold into the open market. Hence, the recent surge in the Ethereum reserves on Binance is a bearish signal for the price of ETH, as it signals impending selling pressure. This means that this trend could exacerbate an ongoing price correction or trigger the beginning of downward price movement . However, BorisVest also painted a bullish picture for the Ethereum price based on this on-chain observation. ‚ÄúIf these ETH transfers are being positioned ahead of a potential rally, and price holds firm despite increasing reserves, it could indicate strong underlying demand or strategic positioning by whales,‚Äù the analyst said. Furthermore, BorisVest mentioned that the last time the Ethereum reserves on Binance rose to this level, the price of ETH dropped from $1,900 to around $1,600. However, this brief price correction was followed by a sharp, abrupt rally to the upside. The on-chain analyst also noted that the ETH price has not witnessed any major downward movement since the Binance reserves started rising, suggesting price resilience by the altcoin. Ultimately, BorisVest urged investors to stay alert as these recent exchange movements could trigger the next move for the Ethereum price .

2025-07-06T17:30:48,"NFT Market Heats Up Again as Crypto Rally Boosts Sales","The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market is showing signs of a strong comeback . After a period of slowed momentum, digital collectibles have rebounded with a 10.44% increase in total sales volume, reaching $136.5 million. This marks the second straight week of growth for the sector, signaling renewed interest among traders and collectors. Strong Crypto Prices Support NFT Growth The rise in NFT sales is coinciding with the broader crypto market‚Äôs upward trend. Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed to $108,000, while Ethereum (ETH) has also gained 3.6% over the past week. The global crypto market cap is now $3.33 trillion, higher than last week‚Äôs $3.21 trillion. This growth in top crypto assets is revitalizing the NFT sector, attracting both seasoned investors and newcomers. Although the sales volume has increased, the number of NFT transactions has dropped by nearly 20%. However, the number of buyers stayed the same, and the number of sellers increased by 8.09%. This means that fewer trades are occurring, but the trades that do take place are larger in value. Immutable Leads as Polygon Gains Ground Among all blockchains, Immutable remains the leader in NFT sales. It generated $43.9 million this week, representing a 30% increase from the previous week. Its growth continues to be helped by popular gaming collections. The platform also has very low wash trading, meaning most of the activity is real and organic. Polygon, now known as POL (formerly MATIC), moved into second place with $25 million in sales. That is a 51.53% increase from last week. However, Polygon‚Äôs wash trading rose sharply, reaching over $564,000. Ethereum blockchain dropped to third place with $22.5 million in NFT sales, a 8.63% decrease. Wash trading on Ethereum also increased slightly. Still, the Ethereum network remains one of the most used blockchains in the NFT space. Other blockchains, such as Mythos, BNB Chain, and Bitcoin, also remained active. Mythos experienced a slight increase in sales, while BNB saw a corresponding drop. The Bitcoin network reached $8.7 million in sales, representing over 12% growth. In terms of buyers, Polygon saw the highest increase, followed by Bitcoin and Mythos. Gaming NFTs are also gaining ground, with top collections like Guild of Guardians Heroes and The Courtyard seeing strong sales growth. CryptoPunks Reclaim the Spotlight CryptoPunks, one of the oldest and most well-known NFT collections , is rising again. It climbed to ninth place with $2 million in sales, and the collection has seen improvements in both activity and user interest. Some CryptoPunks were sold for very high prices. One Punk sold for 150 ETH, equivalent to approximately $389,000. Others sold for between $150,000 and $200,000. This shows that collectors are still willing to pay large amounts for rare NFTs.

2025-07-06T17:00:57,"Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High?","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has not been particularly impressive over the weekend, which has been a somewhat consistent theme of the cryptocurrency market so far in the year 2025. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $108,000 mark, showing signs of indecision amongst the investors. With the coin‚Äôs indecisive price action, the conversation has been about when the Bitcoin price will return to its all-time high. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data shows that investors are becoming increasingly confident in the long-term promise of the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio Below 1: On-Chain Analyst In a July 5 post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost revealed that Bitcoin has continued to flow out of centralized exchanges over the past few months. The online crypto pundit mentioned that this trend reflects the growing confidence of investors in the long term. Related Reading: Analyst Shares Bitcoin Cheat Sheet Showing When The Bull Run Begins This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio 30DMA, a metric that measures the volume of BTC flowing in and out of centralized exchanges over a period of 30 days. A high ratio (>1) indicates more inflows than outflows into exchanges, signaling increased selling pressure for the premier cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a low ratio (<1) implies that more coins are flowing out of rather than into centralized exchanges. When the Exchange Inflow/Outflow Ratio has a low value, it suggests that investors are accumulating and holding their coins in the long term. According to Darkfost, the Bitcoin monthly outflow/inflow ratio recently fell to around 0.9, its lowest level since the bear market of 2023. With the metric now beneath the 1 threshold, it means that Bitcoin exchange outflows are dominant, reflecting a strong and sustained demand on the spot market. The on-chain analyst said: As of today, demand remains present as outflows continue to dominate, with a growing number of long-term holders stepping in. Ultimately, Darkfost believes that the confidence being shown in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term promise is expected, considering the growing adoption by major corporations and governments, most notably in the United States. ‚ÄúBTC is gradually evolving into a store of value, increasingly used to strengthen treasury strategies,‚Äù the crypto analyst added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $108,103, reflecting a mere 0.3% increase in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-06T16:55:34,"Drake Drops New Single Comparing ‚ÄòFake Friends‚Äô to Bitcoin‚Äôs Brutal Price Swings","Drake, a renowned rapper and Bitcoin enthusiast, has dropped a new single ahead of an album release with lyrics referring to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The single is released at a time when Bitcoin‚Äôs future remains uncertain, particularly regarding regulatory support from the US government. It could very well reach an All-Time High (ATH) in the coming months. Drake‚Äôs new single addressed themes of betrayal, fake friends, and conflict. Drake released a new single titled ‚ÄúWhat did I miss‚Äù ahead of an upcoming album release. Bitcoin traders have taken a keen interest in the album due to its lyrics‚Äîthe new single references Drake‚Äôs ongoing feud with rapper Kendrick Lamar. Drake refers to his conflict with Lamar as being similar to the price volatility of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate significantly from one day to the next. Drake is also a keen gambler and has been referred to as the ‚ÄòDrake Curse‚Äô due to his unfortunate picks on UFC, NBA, among other high-profile sporting events. Blockwave, a Bitcoin hardware provider, predicted in 2022 that it would use data from previous innovations that scaled over time, such as automobiles, electricity, and the internet, to forecast Bitcoin adoption. Blockwave predicted that Bitcoin would hit 10% adoption by 2030, using the listed scalability models for technological innovation. It is estimated that Bitcoin currently has a global adoption rate of 4%, meaning that approximately 4% of the world‚Äôs population holds Bitcoin. Therefore, using a back-of-the-envelope analysis, we can safely assume that Bitcoin will double from 4% to 10%, which corresponds to a roughly 2x increase in adoption. This could lead to a 2x price increase from $100k to $200k if the scalability model of technological innovation holds. This forecast supports the Bitcoin traders who have been pointing to a $200,000 price target. Drake‚Äôs reference to Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility may be timely if the price continues to make large returns for crypto traders. Drake released the new single during a YouTube stream titled ‚ÄúICEMAN EPISODE ONE,‚Äù where the Canadian rapper addressed the issue of betrayal and feuds. In the stream, Drake plays the character of a worker on his lunch break. The song is about a friend who has betrayed his trust. He describes this as being similar to the price of Bitcoin, which sometimes serves as an ally when the price rises, but then becomes a traitor when the price falls, leaving Drake with less money. He could be describing his relationships as being similar to gambling, with one moment being on top, and then being betrayed when he is down on his luck. His lyrics describe friends who once stood by his side and now hang out with people who are his enemies. He describes friendship like the price of Bitcoin, which can fluctuate without warning. Bitcoin has been a complicated asset to forecast, changing direction within the blink of an eye and causing much suffering for traders who speculate on margin. The ‚ÄòDrake Curse‚Äô refers to the rapper‚Äôs history of taking large bets on the NBA and UFC. Drake has lost over $1 million in Bitcoin, betting on NBA games. Drake took a bet on the Dallas Mavericks taking the NBA title. He lost his $ 500,000 Bitcoin bet because the Boston Celtics beat the Mavericks. Within weeks of this failed bet, Drake bet another $500k on the Edmonton Oilers winning the NHL Cup. However, the Panthers beat the Oilers, adding another Loss to Drake‚Äôs gambling tally. Maybe Drake could release his gambling blockchain that gives all proceeds to a ‚Äò0% admin fees‚Äô charity such as GiveDirectly? This would transform Drake‚Äôs gambling losses into charity donations. The more he loses, the more he gives. The UFC has been of great interest to the Canadian rapper. His most notable loss was betting $450,000 on Israel Adesanya to defeat Dricus du Plessis in 2024. However, he has had some notable successes, such as betting on Alexander Volkanovski to beat Diego Lopes. This was a good bet because Volkanovski had experienced some major losses and appeared to be on the verge of retirement. However, recently, Drake bet on Oliveira beating Topuria, which cost him $ 200,000. Topuria achieved a knock-out in the first round, which would have been very disappointing for Drake to watch. Drake, therefore, has a lot of experience with Bitcoin and gambling, earning the title ‚ÄòDrake Curse‚Äô. The reference to Bitcoin in his latest song is a reflection of how cryptocurrencies have become a mainstream phenomenon, no longer a fringe movement.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/drake-drops-new-single-comparing-fake-friends-to-bitcoins-brutal-price-swings/,"BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:55:24,"Analyst Unveils Crypto Catalysts for ‚ÄòJubilant July,‚Äô Says Altcoins Will Likely ‚ÄòCook‚Äô for Next Few Weeks","A crypto strategist with a history of timely Bitcoin ( BTC ) calls believes that the digital asset market will flourish this month. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 868,800 followers on the social media platform X that he sees the crypto markets rallying this month amid a slew of bullish catalysts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the start of a new quarter and a new month. It‚Äôs also Jubilant July. I gotta say. I feel extremely refreshed for the first time in a long time with all the positives happening. Stablecoin legislation is moving forward. More rails are being connected with traditional finance, banks and consumers. Crypto will continue to grow as a focus in global markets. Let‚Äôs also not forget the fiscal and monetary tailwinds that are coming.‚Äù As for the fiscal tailwinds, the analyst says that the US is positioning to ease monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, while Bitcoin and US equities are in a strong uptrend. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre bearish, consider this. The market has, for now, failed to prove a bullish bias to be incorrect. When there is FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), it V reverses into new highs each time. No matter how extreme the FUD. Market structure is intact on high time frames. BTC and stocks are at or around all-time highs. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing outgrowing its debt by spending more. The largest economy in the world is openly discussing lowering interest rates, which in this instance would likely stoke both inflation/growth. If the market proves these ideas to be incorrect, then you can pivot. I see no reason to be bearish on markets with this in mind.‚Äù Turning to altcoins, Pentoshi says he‚Äôs keeping a close eye on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market capitalization of crypto, excluding the 10 largest digital assets and stablecoins. The analyst predicts that OTHERS will soar close to $400 billion, indicating massive upside potential for altcoins. ‚ÄúI do think many alts will likely cook for the next few weeks. Just feels like‚Ä¶ sellers have run out of momentum. Many of them look better than they have in quite some time. I think you could essentially use last week‚Äôs lows as a point we shouldn‚Äôt lose on most of these‚Ä¶ I think we see others play out something like drawn below.‚Äù Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $229 billion.

2025-07-06T16:55:00,"Top 3 catalysts for Bitcoin and altcoins this week","Bitcoin and most altcoins remained in a tight range last week, despite rising exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and top US indices, such as the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, reaching a record high. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose above $110,000 for the first time in a month and then pared back those gains, ending the week at $108,000. The market capitalization of all coins ended the week at $3.30 trillion. Here are some of the top catalysts for Bitcoin and most altcoins. Tariff deadline The most important catalyst for the stock and crypto markets will be the end of President Donald Trump‚Äôs 90-day pause on tariffs, slated for July 9. The US has reached preliminary trade agreements with a few countries, including Vietnam, China, and the U.K. Other top trading partners ‚Äî Canada, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea ‚Äî may revert to the high tariffs he announced in April. A restart of his ‚Äúretaliatory tariffs‚Äù will likely be bearish for Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market. For example, Bitcoin price plunged to $74,000 after the Liberation Day speech , and then bounced back after he announced the 90-day pause.

These minutes, for the May 6-7, 2025 meeting, will provide more information about the last meeting, in which officials left interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. The Fed minutes will provide hints on when officials expect to cut interest rates, which would be bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins. Still, the odds of a rate cut in July have decreased recently due to the strong nonfarm payrolls data. The data showed that the economy added over 147,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%. Most traders anticipate the bank to cut rates in September if inflation data continues falling. Bitcoin price potential breakout The other key catalyst for Bitcoin and the crypto market will be the potential BTC breakout. The chart below shows that Bitcoin has remained below the all-time high of $111,900 in the past few weeks. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin has also formed a bullish flag pattern, shown in black, and a cup-and-handle pattern. These two patterns often result in greater gains over time. Therefore, a breakout this week could push it to its all-time high, leading to further gains among altcoins. The other top catalysts in the crypto market include upcoming token unlocks by prominent altcoins such as Aptos ( APT ), Flare ( FLR ), and Ethereum Name Service.

2025-07-06T16:51:39,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Altcoins Could Break Out as as U.S. Prepares for Historic Crypto Week","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Altcoins Could Break Out as as U.S. Prepares for Historic Crypto Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has been unusually quiet lately, but that calm might not last much longer. A big event is on the horizon that could shake up Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. The U.S. Congress is preparing for ‚ÄúCrypto Week‚Äù from July 14 to 18, and the decisions made during this week could have a major impact on the crypto market. What‚Äôs Happening in the Market Right Now? In the past week, the price of Bitcoin and altcoins has barely moved. Bitcoin is up just 0.6%, Ethereum by 2%, and most of the altcoin market has stayed flat. Some meme coins managed double-digit gains, but overall, it‚Äôs been a slow, sideways market. Historically, this kind of price action often happens before a big breakout, and all attention is now on what Congress will decide in the coming days. Why Crypto Week Matters During Crypto Week, U.S. lawmakers will discuss and possibly pass several important bills related to cryptocurrency: The Clarity Act: This bill will finally create clear rules for how crypto assets are traded, invested, and regulated in the U.S. The Stablecoin Bill (Genius Act): Focused on regulating dollar-backed stablecoins, it has already passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House as well. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: A bill aimed at blocking government-controlled digital currencies that could invade financial privacy. While some bills, like the Stablecoin Act, are likely to move quickly, others like the Clarity Act, which deals with more complex areas like DeFi, staking, and crypto taxes, might take longer to finalize. Why This Could Trigger a Market Pump Alongside these bills, the U.S. government recently approved a massive $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. This move means more money could flood the financial system, which historically tends to benefit risk assets like crypto. Plus, crypto-friendly policies and clear rules can attract new institutional investors and bringing fresh capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Ethereum‚Äôs Big Moment Is Coming While Bitcoin has been surging for months, analysts say Ethereum is about to get its turn. Big names like Bitwise predict that Ethereum ETFs and tokenized assets built on the Ethereum network could see massive growth in the second half of 2025. New projects like Robinhood‚Äôs blockchain network and the rise of tokenized stocks and stablecoins on Ethereum‚Äôs platform are expected to fuel demand for ETH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-and-altcoins-could-break-out-as-as-u-s-prepares-for-historic-crypto-week/,"ETH|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:30:17,"This technological phenomenon is the worst case scenario for Bitcoin","The debate about the longevity of Bitcoin has been ongoing for years. Most people would say that Bitcoin will end because of quantum technology, however, I believe there‚Äôs another answer. Ever since Bitcoin debuted in 2009, people have speculated about the survival of this digital currency. Many people believed that it would go to zero, but 16 years later, governments are recognizing its potential as gold 2.0. Let‚Äôs be real. Bitcoin has proven its reliability as an asset after reaching almost $112,000 per coin. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $3.91 trillion, and most of this money was in Bitcoin. At the peak, BTC had a market cap of $2.227 trillion, while the remaining $1.68 trillion was in the 17,000-ish altcoins. Bitcoin is an asset class‚Äîother altcoins aren‚Äôt included in this category. This is because BTC is among the top 10 assets ranked by market cap according to data from Infinite Market Cap. Despite the massive success of Bitcoin, there‚Äôs a technological phenomenon I believe that would kill the crypto king. Quantum computing isn‚Äôt the Bitcoin killer Quantum computing is considered a major threat to Bitcoin. More specifically, quantum computers could break the complex mathematical algorithms that support modern cryptography. It could also make it possible to access dormant wallets and spend any Bitcoins from the Satoshi era. Quantum computing originates from two fields: quantum mechanics and computer science. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics. It examines the physics of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic levels. The behavior of atoms and subatomic particles is unique and classical physics laws like Newton‚Äôs laws can‚Äôt fully explain it. There are specific principles and phenomena that explain quantum mechanics such as superposition, quantization, etc. Computer science is the study of computational systems and it includes algorithms, data structure, programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, etc. Quantum computing takes principles from quantum mechanics and applies them to computing for superior processing power. But how could quantum computing crack the Bitcoin algorithm? Could it really make it possible to access dormant BTC coins? Theoretically, if someone builds a powerful quantum computer and obtains your public key, they could derive your private key, forge a valid signature, and spend your BTC. This scenario depends on the type of wallet address used, whether the public key has been revealed, and the processing speed of the quantum computer . All BTC in pay-to-public-key (p2pk) addresses and reused pay-to-public-key-hash (p2pkh) addresses are vulnerable to a quantum computer attack. In a p2pk address, the public key is exposed on the blockchain by default, even before any coins are spent. In a p2pkh address, the public key is not revealed until the coins are spent. P2pk and p2pkh addresses were dominant in the early days of Bitcoin. The BTC mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are stored in p2pk addresses. In 2020, the number of Bitcoins in p2pk addresses was around 2 million coins, while p2pkh addresses had 2.5 million coins. A total of 4.5 million Bitcoins is equivalent to around $490 billion. In terms of processing speed, a quantum computer must derive the private key and broadcast a competing transaction before the next block is mined, typically within 10 minutes. So if a quantum computer takes two hours to derive a private key from a publicly available public key, it won‚Äôt be able to spend the Bitcoins‚Äîbecause transactions are typically confirmed within 10 minutes. However, if the address is reused and receives new coins after the public key has already been revealed, those new funds become vulnerable, and the quantum computer could potentially spend them. The technological phenomenon that could catalyze Bitcoin‚Äôs demise NEMP stands for nuclear electromagnetic pulse. It‚Äôs considered both a technological phenomenon and a weapon. As the name indicates, an NEMP generates a pulse of electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion, especially one detonated at high altitude. Instead of causing physical damage, an NEMP is intentionally detonated to generate an intense electromagnetic pulse. This results in an extremely high voltage and current surges into anything that conducts electricity ‚Äî wires, antennas, power lines, computers, electronics etc. In other words, an NEMP will fry every electrical and electronic equipment and device. Because of the high altitude, an NEMP explosion can affect thousands of kilometers and impact an entire country or even continent. This means servers, data centers and Bitcoin mining farms are gone in a fraction of a second. According to a YouGov poll , around 68 to 76% of Europeans and Americans believe that nuclear arms will be used in World War III. Analysts also point to growing tensions between major nuclear powers, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and the US. The recent Israel‚ÄìIran conflict , along with US-supported strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, is the closest the world has come to a nuclear war in recent years. If a global-scale NEMP attack happens, it could wipe out Bitcoin mining equipment, nodes, internet infrastructure and modern technology as we know it today. In 1949 Albert Einstein said ‚ÄúI know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.‚Äù In such a scenario, one would not be wrong to assume that Bitcoin was not spared.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-will-die-technological-phenomenon/,"BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MINING","OP-ED|Bitcoin|BTC|USD",cryptocompare

Recent market fluctuations have generated a lot of fearful controversy whether the bull cycle has topped out or not. While some institutional investors are still holding strong with optimism of one last leg up, many traders are pessimistic as they panic for a potential price crash. As a matter of fact, the overall market is technically reaching an extremely overbought condition as several meme coins enter a mini bearish phase since the start of the year. Although Bonk and Pengu have regained momentum and continued to show strength amid the latest market drops. Few Meme Coins Defying Market Odds Aside from Bonk and Pengu, which have consistently charted major gains for a week, many meme coins are seriously bleeding out today as Bitcoin loses footings again after almost retesting its recently marked all-time high (ATH). Other meme coins that follow trends are Fartcoin, Useless Coin and AI Agents. Moderate gains from Turbo, Pepe and Shiba have also put their prices in a green zone over the past hours, although they may record losses if Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to drop. Few Binance Alpha tokens, and most especially assets on Dex are not left behind in the daily posting gain as they registered a significant profit at the time of writing. What To Expect With The Current Market Behaviour The fate of the entire market lies in Bitcoin‚Äôs future direction. However, if BTC calms or even resumes bullish, the meme coin market may see a strong recovery with Doge and others rising back above their key monthly high. Otherwise, a huge breakdown can be expected in the long term. Further drops in the flagship asset could lead to a serious decline of meme coins in the future with Pengu and Bonk joining the ride. But as of now, they appear to be footing a new bullish phase. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-06T16:08:30,"Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP Rise as Bessent Hints at Trade Deals Before Liberation Day Tariff Deadline","Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin (DOGE) rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550. In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. ""President Trump's¬†going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2¬†tariff¬†level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent said, per Reuters . Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. ""We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000. The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/06/btc-doge-xrp-rise-as-bessent-hints-at-trade-deals-before-liberation-day-tariff-deadline,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|XRP|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|DOGE|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-06T16:06:52,"Bitcoin bulls price in new all-time highs in H2 2025, with big money breakout on the horizon","Bitcoin is staring down the second half of 2025 with a clear target: new all-time highs. According to CNBC, large firms have already begun piling more of the crypto onto their balance sheets while Capitol Hill inches closer to passing long-delayed legislation. The price climbed about 30% in Q2, even though most traders called it a consolidation phase. The reason? Monthly returns kept fading, and the coin barely moved from its tight range for most of the quarter. But that didn‚Äôt stop it from racking up a 15% gain in H1, even if that‚Äôs weaker than the 45% jump during the same period last year. Still, Bitcoin‚Äôs staying power above $100,000 since May 9 is keeping bulls aggressive. The coin traded at $108,000 on Sunday, about 3% short of its May record at $111,999, per CoinGecko data . Devin Ryan, who heads financial tech research at Citizens, said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still an acceleration coming here around ETF adoption‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more money coming into those.‚Äù Ryan said people are still moving from owning nothing to owning some, adding that the old walls around Bitcoin access are disappearing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving closer to the end of the consolidation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe path is higher from here.‚Äù Public companies set up for massive Bitcoin inflows A group of firms now known as Bitcoin treasury companies is driving that push. These are publicly traded companies that either already hold Bitcoin as a main asset or are planning to. Some of them, including Nakamoto, Twenty One, and Strive Asset Management, are going through mergers with other listed companies to raise capital by offering equity and using it to buy Bitcoin. Steven Lubka, the VP of investor relations at Nakamoto, told CNBC that a lot of that capital hasn‚Äôt even touched the market yet. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre waiting on SEC approval on the mergers, so there‚Äôs way more money that‚Äôs coming, that‚Äôs trying to buy Bitcoin but has not currently bought it,‚Äù Lubka said. ‚ÄúWe have not yet seen the full impact of even just the money that‚Äôs already lined up.‚Äù Lubka said adoption isn‚Äôt the only driver right now. The broader macro setup is turning bullish too. He pointed to rising fiscal spending, surging stock prices, and a White House under Donald Trump that appears supportive of crypto. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs maturity as an asset class intersects with a huge amount of capital coming in through new financialization vehicles,‚Äù Lubka said, referring to the treasury companies. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see a ton of fiscal spending, and you also have an administration that‚Äôs pro-Bitcoin,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThese four factors are going to intersect together to produce a pretty material bull market.‚Äù Legislation and Fed drama add fuel for Q3 surge Bitcoin‚Äôs next leg higher could be helped by Washington. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, said the political landscape could play a major role in the third quarter. If President Trump replaces Jerome Powell as Fed chair, markets could start betting on earlier rate cuts, which may boost investor confidence in the central bank‚Äôs independence. Kendrick also flagged a potential law: the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill now working its way through Congress. He believes it could pass in Q3 and trigger a ton of new retail demand. ‚ÄúIt could encourage more retail investors to make their first investments in crypto, with Bitcoin the prime beneficiary,‚Äù Kendrick wrote in a research note last week. But not everyone‚Äôs completely calm. Kendrick said prices could get messy around late September because of fears tied to Bitcoin‚Äôs four-year cycle. In that cycle, the coin usually dumps around 18 months after a halving, when the rate of new supply is slashed. The last halving happened in April 2024, which puts that potential correction window directly into H2. Still, Kendrick isn‚Äôt backing off his forecast. He believes the current demand, especially from ETFs and treasury companies, will be enough to hold up the price even if some long-term holders start unloading. ‚ÄúThe key this time will be whether increased ETF and Bitcoin treasury flows are enough to offset any other selling by long-term holders,‚Äù Kendrick said. ‚ÄúWe think they will be.‚Äù By Kendrick‚Äôs estimate, Bitcoin could rise to $135,000 by the end of Q3, and then finish the year at $200,000. He expects that once investors stop worrying about another cycle repeat, the crypto will keep rising. ‚ÄúOnce market concerns about this have passed, we expect Bitcoin to continue to rise to our end-Q4 forecast,‚Äù he wrote.

The UK government is tightening its grip on the crypto economy with new tax compliance rules that require users to provide identifying information to exchanges and platforms. The Cryptoasset Reporting Framework, designed to close loopholes and capture unpaid capital gains, is expected to raise ¬£315 million by April 2030. The fines‚Äîtargeting both individual holders and non-compliant service providers‚Äîare part of a broader push to bring digital assets under traditional financial oversight and align UK regulations more closely with U.S. policy than the EU‚Äôs approach. According to the Daily Mail , holders of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and other cryptocurrencies must supply accurate information to exchanges and platforms they use for trading. Service providers that fail to report transaction details and tax reference numbers will also face penalties.

The new framework forms part of broader government efforts to increase tax compliance across digital asset transactions. Current UK tax rules require cryptocurrency holders to pay capital gains tax on profits, but enforcement has been limited by reporting gaps. The timing coincides with Chancellor Rachel Reeves‚Äôs refusal to rule out future tax increases following recent welfare reform reversals. Reeves defended the government‚Äôs fiscal approach, stating, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to apologise for making sure the numbers add up.‚Äù The tax compliance measures complement the UK‚Äôs broader cryptocurrency regulatory framework, with draft legislation published in April 2025. This brings crypto exchanges, dealers, and stablecoin issuers under traditional financial services oversight.

The first phase focuses on stablecoins while the second phase will expand to broader cryptoasset categories and activities. Key rules and requirements are already being implemented throughout 2025. Cryptocurrency service providers will need to implement customer data collection systems and regular reporting procedures to avoid penalties. The compliance burden may increase operational costs for smaller exchanges and trading platforms. Users trading on non-compliant platforms or failing to provide required documentation face direct financial penalties. The ¬£300 fine structure creates clear incentives for voluntary compliance while generating revenue from non-compliant actors.

2025-07-06T14:55:27,"Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones Warns of ‚ÄòUnprecendented Social Upheaval,‚Äô Stock and Bond Market Crash Amid Rise of AI","Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones says the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) may cause more collateral damage than anyone is expecting. In a new op-ed for Time , Jones says that while we can celebrate technological progress, there should also be consideration, or even ‚Äúvigorous debate,‚Äù of the societal cost of game-changing technologies like AI. The Tudor Investment Corporation founder references a recent warning from Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, who said AI could eliminate about half of all entry level white collar jobs in the next one to five years. Even if Amodei is only half correct, Jones says such a transformation would create ‚Äúunprecedented social upheaval.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf we follow the playbook of the last 45 years where over 92% of productivity gains went to shareholders over workers, and if Amodei is even half right on his unemployment prediction, you can bet we will face unprecedented social upheaval. In the worst-case scenario, the safety-net strains that high unemployment will place on states and municipalities will force many into bankruptcy. The federal government won‚Äôt be a good backstop because with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120% it won‚Äôt have the borrowing power it once did. Bond markets will tank and take stocks with them.‚Äù The investor calls for several responses to AI, including a federal law requiring AI content to be watermarked so it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs AI-generated. Otherwise, Jones says ‚Äúhumans will become irrelevant in the world we are headed for if we don‚Äôt demand human authenticity.‚Äù Jones also calls for a bipartisan commission that addresses issues of productivity sharing, as well as bilateral talks with China to ‚Äústart establishing shared AI safety protocols to protect the entire world from mistakes and bad actors.‚Äù ‚ÄúNone of this is radical. It‚Äôs rational. The unemployment data on entry-level jobs is a call to action. The first signs of the societal disruptions of AI are already here.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
