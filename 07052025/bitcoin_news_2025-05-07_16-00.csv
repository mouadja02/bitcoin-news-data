2025-05-07T15:00:00.000Z,"SocialFi has failed to take off — Here&#039;s what needs to change","Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?The harsh reality is that decentralized social networks have largely failed to attract and retain mainstream users despite genuine enthusiasm from Web3 communities. The fundamental promise of user ownership, data portability, and monetization remains compelling — but deep structural issues bottleneck adoption.The technical hurdlesBlockchain infrastructure was never designed for the high-throughput, low-latency demands of social networking. Social media users expect instant results when posting pictures, liking comments, or following new accounts — actions that generate hundreds of millions of transactions daily across platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X.Consider this: Ethereum handles just 15-20 transactions per second (TPS). Even Solana — often touted as a high-performance chain — with ~5,000 TPS falls short. Compare that to TikTok's 25 million daily video uploads or X's 500 million daily posts. Adoption becomes impossible when users face 30-second confirmation delays to comment on a post or volatile gas fees ranging from 10 US cents to $50 during network congestion.Web2's hard-won lessons Meta spends $35 billion annually on research and development to refine its platforms' addictive simplicity. TikTok's algorithm, honed through 1 billion hours of daily user engagement, delivers content so frictionless that 47% of users open the app immediately upon waking. The result? Interfaces where the tech disappears behind the experience.By contrast, most SocialFi platforms confront new users with wallet popups, crypto slang, and variable fees. For mainstream users, it's confusing and intimidating. A 2023 DappRadar study found that 92% of SocialFi users abandon platforms within 30 days. Until SocialFi applications can match the frictionless experience of their Web2 counterparts while delivering unique advantages, adoption will remain limited to crypto natives.The fragmentation problemWeb3's multichain world has splintered SocialFi into silos. Lens Protocol's social graph doesn't integrate with Farcaster. Friend.tech's monetization tools don't port over to DeSo. The result? A fractured experience with no network effects.Recent: Avara’s Lens secures $31M for SocialFi-focused L2 blockchainConsider if Gmail users had to pay to email someone on Outlook — and couldn't bring their contacts or messages with them. That's today's SocialFi reality.To solve this, decentralized identity systems like ENS and emerging standards like EAS must power portable, composable social graphs. A user's content, followers, and reputation should travel with them — benefiting the broader ecosystem, not just one app.Purpose-built infrastructureThe solution to SocialFi's adoption challenges isn't incremental improvements to existing models but purpose-built infrastructure explicitly designed for social applications. Just as horizontal scaling revolutionized Web2 infrastructure, modular blockchain architecture that separates concerns like data availability, execution, and settlement creates the foundation for social applications that can scale to billions of users.The shift is already underway. Farcaster moved from Ethereum mainnet to Optimism's layer 2 stack, prioritizing low-cost social interactions. Lens Protocol is migrating to ZKsync, using zero-knowledge proofs to scale while preserving user privacy. CyberConnect launched Cyber, its own L1 chain optimized for social applications, which now supports faster, cheaper interactions with an embedded social graph.These purpose-built stacks mirror how Web2 scaled — separating data, execution, and storage to handle exponential growth. Web3's version is modular architecture: rollups for performance, decentralized storage for media, and identity layers like ENS or Lit Protocol.User-centric social networkingWhen built on the proper foundation, SocialFi can finally deliver on its core promise: putting users back at the center of the social networking experience. This means true ownership of identity and content, portable social graphs that work across applications, and fair value distribution to the people who create and curate content.The opportunity extends well beyond fixing what's broken in Web2 social media. True ownership enables creators to retain control and port audiences across platforms. Programmable money allows TikTok-esque viral trends to include instant revenue splits — imagine a dance challenge where 10% of ad revenue auto-splits among creators.Combining programmable money with social connections, new interaction models become possible — from seamless tipping for quality content to automated revenue sharing for collaborative creation.SocialFi's early iterations have failed to gain meaningful traction beyond crypto enthusiasts. If we finally address the fundamental technical and user experience barriers, Web3 Social can deliver a disproportionate advantage over established platforms only Web3 can offer.Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail.

2025-05-07T14:43:02.000Z,"Safeheron introduces open-source Intel SGX TEE framework for Web3 security","Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.Related: Fully onchain AI agents can be the key to a more open AI future — Here’s why“We’re not threatened by competitors,” Safeheron CEO Wade Wang told Cointelegraph. “What worries us is slow innovation due to closed systems.”A critical technology for protecting code and data, Trusted Execution Environments create secure, isolated spaces within CPUs. These spaces are traditionally called “enclaves.” In these spaces, programs can run while protected from external attacks, including those coming from within the hardware.Some sectors of Web3 that employ TEEs include privacy-focused blockchains, oracles, DeFi, payments services, and exchanges. Oasis Network, Secret Network, and Phala Network are known for using TEEs. Other companies, such as Chainlink, are suspected of using TEEs.Safeheron's new TEE framework allows clients to use cloud services to create enclaves. Any cloud service, including those that are public, that supports Intel SGX servers will do.Safeheron has provided services over 100 clients, primarily payment providers, OTC desks, trading firms, and wallet service providers. Its clients include MetaMask, Doo Group, and Amber Group. According to the company, its cumulative transfer volume recently surpassed $100 billion.In August 2022, Safeheron raised $7 million in pre-Series A funding. The capital was allocated to research, development, and expanding the company’s business team.Related: Here’s how ‘confidential AI’ with blockchain and TEEs protects data privacyButerin proposes TEE for Ethereum privacyIn an April 11 roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed adding a TEE to the Ethereum ecosystem to enhance user privacy. The TEE would be a short-term solution allowing “users to interact with RPC nodes while getting stronger assurances that their private data is not being collected.” He also called for the addition of privacy-protecting tools to Ether (ETH) wallets. TEEs could help here as well by protecting private wallet keys. Announced at the time of its fundraise, Safeheron secured MetaMask as a client in August 2022.Another area in crypto where TEEs can help is Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge, or SNARKs. An August 2024 study by Imperial College London found that vulnerabilities in the circuit layer pose significant threats to these systems. TEEs could guard against any attacks coming from within the system.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/safeheron-intel-sgx-tee-framework-web3-security?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Analysts are watching these key levels","Key takeaways:XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.Whale accumulation supports bullish XRP viewCertain indicators show that XRP’s ongoing price rise may not be just a short-term reaction to the positive macroeconomic news. For instance, Santiment's Supply Distribution metric shows a steady rise in the supply held by entities with a 1 million –10 million token balance. These addresses now own 9.44% of the total XRP supply, a 1.2% increase since Jan. 1. Percentage of addresses holding between 1M and 100M XRP. Source: SantimentThis suggests that whales did not sell on the recent drop to $1.60 but accumulated XRP, suggesting most are positioning themselves for further gains.By purchasing during downturns, these large entities can reduce selling pressure and create a floor for the price, encouraging smaller retail investors to follow suit. Meanwhile, XRP open interest (OI) has seen a modest 0.32% rise to $3.65 billion over the last day, signaling a slight increase in trader confidence and liquidity. However, the 17% drop in trading volume to $3.9 billion is a cause for concern, suggesting low conviction as traders wait for the XRP price to establish a clear directional bias.XRP derivatives data. Source: CoinGlassXRP price to $4 all-time highs?Traders believe XRP can revisit its seven-year highs above $3.40 and beyond, but its potential to continue its gains depends on holding above key support levels. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that XRP price bounced off the 200-day SMA at $2.08 on May 6, rising as much as 4.5% to today’s intraday high of $2.17, which is also the 50-day SMA.Related: Why is XRP price down today?The 200-day SMA coincides with the election volume-weighted average price (VWAP) and the monthly rVWAP, as shown in the chart below.“This is an area that we want to see continue to get defended,” said trader and analyst Dom in a May 6 post on X, adding that failure to hold above this level could see XRP drop toward $1.90.“To see an immediate trend reversal, we need to see the price regain $2.12.”XRP/USD daily chart.

Diversified reportedly denied that the site was abandoned, stating it may resume gas production.However, the DEP and environmental advocates say the company has failed to meet its obligations. Under a 2021 agreement, Diversified had committed to plugging Longhorn A and 13 other wells at the end of their operational life, an obligation it has reportedly not fulfilled.An image of the site.

With the product, qualified clients can access up to $1 million in loans while keeping their BTC.Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca at the Token2049 media lounge. Source: CointelegraphBitcoin-backed loans are an “obvious” next stepRocca told Cointelegraph that growing confidence in crypto’s long-term trajectory had fueled demand for the product. This has been driven by developments leading to broader institutional adoption. “Expectations are for institutional space coming in, the ETFs, and the mood music on Bitcoin is much more about wider adoption and long-term thinking than very short-term speculation,” Rocca said. He said this shift is the key to unlocking demand for borrowing against BTC, as investors feel more secure and feel that sharp price drops are less likely to happen. The Xapo Bank CEO said that its Bitcoin-backed loans offer loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 20%, 30% and 40%, giving borrowers flexibility while managing risk. “If you get a 20% LTV loan and you have 100 Bitcoin, as a lot of early adopters do, that’s still a couple of million dollars you can borrow without having to sell them,” Rocca said. With conservative LTV levels like 20%, Bitcoin must fall below $40,000 for borrowers to get liquidated. “We’re nowhere near $40,000,” Rocca told Cointelegraph, pointing to the current price stability as a reason for growing borrower confidence.Related: Blockchains ready for institutions, lawyers hesitate: DoubleZero CEOBorrowing helps investors avoid selling in emergenciesRocca said Bitcoin-backed loans provide a solution for holders who want to stay exposed to BTC when facing life’s unexpected expenses. “If you follow the ethos of investing, the smart thing to do would be not to sell it in three days if it goes to $100,000,” Rocca said.“But life gets in the way,” Rocca added. He told Cointelegraph that unexpected costs, like medical bills or replacing a car, often force investors to liquidate assets at unfavorable times. Rocca said that instead of selling Bitcoin for a $10,000 expense, investors could borrow against their holdings while simply paying interest on the loan.“You continue to have the upside potential of the price appreciation of the Bitcoin because you haven’t sold it,” he said. “But you get liquidity to pay for things that you need in everyday life.”With institutional adoption deepening and the Bitcoin market maturing, the Xapo Bank executive is betting that more long-term holders will be ready to tap into crypto liquidity without selling their BTC. This marks a shift from the “hodl” culture to an age where Bitcoin owners can do more with the asset. Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-backed-loans-growth-xapo-bank-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It aims to increase its hashrate to 25 EH/s by September.Related: Bitfarms sells Paraguay site to Hive for $85M, refocuses on USThe CEO said Hive has spent over a year cultivating strong, cooperative relationships with local stakeholders in Paraguay. “We are investing in local hiring, training programs and strong vendor partnerships. Our goal is to create a local ecosystem of support that keeps costs stable while boosting uptime and efficiency,” he added.While there was a proposed ban on crypto mining in Paraguay due to the pressure it poses on the country’s electricity supply and potential rising electricity prices, Aydin said that their team is actively involved with policymakers to support clarity and cooperation in mining legislation.Hive embraces global diversification to hedge against geopolitical risksHive has data centers in Canada, Sweden and Paraguay. Contrasting with its ongoing LATAM expansion, the miner is relocating its headquarters to San Antonio, Texas. “Our growing presence in North and South America creates a balanced footprint resilient to geopolitical or trade policy shocks,” Kilic said.The US tariff on China raised concerns about the rising cost of mining equipment, like ASICs. Kilic told Cointelegraph that they have diversified sourcing channels for ASICs and electrical components to avoid single-region dependencies. Related: Bitcoin miners should pay costs in depreciating currency — Ledn execTo ensure scaling from six to 25 EH/s, the CEO said the company has locked in key ASIC orders, secured power access through long-term power purchase agreements, and expanded engineering capacity across three continents to deal with market and technological uncertainties.Profitability in Bitcoin mining is ultimately a physics equationKilic sees Bitcoin mining profit as a physics equation. He told Cointelegraph that capital and operational expenses depend on hashrate-sensitive analysis to seek the most accretive way to fund their business through BTC treasury and ATM sales.While the solo mining community may have more difficulty making profits, the CEO suggested the focus should be on the variables it can control: “Whether you run one rig or ten thousand, it comes down to controlling inputs like opex, power costs, and machine uptime to drive predictable outputs —  maximizing energy efficiency, minimizing downtime and being disciplined with treasury management.”Magazine: Korea to lift corporate crypto ban, beware crypto mining HDs: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hive-digital-expands-bitcoin-mining-paraguay-latam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T08:57:28.000Z,"Ethereum’s ‘Pectra’ network upgrade goes live: What to expect","Ethereum — the network that unleashed smart contracts on the world — moves on to the next chapter with today’s Pectra upgrade, but what does it mean?Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.Ethereum Pectra Consensys announcement. Source: ConsensysEIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially significantly reduces transaction fees. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of Ethereum decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator 1inch, said Pectra “introduces ‘smart account’ functionality” at deeper protocol levels and “improves Ethereum’s scalability” through layer-2 solutions.Related: Ethereum to simplify crosschain transactions with new token standardsBetter account abstraction0xAw, lead developer at Base Ethereum layer-2 DEX Alien.Base told Cointelegraph that EIP‑7702 “is a potentially great addition for Ethereum.” He said that account abstraction has so far been unable to gain traction due to the need to switch wallets.The positives of adopting such a solution include “getting rid of approval flows, not having to sign each transaction, segregated permissions and actions, and automations on behalf of the user.” 0xAw added that, following the update, developers will have an easier time implementing the features.While account abstraction “won’t magically result in mass adoption,” it still “does remove a significant barrier to entry for new people.” He added:“It enables a Web2-like UX by hiding many of the underlying scaffolding from users.”1inch’s Kunz highlighted that the update will pave “the way for native gasless transactions and simplified user flows.” Ivo Georgiev, founder and CEO of self-custodial smart wallet Ambire, told Cointelegraph that “there will be no more infinite ERC-20 approvals, and users won’t need native currency like ETH to pay transaction gas fees.” He added:“Following this, the UX will be reworked completely, with permissions/delegations systems that let wallets give more limited abilities to apps, thus increasing their overall security — for example, you won’t need the wallet popup every time you interact with OpenSea.“Still, the change is not without its downsides. According to 0xAw, it gives “users have one more dangerous thing they could sign, which would be even more damaging than an approval to wallet drainers.”Mike Tiutin, chief technology officer at onchain compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “drainers proved that users will sign ‘harmless’ messages in cloned DApps.” The risk will now get worse:“EIP-7702 expands that trick from one token to the whole wallet.“Georgiev is more optimistic, saying he is “confident there will not be a tangible increase in risk.” He explained, “By this point, the industry knows how to create a secure contract, especially with such a minimal scope as an EIP-7702 delegation.”Related: Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 yearsEasier institutional stakingArtemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org, told Cointelegraph, “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.” Staking service clients had to obtain a signed message from their staking service provider to be able to exit and store it securely for later.Until Pectra, stakers could not exit without the participation of the staking service provider. Those messages also couldn’t be generated until about 13 hours after starting staking — now this exit delay will be decreased to about 13 minutes.Supply validator deposits onchainAnother notable upgrade is EIP-6110. This makes the execution‑layer block carry data about new validator deposits to the consensus layer. Validator deposits are new validators joining Ethereum’s staking protocol.Until Pectra, consensus clients waited for block proposers to vote on a Merkle root that summarized deposits. Now, the execution-layer block includes (supplies) a list of new verifier deposits. This sort of upgrade makes changes very deep into Ethereum’s consensus layer, and its introduction follows client bugs breaking the Holesky and Sepolia Ethereum test networks. Still, Parshakov explained that his firm’s biggest concern “are client bugs, but we trust that respectable teams and the Ethereum Foundation are working together to prevent it from happening on mainnet.”Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-pectra-network-upgrade-goes-live-today-what-to-expect?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T08:53:00.000Z,"What is Tornado Cash, and why did it get into trouble?","What is Tornado Cash?              Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a different address. The protocol was launched to boost privacy in Ethereum-based transactions. Over time, the developers have expanded its functionality to support multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, including BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum and Avalanche.Tornado Cash supports several ERC-20 tokens and native ETH across Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. At its peak usage, Tornado Cash supported several ERC-20 tokens, including:On Ethereum: Ether (ETH), Dai (DAI), USDC (USDC), Tether’s USDt (USDT), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).On other EVM chains (via smart contract deployment): BNB (BNB), Polygon (POL), Avalanche (AVAX) and ETH on Arbitrum and Optimism.Did you know? Tornado Cash launched in 2019 as an experiment in financial privacy using just a few smart contracts. By 2022, it had processed billions in crypto transactions without ever holding user funds directly.                  How Tornado Cash works              Unlike traditional financial systems that prioritize users’ privacy, blockchain public ledgers are accessible to everyone on blockchain explorers. Tornado Cash counters this by enabling anonymous transactions through smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs.Crypto mixers typically pool and shuffle users’ funds, deduct a fee, and redistribute them. Tornado Cash, however, uses a pool-based system where deposits are commingled in a smart contract, and withdrawals to new addresses are delinked using zk-SNARKs, ensuring anonymity without random shuffling.Here’s how it works:At its core, Tornado Cash has smart contracts that break the onchain link between a sender and receiver. When a user deposits a cryptocurrency into a Tornado Cash pool, the smart contract issues a cryptographic note that the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a different wallet address without revealing the link between the two.As Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol, the underlying smart contracts cannot be changed or destroyed by anyone, including the Tornado Cash decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).The system uses ZK-proofs, which allow a user to prove that they have the right to withdraw a specific amount without revealing what deposit was theirs. This mechanism ensures that deposits and withdrawals are mathematically linked but anonymous.Tornado Cash is non-custodial, meaning it does not hold user funds at any point. The code runs independently and cannot be altered or controlled by the developers. The funds can remain in the pool for as long as the user likes.Before sanctions, Tornado Cash was primarily accessed via its web interface by connecting a crypto wallet. Advanced users could also interact with the protocol’s smart contracts directly using a command-line interface.                  How Tornado Cash got into trouble              Tornado Cash landed in legal trouble primarily because it was allegedly used to launder billions of dollars in illicit funds, including crypto stolen in high-profile hacks. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash on Aug. 8, 2022, under Executive Order 13694.There were several reasons behind Tornado Cash facing issues with regulators: Facilitation of money laundering: Tornado Cash was accused of facilitating money laundering, with the OFAC claiming it processed over $7 billion in virtual currency since 2019, approximately 30% of which was linked to illicit activity, per Chainalysis.Support for North Korean cybercrime: The platform was linked to laundering more than $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.Threat to national security: The OFAC accused Tornado Cash of materially assisting cyber-enabled activities originating outside the US, posing a significant threat to US national security, foreign policy and economic stability.Lack of effective controls: The Treasury highlighted Tornado Cash’s failure to implement adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures, allowing malicious actors to exploit it.Obfuscation of illicit transactions: According to the OFAC, Tornado Cash was facilitating anonymous transactions by obscuring their origin, destination and counterparties, enabling criminals to hide the proceeds of cybercrimes.Tornado Cash was designed to obfuscate the entire transaction history. This feature was beneficial for privacy, particularly in use cases like payroll, donations and personal spending, where anonymity can be important. However, the very feature that made it attractive for legitimate use also made it appealing to bad actors looking to launder money or conceal illicit transactions. This drew significant attention from regulators, who became concerned about the potential for criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism financing or other forms of illicit finance.On March 21, 2025, the US Treasury lifted sanctions imposed by the Biden administration against Tornado Cash. Did you know? In August 2022, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash smart contracts, marking the first time code, not a person or organization, was blacklisted. This sparked a heated global debate over open-source freedom.                  Debate around Tornado Cash              The action against Tornado Cash followed similar sanctions against Blender.io in May 2022, signaling a broader regulatory push to address cryptocurrency mixers. Such actions sparked a controversy in the crypto community. Critics of regulatory actions on the decentralized crypto mixers argue that sanctioning open-source code and punishing developers for creating privacy-preserving tools pose a threat to free speech and innovation. It undermines the neutrality of blockchain tools and sets a precedent where governments could censor software itself, not just its use.On the other hand, advocates of hardened regulatory sanctions say it is a necessary step to combat crypto-related crime and that illicit activity cannot be left unchecked. While the protocol does have legitimate uses, the scale of its illicit use, nearly 30% of funds tied to illicit actors, outweighed these benefits. They argue that the decentralized, non-custodial nature of the smart contracts in such protocols, which cannot be modified or controlled, complicates efforts to mitigate misuse. This leaves regulators with no option but to take action against the protocol itself to deter similar platforms from operating without safeguards.The Treasury held that the platform consistently failed to implement effective controls to prevent money laundering by malicious cyber actors. This lack of oversight allowed illicit actors to exploit the service without restriction, prompting the need for regulatory intervention to curb unchecked abuse.Nevertheless, the case has set up pressing questions about how to balance financial privacy with security and how decentralized, permissionless systems can coexist with traditional legal frameworks.Did you know? The Tornado Cash protocol is governed by a DAO, allowing tokenholders to vote on upgrades and proposals. Even after sanctions, the DAO continued to operate briefly on-chain.                  The efficacy of “sanctions” and their removal              Despite sanctions, Tornado Cash remained operational through decentralized technologies like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Tor. Its resilience led to doubts around the efficacy of sanctions on decentralized protocols and the broader implications for crypto regulation under evolving US policy.According to Chainalysis, Tornado Cash kept functioning on the dark web despite the sanctions. Its front end was available on the IPFS and via The Onion Router (known as Tor). IPFS is a peer-to-peer, distributed protocol for data storage and sharing, while Tor is open-source software enabling anonymous communication, often called the dark web.Per Flipside Crypto data, Tornado Cash saw $1.9 billion in deposits between Jan. 1 and June 30 in 2024, compared to $635.696 million in deposits during the same period in 2023.Unlike centralized services, Tornado Cash is decentralized and autonomous, making it difficult to shut down or control. But the US government targeted associated infrastructure, including GitHub repositories and websites. Developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of concealing illicit financial flows and facilitating money laundering. Two of the co-founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, were charged in 2023 for involvement in more than $1 billion in money laundering.A Dutch court later suspended Pertsev’s pretrial detention. A US court determined that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts aren’t “property,” though legal experts note this doesn’t clear the founders of other charges. High-profile figures like Vitalik Buterin and Edward Snowden have publicly supported Pertsev in the matter.The Treasury stated that a review of legal and policy issues regarding sanctions in “evolving technology and legal environments” led to the repeal of sanctions. In January 2025, a US court overturned the sanctions. The ruling came after Joseph Van Loon and other Tornado Cash users filed an appeal against the sanctions, arguing that the OFAC had overstepped its congressional authority by blacklisting the mixer in 2022.In April 2025, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the US Treasury Department’s sanctions against Tornado Cash were unlawful and barred the agency from reimposing them on the crypto mixer.                  Tornado Cash sanctions repeal: What’s next for crypto privacy?              The repeal of sanctions on Tornado Cash marks a pivotal moment for decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto privacy. It underscores the challenges of regulating permissionless, immutable systems while highlighting the growing legal recognition of code as distinct from traditional property or entities.For users, the lifting of sanctions restores access to a tool designed for financial privacy, potentially boosting adoption for legitimate use cases like shielding personal transactions or protecting sensitive donations.However, the repeal does not resolve the underlying tension between privacy and regulatory oversight. Tornado Cash’s continued operation, even during sanctions, demonstrates the resilience of decentralized protocols but also their vulnerability to misuse. Regulators worldwide are likely to scrutinize similar platforms, pushing for stronger AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks, even in DeFi. This could lead to hybrid solutions where privacy tools incorporate voluntary compliance mechanisms to deter illicit activity without compromising user autonomy.For Tornado Cash itself, the future remains uncertain. While the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable, its governance via the Tornado Cash DAO could evolve to address regulatory concerns, such as implementing optional transparency features for compliant users. The legal battles of its developers — Pertsev, Storm and Semenov — are ongoing, and their outcomes could shape public perception and trust in the platform. A guilty verdict could deter developers from building similar tools, while acquittals might embolden innovation in privacy-focused DeFi.The Tornado Cash saga has also sparked broader discussions about the right to financial privacy in the digital age. Advocates argue that privacy is a fundamental right, especially in an era of pervasive blockchain surveillance, where every transaction is traceable by default. Critics, however, emphasize the societal cost of unchecked anonymity, pointing to cases like the Lazarus Group’s exploits. Striking a balance will require collaboration between developers, regulators and the crypto community to ensure privacy tools serve legitimate users without becoming havens for crime.As the crypto landscape evolves, Tornado Cash will likely influence the next generation of privacy protocols. Emerging technologies, such as advanced ZK-proofs or layer-2 scaling solutions, could enable even more robust privacy guarantees while addressing regulatory concerns. For now, the repeal of sanctions offers a reprieve for Tornado Cash and its users, but it also sets the stage for a new chapter in the ongoing debate over privacy, security and the future of decentralized finance.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-tornado-cash-and-why-did-it-get-into-trouble?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments. “In big Web2 companies, this is mandatory,” Budorin added. Dyma Budorin at the Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: CointelegraphReal-time blacklisting, a step forwardWhile crypto security approaches remained the same, post-hack security approaches shifted slightly. Budorin told Cointelegraph there were some improvements in the crypto space’s post-hack security responses. “Maybe a little shift from a post-hack approach,” Budorin told Cointelegraph, citing how security firm Chainalysis introduced near real-time blacklisting of stolen funds. He said this small improvement is a step toward progress in crypto security.“This is great because, previously, Chainalysis was blacklisting within three days when the funds were moving. And this is obviously nothing because hackers had enough time to launder, through exchanges, the stolen money,” Budorin said. On Feb. 21, the Bybit hack saw $1.4 billion in crypto stolen through a safe wallet vulnerability. This became the largest crypto hack in history. After the hack, the malicious actors laundered 100% of the stolen money in just 10 days. While faster blacklisting is a step forward, it still doesn’t address the deeper structural risks. “But in terms of the practice, cybersecurity, nothing changed,” Budorin told Cointelegraph. Related: Bybit hacker launders 100% of stolen $1.4B crypto in 10 daysCrypto losses near $360 million in April In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. Source: PeckShieldApril’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million.

The protocol enables AI agents to access paid resources in real-time based on their needs and eliminates dependency on pre-paid credits, API keys, or human-managed accounts. AI agents can also provision and pay for hardware resources in real-time, access specialized data sources through micropayments, and pay other AI systems for services. The x402 protocol essentially transforms AI agents from tools that require constant human interaction into autonomous economic actors that can independently discover, purchase and utilize resources to accomplish their goals.Developers can use the protocol to monetize APIs, create software unlocks and enable metered services that dynamically charge users based on actual resource usage, while content creators can monetize their content without the need for blanket subscriptions or credit card minimums and fees.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-x402-payments-protocol-make-ai-agents-more-autonomous?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal environment for alternative hedge assets such as cryptocurrencies.Source: Jim PaulsenEconomist and investor Jim Paulsen notes that when Fed funds trade above a “neutral” interest rate (Fed Funds minus the annual core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index), the economy has historically moved toward recession or a “growth recession,” a period of sluggish growth with rising unemployment and weak consumer demand. Similar patterns since 1971 support this analysis.According to Paulsen, the Fed will likely be compelled to lower interest rates. Moreover, central bank Chair Jerome Powell is under significant pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has criticized the Fed for not reducing the cost of capital quickly enough.Reasons why the Fed could start easingConcerns about overheated markets remain as the US consumer inflation exceeds the 2% target, and April unemployment rates of 4.2% suggest no signs of economic weakness.FOMC rates estimate for the Sept. 17 decision. Source: CME FedWatchMarket expectations, as reflected in Treasury yield futures, show a 76% chance of interest rates at 4.0% or lower by Sept. 17. This probability has dropped considerably from 90% on April 29, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are growing less confident that the Fed will ease monetary policy. While this may initially seem bearish for risk assets, it could prompt the Treasury to inject liquidity into markets to support government spending.Regardless of the FOMC’s decision, some analysts point out that the Fed’s recent $20.5 billion Treasury bond purchase on May 5 signals renewed intervention. Additional liquidity has historically been bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially as the US dollar lags behind other major global currencies. Consequently, investors are increasingly seeking alternative hedges rather than holding cash.Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this lowDXY US Dollar Index (left, green) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped below 100 for the first time since July 2023, as investors retreat from US markets amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 12% in the past 30 days and is now trading just 2% below its all-time high of $3,500. Declining confidence in the US Treasury’s ability to finance its debt favors scarce assets such as Bitcoin.While the probability of multiple rate cuts has diminished, this scenario may still be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Should the Fed be pressured to expand its balance sheet, it would likely fuel inflation and erode the value of fixed-income investment factors that ultimately support cryptocurrencies.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement. Bitcoin Risk-Off signal indicator. Source: CryptoQuantIn 2019, the same signal preceded a staggering 1,550% rally that saw Bitcoin soar above $68,000 in 2021. Data from CryptoQuant indicates that the Risk-Off signal combines six metrics: downside and upside volatility, exchange inflows, funding rates, futures open interest, and market capitalization. Collectively, they provide a balanced view of correction risk, making the signal a data-oriented gauge for market trends. The last time the Risk-Off Signal indicated a low-risk investment environment, Bitcoin was valued at $4,000. Several factors can explain the price disparity. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in 2024 opened the floodgates to institutional capital, boosting demand and stabilizing prices.

2025-05-06T15:41:51.000Z,"Is it a bull or bear market? How to tell the difference","TL;DR:Not sure if you’re in a bull or bear market? This guide breaks down how to spot the difference using price action, volume, sentiment and onchain data. Learn how to recognize market cycles, what signals to watch for and how to adjust your strategy for each phase so you can trade smarter.Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.In the simplest terms:A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your cousin to your Uber driver was buying crypto.On the flip side, a bear market is when prices drop consistently, investors pull back, and sentiment sours. A good example? 2022. After hitting all-time highs, the market tumbled. Bitcoin fell below $20,000, projects collapsed (remember Terra?), and even veteran traders started discussing “building in the bear.”Knowing what kind of market you’re in helps you make smarter moves, and that’s why this all matters. You don’t want to ape into memecoins during a downtrend or panic-sell just before a rebound. Recognizing market phases helps you invest more strategically, manage risk and crucially, keep your emotions in check. Which, in crypto, is half the battle.Did you know? In 18th-century England, “bearskin jobbers” were early short-sellers, traders who sold bearskins they didn’t yet own, betting prices would fall. The saying “don’t sell the bear’s skin before you’ve caught the bear” stuck, and so did the metaphor. The term bull came later, not only as the bear’s opposite, but also because of the upward motion of a bull’s horns when attacking.Understanding bull and bear marketsSure, crypto is “numbers on a chart.” But, it’s also stories, headlines and entire communities’ constantly shifting mood. Here’s how to understand bull and bear cycles: 1. Bull market characteristicsa) Sustained price increasesPrices rise in a bull market, sure. What’s more important is that they keep rising, often over weeks or months. You’ll see major coins climbing steadily and altcoins riding the wave. A textbook example? Bitcoin’s run in 2020–2021, where it jumped from ~$10,000 to $69,000. That rally had momentum, institutional backing (Tesla, Strategy, etc.), and serious retail FOMO.Or Dogecoin’s meme-fueled sprint in early 2021, going from joke status to $0.45 thanks to Elon tweets and Reddit hype.b) Positive investor sentimentYou’ll know sentiment is bullish when X feels euphoric, everyone’s calling for a BTC moonshot and new projects are launching daily with sky-high valuations. Money flows in fast, and even risky bets feel like obvious plays. That’s when you know that positive investor sentiment is in the air. c) Favorable economic indicatorsBull runs often line up with low interest rates, easy access to credit and generally tech-friendly conditions. During the 2020 bull, for instance, pandemic-era stimulus checks and low borrowing costs gave retail and institutional investors more ammo to deploy into digital assets.2. Bear market characteristicsa) Prolonged price declinesBear markets will drag on until the cows come home. Prices fall, then fall some more, and every slight bounce is sold off. Think 2018’s “crypto winter,” when Bitcoin crashed from $20,000 to around $3,000.Or 2022’s brutal downturn, when BTC dropped from $69,000 to under $20,000. That crash wasn’t really about price either; it was fuelled by implosions like Terra-Luna, Celsius and the FTX scandal. The dominoes just kept falling.Bear markets tend to feel like the party’s over. b) Negative investor sentimentDuring bear phases, fear takes over. Headlines turn grim, social media goes quiet and even die-hard believers start questioning their convictions. Funding dries up, dev teams go silent and “exit liquidity” jokes make the rounds.c) Adverse economic conditionsMacro headwinds don’t help. High interest rates, inflation fears or tightening monetary policy often make things worse. In 2022, for example, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes made risk assets, including crypto, far less appealing.Key indicators to identify market phasesWhile no single metric can give you 100% certainty, there are a handful of time-tested indicators that traders and analysts rely on. Let’s break down the indicators you can use, aside from the obvious one (price). Trading volumeVolume tells you how much conviction is behind the price moves.In a bull market, rising prices are often backed by strong trading volume. More buyers step in, more liquidity enters the market and the rally feels supported.During a bear market, volume tends to dry up. Price drops are met with weak buying pressure and it can feel like no one wants to touch the market.Low volume plus a declining price? Not a great sign if you’re hoping for a bounce.Did you know? During the 2021 bull run, Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading volume, with nearly $70 billion traded in a single day as its price soared to $0.45Market sentimentOne tool many investors rely on is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. It measures social media activity, volatility, Google search trends and more to gauge whether investors feel optimistic (greedy) or pessimistic (fearful).Extreme greed often pops up near the top.Extreme fear tends to appear near the bottom, though it can hang around in deeper downturns.Check it daily, but don’t let it drive your whole strategy. It’s a mood ring, not a crystal ball.Technical indicatorsYou don’t have to be a chart wizard to spot a few helpful signals.Moving averages: When the price is consistently above the 200-day moving average, it’s generally bullish. When it dips below, that’s often a warning sign. These are long-term trend indicators, not day-trading tools.Relative strength index (RSI): This measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold: Readings above 70 suggest it’s overheated and due for a pullback, while readings below 30 may indicate it’s oversold with potential to bounce.None of this is gospel, but it helps you get a feel for momentum.Fundamental factorsSometimes the biggest market movers don’t show up on a chart.Bullish signs might include:Big-name institutional adoption (like BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF).Friendly regulatory news or court wins for crypto firms.Major tech milestones (think Ethereum upgrades or layer-2 rollouts).Meanwhile, bearish signs often look like:Regulatory crackdowns (the SEC targeting major exchanges).High-profile security breaches or protocol failures.Global instability — inflation, war or financial contagion.Once you know what to look for, the next step is figuring out where. Fortunately, crypto comes with a treasure trove of free tools if you know where to dig.Charting platforms If you want to understand price action, you need solid charts.TradingView is known for customizable charts and technical indicators.Cointelegraph offers clear overviews of prices, market caps and volume trends that are especially useful for tracking newer or smaller tokens.Did you know? TradingView’s charting tools are integrated directly into many of the world’s top crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Sentiment analysisCrypto is more mood than math. Tools like LunarCrush track social media activity, influencer buzz and trending tokens. If Dogecoin starts heating up again, you’ll probably see the early signs there.Onchain dataWant to know what the whales are doing? Platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant surface data like wallet flows, miner activity and exchange balances. It’s like reading the blockchain’s heartbeat. You’ll often spot capital shifts before they show up in the price.Strategies for navigating different market conditionsUnderstanding the cycle is one thing. Knowing how to act on it is another. Your playbook should change depending on whether you’re riding a bull or surviving a bear.Bull market strategiesTrend following: When the market’s running hot, sometimes the best move is to go with the flow, but stay disciplined. Focus on assets in strong uptrends, and don’t get caught chasing green candles without a plan.Profit-taking: Set targets and honor them. It’s easy to get greedy when everything’s pumping, but taking profits on the way up helps you avoid the dreaded round trip: watching your gains vanish in the next drawdown.Risk management: Even bull markets pull back. Use stop-losses or trailing stops to lock in gains and guard against surprise reversals. You’ll thank yourself later.Bear market strategiesDefensive positioning: Sometimes, the smartest trade is no trade. Moving part of your portfolio into stablecoins or sticking to less volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) can help preserve capital while others panic.Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Trying to time the exact bottom? Good luck. DCA smooths the ride by spreading your entries over time, lowering your average cost and helping you stay engaged without overcommitting.Focus on fundamentals: Bear markets strip away the noise. What survives are the projects with real use, strong teams and long-term vision. If you’re holding through a downturn, ensure you’re holding for the right reasons.By failing to prepare, you are preparing to failBull or bear, crypto never stops moving, but that doesn’t mean you have to react to every swing. Price trends, sentiment shifts, volume patterns and fundamentals can all clue you in on where you are in the cycle. Armed with the right tools and a calm mindset, you can tune out the noise and act with clarity.Markets reward preparation, and knowing whether you’re in bull territory or bear country is one of the most powerful tools you can have.Happy trading! This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-06T15:19:22.000Z,"North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview","For months, Cointelegraph took part in an investigation centered around a suspected North Korean operative that uncovered a cluster of threat actors attempting to score freelancing gigs in the cryptocurrency industry.The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”Ultimately, Motoki accidentally exposed links to a cluster of North Korean threat actors, then rage-quit the call.Here’s what happened.Suspected North Korean crypto spy posed as a Japanese developerGarcia first encountered Motoki on GitHub in late January while investigating a cluster linked to a suspected DPRK threat actor known as “bestselection18.” This account is widely believed to be operated by an experienced DPRK IT infiltrator. It was part of a broader group of suspected operatives who had infiltrated the crypto gig economy through freelancing platforms such as OnlyDust.Most North Korean state actors don’t use a human face photo in their accounts, so Motoki’s profile, which had one, hooked Garcia’s attention. “I went straight to the point and just wrote to him on Telegram,” Garcia told Cointelegraph, explaining how he created an alter ego as a headhunter for a company looking for talent. “It was pretty easy. I didn’t even say the company name.”On Feb. 24, Garcia invited Cointelegraph’s South Korean reporter to join an upcoming interview for his fake company — with the hope of speaking to the suspected DPRK operative in Korean by the end of the call.We were intrigued; if we could meet with an operative, we had the opportunity to learn just how effective these tactics were and, hopefully, how they can be counteracted.On Feb. 25, Garcia and Cointelegraph met Motoki. We kept webcams off, but Motoki did not. During the interview, conducted in English, Motoki often repeated the same responses for different questions, turning the job interview into an awkward and stilted conversation.Motoki displayed questionable behavior inconsistent with that of a legitimate Japanese developer. For one, he couldn’t speak the language.Related: From Sony to Bybit: How Lazarus Group became crypto’s supervillainWe asked Motoki to introduce himself in Japanese. The screenlight reflecting off his face suggested he was frantically searching through tabs and windows to find a script to help him answer.There was a long, tense silence.“Jiko shōkai o onegaishimasu,” Cointelegraph repeated the request, this time in Japanese.Motoki frowned, threw off his headset, and left the interview.Motoki sensed something was off moments before leaving the interview.Compared to bestselection18, Motoki was sloppy. He revealed key details by sharing his screen in the interview. Garcia theorized that Motoki is likely a lower-level operative working with bestselection18.Motoki had two calls with Garcia, one of which was with Cointelegraph. In the two calls, his screenshare revealed access to private GitHub repositories with bestselection18 for what Garcia calls a defunct scam project.“That’s how we linked the whole operation and the whole cluster… He shared his screen and revealed he was working with [bestselection18] in a private repo,” Garcia said.Linguistic clues point to North Korean originsIn a 2018 study, researchers observed that Korean males tend to have wider, more prominent facial structures than their East Asian neighbors, while Japanese males typically have longer, narrower faces. While broad generalizations, in this case, Motoki’s appearance aligned more closely with the Korean profile described in the study.“Okay, so let me introduce myself. So, I am an experienced engineer in blockchain and AI with a focus on developing innovation and impactful products,” Motoki said during the interview, his eyes scanning from left to right as if reading a script.An ID card submitted to Garcia by Motoki in his job application. Source: KetmanMotoki’s English pronunciation offered more clues. He frequently pronounced words beginning with “r” as “l,” a substitution common among Korean speakers. Japanese speakers also struggle with this distinction but tend to merge the two sounds into a neutral flap.He seemed more relaxed during personal questions. Motoki said he was born and raised in Japan, had no wife or children, and claimed native fluency. “I like football,” he smiled, pronouncing it with a strong “p” sound — another hint more typical of Korean-accented English.Related: The whale, the hack and the psychological earthquake that hit HEXMotoki unveils one more North Korean tacticAbout a week after the interview with Cointelegraph, Garcia attempted to prolong the charade. He messaged Motoki and claimed that his boss had fired him due to the dubious interview.That led to three weeks of private message exchanges with Motoki. Garcia continued to play along, pretending Motoki was a Japanese developer.Garcia later asked Motoki for help finding a job. In response, Motoki offered a deal that provided additional insight into some of North Korea’s operational methods.“They told me they would send me money to buy a computer so they could work through my computer,” Garcia said.The arrangement would allow the operator to remotely access a machine from another location and carry out tasks without needing a VPN connection, which can trigger issues on popular freelancing platforms.Motoki attempts to access a US-based PC through remote applications like AnyDesk. Source: KetmanGarcia and his partner published their findings on the cluster of suspected DPRK operatives tied to bestselection18 on April 16 on open-source investigative platform Ketman.A few days later, Cointelegraph received a message from Garcia: “The guy we interviewed is gone. All his socials changed. All the chats and everything around him has been deleted.”Motoki has not been heard from since.Suspected DPRK operatives have become a recurring problem for recruiters across tech industries. Even major crypto exchanges are targeted. On May 2, Kraken reported it identified a North Korean cyber spy attempting to land a job at the US crypto trading platform.A United Nations Security Council report estimates that North Korean IT workers generate up to $600 million annually for the regime. These spies are able to funnel consistent wages back to North Korea. The UN believes those funds help finance its weapons program — which, as of January 2024, is thought to include more than 50 nuclear warheads.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-spy-reveals-ties-in-fake-job-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threatIn traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead to higher investment. Take the European Union's pre-Brexit single market. Investment flows slowed when the United Kingdom's exit fragmented access to capital pools, as economists tracking cross-border activity noted. Ethereum faces a decentralized parallel. Rollups, particularly those that are optimistic and ZK-based, impose delays of up to a week on withdrawals and offer only patchy cross-rollup liquidity. The result is a fragmented system in which adoption slows, and capital is underused.Developers are left with two poor choices. Either they focus on one rollup and limit their audience, or fragment liquidity across several and accept inefficiencies. Neither option serves the ecosystem's long-term interests. A significant opportunity lies, therefore, with protocols that remove these frictions. They will attract more capital, operate more efficiently, and deliver better experiences.Recent: 3 reasons Ethereum could turn a cornerCapital movement must be abstracted away from the end-user. Bridges and withdrawal queues should become protocol-level concerns, not user problems. It is feasible for liquidity deployed on one rollup to satisfy demand on another, with background rebalancing ensuring solvency and efficiency. What today seems complex can be made invisible.This design shift from reactive bridging to intent-based liquidity coordination would restore composability and preserve decentralization. More importantly, it would uphold Ethereum's core principles of building open systems without central gatekeepers. Without it, users will continue to rely on centralized exchanges to bypass friction, compromising self-custody for convenience. This is not just a technical challenge — it is a philosophical one.Designing around friction is the competitive edgeDesigning around capital efficiency is becoming a competitive edge. Tomorrow's DeFi protocols will not simply compete on fees or yield. They will compete on how well they can access liquidity across a fractured landscape. The winners will be those that can fulfill a user's request wherever the user is without requiring them to move funds manually. The result will be better UX, more productive capital, and higher network stickiness.Some underlying technologies are beginning to address the problem. Ethereum-native rollups, planned after a hard fork in 2026, promise closer integration, and while they are still not ready for deployment, based rollups offer tighter alignment with Ethereum by sharing sequencing and improving settlement while sacrificing some independence. In the meantime, optimistic rollups are racing to implement zero-knowledge proofs to speed up exits. These innovations reduce friction, but they are not enough on their own. Scale will come from applications designed around these constraints, not from the base layers alone.Zk-Rollups are particularly well suited for this. Their cryptographic structure allows for low-latency and trust-minimized messaging between chains. This makes them ideal for applications like payments, decentralized trading, and real-time financial products, all of which demand speed and certainty. If Ethereum can make such cross-rollup flows seamless, it will not just scale. It will become the backbone of a more efficient financial system.That outcome is not guaranteed. Tariffing rollups may serve short-term goals, but in the long run, they would weaken the very network Ethereum aims to strengthen. Solana, for example, already offers composability within a single domain. While Ethereum's modular approach is arguably more robust, it cannot afford to ignore the usability cost of fragmentation.Ethereum's greatest strength is its neutrality. That should include the ability of capital to move freely within its ecosystem. The future will not be built by taxing rollups. It will be built by enabling them to function as one economic engine.Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of Malda.

2025-05-06T14:25:00.000Z,"What bankers, CPAs and CFOs need to know about blockchain","Why finance veterans are still skeptical about blockchain              Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.Uncertainty about practical applicationsBlockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.A 2021 APQC survey identified the main hurdles: a lack of industry-wide adoption, skill gaps, trust issues, financial constraints and problems with interoperability. Even organizations that want to embrace blockchain often struggle to turn ideas into working solutions.Doubts about necessitySome finance professionals aren’t convinced blockchain is necessary at all.The same APQC survey showed trust issues and a lack of understanding as major reasons for the slow adoption. Without a clear and compelling return on investment (ROI), it’s tough to justify tearing up existing systems that, frankly, still work.Lack of understanding Maybe the biggest obstacle? A lack of understanding. A 2024 study revealed that only 13.7% of financial advisers engage with clients about cryptocurrencies despite increasing client interest and the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between 2021 and 2024. Moreover, while groups like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) are trying to build frameworks for blockchain compliance and auditing, there’s no standard playbook yet. And without clarity, leadership teams are stuck. This article will aim to address each of these skepticisms, ultimately providing an answer to how blockchain fits into finance in 2025.Did you know? Christina Lynn, a behavioral finance researcher and certified financial planner, highlighted in her 2024 Journal of Financial Planning article that many financial advisers dismiss cryptocurrency due to biases, fear and regulatory concerns despite growing investor interest. She urges advisers to educate themselves, adopt a balanced approach, and provide guidance to avoid client mistakes.                  The 2025 blockchain landscape: Key developments              Unbeknownst to many, thanks to regulatory shifts, stablecoins gaining ground and major institutions building on-chain infrastructure, blockchain is moving from experimental to essential within finance. Below are the developments serving as key contributors in 2025.Regulatory shiftsThe US Federal Reserve has relaxed its 2022 stance, no longer requiring banks to get explicit approval to offer crypto services. Similar signals from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency show that regulators are starting to treat blockchain as a legitimate tool.At the same time, SEC Chair Paul Atkins is pushing for clearer, innovation-friendly crypto rules, moving away from vague enforcement tactics and toward a more structured regulatory framework.Stablecoin stampedeThe stablecoin market capitalization has climbed to nearly $240 billion as of late April 2025, brushing up against an all-time high. Regulators are also stepping up. In Europe, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework is now fully live, laying down clear ground rules for crypto assets. For stablecoins, that means strict 1:1 reserve requirements and a crackdown on anything resembling an algorithmic model without real backing. Meanwhile, in the US, lawmakers are making moves, too. The STABLE Act, reintroduced in March, proposes tighter oversight over stablecoin issuers and even suggests a two-year freeze on new algorithmic coins. Alongside it, the GENIUS Act aims to set up a whole new licensing system for stablecoins, making issuers meet banking-level standards for reserves, redemption rights and compliance.The private sector isn’t sitting still either. Coinbase recently waived fees on PayPal’s PYUSD (PYUSD) transactions and now offers seamless USD redemptions. It’s a smart play to make stablecoins more visible in day-to-day finance. And the uptake isn’t just happening in the US. In Asia, stablecoins are becoming a go-to for cross-border remittances because they’re faster and cheaper than traditional methods. In Latin America, they’re being used to hedge against local currency collapses; in Brazil, for example, stablecoins now make up over 80% of crypto transactions. In different corners of the world, stablecoins are solving very real problems.Blockchain goes bigProjects like JPMorgan’s Kinexys and Citigroup’s permissioned blockchain platform show that major banks are actively investing in tokenization, digital asset settlement and blockchain infrastructure for global finance.Did you know? The global blockchain market is projected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027, up from $26.91 billion in 2024.                  Blockchain in banking operations              As of 2025, blockchain is helping streamline settlements, tighten compliance, and transform cross-border payments from a headache into a smooth operation. Here’s how:Real-time settlement and clearingMoving money between banks — especially across borders — used to be a slow, messy process. Layers of intermediaries meant delays, high fees and plenty of room for errors.By cutting out intermediaries and verifying transactions directly, blockchain enables near-instant settlement, slashing turnaround times dramatically.In fact, JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform (part of its Onyx suite) now processes over $2 billion in daily transactions, using JPM Coin to settle payments across banks and currencies in real time.It’s an example of a live system handling serious volume with the help of a blockchain.Enhanced KYC and AML complianceKnow Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks have always been necessary — but painfully slow and repetitive.Blockchain offers a smarter way to handle them. A tamper-proof ledger allows banks to securely store and share verified customer information, speeding up audits and reducing compliance headaches.Another real-world example from JPMorgan is Liink, which runs a blockchain-inspired service called Confirm, which helps banks validate over 2 billion bank accounts across more than 3,500 financial institutions, dramatically improving efficiency for KYC processes.Cheaper, faster cross-border paymentsSending money internationally used to take days and came with hefty fees.With blockchain, transactions can settle in minutes, and fees are significantly lower.Real-world moves:HSBC and Ant Group: In 2023, they ran real-time HKD-denominated tokenized transactions under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Ensemble Sandbox, giving businesses 24/7 cross-bank transfers.Wells Fargo: Implemented HSBC’s blockchain-based system for foreign exchange settlements, reducing risk and speeding up cross-border FX deals.Even Deloitte estimates that blockchain could slash cross-border payment costs by 40%-80%, saving the industry up to $24 billion a year.This all shows that banks are betting real money and real infrastructure on blockchain delivering real value.Did you know? Visa’s Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) allows banks to mint, burn and transfer fiat-backed tokens, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins.Considerations for banksOf course, blockchain isn’t a panacea. There are a few things banks need to keep in mind:Integration is critical: Blockchain systems have to plug into existing core banking infrastructure. Full rip-and-replace projects aren’t practical (or cheap).Training matters: New systems won’t work if the people running them don’t know how. Banks need to upskill teams across compliance, operations and IT.Customer experience comes first: It’s not just about making internal processes faster — clients need to feel the difference, too.Behind the scenes, accounting and auditing firms are also finding that blockchain can fix long-standing pain points. That’s what will be explored next.                  Blockchain in accounting and auditing              Accounting and auditing might not be flashy headlines, but behind the scenes, blockchain is slowly changing how financial data is managed, verified and reported.Better data security and fraud preventionWith blockchain, once a transaction is recorded, it can’t be altered without consensus from the network. This built-in immutability drastically reduces the risk of tampering or fraud and strengthens the integrity of financial records.More transparency = better auditsAuditors no longer need to stitch together fragmented information from multiple systems. Blockchain provides a single, real-time, tamper-proof trail of transactions, making audits faster, more accurate and more reliable.Streamlined reconciliation and reportingBlockchain simplifies day-to-day reporting, too. Instead of manually reconciling across different ledgers, authorized parties all have access to a shared, automatically updating record.Adoption challengesOf course, it’s not all smooth sailing.Lack of standardization: There’s still no universal rulebook for blockchain accounting. Groups like the AICPA and the International Accounting Standards Board are issuing early guidance, but without global standards, firms must tread carefully.Integration woes: Most firms still use legacy enterprise resource planning and accounting platforms that weren’t designed for blockchain. Integrating — or deciding when to overhaul — poses serious technical and financial challenges.Regulatory uncertainty: Regulations around digital assets and blockchain-based transactions are evolving fast. Firms must keep their internal controls and reporting practices agile to stay compliant.Did you know? The concept of triple-entry accounting, enabled by blockchain, adds a third component to traditional double-entry systems.                  Blockchain for CFOs and treasurers              In 2025, blockchain is a practical tool for chief financial officers and treasurers looking to sharpen financial reporting, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen risk controls.Strategic applicationsReal-time financial reporting and analysis: Blockchain’s tamper-proof, real-time data streams give CFOs instant access to financial performance. No more waiting for reconciliations — finance teams can forecast and pivot with live numbers at their fingertips.Smart contracts for compliance and transactions: Smart contracts automate routine processes like compliance checks and payment executions, reducing human error and ensuring agreements are enforced exactly as written.Tokenization for capital raising and asset management: Tokenizing assets such as real estate, equipment or equity opens new doors for raising capital and improving liquidity. Fractional ownership models also make it easier to access a broader investor base.Risk management considerationsWhile blockchain enhances security overall, it’s not invulnerable. Strong access controls, regular audits and active network monitoring are essential to protect systems and assets. Organizations also need contingency plans in place, since blockchain networks can experience outages or latency issues; having off-chain fallback procedures ensures business continuity during disruptions.Finally, CFOs and treasurers must stay actively engaged, working closely with legal teams and regulators to stay ahead of compliance risks and future-proof their operations.                  Best practices for blockchain compliance              If you’re operating — or planning to operate — in blockchain environments, these practices should be at the top of your checklist.Establish robust internal controlsManaging digital assets safely demands stricter-than-ever internal controls. That means:Segregation of dutiesRole-based access systemsRigorous transaction validation.Without these safeguards, the risk of fraud or mismanagement climbs quickly.Engage with regulators earlyOrganizations that wait for final rulings often find themselves scrambling. Proactively building relationships with regulatory bodies helps you stay informed and adapt to early guidance.For example, a licensed Swiss crypto bank, SEBA, engaged early with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and became one of the first banks to secure a banking and securities dealer license in 2019. Its proactive compliance approach allowed it to operate both crypto and traditional assets legally in Switzerland.In addition, the Crypto Valley Association (based in Zug) collaborates regularly with Swiss regulators to shape clear, forward-thinking crypto and blockchain policies. They’ve been instrumental in making Switzerland one of the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions.Invest in ongoing compliance trainingBlockchain regulation is in flux. Regular training ensures your finance and compliance teams are ready to adapt.Everyone from junior auditors to senior compliance officers needs to stay fluent in blockchain fundamentals, regulatory updates and best practices.By building these habits into your organization now, you’ll be better equipped in the long term.                  Actionable steps for finance professionals              So, blockchain does have real use cases in finance; it is here to stay and needs to be firmly on your radar. Here’s how different finance professionals can start making smart, manageable moves today:For bankersFocus on practical wins first.Look for areas where blockchain can immediately improve operations, like speeding up settlements, streamlining compliance processes or making loan servicing more transparent.Instead of jumping into a full blockchain overhaul, pilot small initiatives in targeted areas like trade finance or cross-border payments. This way, you can measure results with minimal risk.Also, partnering with fintechs that specialize in blockchain infrastructure can accelerate your learning curve and implementation, letting you tap into blockchain benefits without rebuilding internal systems from scratch.For CPAs and auditorsStay current with evolving standards — especially updated AICPA guidance on digital asset accounting and blockchain auditing.Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and auditors also need to build technical expertise because auditing blockchain records isn’t the same as auditing traditional ledgers.You’ll need to understand:How blockchain structures dataHow verification worksWhat best practices apply to blockchain audit trails.Moreover, don’t be afraid to advocate for blockchain adoption at your firm — especially when it can boost transparency, lower risk, and strengthen the credibility of financial reporting.For CFOs and treasurers When evaluating blockchain initiatives, look through a financial lens first. Consider:How blockchain impacts cash flowHow tokenization might affect your balance sheetHow stablecoins or blockchain-based settlements could influence treasury operations.If tokenization or stablecoin strategies are even on the horizon for your business, they should already be reflected in your three- to five-year strategic plans.Also, don’t go it alone: Engage with peer networks, industry groups and blockchain-focused finance events. Real-world insights from other CFOs and treasurers can help you spot opportunities and avoid common early-adoption pitfalls.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-bankers-cpas-and-cfos-need-to-know-about-blockchain?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It is expensive to access and only available in the territories that companies pay for,” he noted, adding:“A blockchain-based incentivization system provides better results in terms of frequency, participation, and coverage.”“We’re giving Tesla drivers access and storage for their vehicle’s camera feed — while earning rewards for contributing 360° imagery that will be used for better mapping solutions and to power physical AI,” Natix said in the announcement.Source: NatixFor the tech to pay attention to map events like accidents and roadwork as well as traffic signs, Natix has also been building AI pipelines for the extraction of data, Ghods said, adding:“Some are internal efforts, and now we plan to tap into Grab’s AI capabilities as they have cutting-edge technology already built for this need.”Grab’s growing interest in crypto and blockchainGrab’s new partnership with Natix is another milestone in the company’s growing number of blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption use cases.In March 2024, Grab partnered with the payments firm Triple-A to enable its clients to pay for services using five cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) stablecoin.An excerpt from Circle’s case study on Grab.

2025-05-06T12:28:58.000Z,"US stablecoin bill loses democrats amid Trump corruption concerns","Democratic lawmakers in Washington are backing off support for crypto legislation amid heightened concerns over corruption, including the conduct of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI).In March, the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins in the US, passed a critical committee reading with the support of several pro-crypto Democrats. Democratic Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester, Andy Kim and Angela Alsobrooks voted with Republicans, opposite lead Democrat and prominent crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren.The bill passed the committee only after a number of changes were made, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and provisions for Anti-Money Laundering, countering terrorism financing and risk management procedures. Now, it seems that even those provisions are insufficient to quell Democratic concerns. Following some high-profile crypto deals that personally enrich President Donald Trump, Congressional Democrats are pulling their support.Bipartisan efforts on stablecoin bills endangeredOf the five pro-crypto Democrats to pass the GENIUS Act in the Senate Banking Committee, four signed their names to a statement on May 3, saying that they do not feel comfortable with the direction stablecoin legislation is taking. “The bill as it currently stands still has numerous issues that must be addressed, including adding stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, preserving the safety and soundness of our financial system, and accountability,” the announcement reads.The statement does not explicitly call out corruption nor mention Trump by name, but taken alongside other measures from Democratic lawmakers, it shows a growing reticence to engage on cryptocurrency issues.As Cointelegraph reported on May 5, Representative Maxine Waters and other Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee plan to leave a House of Representatives hearing on crypto titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets” on May 6. According to a staffer familiar with the matter, this would sink the hearing, as House rules require all committee members to be present. The hearing concerns a draft bill, announced by Representative French Hill and other top Republicans on May 5, that would change how US financial regulators, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), treat cryptocurrencies.Related: New crypto bill draft seen to curb big crypto firm influenceWaters, who has previously called for bipartisan cooperation on crypto legislation, has harshly criticized Trump, specifically his WLFI crypto investment firm. She characterized his TRUMP memecoin, released on his inauguration, as “the worst of crypto” and has been particularly vocal about the WLFI USD1 stablecoin project.At a markup hearing on April 2 concerning the STABLE Act — a draft bill circulating the House regarding stablecoins — Waters said the bill, in its current form, allows the president and insiders to “enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.”“If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” said Waters.Even Hill, a Republican leading the charge for crypto in Washington, said that Trump’s crypto projects complicate Congress’ ability to pass legislation.Stablecoin support as political leverageCorruption concerns may be one factor behind Democrats’ pumping the brakes on bipartisan crypto laws, but some observers believe it could be more of a political ploy. Aaron Brogan, a lawyer specializing in regulatory issues in the cryptocurrency industry, said it’s “unlikely that this group of Senators suddenly came to their senses and realized that the mostly benign stablecoin bill they had previously supported lacked protections they refused to name.”Brogan suggested that either lawmakers wanted to use support for the bill as leverage — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly urged Democratic lawmakers in private not to commit to the bill for this very reason — or an influential donor wants to kill the bill or use it as leverage. Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?Protect Progress, a major political action committee supporting crypto, donated millions to Gallego’s campaign, Brogan noted. He said it is possible that major donors to the committee (i.e., Coinbase) would rather see the bill replaced with something more to their liking. While he said it’s impossible to know for sure, “Coinbase has attempted to bundle the pending market structure legislation with stablecoins to make it more likely to pass,” he said. WLFI accused of shady dealingWLFI has already netted some $550 million from Trump token sales and is sealing more deals that will enrich its founders and board members, many of whom are Trump family members. One of them, Eric Trump, announced on May 1 that Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX would use USD1 to settle its $2-billion investment in global crypto exchange Binance.At Token2049, Eric Trump praised the UAE for its crypto-friendly approach, saying that the regulation-heavy EU is a “lost cause.”In November 2024, the founder of the Tron blockchain, Justin Sun, became the largest investor in WLFI when he bought some $30 million in TRUMP. More recent reports suggest he has spent nearly $70 million. On Feb. 24, just one month after Trump took office, the SEC, then with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda at the helm, halted its civil fraud investigation into Sun despite previous allegations that Sun and the Tron Foundation had illegally distributed tokens, concealed celebrity donations, and inflated trade volumes. Critics claimed that the president was selling exposure to the highest bidder when WLFI announced that top TRUMP tokenholders would be welcomed to a gala with the president himself. This prompted one lawmaker to suggest impeachment — a pipedream in a Congress with Republican majorities in both houses. WLFI has not responded publicly or on social media to these criticisms. In a May 5 interview with Meet the Press on NBC, President Trump downplayed the project, saying he was “not profiting from anything.” He said he hasn’t “even looked” at his portfolio.He also rejected the idea that he should forgo any profits from WLFi. “Should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so,” he said.With purported scandals and pressure mounting on Democratic officials to block Republican efforts on the Hill, the possibility of a bipartisan stablecoin bill, much less a crypto framework, looks increasingly bleak. Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-stablecoin-bill-loses-democratic-support-trump-corruption-concerns?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

However, lawyers still need to catch up. “Most blockchains nowadays, especially things like Solana, are fast enough for institutions to use them,” Federa said. “It’s really more about the institutions and the institution’s lawyers getting comfortable with crypto.”Federa added that institutional lawyers and compliance teams are still addressing regulatory concerns. The executive said this may slow adoption despite the growing regulatory clarity in key markets like the United States. DoubleZero Labs founder Austin Federa. Source: CointelegraphInstitutions are coming; they just move slowAccording to Federa, technical infrastructure is no longer a primary barrier for large firms. Tools needed to support enterprise-scale activity on networks like Solana are already in place:  “Especially on networks like Solana and other fast networks, the infrastructure is there today for high amounts of institutional adoption.”While crypto community members may feel like institutional adoption should be bigger than it is, Federa said that these organizations are not quick at onboarding new technologies.  “Institutions are coming on board, but they just move really slow,” Federa told Cointelegraph. “People expect these massive institutions to move fast, but that’s just not what they’re good at.” Until legal departments are fully satisfied with risk controls and compliance structures, Federa said meaningful adoption may unfold gradually. Related: DoubleZero’s alternative to public internet targets mainnet rollout in H2Institutional involvement in crypto infrastructureFedera also highlighted a growing trend of institutional involvement in the crypto infrastructure space. He said that bare-metal infrastructure providers and venture capital firms have offered financial support and contributed actual fiber infrastructure to DoubleZero. This kind of commitment was almost unthinkable just a few years ago, he said. “Most of those companies two years ago would not have had any interest or thought it was way too legally risky to take something and contribute fiber to it.”Unlike running a validator node, deploying fiber and infrastructure is a major commitment. Federa said that institutional players now allocating serious resources to crypto-native projects reflects a shift in how traditional finance views the sector.Despite this, he acknowledged that while institutional adoption grew, the broader crypto product landscape isn’t fully mature. “The products are not quite there yet for the most part,” Federa said.Magazine: Solana ‘will be a trillion-dollar asset’: Mert Mumtaz, X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-infrastructure-crypto-austin-federa-doublezero?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-06T11:19:48.000Z,"Research DAO claims paralyzed rats recover after spinal cord fix","Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) HydraDAO claims that its researchers were able to use a novel technique to repair severed spines in rats.In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.Source: HydraDAOThe post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting. The effort in question is the Dowell spinal fusogens project led by Michael Lebenstein-Gumovski, which raised 380,700 USDC (USDC) from donors. The dedicated HydraDAO page reads:“The Dowell team submitted a project proposal to HydraDAO. After careful consideration and two peer reviews, HydraCore deems it in the interest of HydraDAO’s community.“Related: Experts to gather in Miami to drive longevity research forwardMore than smoke and mirrors?Fusogens are chemicals capable of fusing cell membranes and have long been researched as a means to reconnect severed nerve fibers. One such chemical is polyethylene glycol (PEG), which was shown to promote membrane fusion and seal axonal membranes in other research.The Dowell team adds a biopolymer from crustacean shells called chitosan, resulting in a PEG-chitosan compound dubbed neuro-PEG. This compound is also photopolymerizable, meaning it can be rapidly solidified using light.This presumably allows for creating a solid scaffolding that can weld the spinal cord more permanently than liquid PEG-based solutions. Dowell also implements neuroprotection techniques such as localized hypothermia and cellular death inhibitors to prevent further damage to nerve tissue. A 2023 research paper by Gumovski published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Surgical Neurology International claimed that pigs treated with the compound recovered mobility in two months. The study’s conclusion read:“Neuro-PEG affords sensorimotor recovery after complete spinal cord transection. This opens the door to human experimentation, including trials of spinal cord transplantation.“The Dowell team also filed a patent for developed technologies, with a 2022 Russian patent describing a “method of restoring spinal cord functions after transection using a PEG-chitosan conjugate,” listing Lebenstein-Gumovski among its inventors.The HydraDAO proposal suggests that “revenue streams include specialized surgical kits priced between $3,500 and $20,000, depending on the market and region.” Furthermore, the team would also provide “comprehensive training and certification for neurosurgeons and emergency medical services” personnel.Related: Major scientific journal Nature features DeSci project ResearchHubSome interesting connectionsGumovski is a neurosurgery researcher based in Russia (Stavropol State Medical University and affiliated institutes). He was a member of Sergio Canavero’s research head-transplant project, cited in at least one relevant paper.Those articles were also published in Surgical Neurology International, while most top scientific publications shied away from the subject. The neurosurgeon from Turin, Italy, claimed to have performed a successful head transplant on a monkey back in 2016.The team also experimented on human cadavers in preparation for a 2017 live human head transplant, which never took place. Neuroscientist Dean Burnett said at the time that head transplantation presented insurmountable challenges and that Canavero had “offered no feasible explanation or science for his claims to be able to overcome these hurdles.”While the Dowell team’s project builds on established research and should not be dismissed outright, it is hard not to notice the similarity in making public claims not unlike those that characterized Canavero’s career. Furthermore, fusogens are well studied and less dramatic but similar results have been reported by other teams in the past (2019 example from the University of Texas).Will the paralyzed walk again?The evidence provided is promising, but it is advisable to exercise caution, especially until multiple third-party teams independently reproduce the results.HydraDAO promised additional electrophysiology experiments and tracing dyes to assess connectivity between the brain and lower spine. This extra data may enhance the credibility of the research results.Still, further research is needed to assess whether it will result in a clinically viable technique for real-world spinal injuries.Magazine: DeSci: Can crypto improve scientific research?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hydradao-spinal-cord-repair-neuropeg-rats?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The company could acquire approximately 3.52 million BTC if it purchases the cryptocurrency at May’s approximate price of $95,000. This equates to about 17.88% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply of 19.69 million coins.If the company tapped only its estimated $295.98 billion in US Treasury, it could buy around 3.12 million BTC, or 15.85% of the circulating supply, positioning it as a dominant player in the crypto market.Berkshire Hathaway is 20th Century Bitcoin.— Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 3, 2025Such a move would easily eclipse Nasdaq-listed Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy), the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, which owns 553,555 BTC worth approximately $52.2 billion as of May 6.In other words, Berkshire can theoretically match Strategy’s stash with roughly one-sixth of its cash pile if it converts it to Bitcoin.

However, Berkshire surprised markets by buying Barrick Gold shares (a gold mining company) in 2020, though it later sold that position.Under Abel, Berkshire may not dive straight into Bitcoin, but its cautious, indirect approach could expand as markets evolve.

He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. “We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”Mercuryo Petr Kozyakov at the Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: CointelegraphCrypto payroll gains momentum as payment options expandCrypto as a salary payment option is no longer a novelty. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that more companies are settling employee salaries with crypto assets. “That is a growing trend,” Kozyakov said. “I see a lot of businesses that are starting to settle with their full-time employees and with their gig employees all over the world, in crypto.”As more employees receive crypto salaries, new challenges can emerge. According to Kozyakov, workers paid in crypto may ask what they can do next with their funds. “You won’t invest everything and just wait. You need to use it for everyday purchases,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. This is where practical spending options are needed. Kozyakov said that crypto earners are looking for ways to use their digital asset incomes in daily life scenarios, whether buying coffee, going out for drinks or settling utility bills. As crypto becomes an option for employee salaries, there has also been a growing acceptance of crypto in employee contracts in some jurisdictions. In August 2024, a Dubai court recognized crypto as a valid form of salary payment. Related: OKX exec warns against hype amid real-world asset tokenization boomCrypto, a powerful tool for moving and storing moneyThe executive also told Cointelegraph that Mercuryo views crypto as more than just a speculative asset but a powerful tool for moving and storing value. “Crypto is not only an asset; it’s the perfect rail to move money and store money. And it is essential to be able to spend it.”The executive said that in practice, spending crypto can still be complex. He said it takes a few steps, including moving it to an exchange, sending it to a bank account and answering “weird” questions from banks. Because of this, he highlighted a need for easier ways to spend crypto directly.

2025-05-06T09:50:25.000Z,"IRS appoints Trish Turner to head crypto division amid resignations","Veteran US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official Trish Turner was appointed to lead the agency’s digital assets division following the departure of two key crypto-focused executives.Turner, who has spent over 20 years at the IRS and most recently served as a senior adviser within the Digital Assets Office, will now head the unit, according to a report from Bloomberg Tax citing a person familiar with the situation.Her promotion marks a significant leadership transition at a time when US crypto tax enforcement is facing both internal and external pressures.On May 5, Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks, two private-sector experts brought in to lead the IRS’s crypto unit, exited after roughly a year in their roles.Mukherjee served as compliance and implementation executive director, while Wilks oversaw strategy and development. Wilks announced his departure on LinkedIn, while Mukherjee confirmed his decision in a statement to Bloomberg Tax.“The reality is that federal employees have faced a very difficult environment over the past few months,” Wilks wrote. “If stepping aside helps preserve someone else’s job, then I am at peace with the decision.”Seth Wilks announced his departure on LinkedIn.

Additionally, the Department of Justice has announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.Internally, the IRS is also navigating instability. Over 23,000 employees have reportedly expressed interest in resigning after Trump reintroduced a deferred resignation policy, raising concerns about long-term staffing and morale within the agency.Magazine: Bitcoin to $1M ‘by 2029,’ CIA tips its hat to Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest, April 27 – May 3",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trish-turner-irs-crypto-division-leadership-shiftpto-division-amid-leadership-shakeup?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-06T09:08:36.000Z,"OKX exec warns against hype amid real-world asset tokenization boom","Crypto exchange OKX’s CEO for its Middle East and North Africa (MENA) arm urged the industry to focus on delivering real-world utility as interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates. In a Cointelegraph interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh warned that while tokenization is promising, projects must “clearly demonstrate” the benefits of tokenizing specific assets. “In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.He said hype can drive project growth in the Web3 space, but providing everyday value should be the priority. OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh at the Token2049 media lounge. Source: CointelegraphRWA tokenization gains traction in the UAEMahasneh’s comments come amid an increase in real-world asset tokenization projects in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates. On May 1, MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA agreement with the UAE-based real-estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk — the largest RWA initiative worldwide to date. In addition to billions in RWA deals, the UAE government has started working on RWA tokenization. On March 19, the Dubai Land Department — the government agency responsible for promoting, organizing and registering real estate in Dubai — announced a pilot phase of its real-estate tokenization project. The agency is working with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the emirate’s crypto regulator. On Jan. 9, RWA project Mantra also signed a $1 billion deal with Damac Group to tokenize the assets of the UAE-based conglomerate. However, months later, Mantra saw one of the biggest token collapses in crypto history, wiping out billions in market capitalization on April 13. Mahasneh told Cointelegraph that the region’s clear regulations help drive bigger institutions to get into tokenization and crypto. He said regulatory clarity allows understanding of how key players in the space, like exchanges, are governed. Related: Real estate not the best asset for RWA tokenization — Michael SonnensheinUAE stablecoin framework gives institutions confidenceThe executive also praised the region’s progress in stablecoin regulations. In June 2024, the Central Bank of the UAE approved a regulatory framework for stablecoin licensing. This clarified the issuance, supervision and licensing of dirham-backed payment tokens. According to Mahasneh, this demonstrates the UAE’s speed in regulating crypto-related technologies. The executive also highlighted that the central bank's involvement gives institutions extra confidence in entering the business. “Other markets are still debating whether they should have crypto regulations. Here, we moved into developing stablecoin regulations. For an investor, you want to know that your stablecoin is regulated. That’s a big plus,” Mahasneh said.Since then, major players like Tether have joined the race by issuing a dirham-pegged stablecoin. On April 29, institutions like Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ), First Abu Dhabi Bank and the International Holding Company partnered to launch a dirham-pegged stablecoin, pending regulatory approval. Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/okx-mena-ceo-rwa-tokenization-boom-token2049-dubai?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
