The move could allow the platform to offer political event contracts to users without contest.In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.Motion to dismiss appeal filed by the CFTC on May 5. Source: CourtlistenerKalshi stipulated in a joint filing that the company would “bear its own costs, court fees and attorney fees incurred” if the court granted the CFTC’s motion to dismiss. The platform said that “election markets are here to stay” in a May 6 X post following the filing.The betting platform initially filed a lawsuit against the CFTC in 2023 in response to the regulator ordering Kalshi to stop offering political event contracts. The company won in the lower court, prompting the appeal by the CFTC in September 2024. Motion to drop the appeal after the change in administration?The case was handled mainly before the US election and the appointment of acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham under President Donald Trump. CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, nominated by former President Joe Biden, reportedly echoed Kalshi’s sentiment in February, claiming that election prediction markets were “here to stay.”Related: Kalshi accepts Bitcoin deposits in bid to woo crypto-native usersLaunched in 2021, Kalshi became popular among many crypto users in part due to bets related to the 2024 US election. Though the CFTC argued in its appeal that betting on the elections could result in “spectacular manipulation” of markets and harm to the public interest, the regulator under Pham and Trump appeared to have reversed its position with the motion to dismiss. Magazine: Pokémon on Sui rumors, Polymarket bets on Filipino Pope: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cftc-dismiss-appeal-kalshi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-06T19:45:00.000Z,"Bitcoin could rally regardless of what the Federal Reserve FOMC decides this week: Here’s why","Key Takeaways:The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal environment for alternative hedge assets such as cryptocurrencies.Source: Jim PaulsenEconomist and investor Jim Paulsen notes that when Fed funds trade above a “neutral” interest rate (Fed Funds minus the annual core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index), the economy has historically moved toward recession or a “growth recession,” a period of sluggish growth with rising unemployment and weak consumer demand. Similar patterns since 1971 support this analysis.According to Paulsen, the Fed will likely be compelled to lower interest rates. Moreover, central bank Chair Jerome Powell is under significant pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has criticized the Fed for not reducing the cost of capital quickly enough.Reasons why the Fed could start easingConcerns about overheated markets remain as the US consumer inflation exceeds the 2% target, and April unemployment rates of 4.2% suggest no signs of economic weakness.FOMC rates estimate for the Sept. 17 decision. Source: CME FedWatchMarket expectations, as reflected in Treasury yield futures, show a 76% chance of interest rates at 4.0% or lower by Sept. 17. This probability has dropped considerably from 90% on April 29, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are growing less confident that the Fed will ease monetary policy. While this may initially seem bearish for risk assets, it could prompt the Treasury to inject liquidity into markets to support government spending.Regardless of the FOMC’s decision, some analysts point out that the Fed’s recent $20.5 billion Treasury bond purchase on May 5 signals renewed intervention. Additional liquidity has historically been bullish for cryptocurrencies, especially as the US dollar lags behind other major global currencies. Consequently, investors are increasingly seeking alternative hedges rather than holding cash.Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this lowDXY US Dollar Index (left, green) vs. Bitcoin/USD (orange). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThe US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped below 100 for the first time since July 2023, as investors retreat from US markets amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 12% in the past 30 days and is now trading just 2% below its all-time high of $3,500. Declining confidence in the US Treasury’s ability to finance its debt favors scarce assets such as Bitcoin.While the probability of multiple rate cuts has diminished, this scenario may still be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Should the Fed be pressured to expand its balance sheet, it would likely fuel inflation and erode the value of fixed-income investment factors that ultimately support cryptocurrencies.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Several factors can explain the price disparity. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in 2024 opened the floodgates to institutional capital, boosting demand and stabilizing prices. In fact, ETFs and public companies now hold 9% of the Bitcoin supply. ?LATEST: ETFs and public companies now hold 9% of Bitcoin's supply!

Between 2019 and 2025, the 1-year annualized realized volatility dropped by more than 80%. This maturing market absorbs capital inflows with less price disruption. Thus, growing mainstream adoption, regulatory clarity, and Bitcoin’s increasing role as a hedge against inflation have bolstered its value, setting a higher price floor compared to 2019.Bitcoin 1-year realized volatility vs Bitcoin price.

Historically, MCI’s RSI crossover has preceded massive rallies, such as the more than 500% surge in 2019. Combined with rising futures open interest and favorable funding rates, the MCI suggests Bitcoin could break $100,000 over the coming few weeks. Anonymous crypto analyst Darkfost pointed out that Bitcoin’s network activity index has declined sharply, reflecting reduced transaction volume and fewer daily active addresses since December 2024. The drop in UTXOs further indicates waning demand for block space, a pattern often seen in bear markets.Bitcoin Network activity index.

2025-05-06T15:41:51.000Z,"Is it a bull or bear market? How to tell the difference","TL;DR:Not sure if you’re in a bull or bear market? This guide breaks down how to spot the difference using price action, volume, sentiment and onchain data. Learn how to recognize market cycles, what signals to watch for and how to adjust your strategy for each phase so you can trade smarter.Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.In the simplest terms:A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your cousin to your Uber driver was buying crypto.On the flip side, a bear market is when prices drop consistently, investors pull back, and sentiment sours. A good example? 2022. After hitting all-time highs, the market tumbled. Bitcoin fell below $20,000, projects collapsed (remember Terra?), and even veteran traders started discussing “building in the bear.”Knowing what kind of market you’re in helps you make smarter moves, and that’s why this all matters. You don’t want to ape into memecoins during a downtrend or panic-sell just before a rebound. Recognizing market phases helps you invest more strategically, manage risk and crucially, keep your emotions in check. Which, in crypto, is half the battle.Did you know? In 18th-century England, “bearskin jobbers” were early short-sellers, traders who sold bearskins they didn’t yet own, betting prices would fall. The saying “don’t sell the bear’s skin before you’ve caught the bear” stuck, and so did the metaphor. The term bull came later, not only as the bear’s opposite, but also because of the upward motion of a bull’s horns when attacking.Understanding bull and bear marketsSure, crypto is “numbers on a chart.” But, it’s also stories, headlines and entire communities’ constantly shifting mood. Here’s how to understand bull and bear cycles: 1. Bull market characteristicsa) Sustained price increasesPrices rise in a bull market, sure. What’s more important is that they keep rising, often over weeks or months. You’ll see major coins climbing steadily and altcoins riding the wave. A textbook example? Bitcoin’s run in 2020–2021, where it jumped from ~$10,000 to $69,000. That rally had momentum, institutional backing (Tesla, Strategy, etc.), and serious retail FOMO.Or Dogecoin’s meme-fueled sprint in early 2021, going from joke status to $0.45 thanks to Elon tweets and Reddit hype.b) Positive investor sentimentYou’ll know sentiment is bullish when X feels euphoric, everyone’s calling for a BTC moonshot and new projects are launching daily with sky-high valuations. Money flows in fast, and even risky bets feel like obvious plays. That’s when you know that positive investor sentiment is in the air. c) Favorable economic indicatorsBull runs often line up with low interest rates, easy access to credit and generally tech-friendly conditions. During the 2020 bull, for instance, pandemic-era stimulus checks and low borrowing costs gave retail and institutional investors more ammo to deploy into digital assets.2. Bear market characteristicsa) Prolonged price declinesBear markets will drag on until the cows come home. Prices fall, then fall some more, and every slight bounce is sold off. Think 2018’s “crypto winter,” when Bitcoin crashed from $20,000 to around $3,000.Or 2022’s brutal downturn, when BTC dropped from $69,000 to under $20,000. That crash wasn’t really about price either; it was fuelled by implosions like Terra-Luna, Celsius and the FTX scandal. The dominoes just kept falling.Bear markets tend to feel like the party’s over. b) Negative investor sentimentDuring bear phases, fear takes over. Headlines turn grim, social media goes quiet and even die-hard believers start questioning their convictions. Funding dries up, dev teams go silent and “exit liquidity” jokes make the rounds.c) Adverse economic conditionsMacro headwinds don’t help. High interest rates, inflation fears or tightening monetary policy often make things worse. In 2022, for example, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes made risk assets, including crypto, far less appealing.Key indicators to identify market phasesWhile no single metric can give you 100% certainty, there are a handful of time-tested indicators that traders and analysts rely on. Let’s break down the indicators you can use, aside from the obvious one (price). Trading volumeVolume tells you how much conviction is behind the price moves.In a bull market, rising prices are often backed by strong trading volume. More buyers step in, more liquidity enters the market and the rally feels supported.During a bear market, volume tends to dry up. Price drops are met with weak buying pressure and it can feel like no one wants to touch the market.Low volume plus a declining price? Not a great sign if you’re hoping for a bounce.Did you know? During the 2021 bull run, Dogecoin experienced a surge in trading volume, with nearly $70 billion traded in a single day as its price soared to $0.45Market sentimentOne tool many investors rely on is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. It measures social media activity, volatility, Google search trends and more to gauge whether investors feel optimistic (greedy) or pessimistic (fearful).Extreme greed often pops up near the top.Extreme fear tends to appear near the bottom, though it can hang around in deeper downturns.Check it daily, but don’t let it drive your whole strategy. It’s a mood ring, not a crystal ball.Technical indicatorsYou don’t have to be a chart wizard to spot a few helpful signals.Moving averages: When the price is consistently above the 200-day moving average, it’s generally bullish. When it dips below, that’s often a warning sign. These are long-term trend indicators, not day-trading tools.Relative strength index (RSI): This measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold: Readings above 70 suggest it’s overheated and due for a pullback, while readings below 30 may indicate it’s oversold with potential to bounce.None of this is gospel, but it helps you get a feel for momentum.Fundamental factorsSometimes the biggest market movers don’t show up on a chart.Bullish signs might include:Big-name institutional adoption (like BlackRock applying for a Bitcoin ETF).Friendly regulatory news or court wins for crypto firms.Major tech milestones (think Ethereum upgrades or layer-2 rollouts).Meanwhile, bearish signs often look like:Regulatory crackdowns (the SEC targeting major exchanges).High-profile security breaches or protocol failures.Global instability — inflation, war or financial contagion.Once you know what to look for, the next step is figuring out where. Fortunately, crypto comes with a treasure trove of free tools if you know where to dig.Charting platforms If you want to understand price action, you need solid charts.TradingView is known for customizable charts and technical indicators.Cointelegraph offers clear overviews of prices, market caps and volume trends that are especially useful for tracking newer or smaller tokens.Did you know? TradingView’s charting tools are integrated directly into many of the world’s top crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Sentiment analysisCrypto is more mood than math. Tools like LunarCrush track social media activity, influencer buzz and trending tokens. If Dogecoin starts heating up again, you’ll probably see the early signs there.Onchain dataWant to know what the whales are doing? Platforms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant surface data like wallet flows, miner activity and exchange balances. It’s like reading the blockchain’s heartbeat. You’ll often spot capital shifts before they show up in the price.Strategies for navigating different market conditionsUnderstanding the cycle is one thing. Knowing how to act on it is another. Your playbook should change depending on whether you’re riding a bull or surviving a bear.Bull market strategiesTrend following: When the market’s running hot, sometimes the best move is to go with the flow, but stay disciplined. Focus on assets in strong uptrends, and don’t get caught chasing green candles without a plan.Profit-taking: Set targets and honor them. It’s easy to get greedy when everything’s pumping, but taking profits on the way up helps you avoid the dreaded round trip: watching your gains vanish in the next drawdown.Risk management: Even bull markets pull back. Use stop-losses or trailing stops to lock in gains and guard against surprise reversals. You’ll thank yourself later.Bear market strategiesDefensive positioning: Sometimes, the smartest trade is no trade. Moving part of your portfolio into stablecoins or sticking to less volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) can help preserve capital while others panic.Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): Trying to time the exact bottom? Good luck. DCA smooths the ride by spreading your entries over time, lowering your average cost and helping you stay engaged without overcommitting.Focus on fundamentals: Bear markets strip away the noise. What survives are the projects with real use, strong teams and long-term vision. If you’re holding through a downturn, ensure you’re holding for the right reasons.By failing to prepare, you are preparing to failBull or bear, crypto never stops moving, but that doesn’t mean you have to react to every swing. Price trends, sentiment shifts, volume patterns and fundamentals can all clue you in on where you are in the cycle. Armed with the right tools and a calm mindset, you can tune out the noise and act with clarity.Markets reward preparation, and knowing whether you’re in bull territory or bear country is one of the most powerful tools you can have.Happy trading! This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-06T15:19:22.000Z,"North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview","For months, Cointelegraph took part in an investigation centered around a suspected North Korean operative that uncovered a cluster of threat actors attempting to score freelancing gigs in the cryptocurrency industry.The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”Ultimately, Motoki accidentally exposed links to a cluster of North Korean threat actors, then rage-quit the call.Here’s what happened.Suspected North Korean crypto spy posed as a Japanese developerGarcia first encountered Motoki on GitHub in late January while investigating a cluster linked to a suspected DPRK threat actor known as “bestselection18.” This account is widely believed to be operated by an experienced DPRK IT infiltrator. It was part of a broader group of suspected operatives who had infiltrated the crypto gig economy through freelancing platforms such as OnlyDust.Most North Korean state actors don’t use a human face photo in their accounts, so Motoki’s profile, which had one, hooked Garcia’s attention. “I went straight to the point and just wrote to him on Telegram,” Garcia told Cointelegraph, explaining how he created an alter ego as a headhunter for a company looking for talent. “It was pretty easy. I didn’t even say the company name.”On Feb. 24, Garcia invited Cointelegraph’s South Korean reporter to join an upcoming interview for his fake company — with the hope of speaking to the suspected DPRK operative in Korean by the end of the call.We were intrigued; if we could meet with an operative, we had the opportunity to learn just how effective these tactics were and, hopefully, how they can be counteracted.On Feb. 25, Garcia and Cointelegraph met Motoki. We kept webcams off, but Motoki did not. During the interview, conducted in English, Motoki often repeated the same responses for different questions, turning the job interview into an awkward and stilted conversation.Motoki displayed questionable behavior inconsistent with that of a legitimate Japanese developer. For one, he couldn’t speak the language.Related: From Sony to Bybit: How Lazarus Group became crypto’s supervillainWe asked Motoki to introduce himself in Japanese. The screenlight reflecting off his face suggested he was frantically searching through tabs and windows to find a script to help him answer.There was a long, tense silence.“Jiko shōkai o onegaishimasu,” Cointelegraph repeated the request, this time in Japanese.Motoki frowned, threw off his headset, and left the interview.Motoki sensed something was off moments before leaving the interview.Compared to bestselection18, Motoki was sloppy. He revealed key details by sharing his screen in the interview. Garcia theorized that Motoki is likely a lower-level operative working with bestselection18.Motoki had two calls with Garcia, one of which was with Cointelegraph. In the two calls, his screenshare revealed access to private GitHub repositories with bestselection18 for what Garcia calls a defunct scam project.“That’s how we linked the whole operation and the whole cluster… He shared his screen and revealed he was working with [bestselection18] in a private repo,” Garcia said.Linguistic clues point to North Korean originsIn a 2018 study, researchers observed that Korean males tend to have wider, more prominent facial structures than their East Asian neighbors, while Japanese males typically have longer, narrower faces. While broad generalizations, in this case, Motoki’s appearance aligned more closely with the Korean profile described in the study.“Okay, so let me introduce myself. So, I am an experienced engineer in blockchain and AI with a focus on developing innovation and impactful products,” Motoki said during the interview, his eyes scanning from left to right as if reading a script.An ID card submitted to Garcia by Motoki in his job application. Source: KetmanMotoki’s English pronunciation offered more clues. He frequently pronounced words beginning with “r” as “l,” a substitution common among Korean speakers. Japanese speakers also struggle with this distinction but tend to merge the two sounds into a neutral flap.He seemed more relaxed during personal questions. Motoki said he was born and raised in Japan, had no wife or children, and claimed native fluency. “I like football,” he smiled, pronouncing it with a strong “p” sound — another hint more typical of Korean-accented English.Related: The whale, the hack and the psychological earthquake that hit HEXMotoki unveils one more North Korean tacticAbout a week after the interview with Cointelegraph, Garcia attempted to prolong the charade. He messaged Motoki and claimed that his boss had fired him due to the dubious interview.That led to three weeks of private message exchanges with Motoki. Garcia continued to play along, pretending Motoki was a Japanese developer.Garcia later asked Motoki for help finding a job. In response, Motoki offered a deal that provided additional insight into some of North Korea’s operational methods.“They told me they would send me money to buy a computer so they could work through my computer,” Garcia said.The arrangement would allow the operator to remotely access a machine from another location and carry out tasks without needing a VPN connection, which can trigger issues on popular freelancing platforms.Motoki attempts to access a US-based PC through remote applications like AnyDesk. Source: KetmanGarcia and his partner published their findings on the cluster of suspected DPRK operatives tied to bestselection18 on April 16 on open-source investigative platform Ketman.A few days later, Cointelegraph received a message from Garcia: “The guy we interviewed is gone. All his socials changed. All the chats and everything around him has been deleted.”Motoki has not been heard from since.Suspected DPRK operatives have become a recurring problem for recruiters across tech industries. Even major crypto exchanges are targeted. On May 2, Kraken reported it identified a North Korean cyber spy attempting to land a job at the US crypto trading platform.A United Nations Security Council report estimates that North Korean IT workers generate up to $600 million annually for the regime. These spies are able to funnel consistent wages back to North Korea. The UN believes those funds help finance its weapons program — which, as of January 2024, is thought to include more than 50 nuclear warheads.Magazine: Lazarus Group’s favorite exploit revealed — Crypto hacks analysis",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korean-spy-reveals-ties-in-fake-job-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-06T15:00:00.000Z,"Frictionless flows are Ethereum&#039;s path to economic dominance","Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of MaldaAn idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threatIn traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead to higher investment. Take the European Union's pre-Brexit single market. Investment flows slowed when the United Kingdom's exit fragmented access to capital pools, as economists tracking cross-border activity noted. Ethereum faces a decentralized parallel. Rollups, particularly those that are optimistic and ZK-based, impose delays of up to a week on withdrawals and offer only patchy cross-rollup liquidity. The result is a fragmented system in which adoption slows, and capital is underused.Developers are left with two poor choices. Either they focus on one rollup and limit their audience, or fragment liquidity across several and accept inefficiencies. Neither option serves the ecosystem's long-term interests. A significant opportunity lies, therefore, with protocols that remove these frictions. They will attract more capital, operate more efficiently, and deliver better experiences.Recent: 3 reasons Ethereum could turn a cornerCapital movement must be abstracted away from the end-user. Bridges and withdrawal queues should become protocol-level concerns, not user problems. It is feasible for liquidity deployed on one rollup to satisfy demand on another, with background rebalancing ensuring solvency and efficiency. What today seems complex can be made invisible.This design shift from reactive bridging to intent-based liquidity coordination would restore composability and preserve decentralization. More importantly, it would uphold Ethereum's core principles of building open systems without central gatekeepers. Without it, users will continue to rely on centralized exchanges to bypass friction, compromising self-custody for convenience. This is not just a technical challenge — it is a philosophical one.Designing around friction is the competitive edgeDesigning around capital efficiency is becoming a competitive edge. Tomorrow's DeFi protocols will not simply compete on fees or yield. They will compete on how well they can access liquidity across a fractured landscape. The winners will be those that can fulfill a user's request wherever the user is without requiring them to move funds manually. The result will be better UX, more productive capital, and higher network stickiness.Some underlying technologies are beginning to address the problem. Ethereum-native rollups, planned after a hard fork in 2026, promise closer integration, and while they are still not ready for deployment, based rollups offer tighter alignment with Ethereum by sharing sequencing and improving settlement while sacrificing some independence. In the meantime, optimistic rollups are racing to implement zero-knowledge proofs to speed up exits. These innovations reduce friction, but they are not enough on their own. Scale will come from applications designed around these constraints, not from the base layers alone.Zk-Rollups are particularly well suited for this. Their cryptographic structure allows for low-latency and trust-minimized messaging between chains. This makes them ideal for applications like payments, decentralized trading, and real-time financial products, all of which demand speed and certainty. If Ethereum can make such cross-rollup flows seamless, it will not just scale. It will become the backbone of a more efficient financial system.That outcome is not guaranteed. Tariffing rollups may serve short-term goals, but in the long run, they would weaken the very network Ethereum aims to strengthen. Solana, for example, already offers composability within a single domain. While Ethereum's modular approach is arguably more robust, it cannot afford to ignore the usability cost of fragmentation.Ethereum's greatest strength is its neutrality. That should include the ability of capital to move freely within its ecosystem. The future will not be built by taxing rollups. It will be built by enabling them to function as one economic engine.Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of Malda.

2025-05-06T14:25:00.000Z,"What bankers, CPAs and CFOs need to know about blockchain","Why finance veterans are still skeptical about blockchain              Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.Uncertainty about practical applicationsBlockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.A 2021 APQC survey identified the main hurdles: a lack of industry-wide adoption, skill gaps, trust issues, financial constraints and problems with interoperability. Even organizations that want to embrace blockchain often struggle to turn ideas into working solutions.Doubts about necessitySome finance professionals aren’t convinced blockchain is necessary at all.The same APQC survey showed trust issues and a lack of understanding as major reasons for the slow adoption. Without a clear and compelling return on investment (ROI), it’s tough to justify tearing up existing systems that, frankly, still work.Lack of understanding Maybe the biggest obstacle? A lack of understanding. A 2024 study revealed that only 13.7% of financial advisers engage with clients about cryptocurrencies despite increasing client interest and the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between 2021 and 2024. Moreover, while groups like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) are trying to build frameworks for blockchain compliance and auditing, there’s no standard playbook yet. And without clarity, leadership teams are stuck. This article will aim to address each of these skepticisms, ultimately providing an answer to how blockchain fits into finance in 2025.Did you know? Christina Lynn, a behavioral finance researcher and certified financial planner, highlighted in her 2024 Journal of Financial Planning article that many financial advisers dismiss cryptocurrency due to biases, fear and regulatory concerns despite growing investor interest. She urges advisers to educate themselves, adopt a balanced approach, and provide guidance to avoid client mistakes.                  The 2025 blockchain landscape: Key developments              Unbeknownst to many, thanks to regulatory shifts, stablecoins gaining ground and major institutions building on-chain infrastructure, blockchain is moving from experimental to essential within finance. Below are the developments serving as key contributors in 2025.Regulatory shiftsThe US Federal Reserve has relaxed its 2022 stance, no longer requiring banks to get explicit approval to offer crypto services. Similar signals from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency show that regulators are starting to treat blockchain as a legitimate tool.At the same time, SEC Chair Paul Atkins is pushing for clearer, innovation-friendly crypto rules, moving away from vague enforcement tactics and toward a more structured regulatory framework.Stablecoin stampedeThe stablecoin market capitalization has climbed to nearly $240 billion as of late April 2025, brushing up against an all-time high. Regulators are also stepping up. In Europe, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework is now fully live, laying down clear ground rules for crypto assets. For stablecoins, that means strict 1:1 reserve requirements and a crackdown on anything resembling an algorithmic model without real backing. Meanwhile, in the US, lawmakers are making moves, too. The STABLE Act, reintroduced in March, proposes tighter oversight over stablecoin issuers and even suggests a two-year freeze on new algorithmic coins. Alongside it, the GENIUS Act aims to set up a whole new licensing system for stablecoins, making issuers meet banking-level standards for reserves, redemption rights and compliance.The private sector isn’t sitting still either. Coinbase recently waived fees on PayPal’s PYUSD (PYUSD) transactions and now offers seamless USD redemptions. It’s a smart play to make stablecoins more visible in day-to-day finance. And the uptake isn’t just happening in the US. In Asia, stablecoins are becoming a go-to for cross-border remittances because they’re faster and cheaper than traditional methods. In Latin America, they’re being used to hedge against local currency collapses; in Brazil, for example, stablecoins now make up over 80% of crypto transactions. In different corners of the world, stablecoins are solving very real problems.Blockchain goes bigProjects like JPMorgan’s Kinexys and Citigroup’s permissioned blockchain platform show that major banks are actively investing in tokenization, digital asset settlement and blockchain infrastructure for global finance.Did you know? The global blockchain market is projected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027, up from $26.91 billion in 2024.                  Blockchain in banking operations              As of 2025, blockchain is helping streamline settlements, tighten compliance, and transform cross-border payments from a headache into a smooth operation. Here’s how:Real-time settlement and clearingMoving money between banks — especially across borders — used to be a slow, messy process. Layers of intermediaries meant delays, high fees and plenty of room for errors.By cutting out intermediaries and verifying transactions directly, blockchain enables near-instant settlement, slashing turnaround times dramatically.In fact, JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform (part of its Onyx suite) now processes over $2 billion in daily transactions, using JPM Coin to settle payments across banks and currencies in real time.It’s an example of a live system handling serious volume with the help of a blockchain.Enhanced KYC and AML complianceKnow Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks have always been necessary — but painfully slow and repetitive.Blockchain offers a smarter way to handle them. A tamper-proof ledger allows banks to securely store and share verified customer information, speeding up audits and reducing compliance headaches.Another real-world example from JPMorgan is Liink, which runs a blockchain-inspired service called Confirm, which helps banks validate over 2 billion bank accounts across more than 3,500 financial institutions, dramatically improving efficiency for KYC processes.Cheaper, faster cross-border paymentsSending money internationally used to take days and came with hefty fees.With blockchain, transactions can settle in minutes, and fees are significantly lower.Real-world moves:HSBC and Ant Group: In 2023, they ran real-time HKD-denominated tokenized transactions under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Ensemble Sandbox, giving businesses 24/7 cross-bank transfers.Wells Fargo: Implemented HSBC’s blockchain-based system for foreign exchange settlements, reducing risk and speeding up cross-border FX deals.Even Deloitte estimates that blockchain could slash cross-border payment costs by 40%-80%, saving the industry up to $24 billion a year.This all shows that banks are betting real money and real infrastructure on blockchain delivering real value.Did you know? Visa’s Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) allows banks to mint, burn and transfer fiat-backed tokens, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins.Considerations for banksOf course, blockchain isn’t a panacea. There are a few things banks need to keep in mind:Integration is critical: Blockchain systems have to plug into existing core banking infrastructure. Full rip-and-replace projects aren’t practical (or cheap).Training matters: New systems won’t work if the people running them don’t know how. Banks need to upskill teams across compliance, operations and IT.Customer experience comes first: It’s not just about making internal processes faster — clients need to feel the difference, too.Behind the scenes, accounting and auditing firms are also finding that blockchain can fix long-standing pain points. That’s what will be explored next.                  Blockchain in accounting and auditing              Accounting and auditing might not be flashy headlines, but behind the scenes, blockchain is slowly changing how financial data is managed, verified and reported.Better data security and fraud preventionWith blockchain, once a transaction is recorded, it can’t be altered without consensus from the network. This built-in immutability drastically reduces the risk of tampering or fraud and strengthens the integrity of financial records.More transparency = better auditsAuditors no longer need to stitch together fragmented information from multiple systems. Blockchain provides a single, real-time, tamper-proof trail of transactions, making audits faster, more accurate and more reliable.Streamlined reconciliation and reportingBlockchain simplifies day-to-day reporting, too. Instead of manually reconciling across different ledgers, authorized parties all have access to a shared, automatically updating record.Adoption challengesOf course, it’s not all smooth sailing.Lack of standardization: There’s still no universal rulebook for blockchain accounting. Groups like the AICPA and the International Accounting Standards Board are issuing early guidance, but without global standards, firms must tread carefully.Integration woes: Most firms still use legacy enterprise resource planning and accounting platforms that weren’t designed for blockchain. Integrating — or deciding when to overhaul — poses serious technical and financial challenges.Regulatory uncertainty: Regulations around digital assets and blockchain-based transactions are evolving fast. Firms must keep their internal controls and reporting practices agile to stay compliant.Did you know? The concept of triple-entry accounting, enabled by blockchain, adds a third component to traditional double-entry systems.                  Blockchain for CFOs and treasurers              In 2025, blockchain is a practical tool for chief financial officers and treasurers looking to sharpen financial reporting, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen risk controls.Strategic applicationsReal-time financial reporting and analysis: Blockchain’s tamper-proof, real-time data streams give CFOs instant access to financial performance. No more waiting for reconciliations — finance teams can forecast and pivot with live numbers at their fingertips.Smart contracts for compliance and transactions: Smart contracts automate routine processes like compliance checks and payment executions, reducing human error and ensuring agreements are enforced exactly as written.Tokenization for capital raising and asset management: Tokenizing assets such as real estate, equipment or equity opens new doors for raising capital and improving liquidity. Fractional ownership models also make it easier to access a broader investor base.Risk management considerationsWhile blockchain enhances security overall, it’s not invulnerable. Strong access controls, regular audits and active network monitoring are essential to protect systems and assets. Organizations also need contingency plans in place, since blockchain networks can experience outages or latency issues; having off-chain fallback procedures ensures business continuity during disruptions.Finally, CFOs and treasurers must stay actively engaged, working closely with legal teams and regulators to stay ahead of compliance risks and future-proof their operations.                  Best practices for blockchain compliance              If you’re operating — or planning to operate — in blockchain environments, these practices should be at the top of your checklist.Establish robust internal controlsManaging digital assets safely demands stricter-than-ever internal controls. That means:Segregation of dutiesRole-based access systemsRigorous transaction validation.Without these safeguards, the risk of fraud or mismanagement climbs quickly.Engage with regulators earlyOrganizations that wait for final rulings often find themselves scrambling. Proactively building relationships with regulatory bodies helps you stay informed and adapt to early guidance.For example, a licensed Swiss crypto bank, SEBA, engaged early with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and became one of the first banks to secure a banking and securities dealer license in 2019. Its proactive compliance approach allowed it to operate both crypto and traditional assets legally in Switzerland.In addition, the Crypto Valley Association (based in Zug) collaborates regularly with Swiss regulators to shape clear, forward-thinking crypto and blockchain policies. They’ve been instrumental in making Switzerland one of the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions.Invest in ongoing compliance trainingBlockchain regulation is in flux. Regular training ensures your finance and compliance teams are ready to adapt.Everyone from junior auditors to senior compliance officers needs to stay fluent in blockchain fundamentals, regulatory updates and best practices.By building these habits into your organization now, you’ll be better equipped in the long term.                  Actionable steps for finance professionals              So, blockchain does have real use cases in finance; it is here to stay and needs to be firmly on your radar. Here’s how different finance professionals can start making smart, manageable moves today:For bankersFocus on practical wins first.Look for areas where blockchain can immediately improve operations, like speeding up settlements, streamlining compliance processes or making loan servicing more transparent.Instead of jumping into a full blockchain overhaul, pilot small initiatives in targeted areas like trade finance or cross-border payments. This way, you can measure results with minimal risk.Also, partnering with fintechs that specialize in blockchain infrastructure can accelerate your learning curve and implementation, letting you tap into blockchain benefits without rebuilding internal systems from scratch.For CPAs and auditorsStay current with evolving standards — especially updated AICPA guidance on digital asset accounting and blockchain auditing.Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and auditors also need to build technical expertise because auditing blockchain records isn’t the same as auditing traditional ledgers.You’ll need to understand:How blockchain structures dataHow verification worksWhat best practices apply to blockchain audit trails.Moreover, don’t be afraid to advocate for blockchain adoption at your firm — especially when it can boost transparency, lower risk, and strengthen the credibility of financial reporting.For CFOs and treasurers When evaluating blockchain initiatives, look through a financial lens first. Consider:How blockchain impacts cash flowHow tokenization might affect your balance sheetHow stablecoins or blockchain-based settlements could influence treasury operations.If tokenization or stablecoin strategies are even on the horizon for your business, they should already be reflected in your three- to five-year strategic plans.Also, don’t go it alone: Engage with peer networks, industry groups and blockchain-focused finance events. Real-world insights from other CFOs and treasurers can help you spot opportunities and avoid common early-adoption pitfalls.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-bankers-cpas-and-cfos-need-to-know-about-blockchain?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-06T12:28:58.000Z,"US stablecoin bill loses democrats amid Trump corruption concerns","Democratic lawmakers in Washington are backing off support for crypto legislation amid heightened concerns over corruption, including the conduct of the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI).In March, the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins in the US, passed a critical committee reading with the support of several pro-crypto Democrats. Democratic Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester, Andy Kim and Angela Alsobrooks voted with Republicans, opposite lead Democrat and prominent crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren.The bill passed the committee only after a number of changes were made, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and provisions for Anti-Money Laundering, countering terrorism financing and risk management procedures. Now, it seems that even those provisions are insufficient to quell Democratic concerns. Following some high-profile crypto deals that personally enrich President Donald Trump, Congressional Democrats are pulling their support.Bipartisan efforts on stablecoin bills endangeredOf the five pro-crypto Democrats to pass the GENIUS Act in the Senate Banking Committee, four signed their names to a statement on May 3, saying that they do not feel comfortable with the direction stablecoin legislation is taking. “The bill as it currently stands still has numerous issues that must be addressed, including adding stronger provisions on anti-money laundering, foreign issuers, national security, preserving the safety and soundness of our financial system, and accountability,” the announcement reads.The statement does not explicitly call out corruption nor mention Trump by name, but taken alongside other measures from Democratic lawmakers, it shows a growing reticence to engage on cryptocurrency issues.As Cointelegraph reported on May 5, Representative Maxine Waters and other Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee plan to leave a House of Representatives hearing on crypto titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets” on May 6. According to a staffer familiar with the matter, this would sink the hearing, as House rules require all committee members to be present. The hearing concerns a draft bill, announced by Representative French Hill and other top Republicans on May 5, that would change how US financial regulators, namely the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), treat cryptocurrencies.Related: New crypto bill draft seen to curb big crypto firm influenceWaters, who has previously called for bipartisan cooperation on crypto legislation, has harshly criticized Trump, specifically his WLFI crypto investment firm. She characterized his TRUMP memecoin, released on his inauguration, as “the worst of crypto” and has been particularly vocal about the WLFI USD1 stablecoin project.At a markup hearing on April 2 concerning the STABLE Act — a draft bill circulating the House regarding stablecoins — Waters said the bill, in its current form, allows the president and insiders to “enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.”“If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” said Waters.Even Hill, a Republican leading the charge for crypto in Washington, said that Trump’s crypto projects complicate Congress’ ability to pass legislation.Stablecoin support as political leverageCorruption concerns may be one factor behind Democrats’ pumping the brakes on bipartisan crypto laws, but some observers believe it could be more of a political ploy. Aaron Brogan, a lawyer specializing in regulatory issues in the cryptocurrency industry, said it’s “unlikely that this group of Senators suddenly came to their senses and realized that the mostly benign stablecoin bill they had previously supported lacked protections they refused to name.”Brogan suggested that either lawmakers wanted to use support for the bill as leverage — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly urged Democratic lawmakers in private not to commit to the bill for this very reason — or an influential donor wants to kill the bill or use it as leverage. Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?Protect Progress, a major political action committee supporting crypto, donated millions to Gallego’s campaign, Brogan noted. He said it is possible that major donors to the committee (i.e., Coinbase) would rather see the bill replaced with something more to their liking. While he said it’s impossible to know for sure, “Coinbase has attempted to bundle the pending market structure legislation with stablecoins to make it more likely to pass,” he said. WLFI accused of shady dealingWLFI has already netted some $550 million from Trump token sales and is sealing more deals that will enrich its founders and board members, many of whom are Trump family members. One of them, Eric Trump, announced on May 1 that Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX would use USD1 to settle its $2-billion investment in global crypto exchange Binance.At Token2049, Eric Trump praised the UAE for its crypto-friendly approach, saying that the regulation-heavy EU is a “lost cause.”In November 2024, the founder of the Tron blockchain, Justin Sun, became the largest investor in WLFI when he bought some $30 million in TRUMP. More recent reports suggest he has spent nearly $70 million. On Feb. 24, just one month after Trump took office, the SEC, then with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda at the helm, halted its civil fraud investigation into Sun despite previous allegations that Sun and the Tron Foundation had illegally distributed tokens, concealed celebrity donations, and inflated trade volumes. Critics claimed that the president was selling exposure to the highest bidder when WLFI announced that top TRUMP tokenholders would be welcomed to a gala with the president himself. This prompted one lawmaker to suggest impeachment — a pipedream in a Congress with Republican majorities in both houses. WLFI has not responded publicly or on social media to these criticisms. In a May 5 interview with Meet the Press on NBC, President Trump downplayed the project, saying he was “not profiting from anything.” He said he hasn’t “even looked” at his portfolio.He also rejected the idea that he should forgo any profits from WLFi. “Should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so,” he said.With purported scandals and pressure mounting on Democratic officials to block Republican efforts on the Hill, the possibility of a bipartisan stablecoin bill, much less a crypto framework, looks increasingly bleak. Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-stablecoin-bill-loses-democratic-support-trump-corruption-concerns?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Bitcoin has lost its position above the 200-day SMA for the first time since April 11, possibly indicating a trend shift in the lower time frame (LTF) chart.However, choppy price action is likely in the short term due to overhead resistance at $97,000-$98,000 (CME gap 1) and key support at $93,000, where multiple liquidity levels are present. Crypto trader UB pointed out several key areas of interest to watch for on X, saying: “Things are fairly clean in terms of key levels. $95.5k & $91.9k. I'm personally not interested in a Bitcoin trade unless price is at one of the levels above.

However, lawyers still need to catch up. “Most blockchains nowadays, especially things like Solana, are fast enough for institutions to use them,” Federa said. “It’s really more about the institutions and the institution’s lawyers getting comfortable with crypto.”Federa added that institutional lawyers and compliance teams are still addressing regulatory concerns. The executive said this may slow adoption despite the growing regulatory clarity in key markets like the United States. DoubleZero Labs founder Austin Federa. Source: CointelegraphInstitutions are coming; they just move slowAccording to Federa, technical infrastructure is no longer a primary barrier for large firms. Tools needed to support enterprise-scale activity on networks like Solana are already in place:  “Especially on networks like Solana and other fast networks, the infrastructure is there today for high amounts of institutional adoption.”While crypto community members may feel like institutional adoption should be bigger than it is, Federa said that these organizations are not quick at onboarding new technologies.  “Institutions are coming on board, but they just move really slow,” Federa told Cointelegraph. “People expect these massive institutions to move fast, but that’s just not what they’re good at.” Until legal departments are fully satisfied with risk controls and compliance structures, Federa said meaningful adoption may unfold gradually. Related: DoubleZero’s alternative to public internet targets mainnet rollout in H2Institutional involvement in crypto infrastructureFedera also highlighted a growing trend of institutional involvement in the crypto infrastructure space. He said that bare-metal infrastructure providers and venture capital firms have offered financial support and contributed actual fiber infrastructure to DoubleZero. This kind of commitment was almost unthinkable just a few years ago, he said. “Most of those companies two years ago would not have had any interest or thought it was way too legally risky to take something and contribute fiber to it.”Unlike running a validator node, deploying fiber and infrastructure is a major commitment. Federa said that institutional players now allocating serious resources to crypto-native projects reflects a shift in how traditional finance views the sector.Despite this, he acknowledged that while institutional adoption grew, the broader crypto product landscape isn’t fully mature. “The products are not quite there yet for the most part,” Federa said.Magazine: Solana ‘will be a trillion-dollar asset’: Mert Mumtaz, X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-infrastructure-crypto-austin-federa-doublezero?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-06T11:19:48.000Z,"Research DAO claims paralyzed rats recover after spinal cord fix","Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) HydraDAO claims that its researchers were able to use a novel technique to repair severed spines in rats.In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.Source: HydraDAOThe post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting. The effort in question is the Dowell spinal fusogens project led by Michael Lebenstein-Gumovski, which raised 380,700 USDC (USDC) from donors. The dedicated HydraDAO page reads:“The Dowell team submitted a project proposal to HydraDAO. After careful consideration and two peer reviews, HydraCore deems it in the interest of HydraDAO’s community.“Related: Experts to gather in Miami to drive longevity research forwardMore than smoke and mirrors?Fusogens are chemicals capable of fusing cell membranes and have long been researched as a means to reconnect severed nerve fibers. One such chemical is polyethylene glycol (PEG), which was shown to promote membrane fusion and seal axonal membranes in other research.The Dowell team adds a biopolymer from crustacean shells called chitosan, resulting in a PEG-chitosan compound dubbed neuro-PEG. This compound is also photopolymerizable, meaning it can be rapidly solidified using light.This presumably allows for creating a solid scaffolding that can weld the spinal cord more permanently than liquid PEG-based solutions. Dowell also implements neuroprotection techniques such as localized hypothermia and cellular death inhibitors to prevent further damage to nerve tissue. A 2023 research paper by Gumovski published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Surgical Neurology International claimed that pigs treated with the compound recovered mobility in two months. The study’s conclusion read:“Neuro-PEG affords sensorimotor recovery after complete spinal cord transection. This opens the door to human experimentation, including trials of spinal cord transplantation.“The Dowell team also filed a patent for developed technologies, with a 2022 Russian patent describing a “method of restoring spinal cord functions after transection using a PEG-chitosan conjugate,” listing Lebenstein-Gumovski among its inventors.The HydraDAO proposal suggests that “revenue streams include specialized surgical kits priced between $3,500 and $20,000, depending on the market and region.” Furthermore, the team would also provide “comprehensive training and certification for neurosurgeons and emergency medical services” personnel.Related: Major scientific journal Nature features DeSci project ResearchHubSome interesting connectionsGumovski is a neurosurgery researcher based in Russia (Stavropol State Medical University and affiliated institutes). He was a member of Sergio Canavero’s research head-transplant project, cited in at least one relevant paper.Those articles were also published in Surgical Neurology International, while most top scientific publications shied away from the subject. The neurosurgeon from Turin, Italy, claimed to have performed a successful head transplant on a monkey back in 2016.The team also experimented on human cadavers in preparation for a 2017 live human head transplant, which never took place. Neuroscientist Dean Burnett said at the time that head transplantation presented insurmountable challenges and that Canavero had “offered no feasible explanation or science for his claims to be able to overcome these hurdles.”While the Dowell team’s project builds on established research and should not be dismissed outright, it is hard not to notice the similarity in making public claims not unlike those that characterized Canavero’s career. Furthermore, fusogens are well studied and less dramatic but similar results have been reported by other teams in the past (2019 example from the University of Texas).Will the paralyzed walk again?The evidence provided is promising, but it is advisable to exercise caution, especially until multiple third-party teams independently reproduce the results.HydraDAO promised additional electrophysiology experiments and tracing dyes to assess connectivity between the brain and lower spine. This extra data may enhance the credibility of the research results.Still, further research is needed to assess whether it will result in a clinically viable technique for real-world spinal injuries.Magazine: DeSci: Can crypto improve scientific research?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hydradao-spinal-cord-repair-neuropeg-rats?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This transition raises speculation about Berkshire’s financial capacity to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) under the new leadership.Source: Discover CryptoBerkshire can easily surpass Strategy’s BTC stash Berkshire ended Q4 2024 with a record $347 billion in cash and US Treasury bills, representing about 32% of its $1.1 trillion market capitalization. The company could acquire approximately 3.52 million BTC if it purchases the cryptocurrency at May’s approximate price of $95,000. This equates to about 17.88% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply of 19.69 million coins.If the company tapped only its estimated $295.98 billion in US Treasury, it could buy around 3.12 million BTC, or 15.85% of the circulating supply, positioning it as a dominant player in the crypto market.Berkshire Hathaway is 20th Century Bitcoin.— Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 3, 2025Such a move would easily eclipse Nasdaq-listed Strategy Inc.

However, Berkshire surprised markets by buying Barrick Gold shares (a gold mining company) in 2020, though it later sold that position.Under Abel, Berkshire may not dive straight into Bitcoin, but its cautious, indirect approach could expand as markets evolve.

He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. “We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”Mercuryo Petr Kozyakov at the Token2049 event in Dubai. Source: CointelegraphCrypto payroll gains momentum as payment options expandCrypto as a salary payment option is no longer a novelty. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that more companies are settling employee salaries with crypto assets. “That is a growing trend,” Kozyakov said. “I see a lot of businesses that are starting to settle with their full-time employees and with their gig employees all over the world, in crypto.”As more employees receive crypto salaries, new challenges can emerge. According to Kozyakov, workers paid in crypto may ask what they can do next with their funds. “You won’t invest everything and just wait. You need to use it for everyday purchases,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. This is where practical spending options are needed. Kozyakov said that crypto earners are looking for ways to use their digital asset incomes in daily life scenarios, whether buying coffee, going out for drinks or settling utility bills. As crypto becomes an option for employee salaries, there has also been a growing acceptance of crypto in employee contracts in some jurisdictions. In August 2024, a Dubai court recognized crypto as a valid form of salary payment. Related: OKX exec warns against hype amid real-world asset tokenization boomCrypto, a powerful tool for moving and storing moneyThe executive also told Cointelegraph that Mercuryo views crypto as more than just a speculative asset but a powerful tool for moving and storing value. “Crypto is not only an asset; it’s the perfect rail to move money and store money. And it is essential to be able to spend it.”The executive said that in practice, spending crypto can still be complex. He said it takes a few steps, including moving it to an exchange, sending it to a bank account and answering “weird” questions from banks. Because of this, he highlighted a need for easier ways to spend crypto directly. The executive said that this is where their company comes in. On April 23, the payment services firm collaborated with the hardware wallet company Ledger on a crypto payment card that allows users to spend crypto where Mastercard payments are accepted. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that seamless crypto payment options will drive wider crypto adoption, not just as an investment, but as a true medium of exchange for daily life.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-payments-mercuryo-ceo-token2049-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.He said hype can drive project growth in the Web3 space, but providing everyday value should be the priority. OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh at the Token2049 media lounge. Source: CointelegraphRWA tokenization gains traction in the UAEMahasneh’s comments come amid an increase in real-world asset tokenization projects in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates. On May 1, MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA agreement with the UAE-based real-estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk — the largest RWA initiative worldwide to date. In addition to billions in RWA deals, the UAE government has started working on RWA tokenization. On March 19, the Dubai Land Department — the government agency responsible for promoting, organizing and registering real estate in Dubai — announced a pilot phase of its real-estate tokenization project. The agency is working with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the emirate’s crypto regulator. On Jan. 9, RWA project Mantra also signed a $1 billion deal with Damac Group to tokenize the assets of the UAE-based conglomerate. However, months later, Mantra saw one of the biggest token collapses in crypto history, wiping out billions in market capitalization on April 13. Mahasneh told Cointelegraph that the region’s clear regulations help drive bigger institutions to get into tokenization and crypto. He said regulatory clarity allows understanding of how key players in the space, like exchanges, are governed. Related: Real estate not the best asset for RWA tokenization — Michael SonnensheinUAE stablecoin framework gives institutions confidenceThe executive also praised the region’s progress in stablecoin regulations. In June 2024, the Central Bank of the UAE approved a regulatory framework for stablecoin licensing. This clarified the issuance, supervision and licensing of dirham-backed payment tokens. According to Mahasneh, this demonstrates the UAE’s speed in regulating crypto-related technologies. The executive also highlighted that the central bank's involvement gives institutions extra confidence in entering the business. “Other markets are still debating whether they should have crypto regulations. Here, we moved into developing stablecoin regulations. For an investor, you want to know that your stablecoin is regulated. That’s a big plus,” Mahasneh said.Since then, major players like Tether have joined the race by issuing a dirham-pegged stablecoin. On April 29, institutions like Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ), First Abu Dhabi Bank and the International Holding Company partnered to launch a dirham-pegged stablecoin, pending regulatory approval. Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/okx-mena-ceo-rwa-tokenization-boom-token2049-dubai?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-06T09:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin vs. digital fiat is freedom vs. serfdom","Opinion by: Simon Cain, contributor at Bitcoin Policy UKMost jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will have the technology to enforce that.. that makes a huge difference with respect to what cash is.”How “absolute control” might workCBDCs could be programmed so you can only buy certain things from certain people, at certain times, within specific dates, or only in approved locations. Their validity could depend on compliance with all government policies (climate, medical, social, and tax). They could be subject to maximum or minimum holding limits. They could be programmed to discourage saving and encourage 'investing' in approved shares and bonds (such as the new EU 'SIU' initiative or in line with UK financial industry lobbying and 'research'). Politicians and central bankers may say they do not intend to implement any such controls, but such assurances are worthless. To quote the UK Parliament's own Economic Affairs Committee, \""while the Governor of the Bank of England told the committee that he did not see a CBDC as a way to implement monetary policy, the committee noted that his successors may disagree\"".Freedom to transact is fundamental to freedom itself. Once you can no longer choose what you do with your money, you're on the road to monetary serfdom. How can you defend yourself? Bitcoin fixes more than monetary serfdom Bitcoin fights financial subjugation. Because it's the world's most decentralized and censorship-resistant money, Bitcoin held in self-custody cannot be frozen or confiscated, and its transactions cannot be stopped. This isn't theoretical. It has already been proven in countless cases of financial repression all over the world, whether in Russia and Ukraine, Afghanistan and Cuba, or globally by organizations from WikiLeaks in 2011 to the Bitcoin Humanitarian Alliance in 2025. Recent: Is Bitcoin’s future in circular economies or national reserves?But financial serfdom isn't the only risk with CBDCs. The UK's Economic Affairs Committee also points out that \""a centralized CBDC ledger, which would be a critical piece of national infrastructure, could be a target for attack from hostile state and non-state actors.\"" Governments and public entities are always being hacked and leaking data, which they exacerbate by constantly hacking each other. Having your access to money entirely dependent on their competence is a terrible idea. Bitcoin fights financial institutional failure. And again, this isn't theoretical — it has also already been proven. When banks fail, or their systems go down, Bitcoin always remains up and running because it is the world's most reliable computer network. For well over a decade, Bitcoin has not been down for even a fraction of a second. Bitcoin is ultra-decentralized, and there have been zero successful hacks of the Bitcoin ledger itself during that period, despite its worth being in the trillions of dollars. Public or private, monetary or otherwise, no other large network can come close to this reliability and resistance to physical, virtual or political attack.Nowhere is immune from digital fiat CBDCs look to be coming to the major Western economies. The European Central Bank is set to complete preparations for its 'digital euro' CBDC this year. Americans may now have a presidential order \""prohibiting… a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States,\"" but stablecoins look set to become government CBDCs disguised in decentralized private-bank clothing, able to perform the same functions. The current US administration's enthusiasm for stablecoins is remarkably aligned with the favored CBDC framework of the BIS, \""a hybrid model which allows the division of labor between the central bank and private intermediaries.\"" For a peek into this potential stablecoin-as-CBDC world, just look at what being embedded in the US dollar system already means for the world's leading stablecoin. \""We follow US laws and regulations when it comes to freezing,\"" says Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, which doesn't even operate inside the United States. \""We have on-boarded the FBI and US secret services; we work with the Department of Justice almost daily and the Treasury.\""Whether it's called a CBDC or not, you'll likely soon be subjected to some form of digital fiat. But, at present, there's nothing to stop you from accessing some self-sovereign 'outside-the-system' money. As permissionless peer-to-peer digital cash, Bitcoin can defend against monetary serfdom and protect from the failures of financial institutions. And, in its own sly roundabout way, it is the best and only truly decentralized tool for doing so.Opinion by: Simon Cain, contributor at Bitcoin Policy UK.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. Critics said that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. “I think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent.Some also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest.Critics of OP_RETURN limit removal.

2025-05-06T06:01:33.000Z,"Celsius’ Mashinsky lashes out at ‘death-in-prison sentence’","Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, has blasted the government's 20-year “venom-laced” sentence request, declaring it a “death-in-prison sentence.”The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.  “The government's venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said.“It concludes by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.”Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argue the DOJ has ignored their client's background in its sentencing request. Source: Court ListenerMashinsky pleaded guilty to two out of seven charges As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023.Lawyers acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ’s push for a 20-year sentence is because their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government’s exaggerated characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from the get-go.” “Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action, every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation, and every employee's watercooler speculation,” they said.As part of its April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive and steal.Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the protocol, believing Mashinsky’s assurances that it was safe.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions.In November 2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius' restructuring plan to repay customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors.Former Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-mashinsky-lashes-govt-death-in-prison-sentence?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

(HOOD), which saw crypto trading dip in the first quarter but whose shares have climbed by nearly 30% so far this year, according to Google Finance.In the filing, eToro said some BlackRock funds and accounts indicated interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO. eToro has also put aside 500,000 shares to sell through a directed share program, typically targeted at employees.The company reported that its revenue from crypto in 2024 was $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It expected crypto to account for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter.Source: Matthew SigelIn a section of its filing listing possible risks to the business, eToro warned its users could leave, or it could struggle to get more users, due to negative perceptions of the cryptocurrencies it lists, “either as a result of media coverage or by experiencing significant losses.”Other crypto-related risks the eToro flagged included US state-level crypto regulation, which it said “may place strain on our resources and make it difficult to operate in certain jurisdictions, if at all.”It also said it expects “to continue to incur significant costs” due to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) laws “on an ongoing basis.”IPOs ready to push after Trump tariff jolt EToro initially made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering, before publicly announcing the plans on March 24.The company reportedly delayed its IPO after President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped many in-the-works public offerings.Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?Crypto companies are also lining up to go public, with stablecoin issuer Circle filing on April 1 but then pausing its plans amid the uncertainty.Crypto exchange Kraken is also reportedly considering a public offering for early next year, which has accelerated its plan with Trump’s election.EToro’s public offering is led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS Investment Bank and Citigroup.Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/etoro-us-ipo-4-billion-valuation-500-million-raise?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

However, Nomad never heard back from him after that.Alleged messages between Gurevich and Nomad’s James Prestwich were shared on X by Israel-based Walla News journalist Yoav Itiel.

We will never ask anyone for payments like this via DM or otherwise,” they said. The team said that based on the illicit contract address the hacker posted, the amount improperly solicited appeared to be around $45,000. Asked whether the same hacker could be responsible for the supposed New York Post’s X account hack on May 3, the Tron team told Cointelegraph that there “appear to be some similarities” between the two security incidents; however, they also cautioned that the investigation is ongoing and “any definitive connection would be premature.” After regaining access, Tron DAO said in a May 2 X update that they suspect the hack resulted from a team member being “targeted in a malicious social engineering attack, which led to their account being compromised.”Source: Tron DAO“Even after the perpetrator was logged out and our access restored, they continued contacting others, offering posts from our main account in exchange for payment,” Tron DAO said.The Tron team is still investigating and says they are in contact with law enforcement.

Source: US House Agriculture CommitteeOne of the major changes from FIT21 is that the draft defines an affiliated person as anyone who owns more than 1% of a digital commodity issued by the project — down from 5% in the FIT21 bill — a move Slaughter said may curb the influence of big crypto firms and lead to more participation in the crypto market.“This is a portent of the entire bill. There are often criticisms of crypto being too dominated by a few large firms. This bill makes clear the regulatory regime proposed is going to push against that fact and strongly encourage more small-d ‘democratization’ of the space.”The draft also defines a “mature blockchain system” as one that, together with its related digital commodity, is not under the “common control” of any person or group.Source: Justin SlaughterThe Securities and Exchange Commission would be the main authority regulating activity on crypto networks until they become sufficiently decentralized, Slaughter noted.The draft also clarified that decentralized finance trading protocols are those that enable users to engage in a financial transaction in a “self-directed manner.” Protocols that meet this criterion are exempt from registering as digital commodity brokers or dealers.The draft also referred to digital commodities as “investment contract assets” to distinguish their treatment from stocks and other traditional assets under the Howey test.According to Slaughter’s analysis, securities laws won’t be triggered unless the secondary sale of tokens also transfers ownership or profit in the underlying business.Crypto firms would also have a path to raise funds under the SEC’s oversight while also having a “clear process” to register their digital commodities with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the committee members said in a separate May 5 statement.Joint rulemaking, procedures, or guidelines related to crypto asset delisting must be established by the CFTC and SEC should a registered asset no longer comply with rules laid out by the regulators.A ‘clear opportunity’ to advance crypto innovation, rules once and for allSpeaking about the need for a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, the House committee members said crypto is a “clear opportunity” to advance innovation in the US — most notably through modernizing America’s financial infrastructure and reinforcing US dollar dominance.The Republicans criticized the previous Biden administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC for adopting a regulation-by-enforcement strategy rather than creating clear rules for market participants.Related: VanEck files for BNB ETF, first in USMany crypto firms were stuck in “legal limbo” as a result of the unclear rules, which pushed some industry players overseas, where clearer rules exist, the House committee members said.“America needs to be the powerhouse for digital asset investment and innovation.

The government alleged the platform helped with over $2 billion in illegal transactions and facilitated over $100 million worth of money laundering transactions from online black markets and scammers.Rodriguez and Hill both pleaded not guilty.In the letter, their lawyers said prosecutors shared details of a call with Kevin O’Connor, chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente.According to an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the call, FinCEN said that “because Samourai does not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].”An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListenerThe email said O’Connor and Valente agreed that the government could try to argue that Samourai functionally controlled the crypto, “but that has never been addressed in the guidance, and so it could be a difficult argument” for prosecutors.Samourai’s lawyers asked the court for a hearing “to determine the circumstances surrounding the Government’s late disclosure” and to administer a remedy.Samourai to renew dismissal bid if case goes onRodriguez and Hill’s lawyers said that, using this latest information, they would again ask for the charges to be dismissed, arguing they lacked fair notice and “understood they were acting lawfully.”Related: US Treasury’s OFAC can’t restore Tornado Cash sanctions, judge rules Prosecutors and Samourai asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider potentially dismissing the case after the Justice Department rolled back its crypto enforcement.Rodriguez and Hill bid to dismiss the case in early April, arguing it should be dropped as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an April 7 memo that the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In the latest letter, their lawyers said if the government “were to resist the Blanche Memo’s directive and push forward,” then they would bid to dismiss as “if they were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance, then they could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.”Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 — The race to build safe and legal coin mixers",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/samourai-wallet-feds-hid-advice-crypto-mixer-didnt-need-license?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang members, terrorists, human-traffickers and other criminals.”The former SafeMoon CEO asked the court in February to consider pushing back the start of the trial based on “significant changes” Trump had proposed affecting US securities laws, potentially impacting his criminal case.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Though not as well known for criminal cases involving high-profile figures in the crypto industry, the Eastern District of New York has been responsible for overseeing cases against individuals tied to digital assets, including a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against Hex founder Richard Heart and fraudsters. Its neighboring district, the Southern District of New York, will oversee the sentencing of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky on May 8. Jay Clayton, a Wall Street insider and the former chair of the SEC, became the interim US Attorney for the district in April.Criminal trial to start on May 6SafeMoon’s Karony, Kyle Nagy, and Thomas Smith were charged in November 2023 for “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token between 2021 and 2022. Karony has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has been free on a $3 million bond since February 2024.In a May 5 filing, Karony agreed to have jury selection for his trial proceed under US Magistrate Judge James Cho.

2025-05-05T21:33:00.000Z,"OpenAI to stay nonprofit, scrap proposed overhaul","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has abandoned plans to become a for-profit company and reaffirmed commitment to its nonprofit status. In a May 5 blog post, OpenAI confirmed plans to convert its for-profit business unit into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would remain under the nonprofit’s control. PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. “OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said. This can be done without compromising OpenAI’s ability to raise funds for AI development, which “currently requires hundreds of billions of dollars and may eventually require trillions of dollars,” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said in a letter to employees announcing the decision. In 2024, OpenAI took a starkly different view, asserting that the for-profit entity was “necessary” for raising capital to amass the “vast quantities of compute” needed to run AI models. OpenAI’s May 5 governance announcement. Source: OpenAIRelated: OpenAI expects to 3X revenue in 2025 but Chinese AI firms are heating upControversial Plans OpenAI was originally founded as a nonprofit in 2015, and in 2019 it created a for-profit entity purportedly to help AI developers raise funds. The for-profit unit has remained under the nonprofit’s control since then. In 2024, Tesla CEO Elon Musk — one of OpenAI’s cofounders — sued Altman for allegedly “violating terms of Musk’s foundational contributions to the charity,” according to a November court filing. In the lawsuit, Musk alleges Altman “assiduously manipulated Musk into co-founding their spurious nonprofit venture, OpenAI,” while secretly planning to convert OpenAI to a for-profit entity. Musk has since launched xAI, the developer of AI chatbot Grok, which he said has fallen victim to OpenAI’s allegedly anti-competitive practices.OpenAI’s leadership expects its revenue to hit $29.4 billion by 2026, Bloomberg reported in March. It forecasts earning revenues of $12.7 billion in 2025. In March, OpenAI raised $40 billion from Softbank at a $300 billion valuation.

2025-05-05T21:15:00.000Z,"Good actors were &#039;unfairly targeted&#039; by SEC — OpenSea&#039;s CEO","The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement approach on crypto firms has left a lasting “regulatory overhang” within the industry, according to Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”The SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities. At the time, Finzer criticized the SEC for taking an approach of “regulation by enforcement” and said that OpenSea was prepared to “stand up and fight.”With the SEC under new leadership by Chair Paul Atkins, Finzer is hopeful for a more balanced regulatory framework. “Good crypto regulation needs to balance, sort of, protecting consumers but also preserving the ability to innovate,” Finzer said. “It’s not just a one-size-fits-all problem, right?”Under the Trump administration, the SEC has scaled back enforcement actions against several crypto firms, marking a policy shift in the US after years of enforcement actions led by former Chair Gary Gensler.For instance, the agency has withdrawn legal challenges against exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, NFT companies Yuga Labs and OpenSea, and decentralized finance protocol Uniswap — most of them opened during Gensler’s term. The SEC has even dismissed its years-long case against Ripple.During the 2024 US election cycle, the crypto industry widely backed then-candidate Donald Trump, who promised to make the United States “the crypto capital of the planet.” Overall, crypto super political action committees, or PACs, donated over $119 million into the coffers of pro-crypto candidates, helping shape the elections.Related: Crypto’s debanking problem persists despite new regulationsNFTs: Low trading volume, high innovationThe SEC crackdown on crypto firms had weighed on the markets downturn following FTX collapse in November 2022, driving investors away from crypto products such as nonfungible tokensSince then, NFT trading volume has plummeted from its 2021 peak, affecting protocols and platforms such as OpenSea. In 2023, the company laid off 50% of its staff amid the market turmoil.Finzer says the NFT space is still flourishing, with innovation and new applications coming to life — especially in the gaming industry and art collectibles. Despite this, OpenSea has started exploring other areas, seeking to diversify its business to become a destination for all onchain trading beyond NFTs.“I mean, for the first time in the history of the internet, people have the ability to own digital stuff, right, in a real way,” Finzer said. “[...] you can move them around between different applications and take them with you wherever you go on the internet. And that's something that's really powerful.”Related: OpenSea denies NFT airdrop rumors, calls website a test page",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/good-actors-were-unfairly-targeted-by-sec-new-approach-thoughtful-devin-finzer?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-05T20:53:56.000Z,"Trump’s crypto dealings face scrutiny as House Republicans unveil digital asset bill","US President Donald Trump’s crypto businesses are drawing increased scrutiny on Capitol Hill and beginning to influence the progress of US digital asset legislation. As Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives unveiled their draft of a digital asset market structure bill on May 5, Democrats prepared for a united response to Donald Trump’s deepening connections with the industry.Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 5, a Democratic staffer with knowledge of the matter said that House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters planned to lead some members of her party out of a Republican-led hearing discussing digital assets. The May 6 hearing, entitled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets” and led by Committee Chair French Hill, could address draft legislation proposed by Republican lawmakers to establish a crypto market regulatory structure.In a May 5 statement, Rep. Hill and three top Republicans unveiled the draft bill, which could clarify the treatment of digital assets by the US’s financial regulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Hill and others echoed some of Trump’s talking points on crypto — e.g, making the US a “crypto capital of the world” — suggesting deference to the president’s previously announced policies.The draft bill included a provision requiring the SEC and CFTC to issue joint rules defining digital commodities. According to the text, transactions involving digital commodities “shall be deemed not to be an offer or sale of an investment contract” as long as the purchaser did not have “an ownership interest or other interest in the revenues, profits, or assets.”According to the Democratic staffer, rules required all members of the House Financial Services Committee to agree to move forward with the digital asset hearing, suggesting that Waters intended to block the Republican-controlled event and conduct a shadow hearing to explore Trump’s and his family’s ties to the crypto industry. At least nine Democrats have reportedly considered a similar move to oppose a proposed stablecoin bill in the Senate.Calls for impeachment, criticism from both sidesSome members of Congress have already called for Trump’s impeachment after he offered the opportunity for some of his top memecoin holders to tour the White House and attend a private dinner. In addition to the memecoin, the president’s family has backed the firm World Liberty Financial, which recently launched its own stablecoin, and an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm used the USD1 stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.Related: US Senator calls for Trump impeachment, cites memecoin dinnerWaters, according to the staffer, requested that Hill and Republicans amend any proposed legislation to explicitly prevent potential conflicts of interest in which Trump could personally enrich himself through crypto ventures. Cointelegraph reached out to Hill’s office but did not receive a response at the time of publication. The Arkansas lawmaker reportedly said in March that the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto industry makes related legislation “more complicated.”Republican lawmakers in the United States currently have control of the House, Senate, and presidency. At least two senators supportive of Trump have criticized his memecoin dinner, hinting that the president was selling access to his office. It’s unclear at the time of publication who among the memecoin holders could attend the May 22 dinner in person.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questionsThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-structure-bill-hearing-opposition?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.Bitcoin market share excluding stablecoins. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitcoin’s dominance over the broader cryptocurrency market has surged, currently standing at 70%, its highest since January 2021. This has occurred despite a wave of new token launches, including several top-50 projects such as SUI, Toncoin (TON), PI, Official Trump (TRUMP), Bittensor (TAO), Ethena (ENA), and Celestia (TIA). This dominance makes riskier altcoins less appealing to new market entrants.The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $4.5 billion in net inflows between April 22 and May 2. At the same time, the increasing appetite for Bitcoin futures signals growing institutional adoption regardless of whether leverage is used for downside protection or bullish bets.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, BTC. Source: CoinGlassAccording to CoinGlass, the total open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has reached 669,090 BTC, a 21% increase since March 5. Even after Bitcoin’s price crashed below $75,000 in early April, demand for leveraged positions remained strong. The open interest in BTC futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) alone exceeds $13.5 billion, indicating robust institutional demand.Several factors explain why Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $100,000 level. Traders who bought in anticipation of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill on March 6 are growing increasingly frustrated, as the government has yet to disclose its BTC holdings or announce plans for further purchases. Additionally, similar state-level Bitcoin bills have repeatedly failed, including the latest setback in the US state of Arizona.Strategy doubles its plans for BTC acquisitions despite the global trade war Over the past three months, gold has outperformed most assets, rising 16%, while Bitcoin has declined by 5% and the S&P 500 has corrected by 6.5%. This has challenged the notion of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, as the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to decouple from the S&P 500 amid rising economic risks. The global trade war has led investors to favor fixed-income assets and cash positions.5-year US Treasury yield (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitcoin’s recent drop to $94,000 is particularly concerning given that Strategy, a US-listed company led by Michael Saylor, announced the acquisition of 1,895 BTC on May 5, after doubling its capital increase plan to fund further Bitcoin purchases. However, since investors were previously uncertain about Strategy’s ability to raise additional capital, the announcement of an $84 billion plan on May 1 has reduced some of this risk.For Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high, investors will likely need reassurance that US-China trade relations are improving, as tariffs have negatively impacted overall risk appetite. Nevertheless, the key elements for a BTC bull run above $100,000 appear to be in place.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

According to a May 5 press release issued by the agency, the Karen National Army has been orchestrating a variety of crypto scams, including the infamous “pig butchering” scam, which lures victims into contributing more and more to fake crypto schemes. Americans “have collectively lost billions of dollars” from scams such as those emanating from Myanmar, the release reads, without specifying an amount.“Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the Karen National Army (KNA), a militia group in Burma, as a transnational criminal organization, along with the group’s leader Saw Chit Thu, and his two sons, Saw Htoo Eh Moo and Saw Chit Chit, for their role in facilitating cyber scams that harm U.S. citizens, human trafficking, and cross-border smuggling,” the release reads.Many international bodies, including the US, continue to refer to “Burma,” the country’s former name, to demonstrate that they don’t recognize the military regimes that have been in power at various times since a 1989 coup in which the military changed the name to Myanmar. The KNA operates in southeastern Myanmar, along the Thailand border.The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued numerous sanctions against crypto-offenders over the past few years, including Middle East-based terrorist groups, cybercrime units operating overseas, and privacy-focused crypto technology like Tornado Cash.Related: FBI warns of North Korean ’social engineering’ schemes to steal cryptoCrypto scams target US residentsAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Americans lost $9.3 billion to crypto scams in 2024, an increase of roughly 66% from 2023. The most affected group is formed by individuals over the age of 60, who reported a cumulative loss total of $2.8 billion.Pig butchering scams are known for their significant impact on victims, both in the crypto space and beyond. The scam consists of a long-term financial fraud where scammers build trust with victims over time, often through social media or messaging platforms, before convincing them to invest in fake or manipulated crypto schemes. According to TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence company, these scams accounted for well over $4.4 billion stolen in 2023.According to the Treasury Department’s press release, this type of scam is currently common in Southeast Asia, primarily involving trafficked individuals defrauding victims.

Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.“Many of the people who participated in this fraud, benefited from this fraud, and potentially orchestrated this fraud will get away with zero legal consequences,” said Daniel Frishberg of Hillsborough County, Florida, in an April 24 statement. “Please do not allow Mr. Mashinsky to be one of those people (such as with probation/house arrest, as some people supporting him have requested). Please throw the book at him.”A victim impact statement from a Celsius user filed with the SDNY on May 2. Source: PACERProsecutors have requested that Mashinsky serve up to 20 years in prison for his role in Celsius’ fraud, while the former CEO’s legal team asked for a year and one day. The judge will consider guidelines and victim statements at sentencing on May 8.Calls for leniency and harsh prison timeNot everyone who sent in a letter to the prosecutors seemed to be in favor of Mashinsky being sent away for decades, as was former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried. SBF stood before a different federal judge in the same district in March 2024 and was handed a 25-year sentence, which he is currently serving in a California prison. “While Celsius [sic] collapse caused significant losses, particularly for Bitcoin holders, shareholders, and borrowers, despite his mistakes, Mr. Mashinsky was, at times, the more conservative voice in an industry overflowing with unchecked greed,” said Artur Abreu in a victim impact statement.“The twenty-year sentence suggested by the US DOJ is fair in my opinion, as Mashinsky caused pain and suffering for many crypto investors across the globe – even resulting in suicide for some of those involved,” said Web3 Deep Dive podcast host and former Cointelegraph reporter Rachel Wolfson, who lost access to Bitcoin worth about $5,000 at the time. “Harsh punishment for bad actors in the crypto industry has become necessary to ensure that the space legitimizes over time.”Mashinsky’s sentencing will be one of the first in significant crypto cases in the district since Jay Clayton became interim US Attorney for SDNY. A Trump appointee, Clayton was previously the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto proponent on many issues. Critics have suggested that Clayton would take a softer approach to crypto enforcement, given his ties to Wall Street firms and the industry. However, he also released a statement in April regarding a $12-million crypto case, suggesting that he supported accountability for fraudulent actions. His response to Mashinsky’s sentencing and other future cases could be a bellwether for the US Attorney’s approach to crypto.Related: US prosecutors file over 200 victim statements in Celsius ex-CEO’s case",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alex-mashinsky-celsius-prison-sentencing?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week and rose above the 50-day simple moving average (5,575).SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day exponential moving average (5,501) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to buyers. The up move could reach 5,800, which is expected to attract strong selling by the bears. If the price turns down from 5,800, it is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening. The index may drop to 5,400 and subsequently to 5,300.US Dollar Index price predictionThe US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced off the 99 support on April 29 and reached the 20-day EMA (100.38) on May 1.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, but a minor positive is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the index could rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 101.39 and then to the 50-day SMA (102.72).This positive view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below the 99 level. That could sink the index to the critical support at 97.92.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin closed below the $95,000 support on May 4, and the bears are trying to extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($92,204).BTC/USDT daily chart.

If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to propel the BTC/USDT pair to the psychological level of $100,000. Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($86,890). A deeper pullback suggests a range formation in the near term.Ether price predictionBuyers have managed to sustain Ether (ETH) above the moving averages, signaling strength.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($1,771) is sloping up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be crossed. The ETH/USDT pair could surge to the breakdown level of $2,111, where the bears are expected to sell aggressively.A break and close below the moving averages opens the gates for a fall to $1,537 and later to the critical support at $1,368.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBoth moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if they drive the price above the resistance line. The XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3, suggesting a short-term trend change.On the contrary, a break and close below $2 will put the sellers in charge. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.61, where the buyers are expected to step in.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) slipped below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf buyers push the price above the moving averages, it suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls will then attempt to overcome the barrier at $620. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could shoot up to $644.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it suggests that the bears are trying to take control. There is support in the $576 to $566 zone, but if it breaks down, the pair could dive to $520.Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($143), indicating that the bulls remain buyers on dips.SOL/USDT daily chart.

If they do that, the pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($133).

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations. Bitcoin percent supply in profit. Source: X.comBitcoin's price staged a recovery from its long-term cumulative mean percentage in profit, marking a notable shift. Previously, in August 2024, Bitcoin retested the 75% mean at around $60,000. This suggests that the price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent the bottom, aligning with the structural market conditions observed in Q3 2024.Confirming the decrease in holder sales through exchanges, the total exchange flow (inflow + outflow) to network activity ratio provides further insight. Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. explained that the chart shows a 1.5x decrease in ratio following Bitcoin’s all-time high, directly confirming that the current growth is more organic.Bitcoin exchange flows to the network activity ratio. Source: Axel Adler Jr. The analyst explained that, unlike previous price peaks, where a high ratio (marked by orange bars) signaled heavy selling, current levels show no such urgency, reinforcing a more stable market environment.High profitability and reduced exchange inflows indicate diminished selling pressure from holders, enabling an improved holder’s mindset between $75,000 and $95,000. This suggests that investors viewed BTC as undervalued and not as an exit opportunity, which aligned with the broader bullish sentiment.

2025-05-05T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto market manipulation schemes are becoming increasingly coordinated","Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXCMarket manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.A tale as old as time Market manipulation is as old as markets themselves. In ancient Greece, a philosopher named Thales of Miletus used his knowledge of weather patterns to predict a bumper olive harvest, quietly leasing all the olive presses in the region at a low rate before the season started. Then, when the harvest came in, and demand for presses spiked, he rented them out at inflated prices, pocketing the difference. For a more recent historical example, albeit still 300 years in the past, see the South Sea Company bubble in which company directors dumped shares at peak prices, leaving regular investors rekt. Or the Dutch tulip bubble of a century earlier. Market manipulation has existed in crypto since the first exchanges came onstream around 2011. Those who were around back then may recall the pump-and-dump schemes on the BTC-E exchange orchestrated by a notorious trader called Fontas. Or they might remember Bear Whale, whose 30,000 BTC sell wall crashed the market at a time when total daily trading volume was less than $30 million — for all of crypto combined. While not technically market manipulation, it showed how easily one individual could move the crypto market.Fast forward to today, and crypto is a multi-trillion dollar asset class, rendering manipulation of large-cap assets virtually impossible for solitary whales. But when a group of nefarious traders team up, it's still possible to move markets — and well-organized insiders are doing just that.Manipulators make their moveThe days when a single whale could set a BTC sell wall that took weeks to topple are long gone. While crypto is magnitudes more liquid these days, it's also much more fragmented. This presents opportunities to enterprising traders who hunt in packs to move markets to their advantage. Often working through private Telegram groups, people coordinate activities targeting markets where they can have the most effect. The trend highlights the growing participation of major players in market manipulation schemes, presenting a new level of risk for the crypto industry. Recent: What are exit liquidity traps — and how to detect them before it is too lateIn February, analyst James CryptoGuru warned of large-scale manipulation risks involving spot Bitcoin ETFs. He explained that these instruments could put downward pressure on Bitcoin's price — particularly when traditional financial markets are closed. Such a strategy could trigger liquidations among leveraged traders and create temporary imbalances, allowing large players to accumulate BTC and ETH at discounted prices.Because crypto — both onchain and on-exchange — is highly interconnected, the ripple effects of a successful manipulation attempt extend far and wide. If a trading pair queried by APIs for feeding other markets is knocked out of sync on one centralized exchange, it can generate arbitrage opportunities elsewhere, including on perps markets. As a result, an attack can be initiated on one exchange, and the profits claimed on another, making it extremely hard to catch the culprits.The integrity of the cryptocurrency market faces increased risk. Coordinated groups have deep pockets, technical tools, and cross-platform access to execute and mask complex operations. The troubling part is that most exchanges remain reactive by design since it's virtually impossible to prevent market manipulation. As a result, attackers have a high chance of retaining the advantage, even if the window in which they're free to run amok is becoming increasingly smaller.Not all manipulators break the rulesJust as Thales of Miletus wasn't breaking the rules when he profited off olive season, much of what constitutes crypto manipulation isn't illegal. When a large fund starts buying a particular token through one of their public wallets to attract attention — is that manipulation? Or when market makers go beyond simply matching bid-ask spreads to actively propping up a token's price at the request of a project? Many things move markets, but mostly things that aren't illegal — at least not now.While the moral code governing influencers, market makers, trading firms, and other players of serious size can be debated at length, other cases require less nuance. The last time anyone checked, using thousands of exchange accounts staffed by dozens of users to inflate a particular asset is blatant manipulation. Exchanges, aided by increasingly sophisticated AI-powered tooling, are fighting back.The days when one user would cause mayhem on the markets may be over. The threat hasn't, however, dissipated in the multichain, multi-exchange era — it's multiplied. As a result, exchanges are now locked into a game of whack-a-mole, trying to detect suspicious behavior initiated by hundreds or thousands of accounts simultaneously.Thankfully, exchanges don't have to do it alone, as successful collaboration cases show. When Bybit was hacked in early 2025, other platforms stepped in to lend ETH and help it meet its withdrawal obligations — a rare but powerful sign of solidarity in the face of crisis.As well-funded, highly organized groups continue to test the system, one thing becomes clear: manipulating the market may be relatively easy — but doing so without being detected is increasingly difficult. Collective vigilance, data sharing, and early detection are becoming the most effective tools in safeguarding the integrity of the crypto trading ecosystem.Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXC.
