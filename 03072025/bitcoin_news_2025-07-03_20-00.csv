2025-07-03T17:54:27,"Institutional Inflows Quietly Building in BTC: Metrics Suggest Breakout Risk","In the shadows of subdued retail interest and choppy price action, a silent force is gathering momentum in Bitcoin's corner. Institutional inflows are quietly but steadily building beneath the surface. While traditional on-chain metrics may fail to capture the full extent of this movement, multiple signs suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) may be gearing up for a breakout. This analysis, provided by Outset PR , a crypto-focused communications firm, takes a closer look at the disconnect between on-chain stagnation and off-chain accumulation. Like the firm’s approach to data-led PR strategy, the story unfolding in Bitcoin is one of latent buildup, not headline-making moves—at least, not yet. ETF Inflows Speak Louder Than Charts The most compelling evidence of institutional appetite comes not from blockchain data, but from regulated investment vehicles. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively drawn in nearly $4 billion in June 2025 alone, underscoring growing demand from asset managers, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Among them, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a behemoth, managing over $75 billion in BTC holdings, and frequently ranking in the top 10 most traded ETFs. Source: blackrock This surge in the ETF is a structural shift in how institutions access Bitcoin: through compliant, familiar channels that allow deep-pocketed investors to gain exposure without custody risk. And because ETF flows happen off-chain, they don’t leave a trail in traditional blockchain metrics like exchange balances or whale movements. Corporate Treasuries Quietly Stack Sats Corporations aren’t staying on the sidelines either. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues its relentless BTC accumulation, purchasing 4,980 BTC worth over $531 million in late June. This brings its total to an eye-watering 597,325 BTC, cementing its role as a strategic vault for the digital asset. Across the Atlantic, a quiet trend is unfolding in London: small- to mid-cap companies are turning to Bitcoin to revive investor interest. At least nine UK-listed firms have recently disclosed BTC holdings or plans to acquire the asset, echoing MicroStrategy’s playbook for shareholder value creation. Off-Chain Activity Skews On-Chain Readings While blockchain data shows modest exchange outflows and flat miner sales, the real story lies off-chain. Institutional buyers favor over-the-counter (OTC) desks and ETF vehicles, both of which obscure their footprints. As a result, analysts relying solely on on-chain metrics may miss the quiet accumulation underway. This divergence between visible metrics and institutional activity suggests a structural inefficiency in how crypto markets are currently interpreted. It also hints at latent demand pressure—the kind that doesn’t move prices immediately, but builds a coiled-spring setup. BTC Technical Setup Points to a Breakout Risk Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,700, consolidating in a tight band between $104,000 and $110,000. But beneath this calm lies a setup loaded with breakout potential. Source: tradingview According to technical analysts, clearing the $114,000 resistance level could unleash a rally of up to 25%, pushing BTC into the $140,000+ territory. Key resistance awaits at $114,000, and the next challenge will be surpassing the $123,000 mark. Support is solid just above $95,000. This setup hints at a possible upward movement. The 10-day and 100-day averages are aligned, suggesting steadiness. The RSI at 41 indicates it's not overbought, leaving room to climb. Overall, Bitcoin's path seems cautiously optimistic with room to test higher boundaries.

2025-07-03T17:48:10,"Why Is The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Lagging Peers?","Summary The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) has lagged peers in AUM growth and even has negative year to date BTC supply held through the fund. iShares dominates US Bitcoin ETF flows, capturing the vast majority of new investment and leaving little market share for smaller funds like BTCO. BTCO's 0.25% expense ratio is less competitive versus some peers, and its higher post-waiver fee at launch likely deterred long-term investors. Despite its small size, BTCO functions effectively as a Bitcoin ETF proxy, but cheaper and more established alternatives remain more attractive for most investors. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) getting increasingly gobbled up by the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) and Bitcoin Treasury companies like Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF ), not every US-listed Bitcoin ETF has benefited from the same type of inflows as the market leader. In this article, we'll look at the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) relative to peers. 12 Month Holdings Trend, BTCO (TheBlock) The fund's BTC holdings have fallen year to date while the broader US-based Bitcoin ETF segment has seen year to date inflows of over 21% measured in BTC. Is there a reason why the fund has lagged the rest of the market in AUM growth over the last 6 months? I think yes. Bitcoin Capital Flows and Provider AUM As of June 27th, the capital flow story for Bitcoin continues to be incredibly impressive in 2025. As of article submission, the digital asset sector is working on 11 consecutive weeks of positive net flows into investment products. Bitcoin's month to date investment product net flow as of June 27th was $4.6 billion. Year date net flow came in at nearly $15 million through the first half of 2025: Asset (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $4,604 $14,925 $159,399 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $1,432 $2,859 $14,614 Multi-asset -$17.3 $58 $6,814 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $8.3 $91 $1,328 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $21.2 $219 $1,184 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 BTC Dominance 76.0% 84.0% 86.4% Bitcoin is clearly benefiting from demand through capital flows with 76% of digital asset net flow month to date and 84% share year to date. These are impressive numbers. It isn't just a Bitcoin story though, this is very much a BlackRock ( BLK ) story as well. When we break down the capital flows by provider, it's quite clear there is a dominant product provider in the market. The iShares funds account for 77% of the month to date flows and a staggering 96% of digital asset investment demand year to date. Provider (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $4,651 $17,053 $78,605 Grayscale $74 -$1,652 $29,892 Fidelity $355 $249 $21,516 ARK 21 Shrs $97 $75 $5,018 Bitwise $227 -$59 $4,511 ProShares $90 $526 $4,101 21Shares AG $18 -$200 $3,750 CoinShares XBT -$57 -$269 $3,446 Other $605 $2,055 $33,575 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of June 27th, 2025 Invesco's share of the digital asset investment space is so small that CoinShares doesn't even break it out in the company's digital asset fund flow reports. When we assess BTC AUM as a percent of total issuer AUM, Invesco's Bitcoin holdings are a rounding error while iShares has 1% of total AUM in Bitcoin: Billions (as of Q1-25) Total AUM Bitcoin ETF BTC % Invesco $1,845 $0.44 0.02% iShares $4,303 $46.60 1.08% Sources: Invesco, YCharts This kind of dominance is hard to overcome if you're a competitor like Invesco and it begs the obvious question; why? BTCO Fund Details Like the other spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States, BTCO launched in mid-January 2024. For the sake of comparison, the table below shows fund details for the following Bitcoin ETFs: WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ) Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ) CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ) Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) What each of these funds have in common is that they are the bottom 6 US-listed Bitcoin ETFs in the market in terms of assets under management: Fund Details BTCO BTCW EZBC BRRR BITB HODL Issuer Invesco WisdomTree Franklin Templeton Investments Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC Bitwise Investments VanEck Expense Ratio 0.25% 0.25% 0.19% 0.00% 0.20% 0.00% AUM $569.35M $169.44M $564.43M $641.00M $4.30B $1.72B Source: Seeking Alpha For me, the biggest standout difference between these funds is the expense ratios. At 0.25%, BTCO is on the expensive side relative to the selected funds above. But by itself, that doesn't necessarily explain the lack of interest in BTCO. For instance, BITB appears to be a significant outlier in this table. At a 0.20% expense ratio, that fund is closer to BTCO than a fund like BRRR yet has the largest AUM in our sample by far. In my view, there are two key reasons for this. First, Bitwise Investments is a crypto-native asset manager. This is not an issuer that touches traditional index ETFs and even has a digital asset fund that offers exposure to tokens like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Thus, I think Bitwise has benefited from crypto trustworthiness to a larger degree than each of the other issuers shows. Also, BITB uses part of its management fee to fund Bitcoin development. The other issuer that has committed to such an action is VanEck - so it's likely not surprising to see each of these two funds with the two largest AUMs of the bottom 6 funds. Still, this doesn't explain why BTCO has performed so badly against a fund like IBIT. I suspect the original roll out of these funds has been a factor. Consider this screenshot from my Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) from January 2024 : Original expense ratios (Seeking Alpha/IntoTheBlock) Back in January 2024 when these funds originally launched, BTCO would have had one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market at 0.39%. Even though there was a 0.00% waiver on the first $1 billion in AUM or for 6 months, investors looking for long term solutions likely balked at BTCO due to the fee after waiver. BRRR also had a high post-waiver fee and has a very similar AUM to that of BTCO today. Fund Performance Ultimately, what likely matters most for potential BTCO investors is how the fund actually performs compared to the products in the market. So far, there is virtually no difference between these funds based on total return over the last year: Data by YCharts We can see the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) is the obvious laggard of the bunch above. That is entirely due to the fund's egregious 1.5% expense ratio. But short of choosing to minimize third party custodian risk to Coinbase ( COIN ) through FBTC, there is very little difference between these products. Closing Thoughts For investors looking for a simple way to get Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper, BTCO will work perfectly fine. Is it the cheapest fund? No. Is it the biggest by AUM? No. In fact, it's one of the smallest by AUM and that is likely due to some combination of the fund's current 0.25% expense ratio relative to slightly cheaper alternatives today and the fact that the product launched with one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market. The lack of early adoption is perhaps haunting AUM growth today. But, again, purely as a Bitcoin proxy, it'll likely work just as well as the other funds that rely on Coinbase for custody.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799171-why-invesco-galaxy-bitcoin-etf-lagging-peers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL","BTCO",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T17:46:51,"Top Cryptocurrencies for Decentralized Gambling (BTC, Stablecoins, and More)","The rise of decentralized gambling has redefined how players engage with online sportsbooks and casinos. No more lengthy KYC procedures, delayed withdrawals, or centralized control. Thanks to blockchain technology, bettors now have the freedom to wager anonymously, instantly, and across multiple chains. But with so many cryptocurrencies available, which ones are best suited for the world of decentralized gambling? From the battle-tested Bitcoin to lightning-fast altcoins, here are the top crypto picks fueling the next generation of trustless betting. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): The OG That Still Dominates Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto betting. Despite its relatively slower transaction times and higher fees compared to newer chains, BTC is universally accepted across virtually every decentralized and centralized gambling platform. Its primary appeal is security and liquidity. For high-stakes players and whales, Bitcoin offers unmatched trust, deep market depth, and ease of conversion. It also continues to expand in Web3-native casinos that support fast deposits and withdrawals via Layer 2 integrations or wrapped BTC tokens. 2. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) For Predictable Play Stablecoins are rapidly becoming the preferred choice for everyday bettors. USDT (Tether) leads the pack thanks to its wide availability and robust liquidity, followed closely by USDC. With their value pegged to the US dollar rate, these tokens offer price stability which makes them ideal for players who don’t want market swings affecting their betting capital. Most decentralized casinos and sportsbooks including Dexsport now accept stablecoins across multiple chains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Tron, Polygon, etc.), enabling frictionless betting with near-zero volatility. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Powering Smart Bets Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized applications—including many of today’s most innovative gambling platforms. From on-chain sportsbooks to provably fair dice games, ETH is the fuel that powers trustless betting. With smart contracts at its core, Ethereum enables features like automated payouts, fair game logic, and transparent results. Though it can suffer from network congestion and gas fees, Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base) are rapidly improving transaction speed and affordability. 4. Tron (TRX): Fast, Cheap, and Gaining Ground Tron has quietly become a powerhouse in the crypto gambling space. Known for its ultra-low fees and high throughput, TRX is widely used in decentralized casino games and lottery-style applications. Its ecosystem supports a wide array of dApps and betting platforms, particularly in markets where low-cost transactions are essential. Tron’s native support for stablecoins like USDT also makes it a strong contender for cost-effective play. 5. BNB (Binance Coin): A Utility Giant with Casino Reach Binance’s BNB token has moved far beyond its exchange origins. Today, BNB powers one of the most active smart contract networks (BNB Chain), and countless decentralized casinos and betting platforms are built on it. BNB is often used for fast, low-fee wagers and in-house rewards on Web3 gambling platforms. Its compatibility with BEP-20 stablecoins also adds to its versatility, making it a favorite among cost-conscious bettors. Bonus: Dexsport – A True Home for Multi-Chain Bettors Looking to use these coins on a platform built for decentralized betting? Dexsport offers one of the best Web3 sportsbooks and casinos in 2025.

2025-07-03T17:45:00,"Dow Jones gains 344 points while S&P 500, Nasdaq hit new highs on strong jobs data","A strong labor market means that Fed rate cuts are less likely, but economic optimism still swept Wall Street. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts might come later than expected, but Wall Street is still optimistic. On Thursday, June 3, the Dow Jones closed higher by 344 points, or 0.77%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83% in a a shortened session ahead of Friday’s market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.02%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reached record levels, as investor optimism boosted the market. NVIDIA was one of the stronger performers, rising 1.3% and reaching its all-time high. The rally put NVIDIA close to replacing Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The stock achieved a significant rally after a strong Q1 earnings report, showing that the chipmaker was not as affected by U.S. sanctions on China as many traders expected. You might also like: Retail traders dumped $258m in Nvidia stock: Will they buy Bitcoin instead? Strong labor market boosts the economy Traders were focusing on the June jobs report, which showed that the labor market remained more resilient than expected. The data revealed a 147,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, beating the forecast of 106,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, even as economists expected it to rise to 4.3%. A strong labor market has shown that the anticipated tariff-related damage to the economy has not materialized. Despite the potential disruptive effects of U.S. punitive tariffs on its trading partners, employers mostly stayed the course. Notably, businesses managed to avoid layoffs, hoping that the tariffs would be temporary. High employment likely means that the Federal Reserve won’t be under as much pressure to lower interest rates, even if inflation decreases. This is usually bad news for growth stocks, which tend to thrive in a low-interest rate environment. Still, the prospect of a robust economy and stronger-than-expected economic growth was enough to boost sentiment.

2025-07-03T17:43:52,"Are Stablecoins Taking Crypto Mainstream?","For years, cryptocurrencies have been circling the fringes of global finance. Yes, they’re fast and decentralised, but their inherent volatility has kept them just outside the mainstream. These days, though, something is changing. You’ve probably noticed it yourself. Crypto is no longer a niche financial sector populated by traders and maximalists; it’s cropping up in day-to-day payments, entertainment, business infrastructure and more. So why is this change occurring? One word: stablecoins. Far from being flashy tokens that ride the bear and bull markets, these coins do exactly what they say they do. Namely, their value doesn’t budge. Stablecoins Explained (And Why They Matter) So, what are stablecoins? Put simply, they’re digital currencies pegged to a “stable” real-world asset, usually fiat currencies like the US dollar. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI) are among the most widely used . While Bitcoin and Ethereum can rise or fall by 10% in an afternoon, stablecoins are engineered to hold their value steady. This stability comes from collateralization. A stablecoin is either backed by cash, short-term government debt, or crypto overcollateralization. You can think of them as the monetary equivalent of a ballast, used to anchor a ship that might otherwise capsize on rough seas. Why has this had such a transformative effect? Because stability is exactly what’s required to push crypto from speculative asset to everyday utility. Supporting Digital Entertainment In the UK, digital payments are already second nature. Contactless cards, Apple Pay, bank-to-bank transfers via Faster Payments — most consumers expect speed and ease. But crypto? It’s still a bit clunky. Convert to fiat, send to your bank, pay the fees, wait. This is where stablecoins are slotting in. They behave like cash in your crypto wallet, without the volatility or the need to off-ramp into sterling before spending. This shift is already visible in several digital-first sectors, with online casino gaming serving as a prime example. Traditionally, digital casinos were playable only with bankwire or bank card options, which meant gamers would have to wait up to five working days before seeing their winnings hit their accounts. Then, forward-thinking brands expanded their accepted payments to include digital wallets and pre-payment cards. Wildz Casino , for instance, offers fiat options like VISA, Skrill Neteller and several location-specific methods to properly cater to its users. In the years since, crypto casinos and gambling platforms have emerged, but until stablecoins came along, they lacked a degree of legitimacy — irrespective of the gaming authority awarding their operational licenses. Stablecoins provide a happy medium: allowing players to deposit in digital currency without being exposed to price swings. A user can deposit £100 worth of USDC and tomorrow it will still be worth £100. That’s the kind of dependability that operators and regulators alike can get behind. It simplifies accounting, aids legislative checks and removes the ambiguity that surrounds crypto price volatility. Revolutionising Payroll and Cross-Border Payments Stablecoins aren’t just turning up in gaming wallets. They’re quietly transforming another cornerstone of financial life: wages. Freelancers, remote workers and gig economy contractors in the UK and beyond are increasingly being paid in stablecoins. Why? Because it’s quicker, cheaper and often more reliable than conventional banking, especially for cross-border jobs. Companies like Bitwage, Noah and Circle allow businesses to pay staff in USDC or other stablecoins, bypassing the delays and fees associated with international bank transfers. Circle has already bridged transactions worth over $850 billion (around £627 billion) between fiat currencies and supported blockchains since 2018. For British freelancers dealing with clients abroad, these innovations can be transformative. No waiting three to five working days. No intermediary banks taking a slice. Just digital, dollar-pegged money, directly in your wallet — and ready to convert to pounds when needed. What This Means for Crypto Enthusiasts If you’ve been in the crypto space for a while, you’ll be familiar with the discourse: are stablecoins just fiat currencies dressed up in a digital asset costume? The truth is, stablecoins aren’t presenting as a replacement for fully decentralised assets like BTC or ETH. Rather, they offer a workable compromise, a way for crypto to function in the real world, without need to sacrifice its core mechanics. For UK investors and enthusiasts , there’s real opportunity here — you can swap, save, send or spend digital assets with stability.

2025-07-03T17:36:10,"Ripple price analysis: XRP eyes $2.42 if volume confirms breakout","Ripple continues to show technical strength, holding above key moving averages and support levels. A move above $2.42 could complete a market rotation, if volume confirms the upside push. Ripple ( XRP ) has maintained notable strength in recent price action, even as broader market conditions remain uncertain. The coin is currently trading above major support and has been respecting the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of trend continuation. The presence of confluence with high-value support zones suggests the asset may be poised for another leg upward, provided volume confirms the move. Key technical points Major Support at $2.09: I n confluence with the 200-day moving average and the value area low. Next Resistance at $2.42: Point of Control level acting as resistance within the current volume range. Low Volume Environment: Suggests accumulation phase; breakout requires increased volume for confirmation. XRPUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP has recently respected the $2.09 support level, a region of significance due to its alignment with both the value area low and the 200-day moving average. Holding above this level signals continued bullish structure, especially as price trends upward. Historically, the 200 MA serves as reliable dynamic support, and as long as XRP stays above it, the probability of further upside remains strong. The next logical price target lies at the $2.42 region, which marks the Point of Control within the current high time frame volume profile. A successful move toward this level would represent a full volume profile rotation, consistent with market auction theory. This theory suggests that once price bounces from the value area low and gains strength, a move toward the value area high and POC is likely, provided there’s volume expansion to support it. You might also like: Stablecoins supply crossed $250b on investor optimism: Binance report One key factor to monitor is the current lack of trading volume. While this may seem bearish at first glance, it more likely signals a phase of quiet accumulation at support. A strong rally will need to be supported by a notable influx of volume to confirm bullish conviction and signal the transition from accumulation to expansion. Until the 200-day MA or the $2.09 support is breached, the bullish structure remains intact. Traders should continue to monitor the strength of the trend and be alert for any surge in volume that could initiate the next move higher.

The mining company relies on its growing hashrate to boost its reserves. Mara Holdings (MARA) announced the milestone of building up its treasury to 50,000 BTC. Unlike other treasury companies, Mara Holdings combines a growing mining operation with occasional purchases. The company announced it plans to double down on expanding its mining operations, reaching 75 EH/s by the year end. 50,000 BTC now in MARA’s treasury. Fueled by 57+ EH/s of computational power, reinforcing new foundations for our nation’s digital economy and energy infrastructure. This is MARA for America in action. Next target: 75 EH/s by year-end. pic.twitter.com/CxJZs08tLW — MARA (@MARA) July 3, 2025 Mara Holdings started out at 27,000 BTC in the last quarter of 2024, taking up a series of deliberate purchases. After that, the company continued to accrue coins more slowly through its native mining operations. Currently, Mara Holdings has an unknown BTC acquisition price, but its costs may be lower compared to the newer wave of treasury companies. The company has also announced a $2B plan to buy more BTC, though the shares would be sold at intervals on the discretion of Mara Holdings. So far, the mining company has not shown any significant moves to acquire BTC more rapidly, instead focusing on mining operations. Mara Holdings grew its treasury in the past 12 months In the past 12 months, Mara Holdings nearly tripled its treasury, though it did not have a clear plan for copying Strategy (MSTR). The Mara.com pool currently produces around 7% of all blocks, with around 45 EH/s in active mining power. Mara Holdings expanded its treasury after a mining record in May, followed by a strong performance in June. | Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Based on its known wallets, Mara Holdings also mines as part of the Foundry pool, further putting its hashrate to work. Mara Holdings added 761 BTC to its wallets in June, following an inflow of 950 BTC in May, with none of the new coins sold. May was an absolute monthly record, followed by a slowdown in June, mostly due to weather conditions, stated Mara Holdings in its recent half-year report . The Bitcoin mining rate remains high, at over 1,000 EH/s for the entire network, despite the recent slowdown due to a heatwave. Mara Holdings has outpaced all other miners in its readiness to hold onto the newly produced BTC. Miner reserves remain at 1.89M coins, though not all are dedicated to treasuries. Other mining companies like Riot Platforms and CleanSpark have retained significant reserves, though they do not explicitly mention a treasury plan. Even before the announcement, MARA shares expanded by over 15% in the past week, trading at $16.78. MARA is at a one-month peak following a record month for BTC treasury companies. The past month marked another high tide for treasury companies. Over 68K BTC was taken off the market, ranging from large-scale purchases by Strategy to deals for under 10 BTC from virtually unknown businesses. In total, corporate buyers made 250 announcements, coming from companies in healthcare or even coffee sales. A total of 21 new treasuries were announced, buying around 6,745 BTC.

The company's shares more than doubled on Thursday topping $140, now rallying over 3,000% in less than a week since the firm announced the raising of $250 million by selling shares to acquire ETH. The private placement offering, priced at $4.50 per share and due to close today, attracted institutional investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG. At its core, Bitmine is positioning itself as a publicly traded proxy for ether exposure, similar to how Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) became a leveraged bitcoin bet. The approach has gained traction recently as investors look for new ways to access crypto through public equities. The firm originally focused on crypto mining using immersion cooling and held $16 million in bitcoin prior to the fundraising. Sharplink déjà vu But a similar crypto treasury stock's rapid rise and fall may offer a cautionary tale. The parabolic rise in BMNR mirrors the trading behavior of Sharplink Gaming (SBET), another public company that repositioned itself as an ETH treasury firm last month under the leadership of Consensys co-founder Joseph Lubin. Sharplink soared as much as 4,000% in days following its $450 million fundraising announcement. Shares since plunged over 90% from peak as the firm closed its ETH acquisition and early investors in the private placement sold stock locking in their profits. Bitmine’s valuation, with a market capitalization over $800 million at current prices, already prices in aggressive assumptions about the firm's future ETH gains. Retail investors chasing the momentum should tread carefully.

2025-07-03T17:03:03,"IMF blocks Pakistan’s plans to subsidise power for Bitcoin mining","Pakistan is facing backlash from the International Monetary Fund regarding its plan to channel surplus electricity into its cryptocurrency mining operations. Local media reports claim that Pakistan’s Secretary of Power, Fakhre Alam Irfan, has informed the Senate Standing Committee on Energy that the IMF has rejected the country’s proposal to offer subsidised electricity to energy-intensive industries, including Bitcoin mining. The Power Division’s plan, first floated in November 2024, proposed a marginal-cost tariff of 22–23 Pakistani rupees per kilowatt-hour for industries such as copper smelting, data centres, and crypto mining. Officials argued that this would help absorb surplus capacity, generate revenue, and ultimately draw in private investment across high-demand sectors. However, according to Irfan, the IMF opposed the measure on the grounds that it could destabilise the power market. IMF officials are concerned that such targeted incentives could worsen structural inefficiencies in the country’s fragile energy sector. While the plan has not been formally withdrawn, Irfan confirmed that it remains under review by the World Bank and other international partners. According to Irfan, any major changes in the energy policy would require clearance from the IMF, in line with Pakistan’s current financing programme. As part of a national push toward digital transformation, Pakistan designated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in May for Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure. Officials viewed this as a way to monetise stranded generation capacity during off-peak seasons while positioning the country as a competitive player in the digital economy. This wasn’t the country’s first attempt to restructure its electricity pricing to support crypto-related industries. In September 2024, officials proposed offering a six-month marginal-cost tariff for high-consumption sectors, like mining and data centres. However, the IMF only allowed a three-month arrangement, citing similar objections. The IMF’s concerns centre around potential market stabilisation, especially if subsidies are used to artificially stimulate demand in selective sectors. The Fund maintains that such policies could undercut broader structural reforms and compromise energy pricing discipline. Pakistan’s ambitions to become a crypto hub Pakistan has doubled down on its long-term crypto ambitions as it plans to position digital assets at the centre of its economic modernisation strategy. Officials believe that integrating blockchain technologies can help drive job creation, attract global capital, and improve financial transparency across public systems. Key initiatives the country is currently exploring include plans to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and build regulatory infrastructure to support the growth of decentralised finance and tokenisation platforms. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, State Minister on Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib announced the creation of a national Bitcoin wallet to hold sovereign reserves, which would be expanded through yield-generating strategies using decentralised finance protocols. To guide its national crypto strategy, Pakistan has tapped leading global figures for support and insight. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao has taken on an advisory role focused on blockchain infrastructure, while Strategy’s Michael Saylor has been consulted on the design and long-term structure of Pakistan’s sovereign Bitcoin reserve.

2025-07-03T17:01:26,"Solaxy Price Explodes 150% Following LBANK, MEXC Listing - Best New Meme Coin To Buy?","Solana meme coins are starting to print big green candles once again, perhaps front-running the imminent approval and launch of spot SOL ETFs. Besides large-caps like Bonk, Fartcoin and SPX6900, newer meme coins are also in the spotlight. For instance, the viral new token, Solaxy (SOLX) , has surged by nearly 150% since the start of this week. SOLX rose to fame as the first prominent Solana Layer-2 coin, raising nearly $60 million in its presale. Now, multiple CEX listings and the rollout of the Solaxy ecosystem have sent its price soaring. With the broader market outlook improving rapidly, SOLX now looks poised to fulfil analysts' projections of it being the next 10x crypto. Solaxy Price Is Soaring - How High Can It Go? Solaxy is among the Solana meme coins that are benefiting from the broader crypto market rally. The Bitcoin price has surged past $110k, while Ethereum and Solana have cleared key resistance levels as well. As the bull market euphoria returns, new low-cap meme coins will be in the spotlight once again. So far in this bull cycle, small-cap gems have delivered outsized returns when the market outlook improves, turning several small-scale retailers into millionaires. Solaxy also appears to be on the cusp of an explosive rally. On June 30th, the SOLX price market hit its macro bottom after claims went live for staked tokens. Since then, it has surged by more than 150%, currently trading at $0.00137. Elliot Wave analysis reveals that the corrective A-B-C move is over, and a new 5-wave upside move is now underway, which could result in a new all-time high. Notably, the SOLX price has flipped the key $0.00112 S/R level and has continued to hold above it despite several retests. Besides the broader crypto market rally, Solaxy is also benefiting from its new CEX listings. It debuted on MEXC on Wednesday and went live on LBANK today. Solaxy’s Layer-2 ecosystem rollout is adding to the bullish momentum. The mainnet is already live, and its highly anticipated meme coin launchpad is scheduled to go live on July 21, followed closely by the debut of its native DEX, Neptoon. Notably, many experts had previously called SOLX the next 10x crypto. It now appears possible that the meme coin reaches $0.0044 in the coming weeks, which would be a 10x rally from its June 30th low. Best New Meme Coin To Buy Besides SOLX With a new crypto market rally underway, new meme coins are back in the spotlight. Particularly, the new Bitcoin-themed meme coin, BTC Bull (BTCBULL) , couldn’t have picked a better launch date. BTCBULL is set to go live on exchanges on July 7th, right in the middle of a bull market. Its presale has already raised nearly $8 million, a sign of high upside potential and strong community support. $BTCBULL claim goes live 7th July, 2PM UTC. 🐂💥Don’t miss the charge. ⚔️ https://t.co/N1kqrY0bow pic.twitter.com/2mxOI6Qwsw — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 30, 2025 Bitcoin-themed meme coins are rare, which is one of the key reasons behind BTC Bull’s early success. The other is the strong demand for free Bitcoin. BTCBULL holders will receive free BTC airdrops, benefits from token burn events and a massive BTCBULL airdrop when the Bitcoin price hits certain set milestones. BTC Bull has tied itself to Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory, establishing itself as a way to bet that BTC will continue its forward march. Unsurprisingly, smart money investors are taking the bet. BTCBULL has already established itself as the best new meme coin to invest in. In fact, many prominent experts are calling it the next 100x crypto, especially considering it is a viable long-term investment.

2025-07-03T17:00:41,"Dogecoin’s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst—Here’s The Target","Dogecoin was changing hands near $0.174 in European trading on Thursday, extending a two-day rebound that began when buyers twice defended the mid-June floor around $0.16. The 11% recovery since the Tuesday low has put the largest memecoin back on traders’ radars, but technical analyst More Crypto Online cautions that what looks like an impulsive burst is in fact “all corrective in nature,” with the market still trapped inside a complex diagonal wave pattern that could just as easily fail. Dogecoin Is Quietly Coiling For A Potential Breakout In a video update recorded on 2 June, the analyst dissected the one-hour chart and concluded that the advance from the 22 June low is best counted as a three-wave move. “Because wave 1 … was only a three-wave move, the third wave should unfold as an ABC structure,” he said, underscoring that the rally lacks the five-wave DNA of a trend reversal. Even so, as long as Dogecoin defends what he called a “micro-support area between $0.16 and $0.166,” the diagonal remains valid and a measured target at $0.196—the 138 percent Fibonacci extension of wave 1—“remains plausible.” The roadmap is conditional. First, the current A-wave has to finish; then a corrective B-wave should follow, “and in the C-wave we could then rally to round about $0.196.” A probe toward $0.182 before that pullback cannot be ruled out, but the analyst warned viewers not to assume a straight shot higher. “Please be aware that we could be dealing with very choppy and messy structures,” he said. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 ‘Is Free,’ Says Analyst—Predicts 2,000% Upside If bulls do force a full five-wave climb from the July swing low, that sequence would mark the first leg of a larger five-wave advance—a textbook signal that the broader down-trend from Dogecoin’s March peak may finally be exhausted. Failure to hold $0.16, however, would invalidate the diagonal count and expose the June lows near $0.151, where on-chain data show a thin layer of spot bids and little derivative support. Market context is mixed. CoinGecko data show Dogecoin’s 24-hour turnover has topped $1.5 billion, roughly in line with last week’s average, while the memecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin has weakened to 0.62, its lowest reading since early May. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit In the short term, though, all eyes are on the $0.16 band. As More Crypto Online summed up, “The diagonal pattern basically remains plausible as long as we’re holding that $0.16 level.” Should that floor survive the inevitable B-wave turbulence, Dogecoin’s “quiet setup” might indeed detonate shortly—propelling the token toward $0.196 and potentially signalling a more durable trend change. Notably, the upper boundary of Dogecoin’s long-running descending channel in the daily chart, now situated near $0.20, lines up almost exactly with More Crypto Online’s bullish target. A decisive breakout through this confluence would not only pierce the ceiling that has capped prices since the December 8 high at $0.4843 but could also validate the analyst’s call for a trend reversal. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.174.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s proposal to provide subsidized electricity tariffs for cryptocurrency mining operations, citing concerns that such a move would create economic imbalances and distort the nation’s fragile energy market.

In a new statement, the CMS says that an investigation discovered fraudulent Medicare.gov accounts were opened using personal data from its system, impacting 103,000 people. “On May 2, CMS’ 1-800-MEDICARE call center began receiving inquiries from beneficiaries who received letters confirming the creation of Medicare.gov accounts they did not initiate. CMS promptly launched an investigation and discovered that malicious actors had fraudulently created new accounts between 2023 and 2025 using valid beneficiary information, including Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers (MBI), coverage start date, last name, date of birth and zip code.” The fraudsters may have stolen other personal information as well, including provider information, mailing address, dates of service, diagnosis codes, services received and plan premium details. CMS is sending letters to those whose information was stolen, alerting them that it will send them a new Medicare card with a new Medicare number in the coming weeks. The federal agency says it has also deactivated all fraudulently created Medicare.gov accounts and disabled the ability to create new Medicare.gov accounts from foreign IP addresses. Victims are advised to obtain free annual credit reports through www.annualcreditreport.com and to file reports with local law enforcement and the Federal Trade Commission if any identity theft incidents occur.

Senator Cynthia Lummis is leading the charge to fix what she calls “unfair” and “outdated” tax rules that are hurting innovation and everyday users. So, what’s inside this bill? No More Taxes on Small Crypto Payments One of the biggest highlights of Senator Lummis’s bill is a special $300 rule. Under this, small crypto transactions like buying lunch or coffee won’t trigger tax reports. That means people can use digital assets like real money without worrying about tax trouble. There’s a limit, though: the total tax-free gains per year must stay under $5,000. Starting in 2026, the $300 amount will also adjust for inflation. This rule could finally make crypto spending as easy as using a debit card. The tax code shouldn't punish Americans for using new technology. My bill fixes the broken rules around bitcoin and digital assets. MORE https://t.co/1Wo6zjY8wY — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) July 3, 2025 Fairer Rules for Miners and Stakers The bill also wants to help crypto miners and stakers, people who help run blockchains and earn tokens in return. Right now, miners and stakers often have to pay taxes the moment they receive tokens, even if they don’t sell them. Meanwhile, with this new bill, taxes will only be due when the coins are sold or used. This helps avoid double taxes and makes it easier for people and companies to plan without worrying about sudden tax bills. Making Crypto Lending and Giving Easier The bill also supports crypto lending. It extends the same tax rules used for stock lending to digital assets. So, lending your crypto temporarily won’t count as a sale and won’t trigger taxes. And if someone wants to donate crypto to charity, the process becomes easier, too. They won’t need a costly appraisal for commonly traded assets, which could encourage more people to give. Boosting Innovation, Not Burdening It Lummis says this plan could bring in about $600 million in tax revenue over the next ten years. But more importantly, she argues it will protect innovation in America. She wants people and businesses to build the future here, not overseas, because the tax code makes it easy to participate safely. Even though she couldn’t attach the bill to Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Lummis believes this crypto proposal can still pass.

As per the MoU, Tether, in partnership with Adecoagro, plans to mine Bitcoin using the Brazil-based renewable power provider’s surplus energy. Tether @Tether_to · Follow Tether and Adecoagro To Power Bitcoin Mining With Renewable Energy In BrazilLearn more: tether.io/news/tether-an… 6:35 pm · 3 Jul 2025 97 Reply Copy link Read 8 replies “In addition to monetizing surplus energy, Adecoagro recognizes that Bitcoin may become a new source of long-term value, like its farmland assets, and plans to use this mining project to initiate certain strategic exposure to Bitcoin in its balance sheet,” Adecoagro said Thursday in a statement. Tether’s plans with Adecoagro In May, Tether acquired a 70% stake in Adecoagro, marking the stablecoin issuer’s latest push into real-world assets and infrastructure. Adecoagro, which operates across South America, produces over 230 megawatts of power from renewable sources. “This project opens the door to stabilizing a portion of the energy we currently sell on the spot market, locking in pricing, while also gaining exposure to the upside potential of bitcoin,” said CEO Mariano Bosch. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has in recent months stepped up deployment of its profits across a broad set of industries, including artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and bitcoin mining. The move follows the appointment of Paolo Ardoino as CEO in 2023, under whom the company has pursued more aggressive investment in infrastructure tied to the broader crypto ecosystem. “The design and operation of the project benefits from significant synergies between Adecoagro’s energy and industrial expertise and Tether’s capabilities in the digital asset space,” the company added in the press release. Tether’s Bitcoin mining plans The collaboration is part of Tether’s broader push to expand its portfolio of sustainable, infrastructure-backed investments. “We’re proud to collaborate with Adecoagro. This project is another step in our growing commitment to renewable-powered bitcoin mining,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. He added that Tether is focused on building robust energy infrastructure and supporting decentralised networks, both of which align with Adecoagro’s existing capabilities in renewable energy. The new facility will run on Tether Mining OS, the company’s operating system for managing mining operations. Tether plans to open-source the software in the coming months. “The project will be operated using Tether’s Mining OS for site management, which will be open-sourced in the coming months,” as per the press release. Tether’s experience in the digital asset sector and growing mining footprint are expected to play a key role in making the partnership operationally efficient and aligned with long-term sustainability goals.

2025-07-03T16:43:25,"BONK Leads Memecoin Amid Crypto Rally While the Token Approaches 1M Holder Milestone","As bitcoin (BTC) hovers near a fresh all-time high, the Solana-based memecoin, BONK (BONK), is leading the major altcoin rally. The surge coincides with renewed optimism in risk assets following bitcoin's recovery above $110,000, which has triggered widespread gains across established cryptocurrencies. BONK's momentum appears sustainable as numerous crypto analysts express bullish sentiment, citing significant upside potential remaining. Adding to BONK's bullish case, the BONK foundation's token launchpad, LetsBONK.fun, recently surpassed competitor Pump.fun in daily volume with a 126% increase. This development benefits BONK holders as 50% of the platform's revenue is allocated to buying and burning BONK tokens, creating additional positive price pressure in a market already anticipating the upcoming 1 trillion token burn when the project reaches 1 million holders. Meanwhile, Tuttle Capital Management confirmed July 16 as the earliest possible launch date for its suite of leveraged crypto ETFs, including a 2× BONK ETF, fueling bullish sentiment. Technical analysis highlights The BONK-USD pair experienced increased buying pressure during the last 24 hours, from July 2, 16:00 UTC, to July 3, 15:00 UTC. It surged from $0.0000147 to a peak of $0.0000175, representing a 10.4% range, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. A significant volume spike to 2.9 trillion at midnight on July 3 established strong support at the $0.0000157 level, while high-volume buying at the $0.0000168 level during the 05:00 UTC hour propelled prices higher despite late session profit-taking, the model showed. However, during the last 60 minutes from July 3 at 14:50 to 15:49 UTC, BONK-USD experienced significant volatility, dropping from $0.00001666 to a low of $0.00001619 before recovering to $0.00001624. A notable volume spike of 86.9 trillion at 15:35 coincided with the price bottoming at $0.00001619, establishing a key support level. The subsequent recovery formed an ascending trendline with increasing volumes, particularly at 15:49, where 22.5 trillion in volume pushed prices up by 2.7% from the session low, according to the model.

2025-07-03T16:40:50,"Bitcoin’s Crucial Edge: Arthur Hayes Unveils Urgent Warnings on U.S. Bonds and Stablecoin Shifts","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Crucial Edge: Arthur Hayes Unveils Urgent Warnings on U.S. Bonds and Stablecoin Shifts In the ever-evolving world of finance, where traditional wisdom often clashes with innovative insights, one voice consistently cuts through the noise: Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the pioneering cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. Known for his provocative yet prescient analyses, Hayes recently dropped a bombshell that has investors and market watchers buzzing. His core message? It’s time to rethink your portfolio, particularly your exposure to U.S. bonds . This isn’t just another market prediction; it’s a fundamental re-evaluation of where true value and liquidity reside in the global financial system, with significant implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Arthur Hayes’ Bold Stance: Why Shun U.S. Bonds for Bitcoin? For decades, U.S. government bonds have been the bedrock of conservative investment portfolios. They are widely lauded by financial advisors as a safe haven, a low-risk asset offering stability and predictable returns. Yet, Arthur Hayes argues that this conventional wisdom is now fundamentally flawed. In his latest Substack post, Hayes unequivocally states that buying U.S. government bonds today is a mistake, an investment choice that will likely leave you lagging in the long run. Why such a stark warning against what many consider the safest asset class? Hayes’ perspective is rooted in a deep understanding of macroeconomic forces and the changing nature of money. He contends that the perceived safety of bonds is illusory in an environment where inflation can erode purchasing power and where other asset classes offer vastly superior growth potential. Instead, he advocates for a strategic pivot towards more dynamic assets. Opportunity Cost: By tying up capital in low-yield bonds, investors miss out on significant upside potential elsewhere. Inflationary Pressures: While bonds offer fixed returns, the real value of those returns diminishes with persistent inflation, effectively making them a losing proposition over time. Shifting Market Dynamics: The global financial landscape is undergoing a monumental transformation, where traditional risk-reward profiles are being redefined. Hayes points specifically to Bitcoin (BTC) and the Nasdaq as far more attractive alternatives. These assets, he argues, possess the inherent characteristics necessary to not only preserve but significantly grow wealth in the current economic climate. The agility, innovation, and disruptive potential embedded within these markets offer a stark contrast to the static nature of government debt. Decoding Stablecoin Liquidity : A New Financial Weapon? Beyond his warnings on bonds, Arthur Hayes delves into the intriguing, and somewhat unsettling, role of stablecoins in the modern financial ecosystem. While many view stablecoins like USDC or USDT primarily as tools for fast, borderless payments or efficient cryptocurrency trading, Hayes presents a far more strategic and less altruistic narrative. He posits that the U.S. government’s growing support for stablecoins isn’t driven by a desire to foster fintech innovation or empower companies like Circle. Instead, Hayes asserts that stablecoins are being weaponized. Their true purpose, in his view, is to empower large traditional banks , providing them with an unprecedented mechanism to manage and deploy liquidity. This perspective challenges the popular narrative, suggesting a deeper, more calculated agenda at play. His core argument revolves around the concept of a ‘liquidity weapon.’ Stablecoins, backed by U.S. dollars and typically held in bank accounts or short-term U.S. Treasuries, essentially act as a conduit. They allow major financial institutions to purchase massive amounts of government debt without needing the Federal Reserve (Fed) to engage in quantitative easing (QE). In essence, stablecoins provide a bypass, enabling a continuous flow of capital into government coffers, independent of the Fed’s direct market interventions. This mechanism creates a self-sustaining loop where the demand for U.S. debt can be met through alternative channels, maintaining market stability and funding government expenditure even when the Fed is not actively buying bonds. This subtle yet powerful shift in liquidity management is what Hayes believes is the true story behind the institutional embrace of stablecoins. The Role of Traditional Banks in the Stablecoin Narrative If stablecoins are indeed a ‘liquidity weapon,’ then traditional banks are the primary beneficiaries and orchestrators of this new financial strategy. Hayes emphasizes that the narrative around stablecoins is often misdirected, focusing too much on the fintech companies that issue them and not enough on the powerful entities pulling the strings behind the scenes. These large banks, with their deep ties to government and their immense financial infrastructure, are uniquely positioned to leverage stablecoins for their strategic advantage. Consider the implications: when stablecoins are minted, their reserves are typically held in commercial banks. These reserves, in turn, can be invested in short-term U.S. government debt. This creates a direct, efficient, and discreet channel for banks to facilitate the purchase of government obligations. This process effectively allows for a form of ‘shadow QE’ where liquidity is injected into the bond market without the overt, public operations of the Federal Reserve. Hayes’ analysis suggests that the market is already awash in liquidity, even if the Fed hasn’t officially restarted quantitative easing. This liquidity isn’t necessarily flowing from traditional central bank operations but is rather being channeled through the burgeoning stablecoin ecosystem, primarily managed and controlled by major banks. This means that while the public narrative might focus on inflation and interest rate hikes, the underlying plumbing of the financial system is adapting in ways that ensure continued demand for government debt. Therefore, Hayes advises investors to shift their focus. Instead of obsessing over the innovations of Circle or other fintechs in the stablecoin space, he urges a closer look at the U.S. government and the major banks. These are, in his view, the true architects and drivers of the stablecoin narrative, shaping its utility to serve their own financial and geopolitical objectives. Why Bitcoin Remains a Top Investment Choice Amidst Shifting Tides In light of these revelations about U.S. bonds and stablecoin mechanics, Arthur Hayes consistently circles back to Bitcoin as a premier investment. His advocacy for BTC is not merely speculative; it’s deeply rooted in its fundamental properties as a decentralized, scarce, and censorship-resistant asset. In a world where traditional financial instruments are increasingly subject to manipulation or lose their real value due to inflation and strategic government actions, Bitcoin stands out as a robust alternative. Bitcoin’s value proposition is amplified when viewed through the lens of Hayes’ warnings. If U.S. bonds are a trap and stablecoins are a tool for centralizing financial power within traditional institutions, then Bitcoin offers a genuine escape route. It represents a hedge against inflation, a store of value independent of government control, and a potential for significant appreciation driven by its fixed supply and growing adoption. The benefits of investing in Bitcoin, as highlighted by Hayes, include: Superior Upside Potential: Compared to the meager returns of bonds, Bitcoin offers parabolic growth potential driven by network effects and increasing institutional interest. Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies or stablecoins, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single entity, making it resilient to political or economic manipulation. Scarcity: With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity provides a natural defense against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin offers a permissionless financial system accessible to anyone with an internet connection, fostering true financial inclusion. Hayes’ consistent recommendation for Bitcoin alongside the Nasdaq reflects a broader trend of smart money flowing into innovative, high-growth sectors that are poised to outperform traditional, yield-suppressed assets. It’s a call to action for investors to adapt to the new realities of global finance, where digital assets are no longer fringe but central to future wealth creation. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights from Arthur Hayes Arthur Hayes’ recent insights offer a critical roadmap for investors seeking to navigate the complex currents of the global economy. His warnings against U.S. bonds and his unique perspective on stablecoin liquidity are not just academic theories; they are actionable intelligence for anyone looking to protect and grow their wealth. The key takeaways from his analysis are clear: Re-evaluate Traditional Advice: Don’t blindly follow conventional investment wisdom, especially concerning low-yield assets like U.S. bonds. Embrace Disruptive Assets: Allocate capital to high-growth, innovative assets like Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, which offer substantial upside potential. Understand the True Stablecoin Narrative: Look beyond the surface-level benefits of stablecoins and recognize their strategic role in empowering traditional banks and facilitating government debt management. Focus on the Big Players: Pay closer attention to the actions and strategies of governments and major banks, as they are the true architects of financial policy and liquidity. In a financial landscape increasingly shaped by digital innovation and shifting power dynamics, Hayes’ insights serve as a powerful reminder that vigilance and adaptability are paramount. The financial world is not static; it’s a dynamic arena where understanding the underlying mechanics and the true motivations of key players can make all the difference. By heeding these warnings and adjusting investment strategies accordingly, individuals can position themselves to thrive in the emerging financial paradigm. Arthur Hayes’ latest pronouncements serve as a powerful wake-up call, urging investors to challenge long-held beliefs and embrace a more forward-thinking approach to wealth management. His insights into the pitfalls of U.S. bonds and the strategic deployment of stablecoin liquidity by traditional banks underscore a fundamental shift in the global financial architecture. For those brave enough to look beyond conventional wisdom, the path forward is clear: diversify into resilient, high-growth assets like Bitcoin, and remain acutely aware of the hidden currents driving market liquidity. The future of finance is here, and it demands a new kind of investment strategy.

2025-07-03T16:40:31,"Bitcoin’s Ascendant Trend: CryptoQuant Analysis Points to a Powerful BTC Price Outlook","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Ascendant Trend: CryptoQuant Analysis Points to a Powerful BTC Price Outlook The cryptocurrency market is an ever-evolving landscape, often leaving investors searching for clarity amidst the volatility. However, recent insights from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant offer a compelling narrative, suggesting a significant shift in the Bitcoin trend that could redefine expectations for the coming months. If you’ve been wondering about Bitcoin’s next move, the signals are increasingly pointing towards sustained upward momentum. Unpacking the Latest CryptoQuant Analysis: What’s Driving the Bitcoin Trend? According to CryptoQuant’s astute on-chain analyst, Crypto Dan, Bitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing a profound directional shift since April, moving decidedly towards an upward trajectory. This isn’t just speculative sentiment; it’s rooted in meticulous data analysis, particularly concerning the behavior of major market participants. The core of this optimistic assessment lies in the observed actions of U.S. whales and institutions. CryptoQuant, known for its in-depth on-chain data and proprietary metrics, provides a unique lens through which to view market dynamics. Unlike traditional market analysis that relies solely on price charts, on-chain analysis delves into the blockchain itself, tracking the movement of coins, wallet activities, and transaction volumes. This allows for a more fundamental understanding of supply and demand forces at play. The Diminishing Influence of Bitcoin Whales: A Positive Shift One of the most critical observations highlighted by Crypto Dan is the steady decline in selling pressure originating from U.S. Bitcoin whales and large institutional entities. For a long time, the potential for massive sell-offs by these large holders has been a source of anxiety in the market, often leading to significant price corrections. However, the data now indicates a different story. What does this mean for the market? Essentially, it suggests that these influential players, who hold substantial amounts of BTC, are either choosing to hold onto their assets or are no longer liquidating them at previous rates. This reduction in sell-side pressure removes a major hurdle for price appreciation. When fewer large holders are offloading their Bitcoin, the existing demand has a more pronounced effect on price. Consider the implications: Reduced Supply Overhang: Less BTC being sold by large entities means a tighter supply available on exchanges. Maturity of Holdings: It could indicate that many of these whales have matured in their investment strategies, shifting from short-term trading to long-term holding. Increased Market Stability: Fewer large sell-offs contribute to a more stable market environment, reducing sudden, sharp price drops. Strong Buying Activity: Fueling the Upward Momentum While the reduction in selling pressure is significant, it’s only half the story. Crypto Dan’s CryptoQuant analysis also points to robust and sustained buying activity from these very same U.S. whales and institutions. This dual dynamic – less selling combined with strong buying – paints a powerful bullish picture for Bitcoin. Who are these buyers, and why are they accumulating now? While specific identities remain private, the trend suggests a growing conviction among sophisticated investors about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This could be driven by several factors: Spot ETF Inflows: The approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S. has opened a new, regulated avenue for institutional capital to flow into Bitcoin. These ETFs have seen consistent inflows, indicating strong demand from traditional finance. Macroeconomic Hedging: In an environment of global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Post-Halving Dynamics: While the full impact of the recent Bitcoin halving is yet to be realized, institutions may be front-running the anticipated supply shock, accumulating before the reduced new supply fully translates into higher prices. This sustained demand, coupled with dwindling selling pressure, creates a fundamental imbalance that typically leads to price appreciation. It suggests that smart money is actively positioning itself for future gains. Understanding Market Consolidation: A Healthy Phase for the BTC Price Outlook Despite the strong underlying signals, Bitcoin has recently entered what Crypto Dan describes as a market consolidation phase. This might sound concerning to some, but it’s a perfectly normal and often necessary part of a healthy market cycle. After significant upward moves, assets tend to consolidate, allowing the market to ‘catch its breath’ and prevent ‘overheating’. What does consolidation entail? Price Stabilization: Prices tend to trade within a relatively narrow range, neither making significant new highs nor experiencing sharp declines. Volume Reduction: Trading volume often decreases during consolidation as conviction wanes temporarily among short-term traders. Building Support: This phase allows new support levels to be established as weaker hands are shaken out and stronger hands accumulate. Think of it as a pit stop during a long journey. The vehicle (Bitcoin) needs to refuel and check its systems before continuing its upward journey. While a short-term pullback remains a possibility during this phase – as profit-takers exit and short-term traders adjust their positions – it’s generally seen as a cleansing mechanism that strengthens the overall trend rather than negating it. What Does This Mean for the BTC Price Outlook in the Second Half of 2025? Crypto Dan’s long-term perspective remains overwhelmingly positive, particularly for the second half of 2025. This forward-looking stance is critical for investors trying to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. The expectation is that the underlying upward momentum, fueled by the aforementioned factors, will continue to drive Bitcoin’s value higher. Why is H2 2025 a significant period? Post-Halving Effects: Historically, the full bullish impact of a Bitcoin halving event is felt 12-18 months after the event. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, placing the peak of its potential impact squarely in late 2025 or early 2026. Macroeconomic Environment: By 2025, global interest rates may have stabilized or even begun to decline, creating a more favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. Further Institutional Adoption: The continued maturation of the crypto ecosystem, including potential new regulatory frameworks and product offerings, could attract even more institutional capital. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g., Lightning Network, sidechains) could enhance its utility and scalability, further bolstering its appeal. While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, the confluence of on-chain data, institutional behavior, and historical market cycles provides a robust foundation for this optimistic BTC price outlook . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights based on the current market sentiment and analysis: Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable on-chain analysts like those at CryptoQuant. Understanding the underlying fundamentals is key. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re looking to accumulate Bitcoin, a DCA strategy can help mitigate risk by averaging out your purchase price over time, especially during consolidation phases. Focus on the Long-Term: Short-term pullbacks are natural. For those with a bullish long-term conviction, these can be opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose. The crypto market, while promising, remains inherently volatile. Conclusion: A Resilient and Promising Future for Bitcoin The insights from CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan paint a remarkably positive picture for Bitcoin’s trajectory. The diminishing selling pressure from U.S. whales and institutions, coupled with their robust buying activity, signals a fundamental shift towards an upward Bitcoin trend . While the current market consolidation phase is a healthy and necessary cool-down, it is merely a pause before what is anticipated to be a continued ascent, culminating in a strong BTC price outlook for the second half of 2025. For investors, this period offers a valuable opportunity to understand the underlying forces at play and position themselves for potential future growth. Bitcoin’s resilience and growing institutional acceptance underscore its enduring appeal as a digital asset. As the market matures, the insights from on-chain analysis become increasingly vital, offering a deeper understanding of true supply and demand dynamics beyond mere price action. The journey ahead for Bitcoin appears poised for powerful and exciting developments.

2025-07-03T16:39:16,"Bitcoin price outlook: Long-term $120k trendline test could define Q3","Bitcoin is nearing a historically significant resistance level at $120,000. This multi-year trendline has capped price since 2021, making the coming wseeks pivotal for BTC’s long-term direction. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price is inching toward a major high time frame resistance level that has historically dictated market tops and key reversals. This dynamic resistance, in play since April 2021, is once again being tested after two significant rejections over the past few years. With price action now pushing toward the $120,000 zone, the next several weeks could define whether BTC breaks into new all-time highs or retraces back into its established macro range. Key technical points $120,000 Dynamic Resistance: Multi-year descending trendline from April 2021, respected in both 2021 and 2024. $73,000 High Time Frame Support: Range low support acting as the major pivot zone in the event of a rejection. Historical Behavior: Each retest of this resistance has led to major long-term consolidations or corrections. BTCUSDT (12D) Chart, Source: TradingView The dynamic resistance currently hovering around the $120,000 mark has historical significance. It was first established in April 2021, when Bitcoin topped out during the previous bull market. The second major interaction occurred in December 2024, where BTC again tested this level and failed to break through, forming a precise rejection wick at the trendline. These repeated interactions affirm the strength and technical relevance of this resistance. Now, in mid to late 2025, Bitcoin is once again grinding toward this region. While this approach hasn’t yet triggered a breakout, the fact that price has maintained a bullish structure while approaching it suggests potential for a high-stakes breakout, or yet another rejection that could reintroduce range-bound trading. You might also like: Whales who made millions on Solana eye this $0.003333 memecoin that could jump 9000% From a long-term trading perspective, this resistance should be seen as a make-or-break inflection point. If BTC is able to decisively break through and close above the $120,000 level on strong volume, it would represent a structural shift in market behavior and likely initiate a new phase of price discovery. However, if history repeats and the trendline holds once more, the probability of a return to the $73,000 support zone increases substantially. It’s also essential to recognize the time scale of this chart. Since this is a high time frame structure, each candle may take days or even weeks to finalize, meaning short-term moves are not sufficient to confirm a breakout or breakdown. Patience is required until full candle closures validate the next major direction. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin fails to break the $120,000 dynamic resistance, expect consolidation or a pullback toward $73,000. A confirmed breakout above $120,000 would shift the structure entirely and require fresh analysis.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-price-outlook-long-term-120k-trendline-test-could-define-q3/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Bitcoin|Price Analysis|Trading",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T16:30:52,"XRP, Solana, Cardano On Ice—SEC Freezes Grayscale GDLC ETF Debut","The US Securities and Exchange Commission has abruptly halted the conversion of Grayscale Investments’ Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which contains XRP, Solana and Cardano besides BTC and ETH, into an exchange-traded fund, less than twenty-four hours after agency staff had granted the necessary rule change. In a one-page letter dated 1 July, Deputy Secretary J. Matthew DeLesDernier informed the New York Stock Exchange that, “pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice … the Commission will review the delegated action. In accordance with Rule 431(e), the July 1, 2025 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise.” Until that review is completed, GDLC cannot list on NYSE Arca. The stay pauses an approval that the SEC’s Division of Trading & Markets had issued under delegated authority via Exchange Act Rule 19b-4, clearing NYSE Arca’s proposal (File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2024-87) to list GDLC as a “Trust Unit.” Without the Commission’s sign-off, the fund’s conversion cannot proceed even though its registration statement under the Securities Act is already effective. Why Is The SEC Freezing The XRP And ADA ETF? GDLC currently holds roughly $755 million, dominated by bitcoin (≈80 %) and ether (≈11 %), but it is the roughly eight percent allocated across XRP, Solana and Cardano that makes the product the first multi-asset spot ETF to bundle tokens the SEC has not (yet) conceded are commodities. By contrast, Grayscale’s bitcoin trust (GBTC) converted without incident in January 2024, after the D.C. Circuit ordered the SEC to vacate its earlier denial. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart broke the news on X: “UPDATE: While @Grayscale was given an approval order for their conversion of $GDLC into an ETF yesterday, there was a letter attached to that approval that is putting a Stay on their ability to actually convert at this time.” Seyffart sketched two, still-unconfirmed explanations. First, the Commission may be withholding all multi-coin launches until it finishes a comprehensive digital-asset ETP framework. “The SEC doesn’t want to let anything to launch under the 19b-4 process until they officially approve or come up with some framework for digital assets in the ETF wrapper. I assume the SEC didn’t want to deny it but for whatever reason they aren’t ready for a launch just yet.” Second, an internal division other than Trading & Markets may have unresolved concerns about GDLC’s structure or disclosures. “The 2nd theory is that there’s something the SEC wants to work on in relation to a specific aspect of $GDLC itself (like its structure?) The 19b-4 approval order comes from the division of Trading & Markets. Perhaps another division isn’t ready to let this convert just yet,” Seyffart wrote via X. His colleague Eric Balchunas echoed that reading: “The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling GDLC it can’t launch until otherwise notified. … My guess: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any ’33-Act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins.” Rule 431 allows any Commissioner to pull an action approved by staff for plenary Commission review. The rule is procedural; it neither guarantees reversal nor sets a deadline. Historically, reviews have ranged from a few weeks to several months. Until the Commission votes, the staff order remains in limbo. Therefore, Seyffart concludes: “TLDR: It can’t convert *YET* but it will.

2025-07-03T16:28:55,"Franklin Templeton Analysts Warn Of Dangers of Corporate Crypto Surge","Analysts at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets have expressed concerns about public companies using bold strategies to hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. While the rewards may seem high, analysts warned that this trend could backfire in dangerous ways. A new report outlines how this fast-growing strategy may create a cycle of profits or losses that could spiral out of control. The Rise of the Corporate Crypto Treasury A growing number of public companies are now adopting a crypto treasury strategy. These firms raise money through equity, convertible notes, preferred shares, and other financial tools and use the funds to buy and hold crypto assets. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, at least 135 public companies now hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury. The strategy gained popularity after the one led by Michael Saylor made headlines by transforming the company’s balance sheet into a Bitcoin vault. Following this trend, companies such as MARA, Metaplanet, Twenty One, and Sol Strategies have also adopted this approach. Other firms are also focusing on other crypto assets, such as Solana , Ethereum, and XRP, for long-term growth. Franklin Templeton Analysts Say This Strategy Works – For Now Analysts say this model can be very profitable, especially during a crypto bull market. Companies can raise capital at prices above the actual value of their crypto holdings. This gives them an edge. Every new share they sell generates more money than their assets are worth, allowing them to grow faster without relinquishing too much ownership. Surprisingly, crypto volatility, though risky, can help boost companies’ values. This comes as big crypto swings do make tools like convertible notes more valuable due to the embedded options they carry. Additionally, rising crypto prices also boost stock prices, attracting more investors. Franklin Templeton Analysts Outline the Dark Side of the Boom However, there is a catch. If the stock price of these companies falls below the value of their crypto holdings, known as the net asset value (NAV), trouble starts. At that point, issuing new shares becomes harmful to current investors because it reduces the value of their shares. Analysts say this is called dilution. Even worse, falling crypto prices can trigger a negative feedback loop. If companies attempt to sell crypto to prevent their stock from falling, they may push prices even lower. Analysts consider this scenario particularly dangerous, as it could deter investors, leading to further selling and a downward spiral of losses. Franklin Templeton is not alone in raising red flags. Last month, analysts at Presto Research stated that these companies face a real risk of collapse if things go south. However, they believe the risks are more complex than those of past crises, such as Terra or 3AC. Meanwhile, David Duong from Coinbase Institutional warned that highly leveraged crypto buying by companies might create broader risks for the financial system over time. Still, Duong believes any immediate threats remain low.

2025-07-03T16:25:59,"Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break $200K Before This Top Crypto Achieves Its $5 Target?","The post Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break $200K Before This Top Crypto Achieves Its $5 Target? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) is charging toward a monumental $200,000 milestone, currently testing a critical $108,724 resistance. Trading at $107,379.95 with a 0.32% daily gain, BTC’s momentum is undeniable, fueled by surging trading volumes up 16.74% to $51.82 billion. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi star, is capturing attention in phase 5 of its presale, priced at $0.03. Having raised $11,500,000 with over 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders, MUTM guarantees a 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch. Can BTC hit $200K before MUTM reaches its projected $5 target? The race is on. Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge BTC is puffing its chest in the cryptocurrency market, and it is in a bull cycle of four years. In the history of Bitcoin, the currency goes high towards the end of the year, like it happened in December 2017 and November 2021. This cycle is slower but it is not about to die down. Heavyweights such as Strategy which has more than 500,000 BTC and MetaPlanet with 12,345 BTC are contributing to the demand. Bitcoin ETFs also saw $500 million in inflows on June 25, signaling robust adoption. This institutional fervor, paired with retail interest, could propel BTC past $108,724 toward $200,000 in 2025. Moreover, growing stability is luring conservative investors, reducing fears of sharp corrections. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing swiftly through phase 5, already over 50% filled. Priced at $0.03, up 200% from its $0.01 opening, MUTM offers a guaranteed 2x return at its $0.06 launch. Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, a 16.7% jump, narrowing the window for early investors. With $11,500,000 raised and 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders, demand is soaring. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. Furthermore, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , split among 10 winners, boosts excitement. Join by submitting a wallet address, completing quests, and investing $50 in the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its dual lending model. Its peer-to-contract system uses smart contracts for dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. The peer-to-peer model enables direct lending, ideal for volatile assets. Users depositing ETH, AVAX, or DAI receive mtTokens, which accrue interest and support trading or staking. The protocol’s buyback mechanism rewards stakers with passive dividends, enhancing long-term value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, minimizing depegging risks. Consequently, this stablecoin will streamline lending and boost liquidity, setting MUTM apart in DeFi. Security and Scalability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. No security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days, reinforcing trust. The team has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. Plans for Layer 2 scaling will reduce gas fees and enhance transaction speed, positioning MUTM for global adoption. Analysts predict a $3.50 post-launch price in 2025, a 116x jump from phase 5. This robust infrastructure makes MUTM a top crypto to watch. The Race to Milestones Bitcoin’s push toward $200,000 hinges on breaking the $108,724 resistance, driven by institutional and retail momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, offers a compelling alternative with its $0.03 presale price and guaranteed 100% ROI at launch. Its innovative lending, stablecoin, and Layer 2 plans position it for a $3.50 target in 2025. While BTC’s market dominance is clear, MUTM’s utility and security make it a standout. Investors eyeing the best crypto to buy now should act fast—phase 5 is filling up.

2025-07-03T16:17:48,"ATOM Consolidates as Bitcoin Takes Driving Seat, Finds Support at $4.20","The altcoin market took a backseat on Thursday as crypto majors bitcoin and ether attempted to rally to new highs. As billions of dollars worth of liquidity flowed into shorting bitcoin on the brink of record highs, altcoins like ATOM consolidated, finding support at the $4.20 level. Typically when bitcoin rallies altcoin price action is muted and the inverse is true when bitcoin consolidates, so ATOM could be primed for a rally once bitcoin begins to cool off. Technical analysis ATOM-USD traded within a range of $4.09 to $4.26 during the 24-hour period from 2 July 16:00 to 3 July 15:00, representing a 4% swing. Key support established at $4.16-$4.17 with high volume buying emerging at the $4.20 level during the 13:00 hour session on July 3rd. Despite reaching a peak of $4.26 during the 07:00 hour, ATOM failed to sustain momentum above the $4.25 resistance level. In the last 60 minutes from 3 July 14:24 to 15:23, ATOM-USD declined from $4.24 to $4.21, representing a 0.73% decrease. Sharp selloff occurred between 15:03-15:07, dropping to a session low of $4.19, before staging a recovery. Final 15 minutes showed stabilization with price consolidation around $4.21, suggesting potential short-term equilibrium. CD20 Index Surges 2% Before Profit-Taking Emerges The CD20 demonstrated significant volatility in the last 24 hours from 2 July 16:00 to 3 July 15:00, reaching a peak of $1,811.11 before retracing to $1,793.55, with an overall range of $37.27 (2%). After establishing support around $1,780 during early hours, the index staged an impressive rally through the morning session of 3 July, gaining momentum particularly between 09:00-14:00 before profit-taking emerged in the final hour.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/03/atom-consolidates-as-bitcoin-takes-driving-seat-finds-support-at-usd4-20,"BTC|ATOM|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN","Markets|AI Market Insights|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T16:04:30,"Crypto Tax Proposal That Didn't Make it to Trump's Budget Bill Pushed on Its Own","Tax proposals meant to reduce burdens among crypto users, including one that would waive capital-gains calculations for small-scale transactions, didn't make it into President Donald Trump's marquee budget bill but are now being pursued as standalone legislation in the U.S. Senate. Senator Cynthia Lummis, who leads the crypto subcommittee within the Senate Banking Committee, introduced the bill on Thursday to address a number of the digital assets sectors' chief taxation complaints. The legislation would set a threshold of $300 on crypto transactions that would need to factor into a users' tax calculations, freeing up people's small, day-to-day transactions from capital-gains headaches — limited to a total of $5,000 a year. The effort would also eliminate double taxation on crypto given in staking, mining, airdrops and forks, tossing out the initial tax hit when the rewards are received and focusing only on taxing gains from the eventual sale. It would also address lending, wash sales, charitable giving and let dealers and traders choose to mark their assets to the current market value in their accounting. ""We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,"" Lummis said in a statement . Lummis has launched this bill into uncertain waters. Getting Senate time devoted to solitary bills is a challenge in an already busy session, but adding to that complication is the fact that a number of other crypto matters are likely to take priority — including the two bills that would establish regulations for the U.S. crypto markets and stablecoin issuers. And another of her legislative campaigns to establish a federal bitcoin (BTC) reserve is also in the mix. The Wyoming Republican has been at the forefront of crypto matters, but the top priority for the industry on Capitol Hill at the moment is the advancement of the bill to set rules of the road for how the government will oversee the digital assets markets. Lummis publicly agreed to hew to a deadline recently set by Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to deliver the market structure bill to Trump's desk by the end of September.

2025-07-03T15:58:37,"Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Price Surge: Is the Next Big Rally Starting?","Bitcoin (BTC), has just broken out of a bull flag. The next stage of its upward journey awaits. With the king of the cryptocurrencies heading higher, the altcoins will not be far behind. $ETH and $SOL are potentially already beginning their own price surges. Support is firming up for $ETH - $2,800 next? Source: TradingView The daily chart for $ETH shows that the sideways period is still ongoing, at least until now. That said, the $2,400 horizontal support level is firming up, and if the bulls can get the price beyond the current $2,600 resistance, $2,800 would be next. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing the indicator line pointing upwards and it has broken beyond the yellow moving average. All bullish moving forward. $ETH breaks back above mid-level of price range Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $ETH illustrates how the price has been going sideways within a range since breaking beyond the descending trendline. This range stretches from $2,200 up to $2,800, with the midway point being at $2,500. The price is currently back above the mid-level and so it might be expected that another test of the top of the range could be next. This will be crucial for the bulls to get above so that they can concentrate on taking out the all-important previous swing high at $4,110. If they can do this, it is game-on, and the all-time high of $4,860 will not look so daunting. $SOL confirmation of breakout, or another fakeout? Source: TradingView Things were looking up for the $SOL price earlier on Thursday as a breakout appeared to be taking place. However, the price has dipped back down and It now remains to be seen whether this is a confirmation of the breakout, or whether it is another fakeout. Given that there is also some horizontal support at this current level, a retest of the breakout looks to be the favourite outcome. The RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicator line perhaps about to similarly retest the breakout beyond the yellow moving average. A quick candle wick down to the ascending trendline is also a possibility. Time will tell. $SOL still bullish on weekly chart Source: TradingView In spite of $SOL’s recent dip the weekly chart still looks very promising. The price is still beyond the upper trendline of what could be a falling wedge, rather than a descending channel. As long as it is still there by the end of play on Sunday, another candle opening beyond the trendline would be bullish. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are currently crossing back over. This would also be a very bullish signal if this is still the case by the end of this week.

2025-07-03T15:46:39,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Bitcoin Price Rebounds After Jobs Data Dip","Market reactions to US government economic reports have always been powerful catalysts for price movements, particularly within the crypto space. From inflation numbers to jobs data, even the most subtle deviation from expectation can send assets into sharp swings. In many cases, these shifts are not immediate. This is why the latest unemployment report was closely watched. Most assumed a negative outcome would trigger a sharp correction, or at the very least a fresh bout of volatility. And yet, even as the report landed with surprising strength, Bitcoin did the unexpected again and dumped. However, its rebound, swift and clean, has now become the centerpiece of speculation as the next leg of upward momentum begins to take shape. Bitcoin Rebounds Strong Despite Surprising Jobs Data June’s employment data turned out to be a major upside surprise. The US added 147,000 jobs , decisively beating the analyst forecast of just 106,000. The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, in direct contrast to the anticipated rise to 4.3%. For traditional markets, this would typically signal economic strength. For crypto, however, such clarity often brings chaos. JUST IN: The US 🇺🇸 unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in June 2025 from 4.2% in May, against market expectations of 4.3%. The rate has stayed between 4.0% and 4.2% since May 2024, indicating labor market stability. #unemployment #economy pic.twitter.com/OTHIiIZFoS — Crypto Dives (@MakroDives) July 3, 2025 The moment the figures were published, Bitcoin’s price took a sharp dip. It had been hovering around the $110,000 level before swiftly dropping below $108,900 in what many described as a flash dump. That alone caught retail traders off guard, who had expected the report to bring caution but not immediate selling pressure. The irony is that better-than-expected news still triggered a selloff, reinforcing the unpredictable ways in which crypto reacts to macroeconomic indicators. Yet within minutes, the market reversed course. Buyer volume surged just as rapidly as the dump occurred, pushing Bitcoin right back to its earlier levels. This kind of V-shaped move is often interpreted as a sign of underlying confidence. Some see it as a possible instance of strategic accumulation, where institutions or large players take advantage of momentary retail weakness to secure stronger positions. Regardless of the motive, the rebound above $110,000 has now strengthened the view that Bitcoin remains resilient. This also suggests that support zones are tightening, and with labor market indicators showing consistency, the wider market might interpret this as a green light for continued bullishness. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Trend As Investors’ Attention Increases SUBBD With the US unemployment rate dropping unexpectedly, the narrative of job creation and opportunity has taken center stage again. And while most eyes are still on traditional sectors, SUBBD has quietly been building a creator-centric economic layer that may well play a part in the next wave of decentralized employment. SUBBD is not simply a content hosting platform. It is a creator-owned infrastructure designed to ensure that revenue flows back into the hands of those producing the content rather than intermediaries. This changes how influence, information, and income move in digital ecosystems. For creators, this means more than just a place to publish. It offers a financial model where subscriptions, tips, premium content, and micro-communities operate without centralized platforms skimming off the majority. That opens the door to sustainable, independent income at scale. As macroeconomic indicators show a strengthening labor market, projects like SUBBD sit well with this new direction. It turns digital visibility into capital, and it does so on-chain. The user base is evolving from speculative early adopters to real professionals who view blockchain as a tool rather than a trend. It has already been endorsed by top creators like ClayBro and others, adding to its popularity and trust factor. In a market like this, where investor attention is leaning towards tangible utility and user-driven models, SUBBD is positioned at a very strong intersection. If Bitcoin’s rebound is a signal of the next bullish leg, then the creator economy’s expansion may follow suit, and SUBBD could very well be a key player leading that charge. Token 6900 The crypto market has always swung between seriousness and satire. Token 6900 leans hard into the latter, but make no mistake, its timing and structure suggest a deeper understanding of how narratives move this market. With Bitcoin rebounding cleanly from its post-report dip, many believe that the speculative phase may reignite. That creates the perfect backdrop for tokens like 6900, which do not rely on long whitepapers or roadmap jargon, but on raw energy, meme culture, and irony weaponized as community fuel. Token 6900 positions itself as a cultural capsule from the last memecoin cycle. It brings back everything that defined the earlier mania with chaotic graphics, bizarre tone, and absurd web design. And somehow, that chaotic energy is exactly what investors seem to be waiting for. Especially now, as prices begin to climb and fear turns into curiosity again. What makes Token 6900 stand out is its unapologetic approach. It is not trying to please everyone. It is here to cater to the same tribe that made previous degen tokens 100x in weeks. And unlike random meme coins with no storyline, Token 6900 is tapping into a very specific visual and narrative aesthetic that has already proven to work, particularly referencing its loose alignment with SPX 6900 and its deep-cut internet themes. If capital starts rotating back into the higher-risk pockets of crypto, Token 6900 may not just start the degen crypto movement again. It might help shape it. And that makes it worth watching closely. Snorter In the past few months, the demand for accessible trading tools inside messaging apps has quietly exploded. Snorter has emerged as one of the most focused plays on this trend. Built to function directly within Telegram, Snorter combines an AI-powered interface with multi-chain connectivity, allowing users to trade, track, and manage crypto activity without leaving the chat environment. The brilliance of Snorter is in how much it eliminates friction. Users no longer need to toggle between exchanges, wallets, and price trackers. With Snorter, everything happens inside the interface they already use every day. This has huge implications, especially as new investors return to the market following Bitcoin’s resilience. In moments of sharp movement, like the recent flash dip and rebound, fast reaction times become everything and Snorter turns Telegram into a trading terminal that can respond in seconds. More than just speed, it also offers customization. From sniping tools to AI price insights and portfolio monitoring, Snorter is built for users who want more control but less clutter. It bridges casual Telegram users with serious DeFi functions in a way that few projects have done effectively. As crypto gears up for a possible speculative wave, tools like Snorter will likely see more demand. The project does not just benefit from a bullish market — it enhances a trader’s ability to survive one. That positions it as both a product and a utility layer, and it makes Snorter increasingly difficult to ignore. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels and confidence begins returning to the broader market, investor behavior is shifting with it. The rush is no longer just about finding the next 10x token, but also about equipping oneself with the right tools to navigate whatever cycle comes next. Best Wallet Token stands out here because it does not simply ride on speculative hype. It is backed by infrastructure that is already useful, already adopted, and already ahead of what most wallets today offer. Best Wallet is a high-performance Web3 wallet that supports over 60 blockchains. That level of connectivity matters now more than ever. In a market where cross-chain activity is becoming standard, the ability to seamlessly move, manage, and interact with assets across multiple networks is no longer a premium feature. It is essential. Best Wallet delivers this with a UX that feels familiar but operates on far more advanced rails. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 But the token itself is where the utility deepens. Best Wallet Token is not just a governance piece. It is integrated into access, tiered features, staking incentives, and future rollouts of wallet-native applications. This gives it actual use across a growing product suite, not just abstract value. The project has raised upwards of $13 million already, and could soon be ready to launch in the coming weeks. With investor attention returning and market participants setting up for longer plays, wallets become central again. They are the access point. The control layer. And Best Wallet, with its expanding reach and real-world functionality, may be one of the few built to handle what’s coming next. Conclusion The current market sentiment, paved by Bitcoin’s resilience and reinforced by stronger economic indicators, has created a positive backdrop for high-potential crypto assets. Projects that offer a pathway to emerging user behavior, provide real utility, or tap into renewed investor energy are gaining traction fast. From infrastructure plays to cultural tokens and creator-driven ecosystems, the trend is clear; the market is rewarding relevance and readiness. As momentum builds and capital begins flowing with greater conviction, this may be a prime window to consider assets that are not only built for speculation, but also designed to thrive in the next stage of the cycle.

2025-07-03T15:45:23,"Tether signs MoU with Adecoagro to launch a bitcoin mining project","Tether Holdings Ltd., the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with South American agribusiness firm Adecoagro S.A. The agreement was disclosed in a press release on Tether’s website on Thursday. The two companies plan to collaborate on a Bitcoin mining pilot project in Brazil, merging renewable energy capabilities with Tether’s digital asset expertise. Adecoagro is a Nasdaq-listed company with major operations in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay that currently manages over 230 megawatts of electrical generation capacity sourced from renewables. Adecoagro to use Tether mining software According to the statement , the pilot project will be launched using Tether’s proprietary Mining OS, a mining site management software. Tether announced that the software will be open-sourced in the coming months. Adecoagro’s company policies on related-party transactions state that its Independent Committee has reviewed and approved the initiative. The company sees this mining project as more than a means of monetizing surplus electricity. It is seeking to diversify its balance sheet with digital assets like Bitcoin. “ We’re excited to explore innovative ways to maximize the value of our renewable energy assets ,” reckoned Mariano Bosch, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Adecoagro. Bosch explained that the partnership could allow the company to stabilize the pricing of energy it currently sells on the spot market while gaining upside exposure to Bitcoin. Speaking on the new MOU, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked about the synergy between Adecoagro’s agricultural energy infrastructure and Tether’s portfolio of mining operations. “ This project is another step in our growing commitment to renewable-powered bitcoin mining ,” said Ardoino. “ It highlights the potential to align agricultural energy production with cutting-edge digital infrastructure .” Adecoagro is in the sustainable food and energy production business, but has now promised to assess Bitcoin mining as an alternative source of demand for its existing power generation infrastructure. Using 230 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, a Bitcoin mining operation can deploy thousands of ASIC machines such as the Antminer S19 XP, consuming roughly 3,000 watts. At this scale, the operation could reach a hash rate of approximately 6.9 exahashes per second (EH/s), roughly 1.6% of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate, which currently stands near 430 EH/s. Given the current mining difficulty and an average block reward of 3.125 BTC post-halving, a setup could mine a full block approximately once every 2 to 3 days. If efficiently managed and powered by low-cost renewable energy, Adecoagro facilities would rank among the world’s largest industrial-scale mining operations. Ardoino believes the USDT parent company will become the biggest bitcoin miner by the end of 2025. Tether recently disclosed it holds more than 100,000 BTC, worth over $10 billion. Tether takes an extra step into Africa with Zanzibar partnership On July 1, Tether also announced a collaboration with the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, located off the coast of Tanzania. The company signed another MOU, this time with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority, to improve the financial inclusion and blockchain education on the islands. As part of the initiative, Tether plans to work alongside educational institutions in Zanzibar to incorporate blockchain and digital asset knowledge into school and university curricula. This could help citizens add to their knowledge about decentralized technologies and encourage the development of a local digital economy. Tether also intends to integrate its stablecoins, including the US dollar-pegged USDT and gold-backed XAUT, into ZanMalipo, Zanzibar’s government-controlled digital payments platform. Through ZanMalipo, local users can legally engage with digital currencies directly through an official channel. “This MOU with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority reflects our commitment to advancing financial literacy and sustainable blockchain innovation in Africa,” Ardoino said. The Tether CEO added that by investing in educational initiatives and integrating digital assets into formal systems, the company is helping lay the foundation for a compliant and inclusive financial future.

Garrett Patten’s Elliott Wave chart projects $116,400 as the next major wave 3 target if support holds. Both analyses align around bullish momentum, with MACD and RSI confirming strength in current market structure. A strong technical case is building for Bitcoin’s next major rally, as analysts have identified technical chart setups pointing to a rally toward the $116,000–$120,000 range. The bullish sentiment on Bitcoin is supported by the following analytical methods that clearly show a powerful move provided key support levels hold. BTC bullish outlook was highlighted on July 3 by two separate analyses, one focusing on a classic chart breakout and the other on a complex Elliott Wave structure, both arriving at a similar bullish conclusion. The Breakout: A Classic Pattern Signals a 10% Upside Lark Davis, known as @TheCryptoLark on X, shared a Bitcoin chart on July 3 showing a clear breakout above a descending trendline.

2025-07-03T15:32:00,"Top Analyst Warns Bitcoin Risks Retracement To $40,000 As Highly Reliable Indicator Flashes Sell Signal","Independent crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautioned of a potential downside for Bitcoin after spotting a bearish signal from a reliable technical indicator. In a recent post on the X platform, Martinez told his followers that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which has predicted every major Bitcoin crash, had flashed again. The indicator, according to Martinez, was warning that a 63% reversal could be in the offing. “The Tom DeMark Sequential just gave a quarterly sell signal. This is a rare warning that has historically preceded brutal drawdowns,” the pundit stated. Martinez noted that the TD Sequential sent a sell signal in 2015, and a 75% Bitcoin drop ensued. In 2018, the same setup saw Bitcoin plummet by over 85%. The TD Sequential indicator is an oscillating trend-following chart overlay indicator that is used to identify short-term trend reversals based on changes in intraday highs and lows. In other words, the indicator sparks when an asset sees an overextended rally and is due for a brutal correction. In this case, the indicator predicts that the BTC price could see a frantic drop from the current level, dropping as much as 63%, to trade hands at around $40,000. Such a move would mark a huge drawdown as Bitcoin has been trading above the psychologically important $100K level for the most part in recent months. Today, BTC topped the $110,000 mark for the first time since June 11 after U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew in roughly $408 million on Wednesday — a sign of investors’ unwavering confidence. Since May 1, these BTC products have registered $9.91 billion in inflows, approximately 20% of their total inflows since launching in January 2024, data from Farside shows. The world’s largest and oldest crypto was valued at $110,295 as of publication time, a more than 2.4% gain since Wednesday.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/top-analyst-warns-bitcoin-risks-retracement-to-40000-as-highly-reliable-indicator-flashes-sell-signal/,"BTC|TRADING|SPONSORED|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
