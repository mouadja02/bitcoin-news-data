2025-07-03T13:56:16,"Top Presales to Soar as Ripple Seeks US Bank License: Institutions Are Hot on Crypto","Ripple has officially applied for a national bank charter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The crypto company already holds a state-level license from New York’s NYDFS. If it now secures a bank charter, it would become the only stablecoin with both federal and state oversight, boosting the credibility of $RLUSD – Ripple’s stablecoin. This move, confirmed by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on X, comes just two days after USDC issuer Circle announced its own application for a bank charter with the OCC . $USDC is currently the second biggest stablecoin with a market cap of $61B , whereas $RLUSD holds a much smaller footprint of $469M. We’ll dig into what it could mean for the wider crypto market and also suggest the top presales you can buy to capitalize on the trend. Ripple’s Fed Master Account Application Along with a national bank charter, Ripple has also applied for a Fed master account through Standard Custody & Trust Company. Currently, no stablecoin issuer has a Fed master account. If Ripple gets the nod, it could be a major win for $RLUSD. Instead of holding reserves with third-party financial instruments, Ripple will be able to store them directly with the Fed, offering an unmatched level of security. A Fed master account is also a strong indicator of regulatory trust in the stablecoin, which will encourage other financial institutions to use $RLUSD as their primary stablecoin. Ripple’s push for a national bank charter could lead to a domino effect where more stablecoin issuers strive for a regulatory stamp of confidence. This opens the door for innovative altcoins with unique real-world utility to skyrocket. With that in mind, here are some of the top trending cryptos you can invest in to make the most of it. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for the Best Meme Coin Trading Experience Are you a meme coin trader? If yes, the Snorter Telegram bot might just be what you’re looking for. Powered by the Snorter Token ($SNORT) , the bot can automatically, and at breakneck pace, snipe new tokens on the Solana blockchain as soon as it becomes liquid, making it the best crypto to buy now . If you hold $SNORT, you also get access to a low trading fee of just 0.85%, compared to the standard 1.5% when buying or selling crypto with the Snorter bot. The best part? Snorter employs MEV-resistant layers to protect you from sandwich attacks, rug pulls, and honeypots, ensuring a safe and smooth meme coin trading experience. Out of the total supply of 500M, 25% has been reserved for project development. This is a clear sign that the developers are prioritizing long-term innovation and platform upgrades. The bot plans to integrate other blockchains beyond Solana, along with a centralized dashboard where you can view your entire crypto portfolio in a single place. The $SNORT token has raised $1.5M so far and is currently priced at $0.0973. And if the $SNORT price predictions are anything to go by, the token could make a high of $1.02 in 2025 itself – a whopping 1,000% gain. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The First Bitcoin Layer-2 Solution With Faster Transactions and Lower Fees Bitcoin is hands down the most popular cryptocurrency around. However, over time, the Bitcoin ecosystem has been plagued by slow transactions due to growing traffic. Plus, Bitcoin isn’t compatible with decentralized apps, forcing users to resort to other options. All that will change with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution. A canonical bridge sits at the heart of $HYPER, using which you can convert your typical $BTC into wrapped Bitcoin. This Bitcoin can then be used for staking or engaging with NFTs, DeFi, blockchain gaming, and more. Once you’ve done what you needed to do, you can convert the wrapped $BTC back to real $BTC. Note that this entire conversion back and forth is powered by the canonical bridge and aided by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , offering speed and scalability along with low fees. One $HYPER token is currently available for just $0.012125, and the project has raised a total of $1.8M so far. And according to our $HYPER price prediction , it could hit $0.08625 in 2026 — a potential seven-fold profit. 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Innovative Altcoin Looking to Build Futuristic Blockchains With the Help of AI Lightchain AI brings together the best of both worlds – artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Simply put, Lightchain aims to build decentralized, smarter, and secure blockchains by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. For this, it plans to use a mix of modern technologies like consensus mechanism, Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), and Proof of Intelligence (PoI). $LCAI is your key to access the latest AI tech enhancements, privacy tools, and priority processing perks at Lightchain. You can also take $LCAI tokens to participate in DAO governance. Lucky for you, you can get one token for just $0.007125 right now. The project has raised a whopping $21M so far and is on its way to revolutionize blockchain technology. Conclusion Ripple and Circle’s efforts for regulatory approvals signal a growing trend towards legitimizing digital assets. This could ultimately benefit newer, high-potential tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which might churn out outsized gains. However, since cryptocurrencies are always a risky investment, it’s advised to do your own research before putting your hard-earned money into them.

2025-07-03T13:50:01,"IMF Turns Down Pakistan’s Proposal To Subsidize Electricity For Bitcoin Mining: Report","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s bid to offer subsidised electricity to Bitcoin mining operations, dealing a significant blow to the nation’s bold plans to become a regional crypto hub shortly after its high-profile debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve. While testifying before the Senate Standing Committee on Energy on Thursday, Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan said that the IMF was concerned about creating market distortions. The government had proposed allocating 2,000 megawatts from its 7,000 MW electricity surplus to cryptocurrency mining and other energy-intensive industries at rates of 23-24 Pakistani rupees ($0.08) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). But, the IMF remains skeptical despite surplus power during winter months, cautioning that such incentives resemble tax holidays that have historically undermined market efficiency. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” Irfan told lawmakers, suggesting that the project hasn’t been shelved entirely and is under review by the World Bank and other international partners. The IMF has raised red flags about how the government would transition the subsidized electricity back to market rates and contended that similar initiatives had previously failed to yield results. Pakistan’s Pivot Toward Crypto The development follows Pakistan’s creation of a “National Crypto Council” to oversee the formulation of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and to lure in foreign investors. The newly formed council tapped former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as strategic advisor. Pakistan’s crypto embrace also includes the announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in May, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib revealed that the government followed the United States’ example in establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve and is embracing pro-crypto regulatory policies. Saqib promised that the country would “never, ever sell” its holdings of the flagship cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, it’s still unknown how many Bitcoins the country plans to hold, and whether these assets will be bought or acquired via other means.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/imf-turns-down-pakistans-proposal-to-subsidize-electricity-for-bitcoin-mining-report/,"BTC|MINING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|IMF",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:45:13,"YZi Labs joins Goldman Sachs, Citadel in $135m Canton Network push","YZi Labs is now part of a growing alliance of regulated and crypto-native players funding Digital Asset’s Canton Network, a blockchain aiming to merge Wall Street-scale operations with on-chain privacy and composability. On July 3, YZi Labs, the venture capital and incubation firm formerly known as Binance Labs, announced its participation in Digital Asset’s $135 million Series E round, which attracted Wall Street heavyweights like Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, and DTCC. The investment, following Digital Asset’s initial June 24 funding reveal, positions YZi Labs alongside traditional finance’s most influential institutions in backing the Canton Network, a public Layer 1 blockchain seeking to reconcile institutional compliance with decentralized infrastructure. The convergence of companies in the multimillion-dollar funding round represents a strategic alignment between crypto’s builders and TradFi’s gatekeepers. Canton’s configurable privacy model has already processed over $1.5 trillion in monthly tokenized U.S. Treasury repo activity, demonstrating that regulated finance is ready to embrace blockchain, but only on certain terms. You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy hit with class-action lawsuit over $5.9 billion BTC loss The institutional onchain revolution takes shape YZi Labs’ investment in Digital Asset can be seen as a strategic play to participate in the growth of blockchain infrastructure that finally meets Wall Street’s demands. Traditional finance has long viewed public blockchains with skepticism, wary of exposing sensitive transactions to full transparency, while private chains remain isolated and cumbersome. Canton Network’s configurable privacy model changes that equation, allowing institutions to control data visibility without sacrificing interoperability. That’s why YZi Labs, alongside Goldman Sachs and Citadel, sees Canton as the missing link for tokenizing real-world assets at scale. With the $135 million capital injection, the Canton Network plans to accelerate its expansion, focusing on three key areas: infrastructure scalability, faster onboarding for regulated entities, and deeper interoperability between applications. According to the announcement, the network’s roadmap over the next 12 to 18 months includes new live deployments, global market expansion, and more seamless application-level composability. “This investment from YZi Labs reinforces the growing demand for blockchain infrastructure that meets the rigorous standards of global financial markets, Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset, said. “With this new backing, we’re advancing our mission to bring trillions of dollars more in real-world assets on-chain, creating a more connected and efficient financial ecosystem.” YZi Labs’ involvement also signals a strategic pivot under its rebrand from Binance Labs. Since Changpeng Zhao stepped back from Binance’s exchange operations, YZi has doubled down on infrastructure bridging crypto and traditional systems. Its March investment in Plume Network , a modular blockchain for real-world assets, mirrors the Canton playbook: enabling institutions to tokenize everything from carbon credits to private equity. Similarly, backing AI-data startup Vana and token distribution platform Sign earlier this year reveals a pattern: YZi isn’t chasing speculative DeFi trends but funding rails for mass adoption. The firm claims to manage over $10 billion in assets globally.

2025-07-03T13:43:24,"Fight for 40,000 BTC Continues: Judge Allows Celsius’s Lawsuit Against Tether to Proceed","A U.S. bankruptcy judge has ruled that Celsius Network can proceed with its $4.3 billion lawsuit against Tether. The case focuses on claims that the USDT issuer improperly sold nearly 40,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in June 2022. The Judge’s Ruling In court documents filed in New York on Monday, Judge Martin Glenn ruled that some aspects of the multibillion-dollar lawsuit had merit. Celsius had accused the stablecoin company of carrying out a “fire sale” of more than 39,500 BTC and applying the proceeds to a debt of $812 million. The now-defunct crypto lender claimed this was done without following agreed-upon procedures, resulting in losses exceeding $4 billion based on current prices. Judge Glenn argued that the alleged verbal permission from former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to liquidate the collateral was “insufficient.” He added that failing to observe a 10-hour grace period for posting collateral could still count as a breach, “oral permission or not.” The judge also said that the digital asset firm’s awareness of Celsius’s insolvency at the time did not give it a legal basis to act independently. However, he dismissed some parts of the lawsuit. For instance, claims against certain Tether entities were dropped due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Allegations that rely on applying U.S. bankruptcy law outside the country were also dismissed. The judge further decided that Celsius did not prove the defendant had breached its duties under British Virgin Islands (BVI) law regarding good faith and fair dealing. Details of The Case The dispute is centred on a margin call the USDT provider issued during a decline in BTC’s prices three years ago. Celsius says the agreement included a 10-hour window to post additional collateral, but Tether sold the Bitcoin before that period expired. The crypto lender says the respondent’s actions breached their agreement, violated “good faith and fair dealing” under BVI law, and involved fraudulent and preferential transfers that violate the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to the filing, the assets were liquidated at an average price of $20,656 per coin, which was below market value. Celsius further alleged that the proceeds were later transferred to the stablecoin operator’s Bitfinex accounts. The transactions also involved U.S.-based staff, accounts, and communications, which it believes gives the case enough ties to be handled in a U.S. court. In August 2024, Tether moved to dismiss the case, arguing the court lacked jurisdictional authority and that the crypto lender’s claims had no legal ground. The company called the lawsuit “baseless” and a “shameless litigation money grab.” CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement that Celsius executives had told his organization to sell the BTC “in order to close out its roughly 815 million USDT position.” He added that the lawsuit was an attempt by the bankrupt firm to shift blame for its mismanagement. Celsius completed its bankruptcy process on January 31, 2024, and is currently repaying its creditors. More recently, its former top executive, Mashinsky, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud.

2025-07-03T13:41:39,"Dogecoin’s Wall Street Moment: Why Big Money Is Pouring Into DOGE","Dogecoin (DOGE) is witnessing a surge in institutional interest, mostly fueled by growing optimism over the potential approval of multiple DOGE spot ETFs and regulatory clarity in the U.S. This trend is underscored by significant investments from major companies, with Remixpoint, a Tokyo-based energy consulting firm, ramping up its crypto holdings over the past year. According to an earnings report published Friday, Remixpoint’s crypto holdings surged from just $446,500 on March 31, 2024, to $38 million by December 31, 2024. By February 2025, the company had expanded its crypto portfolio to approximately $59.1 million, representing a 13,000% increase in just nine months, as it moves closer to its $65 million investment target. Notably, the company’s diversified cryptocurrency portfolio includes substantial holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. This strategic move, similar to fellow Japanese company Metaplanet, which has been doubling down on Bitcoin , aims to hedge against the declining value of the yen and broaden Remixpoint’s financial assets. Once regarded primarily as a speculative cryptocurrency propelled by retail traders and online communities, Dogecoin is now gaining traction among institutional investors. Remixpoint’s inclusion of DOGE in its portfolio highlights the evolving perception of the cryptocurrency, which has transitioned from a meme coin to a functional digital asset with expanding real-world applications in payments and blockchain-based innovations. This trend extends beyond Remixpoint. Neptune Digital Assets, a publicly traded Canadian blockchain company, purchased approximately 1 million DOGE tokens for $258,000 in December 2024, reinforcing its position in the cryptocurrency market. Elsewhere, last November, Spirit Blockchain Capital acquired Dogecoin Portfolio Holding Corp to expand Dogecoin’s ecosystem and utility. However, the acquisition focused on intellectual property and cash assets rather than direct DOGE holdings on its balance sheet. Similarly, in July 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company had not sold any of its Dogecoin holdings, though the exact amount remains undisclosed. Notably, Tesla began accepting Dogecoin for select merchandise in December 2021, reinforcing Musk’s ongoing support for the cryptocurrency. That said, the surge in interest for DOGE comes amid discussions surrounding the potential approval of Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale Dogecoin ETFs by the SEC. If approved, these ETFs could further strengthen Dogecoin’s presence in financial markets, potentially boosting its price. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17, reflecting a 7.01% surge in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoins-wall-street-moment-why-big-money-is-pouring-into-doge/,"DOGE|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:32:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Sets Sights On $110,000 As Market Rallies","Bitcoin (BTC) rallied sharply on Wednesday, recovering from Tuesday’s low of $105,328 to register an increase of nearly 3%, reclaiming $108,000, and settling at $108,845. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $109,672 as buyers eye the $110,000 mark. BTC’s rally was driven by President Trump’s announcement that the US had struck a trade deal with Vietnam to lower tariffs on exported goods from 46% to 20%. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Seven-Year Low Bitcoin (BTC) exchange reserves have dropped below 15% for the first time since 2018, according to data from Glassnode. A drop in Bitcoin supply could indicate an incoming price rally driven by a “supply shock.” A supply shock occurs when strong buyer demand is met with low BTC supply. Falling exchange reserves are typically associated with growing investor confidence and a shift towards long-term holding patterns. During such events, investors transfer their Bitcoin to cold wallets, reducing the liquid supply of the asset. Bitcoin whales often withdraw their assets from exchanges when the market enters an accumulation phase. Over-the-counter (OTC) desks are also facing a tightening supply. These desks facilitate large, private cryptocurrency trades by matching buyers and sellers. However, they depend on maintaining BTC reserves for swift and reliable trade execution. The cumulative balance of BTC held in known OTC addresses is at historic lows. CryptoQuant data showed a 21% decline in OTC address balances linked to miners since January. BlackRock Earns More Annual Fees From Bitcoin ETF Than Flagship S&P 500 Fund BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is earning more in annual fees from its spot Bitcoin ETF than from its flagship S&P 500 fund. NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci stated, “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF has over $75 billion in assets under management (AUM), and has generated $187.2 million in annual fees, $100,000 more than the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). IVV, launched in 2000, is eight times larger than IBIT and holds $624 billion in assets under management (AUM). However, it charges almost nine times less at just 0.03%. Crypto executives were quick to praise the report, with Anthony Pompliano stating, “BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund. Bitcoin has Wall Street's full, undivided attention now.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is eying a move past $110,000 as market sentiment turned bullish after President Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the red, dropping 1.09% on Monday and 1.33% on Tuesday to settle at $105,742. However, market sentiment flipped to bullish on Wednesday and BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. The price reached an intraday high of $110,281 during the ongoing session before declining to current levels. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied past $109,000 on Wednesday on the back of the global money supply (M2) reaching a new all-time high above $55 trillion. The price increase was outlined by a spike in derivatives activity, indicating renewed momentum. Open interest (OI) across major exchanges rose by 10% or $3.2 billion, thanks to a significant increase in capital in the market. The price increase was primarily driven by long positions, suggesting investor confidence in further upside. The recent price jump has prompted analyst optimism about an imminent new all-time high. According to Rekt Capital, a record weekly close above $109,000 could put BTC above its final resistance zone, unlocking price discovery and pushing it to new highs. BTC traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping 1.17% on Saturday and plunging below $100,000 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. The price fell to an intraday low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,985. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66%, crossing the moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,137. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 1.19% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,980. Source: TradingView BTC recovered despite the overwhelming selling pressure, rising 0.14% on Friday and 0.20% on Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose nearly 1%, crossing $108,000 and settling at $108,350.

According to a crypto analyst’s recent chart shared on social media, the PEPE price has just pierced above a falling wedge pattern. This seems a potential bullish breakout that may set the stage for a new short-term rally. PEPE Gives Falling Wedge Breakout In Short-Term As seen in the chart, PEPE crypto has broken above the upper boundary of a falling wedge that had formed since the mid-May correction. This wedge has contained PEPE’s lower highs and lower lows for nearly seven weeks. $PEPE bullish wedge playing out pic.twitter.com/UupIdWlIZd — Greeny (@greenytrades) July 3, 2025 The breakout, occurring at the start of July, may now open the door to a potential retest of the $0.00001600 level, which marked the mid-May peak. The analyst suggests that if price action continues to hold above the wedge and gains follow through, this target could be reached swiftly in the short term. The short-term optimism for PEPE crypto was also aligned with another analyst’s post, where he said the current level is pivotal and breaking further would give $0.000016 and $0.000019. Source: coinglass Moreover, this short-term optimism in meme coin PEPE is backed by derivatives data, as open interest is $559.75 million, up 19.37% from the previous session. Additionally, the 24-hour long/short ratio is 1.0263, and huge shorts got liquidated, amounting $3.13 million compared to $269.49 longs. The last couple of days have seen less liquidation compared to shorts, which backs the current short-term bullishness. [post_titles_links postid=”478186″] Long-Term Trend Reversal Still in Play Beyond this breakout, the analyst also draws attention to the Q2 rally as a breakout from a long-term descending trendline that had been in place since late 2023. This previous breakout structure resembled a broader wedge formation suggesting the current move is part of a much larger bullish shift. Despite heavy selling pressure in mid-May, PEPE never fell below its April lows, signaling a strong defense from bulls. If the token manages to close above $0.00001600 with strong daily candle confirmation, it would further validate the breakout and set the stage for a move toward Q4 2024’s peak of around $0.00002800. Source: Santiment In addition, the early July rise seems very important for the long-term uptrend, as the number of transactions transferring more than $1 million and $100K metrics were declining since mid-May alongside PEPE price, and more spikes in these metrics would boost PEPE price in the long term.

According to our Pepecoin price forecast, the altcoin’s price could surge to a maximum of $0.000028 this year. Can Pepe coin reach 1 dollar in 2030 No, most predictions do not foresee PEPE reaching $1 by 2030. While some optimistic forecasts suggest a maximum price of around $0.0002733 to $0.00843 by 2030, this is still far from $1. The sheer circulating supply makes such a valuation economically unfeasible within that timeframe. Will PEPE coin ever reach $1 dollar? No, PEPE coin reaching $1 is considered highly improbable and “virtually impossible” by most analysts. With a total supply of over 420 trillion tokens, a $1 price would require an astronomical market capitalization exceeding $420 trillion, which is vastly larger than the entire global economy and well beyond Bitcoin’s peak market cap. Does PEPE coin have a long-term future? PEPE coin’s long-term future is highly speculative and dependent on sustained community hype and cultural relevance, as it lacks intrinsic utility or a formal development roadmap. While it can experience significant short-term pumps, its volatility and “useless” design make it a high-risk investment. Its survival hinges on continued meme coin cycles and strong community engagement.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/pepe-price-targets-0-00001600-after-breaking-falling-wedge/,"TRADING|PEPE|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC","Price Analysis|Meme Coins",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:24:13,"Bitwise: Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, ETH and SOL won’t update ATHs this year","On June 30, 2025, a reputable asset management company, Bitwise, released a Mid-Year Scorecard document, containing predictions for the second half of the year and analyzing how correct they were about the first half of 2025 in December 2024. According to Bitwise, the Bitcoin price will reach $200,000, while ETH and SOL will not get new highs in the remainder of 2025. The document , penned by the Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and head of research Ryan Rasmussen, is the follow-up to the December 2024 text in which the authors made “bold predictions” about 2025. Now they analyze whether they were right or not and offer more predictions for the second half of 2025. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s, Ether’s, and Solana’s new all-time highs Bitcoin ETFs inflows growth, RWA tokenization hitting $50 billion, and other bets Reservations about some of the Bitwise predictions Bitcoin’s, Ether’s, and Solana’s new all-time highs In December 2024, Bitwise’s experts predicted that Bitcoin would reach $200,000 in 2025. They turned out to be correct that the BTC price will get a new all-time high. However, it was only $112,000 in May, not $200,000. The reasons for the growth cited by Bitwise include the strong ETF flows, hefty Bitcoin purchases by treasury companies, and the creation of the U.S. Bitcoin stockpile. Hougan and Rasmussen reaffirm their optimism on Bitcoin, saying they are still sure the first cryptocurrency is going to reach $200,000 by the end of the year, citing pro-crypto efforts of the Trump Administration 2.0, high institutional demand, and the rise of stablecoins as factors that will contribute to the BTC price growth. As for Ether and Solana reaching new ATHs in 2025, Bitwise experts reversed their expectations, saying that they are not that confident anymore. They see hope in stablecoin ETFs approvals and the rise of SOL and ETH treasury companies (which we don’t see yet). Bitcoin ETFs inflows growth, RWA tokenization hitting $50 billion, and other bets Bitwise predicted that 2025 will outperform 2024 in terms of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 2024 saw $35 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows. This year saw only $13 billion. Still, Bitwise experts are sure they were correct, as the number of platforms supporting Bitcoin ETFs keeps growing. As tokenization has actively been adopted in various countries throughout the first half of 2025, Bitwise experts confirm they still believe that the value of tokenized real-world assets (like real estate) will cross the $50 billion mark this year. During the first half of the year, this amount grew from $13 billion to $25 billion. In December 2024, Bitwise predicted that the number of countries holding Bitcoin would double, going from nine to 18. While it didn’t happen, Hougan and Rasmussen believe that Bitcoin accumulation by countries is happening in secret, and the trend of Bitcoin reserves will continue. In 2024, Hougan and Rasmussen claimed that the stablecoins’ AUM will reach $400 billion in 2025. Now, they believe that this amount was too high, however, according to them, the actual amount will be close as the GENIUS act adoption (for which they hope) and stablecoin boost by Mastercard with its 150 million merchants across the globe will propel stablecoins’ AUM up from the current $230 billion level. Read more: MoonPay and Mastercard partner to launch global stablecoin payments Bitwise admitted its mistake in betting that Coinbase would outperform Charles Schwab as the most valuable brokerage in 2025. Now, Bitwise claims such an outcome is unlikely. However, they turned out to be correct about predicting that Coinbase would enter the S&P 500 in 2025. Another prediction from 2024 that turned out to be a mistake, Bitwise recognized, is that the AI memecoin mania will continue in 2025 and will be even stronger than in 2024. Now Bitwise says with the downfall of LIBRA, Official Trump, and MELANIA, the memecoin and AI coin craze has taken a break. Reservations about some of the Bitwise predictions While Bitwise cites the D.C. efforts on clearing the way for cryptocurrencies in America as the factor that will push the BTC Price up, this path has been bumpy. Recently, crypto lobbyists in the administration failed to push crypto-friendly amendments to the “big, beautiful tax bill.” Earlier, a fierce battle between Republicans and Democrats surrounded the efforts to set a framework for stablecoin regulation. The creation of the Strategic Bitcoin reserve turned out to be such a disappointment for the crypto enthusiasts that it didn’t even ignite the market. While the reserve creation was declared, it meant only keeping bitcoins acquired through seizing. New purchases of bitcoins via budget money are forbidden, meaning that the reserve growth prospects are still unclear. On top of that, although the audit of the seized bitcoins was discussed, the government didn’t provide any results of that, leaving the general public in doubt whether over 200,000 bitcoins are actually owned by the U.S. and stored properly. He still hasn’t told us how much bitcoin the US government has and there has been zero move forward with any meaningful policy regarding BTC. — Rumple (@StilsonGR) July 1, 2025 The efforts of Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who advocated for spending money to buy at least 1,000,000 bitcoins for the strategic reserve, failed just like her work to include crypto-friendly tax cuts in the new bill. It’s hard to say if these facts overshadow all the positive steps, like the SEC dropping Biden-era cases against huge crypto companies and the general pro-crypto stance of the Trump Administration.

2025-07-03T13:15:30,"Pakistan’s subsidized Bitcoin mining power plan bumps into IMF redtape","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) rejected Pakistan’s proposal to offer discounted electricity rates to Bitcoin mining ventures and other energy‑intensive industries, raising concerns over potential market distortions, grid strain, and fiscal risks. The government has not yet finalized the plan, and is still seeking advice from international organisations, local reports said. The development was confirmed during the Senate Standing Committee on Power meeting, where Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan stated that the IMF has not approved the proposal. IMF raises some objections to Pakistan’s proposal The IMF raised a red flag about the plan, saying it may inflict more stress on the power sector. Dr. Irfan informed the committee that the agency is worried about market disruptions related to Pakistan’s plan for subsidized energy rates. This was after the IMF questioned Pakistan’s push for power in Bitcoin mining last month, warning of legal and power utilization issues. The global financial authority also listed several other concerns, such as the legality of mining crypto in Pakistan and further pressure on the overloaded power system. In addition, the fund cautioned about resource allocation and its impact on electricity prices. In May, Pakistan declared that it would dedicate 2,000MW of power to support crypto mining and data centers as a strategy to entice foreign investment. The Pakistan Crypto Council leads the initiative, with backing from the Finance Ministry. The IMF said Pakistan did not engage with the fund before announcing the plan. Meanwhile, Dr Irfan said that despite the IMF turning down the proposal earlier, the government is still negotiating with the regulatory body to revise its power subsidiary plan. Concerning the committee’s discussion, they also tackled the topic of technological measures that can help stop electricity theft. Notably, the government recently made a deal with scheduled banks to lower the amount of circular debt. This topic was also included in the committee’s discussion. Senator Shibli Faraz lamented that banks were “compelled at gunpoint” to give the loans. The committee has ordered the Power Division to provide detailed replies to address several issues at the next meeting. Pakistan plans power allocation for Bitcoin mining Earlier, Bilal Bin Saqib, the CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), announced that Pakistan intended to use some of its extra electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers . He then added that they discussed the situation with various mining companies. Pakistan’s power sector faces challenges, including higher electricity prices and an excess power-generating capacity. Solar power’s rapid growth has become even more confusing, as many consumers are looking at alternative energy sources to offset high utility costs. Saqib highlighted that the location of the mining center will be decided by the availability of surplus power in different areas. Interestingly, Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, was involved in this initiative. Reports revealed that Zhao acts as a strategic advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council. In May last year, the founder of Binance received a four-month prison sentence after admitting to breaking US money laundering laws at the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. His role in the Pakistan council included supporting blockchain infrastructure, providing regulatory framework advice, helping with national projects like digital currency and mining, and teaching young people about blockchain technologies. Saqib points out growing crypto adoption in Pakistan Saqib noted that the country has between 15 and 20 million crypto users, is the world’s third-largest freelancing economy, and has an expanding fintech sector. In a statement, he expressed that Pakistan ranks among the top 10 countries globally for crypto adoption , even though it has not been officially regulated. Meanwhile, concerning Pakistan’s finance ministry’s announcement that the country will provide 2,000 megawatts of electricity to support Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, this plan was part of Islamabad’s strategy to utilize its excess electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data facilities. In addition to attracting foreign investment, the ministry said the initiative was meant to turn excess electricity into a source of income and provide advanced job opportunities. This allocation marked the beginning of the first step of a bigger plan to develop digital infrastructure in several stages. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Strategy is facing a class action lawsuit alleging violations of U.S. federal securities laws, The Block reported. Lawsuit Shock to Bitcoin Bull Strategy! New York-based law firm Pomerantz LLP filed a class action lawsuit against MicroStrategy in the Eastern District Court of Virginia. The case in question covers investors from April 2024 to April 2025. Pomerantz alleges Strategy misled investors about its Bitcoin strategy and downplayed the risks. Pomerantz argues that Straetgy violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements about the profitability of its Bitcoin investment strategy. Pomerantz also alleges that Strategy did not properly disclose the full nature or extent of the impact of the new accounting standards (ASU 2023-08) on its financial statements and downplayed the risks to investors. At this point, the lawsuit states that Strategy had $5.9 billion in unrealized losses from digital assets due to the adoption of ASU 2023-08 in the first quarter of 2025, which caused the stock price to fall by more than 8%. This also caused losses to MSTR investors. Pomerantz said in the class action that he represents investors who invested in MicroStrategy from April of last year to this April, and added, “Other investors may also join the class action until July 15.” Strategy adopted a Bitcoin accumulation strategy in 2020 and currently holds the most BTC holdings among publicly traded companies with 597,325 BTC. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-03T13:10:46,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy hit with class-action lawsuit over $5.9 billion BTC loss","Strategy’s high-stakes bet on Bitcoin has earned praise across the industry, but that same bold mission may now be brewing legal troubles for the firm. A class-action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia is targeting the company and some of its top executives, including founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor. The suit represents investors who bought Strategy stock between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025, with plaintiffs alleging that the company misled shareholders about the risks and financial impact of its Bitcoin strategy. Since rebranding as a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” Strategy has continued to strengthen its bet on the crypto asset, steadily accumulating BTC ( BTC ) using corporate funds raised through debt, equity, and operating income as its main reserve asset. The firm also introduced bitcoin-focused financial metrics, such as BTC Yield and BTC Gain, to track the performance of its strategy. But trouble began after it adopted a new accounting rule. New Accounting Rules Expose Hidden Risks On January 1, 2025, Strategy adopted ASU 2023-08, a new accounting rule requiring companies to report the fair value of crypto assets. Under the new guideline, both unrealized gains and losses must now be included in its quarterly earnings. Before this change, Strategy used a more limited method where it only recorded losses if bitcoin’s price fell below the purchase price, and gains were not recognized unless the assets were sold. This allowed the company to avoid showing negative swings in BTC’s market price in its income statements, unless triggered by a sale or impairment. While Strategy told investors the new rule could impact results, the lawsuit alleges the company downplayed the scale of the risk, continuing to release bullish performance indicators like BTC Yield and BTC Gain without showing the full downside. You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy strengthens Bitcoin bet with 10,100 BTC purchase The impact came to light on April 7, 2025, when Strategy filed a report with the SEC revealing a $5.91 billion unrealized loss on its bitcoin holdings for the first quarter. The loss was tied to both the price drop in Bitcoin and the shift to fair value accounting and triggered an 8% drop in Strategy’s stock. Strategy confirmed the loss in its Q1 earnings report weeks later, stating that the company’s BTC holdings had to be marked down due to market volatility under the new accounting method. According to the complaint, the firm overstated the upside of its BTC holdings and failed to clearly warn investors about the risks, especially under the new accounting rules. It accuses the company of making false or misleading statements in violation of U.S. securities laws. The lawsuit now seeks to hold Strategy accountable and recover damages for investors who bought Strategy’s stock during the period. Despite the legal troubles, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with nearly 600,000 BTC still on its balance sheet, worth approximately $65 billion at current prices.

The announcement, as reported by Decrypt, signals a pivotal moment for industries often underserved by traditional finance. For years, crypto startups have grappled with the challenge of securing stable and compliant banking partners. Many traditional banks view the crypto space with caution due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks. This often leaves innovative companies in a precarious position, struggling to manage their finances, process transactions, and secure funding. Erebor’s establishment by a figure like Peter Thiel, known for his foresight and investment in disruptive technologies, suggests a deep understanding of these unique challenges and a commitment to providing tailored solutions. Understanding Erebor: Bridging the Gap for AI and Crypto Erebor is not just another bank; it’s designed with a specific mission: to fill the critical void left by the 2023 bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). SVB had, for decades, been a cornerstone for tech startups, including a significant number of crypto-tied businesses. Its collapse sent shockwaves through the industry, highlighting the fragility of relying on a single, albeit specialized, financial institution. Erebor’s commitment extends beyond just crypto. It aims to serve a broader spectrum of cutting-edge startups, encompassing: Artificial Intelligence (AI): As AI development accelerates, companies require robust financial infrastructure to support massive data processing, complex R&D, and rapid scaling. Cryptocurrency: From blockchain development firms to DeFi protocols and NFT platforms, these entities need banks that understand their unique operational models and regulatory nuances. Manufacturing: Modern manufacturing, especially those incorporating advanced robotics and automation, also demands specialized financial services that can keep pace with rapid innovation and supply chain complexities. This multi-sector focus positions Erebor as a comprehensive financial partner for the next generation of tech innovators, ensuring that vital AI tech funding and crypto startups banking needs are met with expertise and stability. The Legacy of SVB: Why a Dedicated Commercial Bank is Crucial The Silicon Valley Bank collapse served as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities within the tech banking ecosystem. For many startups, SVB was more than just a bank; it was an integral part of their operational fabric, offering not just deposits and loans but also networking opportunities and an understanding of the startup lifecycle. When SVB failed, many crypto and tech companies faced immediate liquidity crises, with some struggling to access their funds for days. This incident underscored the urgent need for financial institutions that are not only stable but also possess an inherent understanding of the unique risks and opportunities presented by nascent, high-growth industries. A commercial bank specifically designed for these sectors, like Erebor, can offer: Specialized Expertise: Staff who comprehend blockchain technology, AI algorithms, and the nuances of crypto regulations. Tailored Financial Products: Services designed for the fluctuating capital needs of startups, including venture debt, treasury management for digital assets, and international payment solutions. Regulatory Compliance Focus: A proactive approach to navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for crypto and AI, ensuring clients remain compliant. Risk Management: Strategies specifically adapted to the volatility and unique operational risks associated with digital assets and advanced technologies. Erebor’s inception, therefore, is a direct response to the lessons learned from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, aiming to build a more resilient and supportive financial backbone for the tech economy. Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities for Crypto Innovation While the establishment of Erebor is undoubtedly a positive development, it will face its own set of challenges and opportunities. Building trust within the crypto community, which has often felt alienated by traditional finance, will be paramount. Regulatory clarity, particularly in the US, remains an ongoing hurdle for any institution deeply involved with digital assets. However, the opportunities are immense. Erebor could become the go-to financial partner for a new wave of crypto innovation, providing the stability and specialized services that allow these companies to focus on building rather than worrying about their banking relationships. For startups, this means: Reduced Operational Friction: Less time spent navigating complex banking requirements, more time on product development. Enhanced Credibility: Partnering with a well-capitalized, dedicated commercial bank can lend legitimacy and attract further investment. Access to Capital: A bank that understands the growth trajectory of tech startups is better positioned to offer appropriate financing solutions. The success of Erebor will also hinge on its ability to adapt quickly to the rapidly evolving tech landscape, particularly in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and new AI paradigms. Beyond Banking: Erebor’s Potential Impact on the Tech Ecosystem The influence of a bank like Erebor could extend far beyond just financial transactions. By providing a stable and understanding banking environment, it could accelerate the growth of the entire tech ecosystem. When companies are confident in their financial infrastructure, they are more likely to innovate, expand, and create jobs. Peter Thiel’s involvement brings significant gravitas and a deep network within the tech and venture capital worlds. This could facilitate greater collaboration between startups, investors, and the banking sector, fostering an environment where groundbreaking ideas can truly flourish. Erebor could serve as a model for how specialized financial institutions can cater to niche, high-growth industries, potentially inspiring similar ventures globally. The focus on AI tech funding and secure crypto startups banking is not merely a business strategy; it’s a recognition of where the future of technology is headed and a proactive step to ensure that financial services do not become a bottleneck for innovation. A New Era of Financial Support for Innovators The launch of Erebor by Peter Thiel and other tech luminaries marks a significant milestone for the AI, crypto, and manufacturing sectors. It represents a direct response to the vulnerabilities exposed by the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, offering a specialized and understanding financial partner for the next generation of innovators. By providing stable banking services tailored to the unique needs of these industries, Erebor aims to unlock new opportunities, accelerate growth, and foster an environment where groundbreaking technologies can thrive. This initiative is more than just a new bank; it’s a testament to the belief in the transformative power of technology and the critical role of supportive financial infrastructure in bringing that future to fruition.

2025-07-03T13:08:37,"Pepe Coin price eyes 70% surge as whale accumulation rises","Pepe Coin price made a bullish breakout on Thursday, July 3, as cryptocurrencies bounced back and whale accumulation continued. Pepe ( PEPE ), the second-biggest Ethereum ( ETH ) meme coin, jumped to $0.0000107, its highest level since June 17. This rally coincided with the broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting $110,000 for the first time in weeks. Nansen data shows that PEPE’s price jump came amid increased whale accumulation, a sign that large holders expect further gains. Whales now hold 7.95 trillion tokens, representing a 5% monthly increase. The top 100 addresses have also expanded their holdings, now controlling 302.8 trillion coins, representing a 3.86% rise from the previous month. You might also like: Grayscale’s large-cap ETF conversion in limbo as SEC halts approval Additional data shows that the amount of PEPE tokens on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level in over two years. As of July 3, there were 246.96 trillion tokens held on exchanges, down from 254 trillion on the same day in June. Fewer tokens on exchanges typically indicate that investors are moving assets to self-custody, signaling long-term holding. Conversely, tokens are usually sent to exchanges when investors plan to sell, either to take profits or in anticipation of price declines. PEPE’s rally also followed Ethereum’s bullish breakout, as ETH retested the $2,600 resistance level. Since PEPE is an ERC-20 token, it often rallies in tandem with ETH. Notably, it surged in May when Ethereum climbed from $1,388 to $2,867. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that PEPE peaked at $0.00001625 in May before entering a bear phase throughout June. On the bright side, it bottomed at a key support level, aligning with the ascending trendline that connects the lowest points since March. PEPE has also formed a falling wedge pattern, a bullish continuation setup in technical analysis. This formation includes two downward-sloping, converging trendlines, with breakouts typically occurring as the lines approach convergence. Currently, PEPE is attempting to move above both the 50-day and 25-day exponential moving averages. If bullish momentum holds, the token could continue climbing toward the $0.00001625 resistance level, a more than 70% increase from current prices. However, a drop below the $0.0000080 support would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Where Could the New BTC Price Peak Be?","The post Bitcoin Surges Past $110K as ETF Inflows Increase—Is a New All-Time High Imminent? Where Could the New BTC Price Peak Be? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has reclaimed the $110,000 mark, posting a 3-week high after a sharp recovery from its June low near $58,000. The leading cryptocurrency has surged nearly 90% from that bottom, fueled by consistent ETF inflows and a broader risk-on shift in global markets. On the technical front, BTC has broken above key resistance at $108K, with bullish momentum supported by rising RSI and MACD crossover. Analysts now eye $115K as the next major target, provided macro tailwinds persist. ETF Inflows, Macroeconomic Tailwinds, etc., Add Momentum One of the primary drivers behind Bitcoin’s price spike is the continued inflow into the spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains a major contributor, consistently attracting large institutional investments. These steady inflows indicate growing confidence among traditional finance players, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a store of value and investment vehicle. Besides, the Macroeconomic factors are also playing a key role in boosting Bitcoin’s performance. Softer-than-expected ADP employment in the US has fueled expectations of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This prospect has encouraged a broader shift toward risk-on assets, with Bitcoin benefiting as a high-beta alternative investment. After $110K, Where Will Bitcoin Price Head Next? The BTC price surged past the $110K mark, reaching its highest level in the past three weeks. This bullish move comes amid a correction of strong institutional inflows and favorable macroeconomic developments that are reigniting risk appetite across financial markets. Now that the price is an inch close to its ATH, the investors continue to hold but not spend, which suggests they are confident of the upcoming price action. The daily chart of Bitcoin suggests the price has risen above the bearish influence as it surges above the resistance of the Gaussian Channel. It displayed a similar move during mid-April that resulted in a 20% upswing. Besides, the price is attempting to break above the pivotal resistance zone as it did and a successful breach could result in a new ATH for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. Moreover, the rising RSI from the average range hints towards the growing strength of the rally. Therefore, considering the current chart patterns and market conditions, the peak of the current Bitcoin (BTC) price rally could be somewhere around $125,000, which may be achieved during Q4, 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-surges-past-110k-as-etf-inflows-increase-is-a-new-all-time-high-imminent-where-could-the-new-btc-price-peak-be/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:00:00,"Why Doesn't the U.S. Have a Bitcoin Reserve, Yet?","President Donald Trump sent a rush of excitement through the crypto industry when he ordered his administration to get to work on setting aside cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment for the U.S. government. But there's been little to see from that effort, so far, and the officials behind the work seem to be suggesting the wait could be considerable. Trump's March directive to get started on the stockpile carried a now-expired deadline for the Treasury Department to figure out how to actually set up the reserves for the bitcoin and other crypto assets the government has at its disposal. By now, the administration is supposed to have a plan for the ""accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order,"" according to the president's directive, which called for two separate heaps of crypto — one for bitcoin only and the other for all other digital assets. Such a plan hasn't yet been revealed by Trump's chief crypto advisers, including Bo Hines, who pointed out last week that ""there's nothing in the [executive order] that mandates that report becomes public,"" Hines said of the document that was due in early May, though he added that the administration could ""choose to make it public at some point."" But Hines offered some update of the government-wide audit that aimed to figure out what assets the various federal agencies — including the U.S. Marshals Service — had gathered from civil and criminal seizures. ""They have received the numbers from the different entities inside the government,"" he told reporters at an event on Capitol Hill, referring to Trump's requirement that federal agencies report their crypto holdings to the Treasury by early April. ""Now the process begins in terms of establishing the reserve, the actual infrastructure behind it."" The executive order from Trump had affixed another federal stamp of approval on cryptocurrency after years of resistance from the previous administration and its regulators that viewed the field as prone to risk and recklessness that could endanger investors. The price of BTC has risen 25% since he issued the order. “President Trump’s proclamations have laid a powerful foundation, but now it’s time to move from vision to execution,"" said Hailey Miller, director of government relations at the Digital Chamber's Digital Power Network, in an email suggesting industry folks are standing by to help. ""The momentum is real. What we need now is coordinated follow-through.” With the administration playing its cards close to the vest, the clearest view is on the legislators who are trying to get bills done to ""operationalize"" the order, as directed by Trump. Senator Cynthia Lummis has taken a lead in the Senate with her Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act aimed at ""transforming the president’s visionary executive action into enduring law."" Turning the U.S. into an outsized bitcoin investor has been a project of the Wyoming Republican for a while now, and she thinks it's the answer to the nation's fiscal worries. But Lummis, who chairs a digital assets subcommittee in the Senate, and others in favor of the reserves understand that there are more urgent priorities in crypto legislation. Representative Nick Begich, an Alaska Republican pushing matching legislation in the House of Representatives, granted that the other crypto efforts to set up rules for the markets and stablecoins have to come first. ""But I'm very hopeful that after those are completed, we can turn the focus toward the BITCOIN Act and start having a serious discussion about why it's important for the United States to have a diversified reserves balance sheet that includes bitcoin,"" he said at a recent event in Washington. Because the market structure and stablecoin bills are on uncertain timelines , despite Trump's earlier ambition to get both done before Congress' lengthy August break, it's unclear how soon the lawmakers will have a window to consider the reserves. Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, put a new September 30 goal on his chamber's potential passage of the crypto market structure bill, but much depends on a House strategy for the two bills that hasn't yet emerged. Begich spoke of his House efforts as if he's still trying to get them off the ground, asking crypto insiders to help convince their members of Congress to co-sponsor the bill. Getting more sponsors ""sends a signal to committee leadership that this is something that has the potential to pass into law,"" he said. ""Having the support of the president is extremely important,"" Senator Lummis noted. ""So I'm hoping we can convince more in Congress to understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin."" While the president was clear that he doesn't want new taxpayer money spent to build crypto reserves, Trump's order called on the administration to find other ways to purchase digital assets. Hines said federal officials are already working on multiple ideas to rake in ""digital gold."" ""We are certainly keen on the idea of accumulation,"" he said. ""I think we'll begin moving very quickly on that."" The government has routinely been estimated to have about 200,000 bitcoin on-hand, though no further public accounting has yet emerged. The BITCOIN Act pushed by both Lummis and Begich would seek to buy about 5% of the global bitcoin supply — a million coins — over a five-year period, ""mirroring the size and scope of gold reserves held by the United States."" To do so, it would try to unlock some novel funding approaches to avoid hitting taxpayers. ""There are several mechanisms available for the acquisition of bitcoin,"" Begich said, including rewriting the rules of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to be able to acquire bitcoin and updating the modern market value of Federal Reserve gold certificates to leverage into bitcoin purchases. Begich maintained that the leading digital asset is not just a niche financial instrument but something the government needs to embrace as a mainstay. ""We like to talk about bitcoin as though it's somehow separate from the rest of the economy,"" he said. ""Bitcoin really is becoming an asset class that represents the economy."" One of the conceptual challenges of this digital ""strategic reserve"" is that the underlying idea for a buy-and-hold government investment means this stockpile isn't actually meant to be a strategic reserve in the traditional sense. Other nationally reserved commodities, such as oil, can be released when the nation has a special need. That's not the plan for bitcoin in the minds of Trump and his lawmaker allies. But as enthusiastic as they are, state lawmakers have jumped ahead of their federal counterparts in setting up state-based reserves. Trump's order seemed to act as a starting gun for efforts across the country to devote public money to crypto investing. As the federal government continues its work, states such as Texas are already building their stockpiles.

2025-07-03T12:58:40,"Here’s why Bitcoin and other cryptos are up today","Bitcoin and most crypto tokens are rising today, potentially signaling the beginning of a new crypto bull run. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged above the key resistance level of $110,000 for the first time in nearly a month. Similarly, most altcoins jumped, with Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Celestia ( TIA ) among the top performers. As a result, 24-hour trading volume across centralized and decentralized exchanges rose by over 30% to $133 billion, while the total market capitalization of all crypto assets increased by 3% to $3.4 trillion. Big Beautiful Bill hopes A likely catalyst for the rally is renewed optimism that the House of Representatives will pass Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill . The Senate approved its version earlier this week, and the White House is reportedly negotiating with holdouts in the House. The bill is seen as positive for Bitcoin, which has increasingly been viewed as a safe-haven asset. With the bill expected to significantly boost U.S. debt, many investors may turn to Bitcoin for protection, as predicted by BlackRock . In addition, the bill includes tax cuts, such as exemptions for tips and overtime pay. As seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, some of these savings could flow into the stock and crypto markets. You might also like: Why Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ bill is bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins Potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts Bitcoin and altcoins are also rallying on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year. Goldman Sachs analysts forecast cuts in September, November, and December, while Morgan Stanley predicts seven rate cuts in 2026. Crypto assets tend to perform well in falling rate environments. During the pandemic, Bitcoin and most altcoins soared to record highs as the Fed slashed rates to zero. Those gains were later erased in 2022 as interest rates rose sharply in response to inflation. Increased institutional interest Bitcoin and altcoins are gaining from growing institutional demand. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to attract inflows from U.S. investors. Bitcoin ETFs are nearing $50 billion in cumulative inflows, while Ethereum ETFs have surpassed $4.25 billion . Additionally, more companies are adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. Strategy, Mara, and MetaPlanet are among the most notable. In a note to crypto.news, Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB, said: “What’s particularly telling is the sustained institutional interest, especially from public companies purchasing Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For the third consecutive quarter, public companies have acquired more Bitcoin than ETFs have. This is a powerful signal of long-term conviction.” Regulatory clarity Finally, Bitcoin and altcoins are rallying amid growing regulatory clarity. The GENIUS Act is expected to become law in the United States, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently signaled a more supportive stance toward the decentralized finance sector. This shift could encourage more institutional and retail investors to enter the market.

2025-07-03T12:58:03,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – Billions in Retirement Funds Could Pour Into BTC as Pension Firms Rush to Add Exposure","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $109,600, gaining over 2.% in 24 hours following a notable vote of confidence from the UK pension sector. Cartwright Pension Trusts, a UK-based advisory firm, revealed it helped a client allocate 3% of its portfolio to BTCin late 2024. That investment has since returned 60% in under a year, outperforming most traditional asset classes. Importantly, Cartwright maintains no direct Bitcoin exposure, positioning itself as a neutral, data-driven advisor. Cartwright Pension Trusts is seeing rising interest from its clients after helping a UK pension fund allocate 3% to Bitcoin in 2024, yielding a 60% in November 2024—and according to Nasri, it secured a 60% return on investment in under 12 months pic.twitter.com/dhgIuST0Yi — The Crypto Utility Guy (@UtilityGuy7) July 2, 2025 To support this, Cartwright has launched its first “Annual Bitcoin Review,” a dedicated research report aimed at educating corporate treasurers, defined benefit schemes, and long-term investors about Bitcoin’s utility, volatility, and evolving macro relevance. “We see it as our fiduciary duty to raise awareness of Bitcoin’s impact on individuals, asset owners, and governments,” said Nasri. Cartwright has no direct BTC exposure, so they are a neutral, data-driven advisor. Sector Response: Cautious but Shifting While Cartwright’s move has drawn attention, the broader UK pension sector remains measured. Volatility is still a sticking point, with many funds hesitant to embrace crypto’s notorious price swings. But Nasri says that’s missing the bigger picture: “Portfolio construction should accommodate volatility, not avoid it.” He noted that interest in Bitcoin is expanding beyond pensions. Charities are exploring BTC as a donation vehicle, while corporate clients are assessing its use in 24/7 cross-border payments and as a treasury diversification tool. Nasri clarified that Bitcoin isn’t suitable for all investors—especially those with short time horizons—but called it a viable fit for long-term allocations, particularly within defined benefit and contribution plans. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Breakout Eyes $113,255 Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, supported by both fundamental and technical indicators. The asset has reclaimed the $108,600 level and is holding well above the 50-period EMA at $107,302. A rising trendline from June 23 remains intact, while price recently printed a bullish engulfing candle, signalling renewed upside strength. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Technical Signals: MACD: Crossed above zero with rising histogram Resistance: $110,413 (immediate), $111,778, $113,255 Support: $108,600 and $107,300 (EMA + trendline confluence) Beginner-Friendly Trade Setup: Buy Entry: Breakout above $110,413 or dip toward $108,600 Stop-loss: Below $107,100 Target 1: $111,778 Target 2: $113,255 Final Word Bitcoin’s latest rally isn’t just technical; it’s supported by growing institutional credibility. As traditional asset managers and pension advisors like Cartwright step in, the case for long-term Bitcoin exposure is becoming harder to ignore. With macro tailwinds and price action aligning, BTC looks ready to test higher levels into mid-July.

2025-07-03T12:56:44,"Solana Staking ETF Racks Up $33 Million Trading Volume On Wall Street Debut, Outperforming XRP Futures ETF Launch","The newly launched REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), the first crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the U.S., clocked an impressive $33 million in trading volume on the inaugural day. This product has notably blown away XRP futures ETFs as well as the Solana futures ETF that were introduced earlier this year. SOL Staking ETF Outperforms XRP And Solana Futures ETFs On Day 1 The first spot Solana staking ETF, which went live on Wednesday at market open, ended the day with $33 million in volume and $12 million in inflows, with Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas describing the launch as better than the average ETF listing. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, trading under the ticker SSK, offers investors direct exposure to spot Solana while earning staking yields without requiring technical expertise, making it the first crypto staking ETF to be approved in the US. While the volume was much lower than the launch of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETFs), Balchunas noted that the trading volume was much stronger than recent Solana futures ETF listings or the XRP futures ETFs debut. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1940516260875514325 It was a “healthy start to trading,” noted Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who observed that it had notched $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes. The price of SOL was hovering at $155.80 as of publication time, a 4.3% increase on the day, according to data from CoinGecko. The token, however, remains 47% below its January 2025 all-time high price of $293.31. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve several crypto-focused ETFs this year, Wednesday’s debut represents “a defining moment for digital assets and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem,” said Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, whose company is the staking and custodian partner for the REX-Osprey ETF. “Staking is the next chapter in the crypto ETF story. This launch marks a major step forward in giving institutions full access to the crypto ecosystem in a regulated package,” McCauley added. Meanwhile, Balchunas and Seyffary estimated a 95% chance that spot Solana ETFs will be approved for launch in 2025. “We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025,” Seyffart said on July 1, forecasting that spot XRP, Solana, and Litecoin products would be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission before the end of this year.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solana-staking-etf-racks-up-33-million-trading-volume-on-wall-street-debut-outperforming-xrp-futures-etf-launch/,"SOL|TRADING|XRP|BTC|EXCHANGE","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T12:51:31,"Top Analyst Highlights Key Confirmation Zone to Send XRP to $22-$27","EGRAG CRYPTO, a popular analyst, has shared an updated XRP/BTC chart, reinforcing a long-term bullish outlook grounded in precise technical levels. He referenced an older chart from 2023, which laid the foundation for Elliott Wave analysis. It emphasized the significance of XRP closing above a designated “Area of Confirmation” to validate the projected wave structure. At that time, the Area of Confirmation was defined within a horizontal range, and price targets were outlined in BTC pairings. The digital asset had also completed the first two waves of the Elliott Wave pattern and was about to start Wave 3 with a target of 0.00013582 BTC. Wave 5, the final bullish wave, would have seen the asset rise to 0.00027101 BTC. This target would have placed XRP between $7.5 and $13, assuming Bitcoin remains within the range of $28,000 to $48,000. The analysis assumed that surpassing the Area of Confirmation would provide conviction for the bullish structure to unfold as projected. #XRP / #BTC Area of Confirmation ( $22 – $27): OLD CHART: New Chart: If you understand how I calculated the $22–$27 target and how the measured move is unfolding, you could be one of the winners!

2025-07-03T12:50:35,"Bitcoin: South Korean Court’s Crucial Ruling Orders Return of Coinone Glitch Funds","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: South Korean Court’s Crucial Ruling Orders Return of Coinone Glitch Funds Imagine waking up to find extra Bitcoin in your crypto wallet, not through a successful trade, but due to a system glitch. Sounds like a dream, right? For some users of the South Korean crypto exchange Coinone in 2018, this was a reality. However, what started as an unexpected windfall has now culminated in a landmark legal battle, with a South Korean court ordering these users to return the excess funds. This ruling isn’t just about a few misplaced BTC; it’s a pivotal moment for digital asset law, highlighting the evolving responsibilities of both exchanges and their users. Bitcoin: A Landmark Legal Victory for Coinone? The recent civil appeal victory for South Korean crypto exchange Coinone marks a significant milestone in the nascent field of cryptocurrency law. In a ruling issued in May, a Seoul court mandated that users who received duplicate Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals due to a 2018 system error must return the excess cryptocurrency. This decision comes nearly six years after the incident, underscoring the long and complex legal journey involved in resolving disputes within the digital asset space. At the heart of the matter is the principle of “unjust enrichment,” a legal concept that prevents individuals from benefiting unfairly at the expense of another. While this principle is well-established in traditional finance, its application to volatile, decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin presents unique challenges. Coinone’s persistent pursuit of this case, culminating in a favorable appeal ruling, sets a strong precedent for how similar incidents might be handled in the future, not just in South Korea but potentially worldwide. The court’s decision effectively validates Coinone’s claim that these funds were obtained erroneously and were never rightfully the property of the users. This is a clear signal that even in the decentralized world of crypto, traditional legal frameworks can and will be applied to uphold fairness and prevent illicit gains from system malfunctions. Unpacking the 2018 Coinone Glitch: What Happened? The incident that triggered this legal saga occurred in October 2018. During this period, Bitcoin was trading on Coinone against the Korean won at approximately 7.08 million to 7.87 million won, which translated to roughly $5,200 to $5,800 per BTC. For context, this price range is a stark reminder of Bitcoin ‘s incredible journey, being about one-twentieth of its current market value. This significant price appreciation since 2018 adds another layer of complexity and financial magnitude to the court’s order. The BTC Glitch itself allowed some users to execute duplicate withdrawals of Bitcoin . While the exact technical details of the vulnerability were not extensively publicized, such incidents typically stem from issues like: Race Conditions: Where multiple withdrawal requests are processed simultaneously, leading to an unintended double execution before the system can update balances. Database Synchronization Errors: Discrepancies between different parts of the exchange’s database, allowing a withdrawal to be approved without the balance being correctly debited. Insufficient Transaction Locks: A failure to properly lock user accounts during withdrawal processes, enabling repeated requests to be processed against a single initial balance. Regardless of the precise technical cause, the outcome was clear: certain users received more Bitcoin than they were entitled to. At the time, the immediate reaction from the exchange would have been to identify the anomaly, freeze affected accounts, and attempt to recover the funds. However, the path to recovery often proves challenging, especially when users are reluctant to return what they perceive as found money. The fact that this case dragged on for so many years highlights the difficulty in enforcing such claims, particularly when the asset in question is highly liquid and easily transferable across various platforms and jurisdictions. It also emphasizes the importance of robust internal controls and immediate incident response protocols for all crypto exchange platforms. The South Korean Court’s Verdict: Setting a Precedent? The Seoul court’s May ruling is a critical development for the regulatory landscape of digital assets. By ordering the return of the erroneously withdrawn Bitcoin , the South Korean court has unequivocally affirmed that even in the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, traditional legal principles of ownership and unjust enrichment apply. This ruling sends a strong message: system glitches do not equate to legitimate ownership. Key aspects of the court’s decision likely centered on: Lack of Legal Basis for Possession: The court would have determined that the users had no legal right or basis to possess the duplicate BTC. Their acquisition was purely a result of a technical error, not a legitimate transaction. Unjust Enrichment: This core legal doctrine was undoubtedly central. It asserts that a person should not be allowed to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of another. The users benefited from Coinone’s error, thus enriching themselves without a valid cause. Identifiability of Funds: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, exchanges often have internal records linking user accounts to specific transactions. This internal traceability likely played a role in identifying the affected users and the amounts to be returned. This verdict is not merely a win for Coinone; it’s a significant step towards bringing greater clarity and accountability to the cryptocurrency market. It suggests that courts are increasingly willing and able to apply existing legal frameworks to resolve disputes involving digital assets, rather than viewing them as an entirely new class of property exempt from traditional law. This could serve as a powerful precedent for other jurisdictions grappling with similar issues, reinforcing the idea that digital assets, while innovative, are not beyond the reach of the law. For crypto exchange platforms globally, this ruling provides a legal anchor. It empowers them to pursue legal recourse against users who exploit system vulnerabilities or fail to return funds received in error. It also underscores the importance of having clear terms of service that explicitly address such scenarios and outline user obligations. Implications for Crypto Exchanges and User Responsibility The Coinone ruling carries profound implications for both crypto exchange platforms and their user base. For exchanges, the primary takeaway is the reinforcement of their right to reclaim funds lost due to technical errors. However, this right comes with a parallel emphasis on their responsibility to maintain robust, secure systems. For Crypto Exchanges: Enhanced Security Measures: The incident serves as a stark reminder of the critical need for continuous investment in cybersecurity, rigorous testing, and real-time monitoring to prevent and detect system vulnerabilities. Clear Terms of Service (ToS): Exchanges should ensure their ToS explicitly state user obligations regarding erroneously received funds, outlining the consequences of non-compliance. This provides a legal basis for recovery efforts. Prompt Incident Response: Rapid detection, isolation of the issue, and immediate communication with affected users are crucial to mitigate damage and facilitate recovery. Legal Preparedness: Exchanges must be prepared to pursue legal action to recover funds, demonstrating that they will not tolerate unjust enrichment at their expense. For Crypto Users: No “Finders Keepers”: The ruling firmly rejects the notion that funds received due to an exchange glitch are free money. Users are legally obligated to return such funds. Ethical Responsibility: Beyond legal obligations, there’s an ethical imperative to report and return erroneously received assets. Failure to do so can lead to legal action, as seen in this case, and potentially severe financial penalties. Understanding Terms and Conditions: Users should thoroughly read and understand the terms of service of any crypto exchange they use, particularly clauses related to system errors and fund recovery. The Long Arm of the Law: Even after years, and despite the decentralized nature of crypto, legal systems can and will pursue claims for unjust enrichment. The significant appreciation of Bitcoin since 2018 means that the financial burden on users ordered to return funds now is far greater than if they had returned them immediately. This case highlights the growing maturity of the crypto market. As it integrates more deeply into the traditional financial and legal systems, participants must understand that established laws will apply, regardless of the innovative nature of the underlying technology. Beyond the Glitch: The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation The Coinone case is but one example of the increasing formalization of the cryptocurrency space, particularly in countries like South Korea, which has been at the forefront of crypto adoption and regulation. The consistent application of existing laws to novel digital assets reflects a global trend towards greater regulatory clarity and oversight. South Korea has a complex but evolving regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Initially, there were strict bans on initial coin offerings (ICOs), but the country has since moved towards a more comprehensive approach, including licensing requirements for crypto exchange platforms and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. This commitment to regulating the space is driven by a desire to protect investors, prevent financial crimes, and foster a stable environment for innovation. Globally, regulators are grappling with similar questions: How do we classify digital assets (securities, commodities, property)? How do we protect consumers from scams and operational failures? How do we ensure financial stability in a rapidly evolving market? How do we prevent the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities? The Coinone ruling, specifically concerning the ownership and recovery of Bitcoin obtained through error, contributes to this evolving legal tapestry. It provides a concrete example of how courts are interpreting digital asset ownership within existing legal frameworks, adding to the growing body of case law that will ultimately shape future regulations. As the market matures, we can expect more such rulings, further defining the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the crypto ecosystem. This continuous legal refinement is crucial for fostering trust and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Platforms In light of the Coinone verdict, both individuals and entities operating within the cryptocurrency space should take proactive steps to safeguard their interests and ensure compliance. For Individual Crypto Users: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory changes and significant court rulings in your jurisdiction and those of the exchanges you use. Review Exchange Terms: Always read the terms and conditions of any crypto exchange carefully. Understand their policies on glitches, errors, and fund recovery. Report Errors Immediately: If you ever receive funds in error, report them to the exchange immediately. Document your communication. This not only fulfills your legal and ethical obligation but can also protect you from future legal action. Do Not Assume “Free Money”: The Coinone case clearly demonstrates that funds received due to a glitch are not yours to keep. Attempting to profit from such errors can lead to severe legal and financial repercussions. Practice Self-Custody for Long-Term Holdings: While exchanges offer convenience, consider moving significant long-term Bitcoin holdings to a personal hardware wallet. This reduces reliance on exchange security and minimizes exposure to exchange-specific operational risks. For Crypto Exchange Platforms: Invest Heavily in Security Audits: Regular, independent security audits are paramount to identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Implement Robust Monitoring Systems: Real-time anomaly detection systems can flag unusual transactions or balances, allowing for immediate intervention. Develop Clear Recovery Protocols: Have a well-defined plan for how to handle system errors, including communication strategies, fund freezing procedures, and legal recourse options. Educate Your Users: Proactively inform users about their responsibilities regarding erroneously received funds through clear communication channels and user agreements. Collaborate with Regulators: Engage constructively with regulatory bodies to help shape fair and effective legal frameworks for the digital asset industry. This proactive approach can lead to more predictable outcomes in future disputes. The Coinone ruling is a powerful reminder that the crypto world, while innovative, is not immune to the laws that govern traditional finance. Adhering to best practices and understanding legal obligations are essential for sustainable growth and maintaining trust within the ecosystem. The South Korean court ‘s decisive ruling in the Coinone Bitcoin glitch case serves as a critical juncture in the evolution of cryptocurrency law. It firmly establishes that the principles of unjust enrichment apply to digital assets, underscoring the legal responsibilities of users who receive funds in error and the rights of exchanges to reclaim them. As the crypto market continues its journey towards mainstream adoption, such legal precedents are vital for fostering a more secure, predictable, and trustworthy environment for all participants. This case is a stark reminder that while technology moves fast, the wheels of justice, though sometimes slow, will ultimately turn to ensure fairness and accountability in the digital realm.

2025-07-03T12:44:21,"Russian insurance firms launch life policies tied to Bitcoin ETFs","Russian companies are offering investment insurance policies tied to the value of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The new products expand crypto investment opportunities in Russia that have been growing since its central bank permitted the offering of derivatives based on decentralized digital assets. Russian insurers offer policies linked to American Bitcoin ETFs Two insurance firms, Renaissance Life and BKS Life Insurance, have announced crypto-related investment products on the Russian market, the Bits.media news outlet revealed on Wednesday. Renaissance Life is launching a Bitcoin-linked life insurance policy under its “Cryptocapital” program. It will provide up to 60% return on the growth of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of Bitcoin (BTC). The policy is valid for two years with a minimum down payment of 1.5 million Russian rubles ($19,000), the report detailed. If a client invests that amount and the value of Bitcoin doubles during the period, they will eventually receive 2.4 million rubles (over $30,000) before tax, explained Oleg Kiselev, the company’s chief executive. And if the value of the cryptocurrency falls below the amount of the down payment, the investor will get 1.5 million rubles back, the CEO promised. Investors will have to spend at least 3 million rubles ($38,000) for the three-year policy linked to Bitcoin ETF futures that BKS Life Insurance is offering. Holders will be able to adjust the share of an asset included in the policy’s investment portfolio throughout the entire period, depending on market conditions. The unique crypto products will be available to qualified investors by the end of the year, the Russian companies said. Moscow Exchange to expand crypto futures offerings The yield of the new investment life insurance policies is linked to the growth of the shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) through futures contracts traded on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX). Russia’s largest stock market started trading Bitcoin futures last month, shortly after the Central Bank of Russia authorized the sale of crypto derivatives to “ highly qualified investors ” in late May. Its initial offering is based on IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF by capital under management. The fund holds an estimated $70 billion in BTC, accounting for more than half of the capital of all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. Later in June, the Russian platform announced it would offer a new futures contract on its own recently introduced Moscow Exchange PFI Bitcoin Index (MOEXBTC), calculated using price data from some of the largest global crypto exchanges. This week, the Managing Director of the Moscow Exchange, Maria Patrikeeva, revealed that the exchange is preparing to increase the number of listed crypto investment products. The executive explained that Russia’s current regulations allow the launch of derivative financial instruments using cryptocurrency-linked securities as underlying assets and elaborated: “These instruments are in demand by both professional market participants and qualified investors. Besides the futures contract on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, we may consider other funds, for example, BlackRock’s ETF on Ether.” Patrikeeva highlighted that the contract on IBIT is already among the top 30 offerings on the Russian futures market. Since its launch on June 4, the product has already reached a daily trading volume of 1 billion rubles ($12.7 million). The MOEX official insisted that the exchange intends to play an active role in the future development of the Russian market for this new class of crypto-related assets within the country’s existing regulatory framework. Financial authorities in Moscow, namely the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, have stubbornly maintained that only qualified investors should have access to cryptocurrencies and their derivatives. However, according to a recent estimate , Russians already hold over $25 billion in crypto. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , T oncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases over the past 24 hours. Donald Trump’s Crypto Ventures Have Made Him $620M Richer US President Donald Trump has reportedly added $620 million to his wealth, thanks to his connections with several ventures in the crypto industry. According to a report, Trump’s crypto holdings represented a sizable portion of his wealth, largely due to windfalls from his family-backed crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, and his personal TRUMP memecoin. However, a bulk of Trump’s net worth is consolidated in his media venture, Trump Media and Technology Group, and other real estate ventures. As of June, crypto accounted for only 9% of President Trump’s wealth. Trump and his sons reportedly earned $390 million through token sales at World Liberty Financial. They also collectively own $2 billion in WLF tokens. World Liberty Financial also netted $100 million after a $2 billion deal, which saw the Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX use the USD1 stablecoin to settle an investment in Binance. Nasdaq, S&P 500 Climb As Rate Cut Hopes Return Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose sharply, while the Dow Jones fell, on positive news about US trade deals and a weak labor market. The Dow Jones fell 40 points or 0.10% while the S&P 500 rose 0.33%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq registered the highest increase, rising 0.78%, with markets hopeful for a rate cut sooner than expected. Optimism about a rate cut increased after US President Donald Trump claimed he had reached a preliminary trade deal with Vietnam, stating that US imports to the country would be tariff-free and Vietnamese imports to the US would be subject to a 20% tariff. The US also plans to impose a 40% duty on transshipping to block tariff evasion by other countries. Progress in trade talks increases the likelihood of a rate cut. Weak employment figures from payroll processing firm ADP contribute to this narrative. ADP data revealed that the private sector lost over 33,000 jobs in June, missing the expected rise of 100,000. If the weak job market persists, the Fed may cut interest rates, benefiting growth stocks like Tesla. Malaysian Regulator To Ease Crypto Asset Listing Process The Securities Commission of Malaysia (SC) is seeking public feedback on a proposal to allow crypto exchanges to list specific digital assets without obtaining explicit approval from the regulator. According to reports, the regulator is considering liberalizing the framework for listing digital assets meeting specific criteria on exchanges. The commission stated in an announcement, “This aims to accelerate time-to-market, increase [crypto exchange] operator accountability and widen product offerings.” Under the new rules, the exchange would be accountable for its decision to list a specific asset. Listed assets must have undergone stringent security audits, with the results made publicly available. They must also have traded for at least one year on a Financial Action Task Force-compliant platform. The SC is also seeking industry input regarding certain assets that it considers high risk and whether they should be permitted for trading. “The lack of transparency aspect in certain digital assets appeals to individuals involved in unlawful conduct, which may result in the increased risk of money laundering and terrorism financing.” Coinbase Continues Shopping Spree, Acquires Token Management Platform Liquifi Coinbase has completed the acquisition of Liquifi, a token management platform focused on early-stage tokenization projects. The acquisition is Coinbase’s fourth this year, coming shortly after its $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit, one of the world’s largest crypto derivatives trading platforms, in May. Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, Greg Tusar, stated, “Acquiring Liquifi gives us best-in-class capabilities in token cap table management, vesting, and compliance, and positions Coinbase to support builders earlier in their journey.” Tusar believes the acquisition will help Coinbase address the complexities of token launches by on-chain builders, including fragmented legal, tax, and compliance hurdles, regulatory obstacles, and more. Tusar added, “We want to remove these barriers by providing both the product and the expertise to make token launches simple, compliant, and scalable. Liquifi solves these pain points by automating core workflows while reducing token launch risk. This acquisition will enable us to partner more effectively with builders earlier in their lifecycle — before tokens are launched or listed.” Ripple Seeks National Bank License Ripple has applied for a national bank license in the US, a move that would bring the firm under federal and state regulatory oversight. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the firm had formally applied for a national bank charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The application has already been acknowledged by the regulator and is viewed as a significant step for the regulator as it seeks to deepen its role in the stablecoin sector in the US through its RLUSD token. Garlinghouse also revealed that Ripple had applied for a Federal Reserve Master Account through its subsidiary, Standard Custody. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) rose nearly 3% on Wednesday as market sentiment turned bullish. The flagship cryptocurrency is pushing towards $110,000, having crossed $109,000 during the ongoing session. Macro catalysts are stacking up, with a mix of high-volume flows, geopolitical headlines, and ETF tailwinds pushing BTC higher. BTC added nearly $2,900 to its value on July 2, rising from $106,300 to $109,700 before settling around $109,600. The jump was backed by a sharp increase in trading volume, which rose to $52.6 billion. The spoke places BTC less than 3% shy of its all-time high of $111,970. The jump in volume indicates buyers are committing capital to BTC, which accounted for 45% of all trading activity on Wednesday. BTC’s latest rally coincides with a rare convergence of liquidity, policy expectations, and shifting investor behavior. Standard Chartered reiterated its prediction for BTC to hit $135,000 by Q3 and $200,000 by the end of the year, citing a “new flow regime.” According to the bank’s global head of research, Geoffrey Kendrick, ETF inflows, corporate treasury buys, and sovereign accumulation are dominant price drivers during the current market. Institutional investors added 245,000 BTC in Q2, with several public companies increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Analysts expect the demand to accelerate through Q3 and Q4, as passive ETF allocations deepen. Technical indicators suggest a major breakout is underway, as the flagship cryptocurrency sets its sights on a new all-time high. BTC traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping 1.17% on Saturday and plunging below $100,000 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. The price fell to an intraday low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,985. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66%, crossing the moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,137. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 1.19% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,980. Source: TradingView BTC recovered to register marginal increases on Friday and Saturday, reclaiming $107,000 and settling at $107,339. BTC continued pushing higher on Sunday, rising almost 1% to cross $108,000 and settle at $108,350. However, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,167.

Buyers have retained control during the ongoing session, with ETH up 1% as it looks to surpass $2,600. ETH was exhibiting limited upward momentum as it struggled to cross $2,500.

ETH traded in the red over the previous weekend, dropping 4.56% on Saturday and nearly 3% on Sunday, as it fell to a low of $2,119 before reclaiming $2,200 and settling at $2,229.

As a result, it fell to $2,415, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView ETH recovered to register marginal increases on Friday and Saturday, rising 0.34% and 0.57% to settle at $2,437.

The fund exposes investors to SOL along with staking yields, making it the first crypto staking ETF to be approved in the US. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated, “First spot Solana staking ETF is officially live. Healthy start to trading for a new ETF with ~$8 million in trading in the first 20 min.” The analyst also commented on the ETF’s impressive first-day volumes, stating it “blows away Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs.

2025-07-03T12:40:33,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Amazing $407.77M Inflows: A Bullish Signal","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Amazing $407.77M Inflows: A Bullish Signal The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with exciting news! On July 2, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a truly amazing milestone: a staggering $407.77 million in total net inflows. This significant surge isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of burgeoning confidence and growing appetite for digital assets among investors. If you’ve been watching the crypto market, this figure signals a robust and positive shift, highlighting how mainstream financial vehicles are increasingly embracing Bitcoin. Let’s dive deeper into what this means for the future of crypto investment and the broader digital asset landscape. Understanding the Surge in Bitcoin Inflows The recent influx of capital into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. According to insights shared by Trader T on X, July 2 saw a combined net inflow of $407.77 million, showcasing a strong rebound in investor sentiment. This isn’t just about a single fund; it’s a broad-based movement across several prominent players in the ETF space. Leading the charge was Fidelity’s FBTC, which alone pulled in an impressive $183.96 million in net inflows. This demonstrates a clear preference and trust among investors for Fidelity’s offering. Following Fidelity, other significant contributors to these remarkable Bitcoin Inflows included ARK Invest’s ARKB, securing $83 million, and Bitwise’s BITB, which attracted $64.94 million. Even Grayscale, whose GBTC fund initially saw outflows post-conversion, managed to pull in $34.56 million, alongside its mini BTC fund adding another $16.53 million. This suggests a potential shift in sentiment even for Grayscale, as investors might be re-evaluating their positions or new capital is entering the space. Invesco’s BTCO contributed $9.85 million, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC and VanEck’s HODL also reported positive inflows of $9.51 million and $5.42 million, respectively. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day further underscores the concentrated nature of these positive movements within the top-performing funds. These inflows are crucial because they represent fresh capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem through regulated and accessible financial products. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of self-custody or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. This ease of access is a major driver behind the growing appeal of these funds, particularly for traditional investors and institutions. Why are Digital Asset ETFs Attracting So Much Capital? The substantial capital flowing into Digital Asset ETFs , particularly those tracking Bitcoin, is a testament to several evolving market dynamics. Firstly, regulatory clarity plays a monumental role. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided a stamp of legitimacy that many institutional and retail investors were waiting for. This regulatory green light has significantly reduced perceived risks, making these products more appealing for traditional investment portfolios. It signals that Bitcoin, once considered a fringe asset, is increasingly being integrated into mainstream finance. Secondly, the inherent simplicity and familiarity of the ETF structure are powerful attractors for Crypto Investment . Investors are accustomed to buying and selling ETFs through their brokerage accounts, integrating them seamlessly into existing investment strategies. This bypasses the need to understand complex blockchain technology, set up digital wallets, or manage private keys – barriers that previously deterred many potential investors. This convenience factor opens the floodgates for a broader range of participants, from large financial institutions to individual retail investors looking for diversified exposure to the digital asset space. Furthermore, the current macroeconomic environment and the narrative around Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge continue to resonate with investors. As traditional markets face uncertainties, many are seeking alternative assets that offer potential for significant returns or act as a store of value. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, fits this narrative perfectly. The ability to access this asset through a regulated ETF provides a safe and familiar conduit for this increasingly popular investment thesis. The competitive fee structures among the various ETF providers also contribute to their attractiveness, as funds vie for investor capital by offering more favorable terms. The Impact of Institutional Adoption on Bitcoin The consistent and significant inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a clear indicator of accelerating Institutional Adoption . When large entities like Fidelity, ARK Invest, and Grayscale see substantial net inflows, it signifies that major financial players, hedge funds, wealth managers, and even corporate treasuries are actively allocating capital to Bitcoin. This level of institutional participation brings several profound implications for the Bitcoin market: Increased Liquidity and Stability: Large institutional orders can absorb market volatility and provide deeper liquidity, potentially leading to more stable price movements over time. Their long-term investment horizons often reduce short-term speculative trading. Validation and Credibility: The involvement of established financial institutions lends immense credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. It moves Bitcoin further away from its early, often speculative, reputation and solidifies its position as a legitimate investment vehicle. Supply-Demand Dynamics: As institutions accumulate Bitcoin through ETFs, it creates a persistent demand pressure on the underlying asset. Given Bitcoin’s finite supply, sustained institutional buying could lead to upward price pressure in the long run, as more Bitcoin is effectively taken off the open market and held within these funds. Broader Market Acceptance: The success of these ETFs encourages other financial institutions to explore similar offerings or integrate digital assets into their services, further normalizing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system. This trend of Institutional Adoption is not merely about price; it’s about the maturation of the entire digital asset ecosystem. It signifies a fundamental shift in how the world views and interacts with cryptocurrencies, moving from niche interest to a recognized component of global finance. As more institutions gain exposure, the infrastructure supporting digital assets will likely continue to evolve and strengthen, paving the way for even greater integration and innovation. Navigating Your Crypto Investment Journey with ETFs For those looking to embark on or expand their Crypto Investment journey, the rise of Digital Asset ETFs presents a compelling, yet nuanced, opportunity. While the recent inflows paint a bullish picture, it’s essential for investors to approach these products with a clear understanding of both their advantages and inherent risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Understand the Underlying Asset: Even though you’re investing in an ETF, its performance is directly tied to Bitcoin. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and volatility is crucial. Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, and ETFs will reflect this. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin is a significant player, a balanced investment portfolio typically includes diversification across various asset classes. Consider how a Bitcoin ETF fits into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Research ETF Providers: Not all ETFs are created equal. Research the specific provider (e.g., Fidelity FBTC, ARK Invest ARKB, Bitwise BITB) in terms of their fee structure, liquidity, and how closely their ETF tracks the underlying Bitcoin price. The minor differences in expense ratios can add up over time. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors, including regulatory news, technological advancements, and global economic trends. Staying updated on these developments will help you make informed decisions regarding your US Spot Bitcoin ETFs holdings. Follow reputable news sources and analysts. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment in Bitcoin ETFs is for short-term speculation or long-term growth. While the daily inflows are exciting, true wealth creation often comes from a patient, long-term approach to investing. These ETFs offer a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. They democratize access to Bitcoin for millions of investors who might otherwise be hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. However, like any investment, due diligence and a clear strategy are paramount to navigating the opportunities and challenges effectively. In conclusion, the astounding $407.77 million in net inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 2 is more than just a daily statistic; it’s a resounding affirmation of growing confidence in Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market. This surge, led by prominent funds like Fidelity’s FBTC, underscores a significant trend towards Institutional Adoption , driven by increased regulatory clarity and the inherent accessibility of these investment vehicles. As Bitcoin Inflows continue to shape market dynamics, the long-term outlook for Crypto Investment through regulated products appears increasingly robust. This marks an exciting chapter in the journey of digital assets, solidifying their place within the global financial ecosystem and paving the way for further innovation and mainstream integration. The future looks bright for Bitcoin and the innovative ways investors are engaging with it.

Nonfarm payrolls grew 147,000 last month, according to a report Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts had been for job growth of 110,000. That's also modestly up from May job growth of 144,000 (revised from an originally reported 139,000). The unemployment rate for June was 4.1% versus an expected 4.3% and 4.2% in May. The price of bitcoin (BTC) dipped modestly in the minutes following the report's release to just under $109,000. Bitcoin had been on a steady climb higher in the days ahead of the report, topping $110,000 for the first time in about one month just hours ago. U.S. stock index futures rose modestly after the data, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 each ahead by about 0.3%. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked nine basis points to 4.36%. Market participants are closely monitoring economic data for signals about the Federal Reserve’s next move. While there's been some chatter from at least a couple of Fed officials about a July rate cut, Chairman Jerome Powell has remained insistent that the economy is in a good spot and the central bank can thus stay patient as it considers the need for monetary ease. This stance has put him directly at odds with President Trump, who has been equally insistent that the Fed needs to cut now and in a sizable way. Prior to the Thursday morning data, traders had placed 75% odds that the Fed would hold steady at its next meeting in late July, according to CME FedWatch . At the subsequent meeting in September, however, traders are pricing in a 95% chance of one or more 25 basis point rate cuts. Fifteen minutes following the news, the odds for holding steady in July had soared to 95% and the chances of a September move had declined to 78%. Checking other report details, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in June versus expectations for 0.3% and May's 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 3.7% against forecasts for 3.9% and May's 3.8%. Today's employment report was released a day early due to the July 4 holiday weekend, with the NYSE and Nasdaq closing at 1 p.m. ET and bond markets at 2 p.m. ET Thursday, while all U.S. markets will remain shut on Friday. Weekly initial jobless claims were released as well on Thursday and are also showing strength, dipping to 233,000 from last week's 237,000 and forecasts for 240,000.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/03/us-added-147k-jobs-in-june-topping-110k-forecast-unemployment-rate-unexpectedly-falls-to-41,"MARKET|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS","Markets|Jobs|Bitcoin|Federal Reserve|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T12:30:48,"Buy Bitcoin Before Jackson Hole—Or Regret It Forever, Says Arthur Hayes","Arthur Hayes has published a new essay, “Quid Pro Stablecoin,” arguing that the United States’ sudden political enthusiasm for bank-issued stablecoins is less about “financial freedom” and more about arming the Treasury with a multi-trillion-dollar “liquidity bazooka.” The former BitMEX chief—writing in his personal newsletter—contends that investors who postpone buying Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing will serve as “exit liquidity” for those who bought earlier. How The Money Printer Is Already Warming Up At the core of Hayes’ thesis is the claim that eight “too-big-to-fail” banks hold roughly $6.8 trillion in demand and time deposits that can be transformed into on-chain dollars. Once customers migrate from legacy accounts to bank stablecoins—he cites JPMorgan’s forthcoming “JPMD” token as the template—those deposits become collateral that can be recycled into Treasury bills. “Adoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power,” he writes, adding that the product simultaneously slashes compliance overhead because “an AI agent trained on the corpus of relevant compliance regulations can perfectly ensure that certain transactions are never approved.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Hayes layers a second mechanism on top of the stablecoin flow. If Congress strips the Federal Reserve of its ability to pay interest on reserve balances—a proposal floated by Senator Ted Cruz—banks would have to replace that lost income by buying short-dated Treasuries. He estimates the policy could “liberate another $3.3 trillion of inert reserves,” bringing the prospective fire-power for government debt purchases to $10.1 trillion. “This $10.1 trillion liquidity injection will act upon risky assets in the same way Bad Gurl Yellen’s $2.5 trillion injection did… PUMP UP THE JAM!” Hayes asserts. The essay frames the bipartisan GENIUS Act as the legislative linchpin. By barring non-banks from issuing interest-bearing stablecoins, Washington “hands the stablecoin market to banks,” ensuring that fintech issuers such as Circle cannot compete at scale and that deposit flight is funneled into the institutions most likely to bankroll the Treasury. Hayes calculates that the cost savings and enhanced net-interest margins could increase the combined market capitalisation of the big banks by more than 180 percent, a trade he describes as “non-consensus” but executable “in SIZE.” Buy Bitcoin Before The Fed Blinks Despite his long-term enthusiasm, Hayes cautions that a temporary liquidity drain looms once Congress passes what he labels Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” Refilling the Treasury General Account to its $850 billion target could contract dollar liquidity by nearly half a trillion dollars, an impulse he believes may knock Bitcoin back toward the mid-$90,000s and keep prices range-bound until the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole conference in late August. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases “I believe that between now and the August Jackson Hole Fed speech to be given by beta cuck towel bitch boy Jerome Powell, the market will trade sideways to slightly lower. If the TGA refill proves to be dollar liquidity negative, then the downside is $90,000 to $95,000. If the refill proves to be a nothingburger, Bitcoin will chop in the $100,000s without a decisive break above the $112,000 all-time-high,” Hayes writes. The punchline, however, is resolutely bullish. Hayes ridicules advisers steering clients into bonds on the premise that yields will fall: “If you’re still waiting for Powell to whisper ‘QE infinity’ in your ear before you go risk-on, congrats — you’re the exit liquidity. Instead go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.” In his view, the political machinery that props up US deficits has already selected bank stablecoins as the next round of stealth quantitative easing, and Bitcoin—alongside JPMorgan stock—is positioned to absorb the spill-over. Hayes signs off with a stark imperative: “Don’t sit on the sidelines waiting for Powell to bless the bull market.” The liquidity horse, he argues, has already bolted; investors who hesitate to buy Bitcoin risk being trampled beneath it. “You will miss out on Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million,” he concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $109,449.
