2025-07-02T21:54:32,"These Bullish Catalysts Could Spark Bitcoin’s Explosion To $200,000 By Year-End: Standard Chartered Exec","British multinational bank Standard Chartered has forecasted massive gains for Bitcoin, predicting a potential rocket surge to $200,000 in the second half of this year. Historically, Bitcoin has slumped months after the halving, a quadrennial event that slows the growth rate in top crypto’s supply. This time, growing ETF inflows and increased corporate treasury buying are expected to kill that pattern, according to Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. Bitcoin Halving Cycle Is Dead Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick told clients in a Wednesday report that the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle “is dead.” While the two previous halving cycles in 2016 and 2020 resulted in Bitcoin prices sinking in roughly 18 months after the halving, the impact of the latest Bitcoin halving in April 2024 will likely be different. Although he believes the maiden crypto will likely defy historical post-halving patterns, he warned it won’t all be smooth sailing. “We think prices could be choppy in late Q3 and early Q4 amid concerns about this pattern being repeated,” Kendrick said. “However, we expect prices to resume their uptrend, supported by continued strong ETF and Bitcoin treasury buying.” The analyst ultimately expects Bitcoin to reach $135,000 by September 30, and doubled down on his $200,000 target for December 31. Bitcoin Headed For “Best Ever” Second Half Of The Year: Standard Chartered Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and treasury buyers snapped up a total of 245,000 BTC during the second quarter. Kendrick forecasts that figure will be surpassed in the coming months as allocations continue and an increasing list of public companies emulate Strategy’s BTC acquisition playbook. The banker observed that both the BTC treasury company demand and spot ETFs were missing in all the prior halving cycles. As such, he believes Bitcoin is on course to set a record above its previous record high of $111,814, set on May 22. “Bitcoin to print new all-time highs in H2,” Kendrick stated. Michael Saylor’s Strategy popularized the Bitcoin treasury strategy, pivoting from its software development focus in late 2020. The Nasdaq-listed firm, which has been buying BTC almost every week over the last year, now owns 597,325 Bitcoin worth around $65 billion based on current market prices. Kendrick also cited macro tailwinds, including a possible early announcement by President Donald Trump naming a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the passage of the landmark GENIUS stablecoin legislation , as other catalysts that could fuel further upside for Bitcoin, the report added. Bitcoin was trading hands at around $109,420 as of publication time after gaining 3.3% over the last 24 hours. It’s trading 1.9% above where it was a week ago, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/these-bullish-catalysts-could-spark-bitcoins-explosion-to-200000-by-year-end-standard-chartered-exec/,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T21:50:58,"Trump Family Rakes In $620M+ From Crypto: Meme coin Windfall, Token Sales, and a 20% Bitcoin Stake","U.S. President Donald Trump and his family have reportedly earned over $620 million from recent cryptocurrency ventures. A report published Wednesday by Bloomberg stated that Trump’s crypto holdings now make up around 9% of his estimated $6 billion fortune as of June. This marks the first time digital assets have accounted for a sizable portion of his wealth. Trump’s Crypto Empire Grows as Real Estate Shrinks to 50% of Net Worth The increase is largely tied to his family-backed firm, World Liberty Financial, and the launch of his personal meme coin, TRUMP, which currently trades around $8.89. The family’s push into crypto has accelerated quickly. Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also taken active roles, as their holdings and ventures expand across tokenized assets, mining infrastructure, and stablecoin platforms. According to Bloomberg, the Trump family's earnings from projects such as World Liberty Financial and TRUMP Memecoins have estimated that Trump's wealth has increased by at least $620 million in just a few months. USD1 stablecoins may earn WLFI about $100 million this year.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 2, 2025 In comparison, just three years ago, Trump’s wealth was still heavily concentrated in real estate, which made up 86% of his net worth in 2021. That number has since dropped to around 50%. One of the biggest earners has been World Liberty Financial. The project includes a native token and a stablecoin, USD1. Since its launch, World Liberty has raised $550 million in token sales , with $390 million going to Trump and his three sons. The family also reportedly holds 22.5 billion governance tokens from the project, valued at over $2 billion, though most of those tokens are currently locked. Trump’s stake in the company was also recently reduced from 60% to 40%. In addition, the platform was used in a $2 billion transaction by Abu Dhabi-based MGX, which reportedly used the token to invest in Binance. According to estimates, the Trump-linked firm may have earned up to $100 million from that transaction alone. Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also taken direct stakes in crypto mining. The two are listed as 20% owners of American Bitcoin , a subsidiary of Hut 8, a large crypto mining firm. Trump son Eric Trump-backed American Bitcoin intends to use the net proceeds from $220 million raised in a new share issuance to fund for Bitcoin equipment purchase. #EricTrump #AmericanBitcoin #Hut8 https://t.co/23zTABD4tb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 The company disclosed in June that it had secured $220 million in capital to purchase mining equipment and Bitcoin. It also plans to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. While much of Trump’s personal fortune still sits in real estate and his media company, Truth Social, the rapid gains from crypto are shifting the structure of his financial empire. At its peak, Truth Social helped push Trump’s net worth to over $4 billion. The company’s valuation has since declined, but his stake remains worth nearly $2 billion despite posting a $401 million loss last year. With real estate now playing a smaller role and political ambitions still in view, Trump’s crypto involvement appears to be moving from experimental to entrenched. Donald Trump’s memecoin , $TRUMP, which gained attention after a controversial “ Presidential Dinner ” for its top 220 holders and a VIP tour offer, is now facing a steep decline. Once valued at around $150 million, Trump’s reported stake is tied to TRUMP tokens that will gradually unlock over the next three years. The token, driven largely by celebrity backing and political hype, has lost momentum since the late May dinner event. With no new endorsements and fading retail interest, TRUMP has dropped over 46%, showing the volatility of hype-based crypto projects. Trump-Backed Ventures Accelerate Crypto Push With Bitcoin, ETFs & UAE Investment Trump’s crypto ambitions are far from over as he advances with Bitcoin, ETFs, and token strategies. For example, on June 13, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a registration statement from Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) tied to its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement linked to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. #Trump #TruthSocial https://t.co/ybidUAZtqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 14, 2025 The filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million tied to convertible notes. While the approval gives the firm flexibility to raise capital, TMTG stated it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. This followed a May 27 announcement confirming a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin . TMTG CEO Devin Nunes called Bitcoin an “apex instrument of financial freedom,” indicating a strategic shift to make it a core part of the company’s treasury. TMTG also filed plans on June 16 to launch a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF , which would directly hold both assets, with a 75/25 allocation favoring Bitcoin. Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is gearing up to release a third-party audit of its stablecoin and launch a mobile app, co-founder Zak Folkman said on June 26. Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial plans to release a stablecoin audit and debut a new app soon, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed Wednesday. #Trump #WLFI https://t.co/yVPQqslR4F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 That same day, WLFI announced a $100 million token purchase by a UAE-based firm , Aqua1 Foundation, now its largest external stakeholder. Aqua1 seeks to expand WLFI’s footprint in real-world asset tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, and stablecoin development, surpassing previous major backers like Justin Sun, who had committed $30 million . Together, the developments reflect growing momentum behind Trump-affiliated crypto ventures.

2025-07-02T21:42:33,"SkyBridge Capital’s Scaramucci Warns Crypto Treasury Craze Will Fade, Despite Saylor Effect","Key Takeaways: SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci said the wave of companies adopting crypto treasury strategies will decline. He questioned investors’ willingness to pay premiums for firms holding crypto assets. Companies like BitMine and Metaplanet are emulating Strategy’s approach, often with prominent public figures attached. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, said the trend of public companies adopting crypto treasury models will decline, according to a report published by Bloomberg. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” Scaramucci said. “So, you know, it will fade.” He questioned the logic of paying a premium for equity in firms that hold crypto when investors could buy the underlying assets themselves. Scaramucci Warns of Crypto Treasury Trent Several companies have mirrored Strategy’s model of using corporate balance sheets to hold Bitcoin or other tokens. BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced a $250 million placement to support an Ethereum treasury and appointed Fundstrat founder Thomas Lee as board chair. Other firms have added high-profile advisers to boost visibility. Eric Trump sits on the board of Metaplanet, while Joe Lubin chairs SharpLink Gaming, which also shifted its focus to Ethereum holdings. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now,” Scaramucci said. While expressing long-term confidence in Bitcoin, he said investors should evaluate each firm’s structure and cost profile. “I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on Bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies,” he said. Public companies acquired about 131,000 coins in the second quarter, growing their bitcoin balance 18%, according to data provider Bitcoin Treasuries. ETFs showed an 8% increase or about 111,000 BTC in the same period. https://t.co/Nyiquq8Ync — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 1, 2025 According to the report, SkyBridge’s ETF, which includes Strategy among its largest holdings, competes with other funds and crypto treasury firms for investor attention. Despite the broader trend, Strategy has outperformed most crypto ETFs this year. Investor Doubts and Regulatory Questions The funding model for Strategy’s purchases has shifted over time, from stock and debt issuance to preferred share sales. The concept has drawn criticism, including from short-seller Jim Chanos, who called it “financial gibberish.” Scaramucci posed a practical question for investors: “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well?” “Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that’s an issue.” Critics argue that firms structured around token holdings may blur the line between operating businesses and passive investment vehicles, complicating shareholder expectations and disclosures. The trend also intersects with emerging regulatory scrutiny. Oversight bodies may revisit listing rules, disclosure practices, and capital allocation policies. Any shift in enforcement or accounting treatment could reshape how corporate crypto strategies are designed or whether they remain viable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why do investors pay premiums for treasury companies rather than buying crypto directly? Some investors prefer regulated equity exposure for accessibility or tax reasons. Others may rely on company governance or believe in additional business value. However, critics argue the added cost may not justify the indirect exposure. What accounting rules apply to crypto held on corporate balance sheets? Current U.S. GAAP treats crypto as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Companies must record impairment losses if prices fall but cannot mark up assets if values rise, potentially distorting reported financials. Are there tax implications for companies holding crypto? Corporate crypto gains are taxed under capital gains rules, and transaction-based holdings may trigger complex reporting requirements. Jurisdictional rules vary and can influence how strategies are structured.

The bankrupt crypto lender filed suit against Tether last year, alleging that Tether improperly liquidated nearly 40,000 bitcoins — worth over $4.3 billion at today’s prices — that it was holding as loan collateral in June 2022, shortly before Celsius halted withdrawals. In their suit, Celsius’ lawyers argued that Tether didn’t give Celsius enough time to satisfy its collateral demands, which they claimed it had “sufficient Bitcoin on its balance sheet” to do so “given that Celsius had instituted a ‘pause’ on customer withdrawals … resulting in the retention of, and access to, a significant amount of Bitcoin.” “If Celsius had been given the opportunity to meet the collateral demand — which it had a contractual right to do — it could have been able to avoid the disposition of its Bitcoin at near the bottom of the cryptocurrency market,” Celsius’ lawyers wrote. “Instead, that disposition was carried out for the benefit of just one creditor: Tether.” At the time the suit was filed, Tether pledged to fight it , calling the suit “baseless” and a “shameless litigation money grab” in a press statement. Tether claimed that Celsius executives directed the liquidation of its BTC collateral held by Tether in “in order to close out its roughly 815 million USDT position” with the company. Read more: Tether to Fight Celsius’ $3.3 Billion ‘Shakedown’ Litigation “Rather than recognize the clear validity of the agreement entered into years before Celsius’ bankruptcy, this lawsuit seeks to improperly impose the costs of Celsius’ mismanagement and failure on Tether,” the company’s statement said. However, the judge overseeing the case disagreed with Tether, arguing in his Monday order that Celsius’ then-CEO Alex Mashinsky’s — who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud in May — ”alleged oral permission” given to Tether to liquidate Celsius’ bitcoin collateral was “insufficient” and that not giving Celsius the 10-hour window to post collateral allotted by the two firms’ contract could still be a breach of contract, verbal permission or not. In his June 30th order, Chief Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) granted threw out only one count of the amended complaint, Count 4, which alleged that Tether breached the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing” under British Virgin Islands law. For that count, Glenn decided to dismiss it without prejudice, giving Celsius’ lawyers the opportunity to amend it with “facts sufficient to bring themselves within the requirements of BVI law.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/02/ny-bankruptcy-judge-gives-celsius-the-green-light-to-pursue-usd4-3b-lawsuit-against-tether,"USDT|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|Tether|Celsius|Bankruptcy|News",cryptocompare

This move is a first for a major Belgian bank. According to a statement from KBC, the regulatory process required to gain official recognition as a crypto asset service provider is currently under analysis. The bank expects this process to be completed and approval to be received by the fall. Once approved, individual investors will be able to purchase BTC and ETH directly through KBC’s secure platform. The bank states that special attention will be paid to user education, security and legal compliance. The move makes KBC the first major Belgian bank to announce concrete plans to offer cryptocurrency services. Until now, Belgian investors have generally had to turn to foreign platforms such as Binance, Coinbase and OKX, or digital banks such as Revolut and N26 for their crypto investments. Related News: How Much U.S. President Donald Trump Has Earned from Cryptocurrency Ventures Revealed - Here Are the Hard-to-Believe Number Other major Belgian banks are taking a cautious approach. Belfius says it is exploring how to adapt to the crypto market through its investment platform Re=bel. ING Belgium says it is examining the issue “very carefully,” while BNP Paribas Fortis says it has no plans to offer any crypto-related services. Large banks in Europe have long shied away from the sector due to regulatory uncertainty, money laundering risks, and the high volatility of crypto assets. However, the introduction of the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation regulating crypto asset markets has changed the situation as banks no longer need extensive new licenses to enter the digital asset space. A similar development took place in Germany. This week, regional German banks known as Sparkassen announced that individual customers will be able to buy and sell BTC and ETH via mobile apps starting in 2026. Spain’s second-largest bank, BBVA, also announced last March that it was developing a product for crypto investments. According to industry experts, the intense interest in cryptocurrencies is forcing banks to take action in this area. According to a recent study published by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA), 43% of Belgian investors under the age of 29 invest in cryptocurrencies. This rate increases to 45% in the 30s. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-02T21:15:46,"Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Snapped: $350M Outflows End 15-Day Run","On July 1, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant net outflow of approximately $342 million, marking a sharp reversal in investor sentiment. This shift is marked by the first outflow since June 6, and interrupted a period of sustained demand that had pushed cumulative net inflows to about $49 billion and total ETF assets under management (AUM) above $131 billion. Breaking Down the Reversal Data from SoSoValue shows that Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows with a net withdrawal of $172.73 million, followed closely by Grayscale’s GBTC at $119.51 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) also saw notable outflows of $27.03 million and $22.98 million, respectively. Interestingly, the biggest ETF by AUM, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), recorded zero flows for the day, neither adding nor shedding assets, to halt its own significant accumulation run . VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW also ushered in July with zero flows. In total, SoSoValue put the daily outflow figure at $342.25 million, despite a trading volume of more than $2.7 billion across all spot BTC ETFs. The pullback comes after a two-week run of inflows, exceeding $500 million on at least three different occasions in that period. On June 24, ETFs absorbed $588.55 million, followed by $547.72 million on June 25 and $501.27 million on June 27. All told, the surge propelled total cumulative net inflows across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to a high of $48.97 billion by June 30. But Monday’s outgoings dragged that figure back down to $48.63 billion. The last time the ETFs experienced a drop was on June 6, when the market recorded a net outflow of just under $48 million following a much larger $278.44 million exit on June 5. Institutional Demand Shifting Beyond ETFs This latest slowdown has coincided with reports that public corporations are ramping up their Bitcoin accumulation, buying 131,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2025 to overshadow ETF inflows of 111,000 BTC in the same period. According to BitcoinTreasuries, this is the third consecutive quarter in which public companies have picked up more BTC than exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, at the time of this writing, the OG cryptocurrency had recorded a modest 24-hour gain of 0.1% within a range of $105,402 to $107,139. In the last seven days, it oscillated between $105,430 and $108,706, posting a 0.5% gain. Zooming out, we see a 1.7% increase over 30 days and a substantial 70.6% surge over the past year, which still puts it 4.3% below its all-time high of $111,814 reached on May 22, 2025.

2025-07-02T21:00:09,"Founder Of $300 Billion Investment Firm Advises 40% Crypto Allocation, Here’s Why","Ric Edelman, the founder of Edelman Financial Engines, which is a $300 billion investment advisory firm, made recent interesting comments with his latest recommendation on crypto. In a new whitepaper published through the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), Edelman issued a direct call to investors to rethink the traditional 60/40 stock-bond allocation model and increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies from between 10% of their portfolio up to 40%. Rethinking The 60/40 Portfolio To Crypto In the whitepaper to investors , Ric Edelman proclaims that the 60/40 stock-bond allocation model is dead and rendered obsolete by longer life spans and technological innovation. Thus, smart investors must adopt strategies that are future-proof and resilient to changes in finance and technology. Cryptocurrencies provide exactly that kind of opportunity for investors. In Edelman’s opinion, conservative investors should have 10% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies, moderate investors should place 25% of their portfolios in crypto, and aggressive investors should allocate 40% of their investments to crypto. In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Crypto World segment, Edelman justified his outlook, arguing that crypto should now occupy a significant share of the equity allocation portion of portfolios. “Within that huge equity allocation, crypto needs a much bigger role because it’s representing the best investment opportunity of the decade,” he said . He also noted that it’s no longer about speculation. The speculation lies in not owning crypto at all. In the DACFP paper, he stressed that omitting digital assets is equivalent to shorting the market, especially now that a market-weighted global index would include around 3% crypto exposure by default. From Skepticism To Aggressive Endorsement Edelman’s latest recommendations mark a dramatic shift from his earlier views. In his 2021 book, The Truth About Crypto, he advised investors to place only 1% of their portfolios in cryptocurrencies, but that was then. Today, he is urging conservative investors to allocate up to 40% in cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, the financial advisor also advised other financial advisors to up their portfolio recommendations from 2.5% to at least 10%. This evolution, he explains, is due to the unprecedented transformation crypto has undergone over the past four years since he released his book. According to Edelman, the crypto industry is no longer an experimental sector like it was in 2021. It’s now a core financial asset class. Furthermore, there’s no longer a question as to whether or not the government likes crypto or not and is going to support its development. Looking ahead, Edelman’s bullish stance is firmly rooted in long-term projections. While speaking at the Vision conference early last month, he projected that Bitcoin could reach a $19 trillion market cap by 2030. He has also placed a $500,000 price target on Bitcoin, basing his estimate on simple supply-demand math. According to him, global investable assets across all classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, cash, and more) amount to about $750 trillion. If just 1% of this capital flowed into Bitcoin, it would equate to $7.5 trillion in inflows. On a per-coin basis, this would push Bitcoin’s valuation to approximately $377,000. Factoring in Bitcoin’s current price, Edelman arrives at a $500,000 target.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/40-crypto-allocation-heres-why/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|bitcoin|Bonds|btc|CNBC|CNBC Crypto World Segment|crypto|Cryptocurrency|DACFP Paper|real estate|Ric Edelman|stocks|The Truth About Crypto|total",cryptocompare

However, BTC price has not fully invalidated the midterm bearish sentiment. As Coinpedia reported , BTC price faced midterm bearish sentiment caused by significant cumulative short leverage trades and consistent negative funding rates. Factors that Will Impact Bitcoin Price Action in July As Coinpedia has pointed out, BTC price has gradually mirrored the exponential growth of the global money supply (M2). The need by the U.S. government to increase its budget deficit implies more money supply in the near term, which is extremely bullish for Bitcoin. The performance of BTC in July will be heavily influenced by the performance of the U.S. spot BTC ETFs. Led by BlackRock’s IBIT, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded a net cash inflow of about $12.8 billion in the last three months. Meanwhile, monitoring the performance of major companies, which have implemented a Bitcoin treasury management plan, in July will help determine BTC price action. Furthermore, the rising demand from institutional investors has caused a sharp decline of disposable coins on centralized exchanges thus exaggerating the supply vs demand shock. Midterm Targets BTC price has rallied above a crucial resistance logarithmic trendline following Wednesday’s pump. The flagship coin is now well-positioned to rally towards a new all-time high if the buyers maintain above $109k in the coming weeks. $BTC it's happening pic.twitter.com/GvtdfkEoa9 — CryptoBoss (@CryptoBoss1984) July 2, 2025 According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan , BTC price could rally beyond its ATH in July fueled by easing geopolitical tension and rising demand from institutional investors. The bullish sentiment in July is also bolstered by the fact that BTC has majorly recorded gains in more Julys in the last ten years. The midterm bullish sentiment will, however, be invalidated if BTC price retraces towards the lower border of the falling channel, around the support range between $92k and $96k.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-bitcoin-price-poised-for-a-historical-rally-in-july-fueled-by-institutional-investors/,"TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The bank plans to offer Bitcoin and Ether investments through its Bolero investment platform later this year. According to a local source, KBC said it is currently undergoing an assessment to obtain recognition as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP). The process is expected to conclude by autumn. KBC Pushes Into Crypto as European Banks Catch Up to Investor Demand A KBC spokesperson said the platform would offer retail investors access to Bitcoin and Ether “within a trusted framework, with a focus on education, security, and regulatory compliance.” Bolero, the bank’s online investment arm, will host the crypto offerings. If approved by regulators, the rollout could begin by the end of 2025. This would place KBC ahead of its domestic rivals in the retail crypto market. According to L'Écho, starting this autumn, users will be able to purchase BTC and ETH through Bolero, the investment platform of KBC, one of Belgium's largest banks, marking a first for a major Belgian bank. KBC expects to receive regulatory approval as a crypto-asset service… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 2, 2025 Belgian customers currently rely on foreign exchanges such as Binance , Coinbase , and OKX to access crypto. Others turn to digital banking apps like Revolut and N26, which have integrated crypto services in recent years. The move by KBC comes amid a broader shift among European banks toward digital asset integration. A recent study by Bitpanda found that while over 40% of business investors in Europe already hold cryptocurrencies, only 19% of financial institutions believe there is strong demand. The report pointed to a gap between investor behavior and the perception among banks. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Bitpanda’s deputy CEO, said , “Financial institutions in Europe know that crypto is here to stay, but most are still not offering services that match investor demand.” The same is true for capital market players too – where European institutions are probably a couple of years ahead. Example: Deutsche Boerse, the main German stock exchange, will provide $btc and $eth custody. Plus, both in the EU and in Switzerland, you can now launch fully… https://t.co/7VGXOYuFaW — Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) March 20, 2025 Despite the hesitation, some banks are beginning to take notice. The same survey found that 18% of institutions plan to expand their crypto-related offerings, particularly in areas like transfers and trading. A separate report from Coincub earlier this year found that over 60 banks in Europe currently offer some form of crypto service . Institutions like BBVA Switzerland, Standard Chartered, and Barclays have all deepened their crypto involvement. While the bank has emphasized a cautious and regulated approach, it appears to be responding to growing interest from retail clients. If the CASP registration is secured, KBC will join a small but growing group of European banks bringing crypto trading into their core platforms. The final decision is expected in the fall, and all eyes will be on how other banks in the region respond. Europe’s Regulatory Shift Sparks Wave of Bank-Backed Bitcoin Services KBC Bank’s entry into retail crypto trading could mark the beginning of a broader trend across Europe, as traditional financial institutions ramp up their digital asset services under the European Union’s newly implemented MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation . MiCA, which came into force in 2024, has set unified standards for crypto operations across the European Economic Area (EEA). In just the first half of 2025, major crypto exchanges like OKX, Coinbase, Bybit, and Crypto.com secured licenses under the framework. The result is a more competitive, regulated European crypto market and increasing pressure on legacy banks to follow suit. Several of Europe’s largest financial players are already responding. Germany’s Deutsche Bank is reportedly preparing to launch a crypto custody service in 2026 , collaborating with Austrian exchange Bitpanda and tech firm Taurus, which Deutsche Bank has backed. @DeutscheBank plans to roll out a digital assets custody service in 2026, partnering with @Bitpanda ’s technology arm to build the platform. #Deutsche #Crypto https://t.co/xdnBFQULqY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Meanwhile, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, Germany’s largest banking group with 50 million customers, plans to allow direct Bitcoin and Ether trading via its mobile app by summer 2026.

The group describes it as “reliable access to a regulated crypto offering.” In Spain, BBVA has already been advising its affluent clients to allocate a portion of their portfolios—up to 7%—to Bitcoin and other digital assets. As European regulators prepare further guidance , including clarifying rules for cross-border stablecoin use, MiCA appears to be positioning the EU as a global leader in crypto oversight. EU stablecoin interchangeability under MiCA clarified: licensed EU tokens treated as equivalent to non-EU tokens. #Stablecoin #MiCA https://t.co/7I5C1txxr5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 For banks like KBC, the clarity may not just offer regulatory cover but also unlock long-term opportunity in digital finance.

2025-07-02T20:30:15,"Bit Digital Bets Big on Ethereum With $21.4M Public Offering","Bit Digital, a company listed on the Nasdaq, recently announced it has raised an extra $21.4 million to support its new focus on Ethereum (ETH). This money came from underwriters who decided to purchase additional shares following a public offering last week. With this additional funding, Bit Digital plans to expand its Ethereum treasury and shift its focus away from Bitcoin mining. This move positions the firm at the center of a growing trend among public companies that are choosing crypto assets as part of their treasury strategies. Public Offering Brings Total Proceeds to $162.9M Bit Digital’s public offering has now reached a total of 86.25 million shares. This has generated approximately $162.9 million in total proceeds for the company. The new funds will be used to purchase Ethereum and to support Bit Digital’s long-term plan to transition away from Bitcoin mining. In June 2025, Bit Digital officially announced it would stop all Bitcoin mining operations. Instead, it will focus on holding and staking Ethereum. Bit Digital to Sell Bitcoin Holdings and Buy More Ethereum Unlike most public crypto firms, such as MARA, which mainly hold Bitcoin in their treasuries , Bit Digital is taking a different path. As part of this transition, the firm plans to convert its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings into Ethereum over time. Currently, the company holds approximately 417.6 BTC, valued at around $44.9 million. These funds will eventually be used to grow its Ethereum treasury. Meanwhile, Bit Digital already owns a large amount of Ethereum. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, the company held 24,434.2 ETH. At that time, one ETH was worth $2,444, meaning the firm’s ETH holdings were valued at approximately $59.8 million. The company began buying and staking crypto in 2022, indicating that this change has been underway for some time. A Trend Among Crypto Miners Bit Digital is not alone. Other Bitcoin mining firms are starting to follow a similar path. BitMine Immersion Technologies, another mining company, recently shared plans to raise $250 million to build its own Ethereum treasury. Earlier, it raised $18 million from share sales to buy Bitcoin, but it is now shifting its focus toward Ethereum. This move reflects a broader trend among companies to diversify their crypto holdings beyond Bitcoin . Under the current U.S. administration, which supports crypto innovation, this strategy is becoming more popular . Many firms now view cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, and XRP as viable long-term assets. Following the news of the extra funding, Bit Digital’s shares jumped nearly 4% in after-hours trading. The company’s market capitalization also increased to $594 million, up from $488 million the week before. This strong market response shows growing investor confidence in the firm’s Ethereum-focused strategy.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says the S&P 500 is in the midst of the “most hated V-shaped” rally after the stock market index recovered from a 2025 low of 4,835 to a new all-time high of 6,215 points. According to Lee, many investors dumped their stock holdings during the market’s early-year decline, only to be left on the sidelines as equities staged a strong rebound. “A lot of folks liquidated at the lows, but we know that whenever the VIX (volatility index) is above 60 and falls below 30, you’ve made a decisive low. And now visibility is better, tariffs aren’t as bad as we expected, and the inflation impact has been very muted, and outside of tariffs, [underlying] inflation is much lower than people expected.” Looking ahead, Lee believes that there’s no reason to be bearish on the S&P 500 after casting off five shocks in half a decade. “I think there’s more upside to 6,600 [points] because the P/E (price to earnings) of the market can go up a lot. We already had five shocks. We had the Covid shock, the supply-chain shock, the inflation shock, the Fed-fastest-hikes-in-history [shock] and then we had the tariff shock. So five shocks in five years, and earnings kept growing. If this was a stock, we’d say, ‘Look if you try to kill it five times and it still grew earnings, we would put a much higher multiple.” As of Monday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,198 points.

2025-07-02T20:00:08,"Market Roundup: How Major Cryptos Moved This Week","This week in crypto brought a blend of resilience and hesitation across major assets. Bitcoin tested resistance, Ethereum showed signs of consolidation, and Solana continued to battle bearish pressure. While gains were mixed, the underlying setups hint at brewing volatility and opportunities ahead. Whether you're tracking momentum or hunting early signals, the latest movements are worth your attention. This roundup is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native agency that aligns high-precision storytelling with real-time market insight. Bitcoin Bears Hold Ground as Bulls Struggle to Gain Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently in a tug-of-war between its bulls and bears, with prices bouncing between around $102,000 and nearly $110,000. The nearest resistance sits at close to $114,000, and it has struggled to break past this level. The bears seem to have a slight edge as Bitcoin’s price recently dipped by over 5% this month. However, there's still hope for bulls, as long-term trends show a growth of 9% over six months. To ignite a stronger rally, Bitcoin would need to surge roughly 15% from its current range to breach $122,000, where a significant resistance level lies. Ethereum Struggles to Break Out, Bulls Await Key Resistance Level Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is hovering between two and a half to three thousand dollars, showing a minor decline in recent weeks. The bulls seem hesitant but remain hopeful as they eye the three thousand sixty-dollar mark as a potential breakout point. The recent downtrend of about five percent over the week suggests caution, but the situation isn’t overly bleak yet. If Ethereum can rally past the top resistance barrier, it might push toward nearly three thousand five hundred, marking a potential climb of around twenty-five percent. However, if it dips below the support level of around two thousand one hundred eighty-five, a further decline might be on the horizon. Currently, market trends indicate a testing time for Ethereum enthusiasts. Solana Struggles as Bears Take the Lead Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, showing signs of bearish momentum. Its price has slipped over 4% this week, nearly 18% this past month, and over 21% in the last six months, reflecting weakness in bullish support. With an RSI around 50, the market isn't oversold or overbought, but bears seem to dominate. Resistance is around $181, with stronger resistance at $208, making these levels crucial for any bullish breakout. Support is found at $126.67 and further down at $99.27, which might see testing if the bearish trend continues. Solana's potential upside from its current range could reach 25% if bulls can reclaim momentum and aim for resistance levels.

2025-07-02T19:58:12,"Ethereum-linked stocks jumped as companies shifted reserves from bitcoin to ETH","Ethereum-linked stocks saw a sharp boost on Wednesday, as companies pivoting toward ETH strategies caught the attention of traders. The rally came while hype around stablecoins and tokenization picked up again across the crypto industry, according to reporting from CNBC. The biggest gainer was BitMine Immersion Technologies, a bitcoin mining firm that decided this week to make Ethereum its primary treasury reserve asset. Shares jumped nearly 20% after the news and have now exploded over 1,000% since that announcement. SharpLink Gaming, a betting firm that also added ETH to its treasury strategy, rose more than 11%. And Bit Digital, which left bitcoin mining behind last week to focus fully on Ethereum treasury holdings and staking, saw its shares increase by more than 6%. Firms adopt Ethereum for reserves and staking Traders responded to growing signs that Ethereum isn’t just surviving its recent slump, it’s being adopted in new ways. One of the strongest signals came from Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens, who said : “We’re finally at the point where real use cases are emerging, and stablecoins have been the first version of that at scale but they’re going to open the door to a much bigger story around tokenizing other assets and using digital assets in new ways.” At the same time, crypto ETF flows showed a clear divergence. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which had seen inflows for 15 straight trading sessions, broke that streak on Tuesday. While that happened, Ethereum ETFs brought in $40 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust pulling in most of it. ETH ETFs had looked dead just a month ago, with traders calling them zombie funds. Now they’re seeing fresh interest again. Ethereum itself rose 5% on the day, based on pricing from Coin Metrics. But it’s still down 24% in 2025. The network has been under pressure since its last major technical upgrade failed to boost revenue. Its long-term value is also being questioned as faster rivals like Solana grab more attention. All of this is happening in a year where geopolitical chaos continues to keep investors on edge. Tokenization and stablecoin news fuel Ether demand Despite that, Ethereum’s role in tokenization is driving new activity. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee called Ethereum “the backbone and architecture” of stablecoins. Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), the two biggest stablecoins, are both issued on the Ethereum network. Lee’s comment points to why ETH is still central when it comes to building stable digital payment rails. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL (short for USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), also started out on Ethereum before expanding to other blockchains. Tokenization is the process of creating digital versions of real-world assets or securities and putting them on-chain. But people who hold those tokenized assets don’t own the actual underlying thing. They hold the crypto equivalent. Robinhood added to the momentum this week when it said it would allow trading of tokenized US stocks and ETFs across Europe. That follows a wave of renewed attention toward stablecoins in June, sparked by Circle’s IPO and a US Senate vote to approve the GENIUS Act , a stablecoin regulation bill. Ethereum will turn ten years old at the end of July. It’s still down roughly 75% from its all-time high. But as ETH-related stocks and funds climb, and more firms ditch bitcoin for Ethereum-focused treasuries, traders are watching closely. Whether it rebounds or not, it’s still in the middle of crypto’s biggest conversation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

In an interview with Bloomberg , the SkyBridge Capital founder says he thinks the BTC treasury business model will fade away. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea… So, you know, it will fade.” The investor says that eventually, investors will begin to question why they’re paying a premium for a “middleman” to hold an asset when they could simply hold BTC on their own. Over the last year, there has been a trend among corporations of accumulating Bitcoin, both as a savings mechanism and a strategy to convert their shares into proxies for investing in the flagship cryptocurrency. Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet . Other companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have been employing the same tactics for years. However, Scaramucci says he feels different about Strategy. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now… I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on Bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies… “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that’s an issue.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T19:45:48,"Binance Dominates Bitcoin Futures with 87% Taker Volume: CQ","Fresh data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows Binance now commands 87% of global taker buy volume in Bitcoin (BTC) futures. This figure dwarfs the combined activity of major competitors like OKX, Deribit, BitMEX, and Bybit, which together account for only about 10%. Taker Volume Signals Market Supremacy Takers are traders who accept existing offers or bids on a platform’s order book rather than placing their own. Since they want their request filled immediately, they tend to “take” a value that’s already listed so that they can react swiftly to a cryptocurrency’s price movements. This is done through the so-called market orders. This metric is crucial: it indicates where positions fill fastest and where capital flows are most concentrated. Experts usually consider the taker volume important for gauging real-time market activity, and according to CryptoQuant, Binance is the overwhelming leader, capturing 87% of such deals. That it holds the lion’s share of this activity indicates that Binance is the go-to platform for traders looking to act quickly on price trends, especially those using leverage-heavy BTC futures contracts. As noted by analyst J.A. Maartun, the exchange’s dominance means traders’ orders will be filled rapidly, while market watchers like him get to “monitor order books, liquidity levels, and capital flows more effectively.” Binance’s grip on the space is not new, but it solidified following the 2022 collapse of FTX, which at one point was one of its main rivals. The gap it left behind saw the then Changpeng Zhao-led firm steadily grow its daily trading volume to cement its place as the largest crypto exchange in the world based on this metric. Beyond Futures However, its dominance isn’t just in the futures space. As recently reported by CryptoPotato , the BTC.com mining pool exclusively directs almost 98% of its identifiable Bitcoin exchange flows to Binance, making it the primary gateway for new BTC entering the market. The crypto exchange also dominates USDT liquidity on Tron, with on-chain data showing it routinely processes more than 65% of the stablecoin’s transfers on the network. This amounts to anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion worth of TRC-20 Tether processed each day. Nonetheless, this extreme centralization is a double-edged sword. While it offers unmatched liquidity and efficiency, it also concentrates systemic risk. Any significant operational, regulatory, or technical issue impacting Binance could send shockwaves across the entire crypto ecosystem, disrupting derivatives pricing, spot liquidity, and even stablecoin flows.

2025-07-02T19:40:12,"What If Bitcoin Hits $200K? AI Projects Dominance Spikes and Altcoin Frenzy","What would happen if Bitcoin reached $200,000? Nearly doubling its previous all-time high, a $200K price would move Bitcoin into a new tier of market capitalization, roughly matching the valuation of global blue-chip equities and sovereign debt holdings. It would likely attract new classes of capital and global media attention. This article uses AI to analyze and explore that possibility through a structured framework. Instead of speculating on a date or treating the figure as inevitable, it investigates what could unfold if Bitcoin does reach this benchmark. Drawing from prior market cycles and behavior patterns, it outlines key indicators investors might observe across dominance, altcoin behavior, sector reactions, macro drivers, and psychological sentiment. Bitcoin Price 2017-Present (Source: CoinMarketCap) Rather than offering predictions, the goal is to map potential outcomes. The AI analysis considers how markets have responded to previous rallies and what those patterns might imply for a future where Bitcoin touches $200K. Research Approach and Analytical Framework To ground the analysis, we analyzed data from two previous bull cycles with ChatGPT’s o3 model—2017 and 2020 to 2021—using CoinMarketCap and TradingView . Both periods saw Bitcoin leading the initial price movements, followed by capital rotation into altcoins. BTC dominance rose early, then declined as other tokens gained traction. This historical lens helps to frame a plausible path forward. AI analysis added structure by projecting how different segments might react under specific conditions. These include shifts in BTC dominance, ETH /BTC ratio trends, and short-term altcoin volatility following a price spike. We assume Bitcoin reaches $200K in an environment that supports a higher risk appetite, such as post-ETF-approval inflows, macroeconomic easing, or a weakening dollar. No single catalyst is implied, but conditions would likely include strong institutional demand and favorable regulation. Initial Shock: Bitcoin Dominance Spikes If Bitcoin breaks through $200K, dominance is likely to climb in the early stages. In past cycles, this has indicated capital concentration in Bitcoin as investors seek security in the most liquid asset. In 2017, dominance fell from 64 percent to under 40 percent as the rally matured. In the 2021 cycle, it peaked around 73 percent before dropping below 50 percent once altcoins gathered momentum. Bitcoin Dominance 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) At the $200K level, Bitcoin would almost certainly attract institutional flows and dominate trading volumes. Search interest and media coverage would spike, even among retail investors who have stayed on the sidelines. Historically, these moments have been associated with a rapid inflow of attention and capital, setting the stage for short-lived overextension. However, the rise in dominance might be temporary. Once BTC appears to stabilize at new highs, capital could begin rotating into ETH and eventually into smaller assets. This transition has occurred before, often within weeks of a Bitcoin top. Altcoin Rotation: ETH Rebounds, Altseason Looms Ethereum has historically underperformed during Bitcoin-led surges but tends to recover strongly once BTC momentum cools. During the late 2020 rally, ETH/BTC declined even as BTC rallied. But by mid-2021, Ethereum regained ground and outperformed Bitcoin in percentage terms for several months. The ETH/BTC ratio climbed steadily, indicating renewed confidence in broader crypto exposure. Ethereum to Bitcoin Ratio 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) Blockchaincenter’s Altcoin Season Index supports this. In both 2017 and 2021, altcoin rallies intensified once Bitcoin had already established a local high. In 2021, large-cap alts rose by over 170 percent compared to a relatively flat BTC. Smaller tokens often lag further, but their moves are sharper once they catch up. If BTC reaches $200K and then stabilizes, the conditions for a classic altcoin season may emerge. Capital typically flows first to ETH, then to mid-cap tokens, and finally to microcaps as risk appetite increases. Altcoin Season Index 2020-Present (Source: Blockchaincenter) These transitions are fast and often unpredictable. Investors watching dominance metrics, ETH/BTC ratios, and liquidity conditions may spot the early signs of such a rotation. Sector Reactions: DeFi, Memecoins, Metaverse Beyond general altcoins, specific token sectors have often been the primary beneficiaries of late-cycle capital. In 2021, DeFi protocols, meme tokens, and metaverse-related assets surged once Bitcoin began to flatten out. These moves were amplified by social sentiment and community engagement rather than core utility. Should Bitcoin reach $200K, speculative capital may again flow into these and other new, trending segments (AI, RWA , etc). Traders who missed the early BTC gains may chase higher beta assets, especially if short-term sentiment supports them. These rallies tend to be brief and steep, with heightened volatility on both the upside and downside. Timing also matters. These sectors often peak just after Bitcoin tops. Watch for rising social engagement and increasing trading volume as early indicators. Macro Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts No major price level exists in a vacuum. A $200K Bitcoin would likely follow a set of favorable macro and regulatory developments. Additional ETF approvals could trigger new flows from wealth managers and pension funds. A weakening dollar or easing Fed stance might drive investors to reevaluate long-term stores of value, and persistent inflation could push more institutional interest into hard digital assets. What drives the price also shapes what follows. An ETF-driven rally would likely keep most capital in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, if broader macro recovery leads the charge—like a tech-stock rebound or real yield compression—then altcoins might benefit as well. The nature of the catalyst would determine the breadth of participation. A narrow rally driven by institutions tends to favor high-liquidity assets. A wider rally, driven by retail and macro optimism, tends to pull in speculative names. The outcome is not just price-based but structural. Understanding this would help investors anticipate where capital may flow next. Mapping Reversal Risks and Volatility Ahead In past cycles, dominance tends to peak around the time Bitcoin hits its top. When BTC hit $20K in December 2017, dominance fell shortly after. In 2021, BTC reached $69K while dominance was already declining, setting the stage for broad market retracements. The scenario might look like this: Bitcoin touches $200K, dominance climbs to 60 percent, then retreats over several days as capital disperses. If this process unfolds too quickly, altcoin prices may rise and fall just as fast. Tokens with low liquidity or inflated valuations may see abrupt corrections. The risk isn’t only that prices fall, but that the correction hits different sectors at different speeds. Bitcoin may remain steady while smaller tokens experience outsized drawdowns. Investors unfamiliar with this dynamic may misread the timing, entering too late or exiting too early. Volatility often follows rapid rotations. Watching dominance trends and ETH/BTC shifts can help assess when momentum begins to fade. Investor Sentiment Shifts—Retail vs Institutional Retail behavior often mirrors price action. In 2017 and 2021, Google Trends data shows search interest for “Bitcoin” peaked near the market top. These periods were marked by media saturation and public curiosity. Bitcoin Google Trend Index (Source: Google) Recent rallies haven’t generated the same level of attention. Even with new highs, search volume remains well below prior peaks. If Bitcoin hits $200K under similar conditions, the move may be driven more by institutions than retail. This could delay broader participation, especially in altcoins. A subdued retail environment might mute initial volatility, but it could also dampen follow-through in later phases. Altcoin seasons tend to rely on retail-driven liquidity. If that component is missing or delayed, smaller tokens may struggle to replicate past performance. Still, attention can return quickly. If media focus intensifies, search trends could reverse rapidly. Retail engagement tends to follow headlines. Preparing for a Potential $200K Bitcoin Market As we’ve explored what might happen if Bitcoin reaches $200K, we’ve drawn from real-world data and historical behavior to outline potential developments across market structure, investor behavior, and asset rotation. Key indicators to monitor include Bitcoin dominance, ETH/BTC ratio trends, and search activity. These offer insight into whether a rally is broadening, narrowing, or beginning to reverse. Rather than make a prediction, this scenario helps map expectations. Understanding previous cycles doesn’t guarantee foresight, but it does offer useful context. If Bitcoin does approach $200K, preparation will matter more than precision. The post What If Bitcoin Hits $200K?

But now, in just a few months, Trump and his family have made more than $620 million by diving into the world of crypto . Is Trump using his power as president to make this money? Let’s look at how he’s turning digital coins into millions. Fast Money: From Real Estate to Crypto For years, the Trump family made their money the traditional way, buying land, building towers, and putting their name on fancy buildings all over the world. But since Donald Trump returned to the White House, things have changed. The same man who once criticized crypto has now done a complete turnaround and jumped right into it. With their new projects like World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin , the Trumps are making money much faster than they ever did by selling condos. One of their biggest money-makers right now is World Liberty Financial, which sells its tokens and runs a stablecoin called USD1, linked to the US dollar. By March, this project had sold about $550 million worth of tokens, and nearly $400 million of that went directly to the Trump family. Earlier, Trump even offered a private dinner to the trump memecoin’s biggest holders. Crypto Beats Real Estate To see how big this is, compare it to Trump’s old business. Last year, his company made about $34 million from licensing buildings. That’s small compared to the hundreds of millions flowing in from crypto projects in just months. And it’s not stopping there. Trump’s family also has a stake in American Bitcoin, a company that wants to go public as a big Bitcoin miner. If that works, it could add even more to their crypto fortune. New Money, Same Name No matter what, the Trump name keeps pulling in money. Now, instead of waiting years to finish towers and resorts, the Trumps can earn millions quickly by putting their name on digital coins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/trumps-620-crypto-jackpot-how-digital-coins-are-boosting-his-fortune/,"BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T19:29:53,"Lending & Borrowing Tokens to Watch Under $1M Market Cap","Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms continue to grow, and several small-cap tokens ( These tokens power emerging protocols that let users lend crypto assets for interest or borrow against collateral. Below we highlight five such projects, summarizing their core features and CoinMarketCap statistics. Trava Finance (TRAVA) Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that allows projects and individuals to launch their own lending pools. Launched in 2021, Trava lets users create and manage “User-owned pools” for lending and borrowing. It also incorporates AI-powered analytics to reduce risk – for example, it offers tools like the BRicher token-price aggregator, Token Health indicators, and a Credit Score system to inform investment decisions. Trava Governance is fully decentralized, letting TRAVA token holders vote on upgrades. The team is even experimenting with NFT collateral: they launched “Trava Knight” NFTs and an auction platform as steps toward NFT-backed loans. Key features: Cross-chain lending pools; AI-driven analytics (credit scoring, token health); decentralized governance; NFT-collateral experimentation. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.00008485 (24h volume ≈$74 K); Market Cap ≈$343.8 K; Circulating Supply ≈4.05 B TRAVA. Trading: TRAVA trades on exchanges such as MEXC (TRAVA/USDT), BitMart, and PancakeSwap v2. UniLend Finance (UFT) UniLend is a permissionless DeFi protocol that uniquely combines spot trading and lending/borrowing for any ERC-20 token. Unlike other platforms that limit which tokens can be used, UniLend lets any community member list an ERC-20 token for lending, borrowing, and trading. Its upcoming UniLend V2 (launched Feb 2024 on Ethereum) promises expanded features and performance. UniLend also bridges into AI: it offers an AI Agent Hub where users can co-create on-chain AI agents using modular smart-contract “lego” components. The native UFT token is used for platform governance; holders can vote on proposals and earn rewards from liquidity mining and protocol fees. Key features: Permissionless trading & lending for all ERC-20 tokens; unified spot and lending markets; community governance (UFT) and a separate UFTG community token; modular AI Agent Hub for on-chain AI agents. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.00605 (24h volume ≈$54.7 K); Market Cap ≈$554.3 K; Circulating Supply ≈91.67 M UFT. Trading: UFT is listed on exchanges like AscendEX, Uniswap V2, and SushiSwap. ForTube (FOR) – The Force Protocol ForTube (formerly The Force Protocol ) is an open-source DeFi lending platform, deployed on Binance Smart Chain in 2020. It describes itself as a suite of crypto-finance service protocols aimed at developers. The platform supports crypto-backed lending and borrowing , yield farming, and issuance of on-chain stablecoins. Its services include cross-chain asset transfers, crypto-asset-backed stablecoin insurance, token insurance, and on-chain payments. ForTube’s smart contracts allow users to deposit, borrow, and repay assets at any time, with interest rates automatically adjusted by the protocol. Notably, the ForTube network has been audited by SlowMist for security. Key features: BSC-based DeFi lending/yield-farming; crypto-collateralized stablecoin issuance; permissionless platform with SDK/APIs for developers; algorithmic interest rates; audited smart contracts. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.000738 (24h volume ≈$128 K); Market Cap ≈$586.7 K; Circulating Supply ≈795 M FOR. Trading: FOR is tradable on major CEXs (Binance, Huobi, etc.) and decentralized exchanges. Interlay (INTR) Interlay is a Bitcoin-centric cross-chain DeFi protocol . Its goal is to bring Bitcoin into the wider DeFi ecosystem. As its website states, “Interlay is a modular, programmable layer between Bitcoin and the multi-chain ecosystem that unlocks decentralized (financial) use cases for BTC”. The main feature is the interBTC bridge, a 1:1 BTC-pegged asset secured by a decentralized network of vaults. Interlay also provides a DeFi hub for BTC – enabling Bitcoin swaps, lending, and staking with low fees (payable in any asset). The INTR token underpins the protocol: holders can lock INTR to vote on governance (“stake-to-vote”) and pay transaction or cross-chain fees, and INTR can even serve as collateral for interBTC or other assets. Key features: Trustless BTC bridge (interBTC) for using BTC across multiple chains; Bitcoin DeFi hub (swaps, lending, staking); modular architecture supporting EVM and Rust contracts. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.002310 (24h volume ≈$59.7 K); Market Cap ≈$154.8 K; Circulating Supply ≈67.0 M INTR. Trading: INTR is listed on exchanges like Kraken and Gate.io. Kintsugi (KINT) Kintsugi is Interlay’s canary network deployed on Kusama. It runs the same codebase as Interlay but serves as an innovation hub, getting new features first. Kintsugi’s flagship product is kBTC , a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on Kusama backed by multi-collateral insurance (like a decentralized BTC-pegged stablecoin). The KINT token is primarily for governance (deciding protocol upgrades) and paying network fees. In practice, Kintsugi aims to stress-test and refine Interlay’s designs; as the Interlay docs say, “Kintsugi focuses strictly on innovation and will always be ahead in terms of features”. Key features: Kusama-based experimental layer for Bitcoin DeFi; 1:1 BTC-backed kBTC asset with MakerDAO-inspired multi-collateral insurance; token governance and fees (KINT). Coin stats: Price ≈$0.17 (24h volume ≈$65.5 K); Market Cap ≈$583.6 K; Circulating Supply ≈3.43 M KINT. Trading: KINT is traded on platforms like Kraken and Gate.io. Summary: Each of these projects has a unique niche in DeFi lending/borrowing, often involving cross-chain or Bitcoin-focused features. Their market caps are currently under $1 M, which implies both potential upside and higher risk. Before investing, do your own research: check current prices, liquidity, and developments. CoinMarketCap provides up-to-date stats (as cited above) to help track these tokens. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-02T19:05:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction toward $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.495 Price Change 24h 2.27% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.495 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis Pi price bounced from $0.4778 to $0.4953, signalling a small recovery after testing critical support levels. MACD shows a narrowing bearish gap, hinting at possible reversal momentum if buying volume sustains above current levels. RSI remains below 40, indicating weak buying strength and continued bearish sentiment. As of July 2, 2025, Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.4953, up 3.32% in the past 24 hours. The price bounced from a support level near $0.478, showing signs of short-term strength. The Immediate resistance lies around $0.505, and a breakout above this zone could open a path toward $0.52. Pi 1-day chart shows a weak momentum despite a short-term price rally The Pi Network 1-day chart shows a rebound as Pi coin price rose to $0.4953 after testing key support. Despite this rise, MACD remains in bearish territory, signalling weak momentum across the Pi Network market. The RSI stands at 38.13, reflecting low buying strength and a cautious current Pi Network sentiment. This aligns with uncertainty caused by ongoing token unlocks and increased selling pressure. Without bullish confirmation, the network price prediction remains bearish for the short term, though long-term recovery depends on ecosystem traction and demand. Pi/USDT Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart shows consolidation as Pi coin price trades between $0.48 and $0.50 with low volatility. MACD is showing signs of flattening, but no bullish crossover has formed, indicating weak momentum in the Pi Network market. The RSI has climbed to 40.84, hinting at small buying interest but still reflecting a bearish current Pi Network sentiment. Key resistance levels remain near $0.505, while support is holding around $0.478. Unless stronger demand emerges, the short-term price prediction points to sideways movement under pressure from high circulating supply and ongoing token unlocks. Pi/USDT Price Chart Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? Pi price may stay in a range between $0.48 and $0.52 with weak momentum and ongoing token unlock pressure. A breakout above $0.52 could signal short-term recovery, but selling risks remain high. Market sentiment and volume will guide the next move. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. On June 28, Pi Network announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the mainnet, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Happy Pi2Day 2025! Today, Pi has introduced two exciting features to the ecosystem and provided various tech and product updates.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48–$0.52 range.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T18:50:08,"Design Giant Figma Goes Public, Reveals $70M Bitcoin ETF Holdings and $30M Ready to Buy More","Design software giant Figma has filed for its initial public offering with the SEC, revealing substantial Bitcoin exposure, including $69.5 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings and an additional $30 million earmarked for future cryptocurrency investments. The company’s S-1 filing mentions Bitcoin 21 times, while strongly highlighting crypto as a core component of its treasury strategy alongside traditional marketable securities. BULLISH: @figma just disclosed $69.5M in spot #Bitcoin ETFs in its SEC IPO filing – with board approval to buy $30M more. This isn’t a crypto company. This is a mainstream tech brand holding $BTC on its balance sheet. Adoption is happening quietly, but at the highest levels. pic.twitter.com/zmTrRyuyqj — ︎ Teo Mercer (@TeoMercer) July 2, 2025 Initially, Figma’s Board of Directors approved a $55 million investment in Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF on March 3, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, the position was valued at $69.5 million. The company subsequently authorized another $30 million Bitcoin investment on May 8, 2025, purchasing USDC as an intermediate step to stabilize the investment before converting to Bitcoin at an optimal time. Figma will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker “FIG” with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company, and J.P. Morgan serving as joint lead book-running managers. The offering size and pricing remain undetermined pending market conditions and SEC approval processes. Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Evolve Through ETF Adoption Figma’s approach involves a hybrid strategy that combines direct Bitcoin ownership and ETF exposure. As mentioned above, the company has invested $55 million in the Bitwise ETF. The subsequent purchase will be made with $30 million in Bitcoin, with the USDC stablecoin serving as a strategic positioning tool for optimal Bitcoin entry timing. This methodology enables treasuries to avoid Bitcoin’s volatility while maintaining readiness for favorable purchasing opportunities. Figma’s risk disclosures acknowledge the impact of Bitcoin ETF volatility, noting that a 10% decline in Bitcoin prices would result in a $7 million reduction in the fair value of its investment. “ A hypothetical 10% decrease in the price of the Bitcoin exchange traded fund would decrease the fair value of this investment as of March 31, 2025 by $7.0 million ,” the filing said. The company emphasizes that unrealized losses are related to Bitcoin price movements rather than credit-specific factors, thereby avoiding the recognition of expected credit losses. Corporate Bitcoin adoption has accelerated dramatically, with 141 companies now holding 849,245 BTC, worth $91 billion at current prices of $107,144. Source: BitcoinTreasuries However, most corporations opt for direct Bitcoin ownership through treasury management rather than ETF exposure, as seen in Figma’s approach. The design software company’s filing coincides with broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, including UniCredit’s structured Bitcoin ETF product for Italian professional clients , which offers capital protection features. With no local spot Bitcoin ETFs approved, UniCredit’s certificate offers a controlled entry point into digital assets. #btcetf #italy https://t.co/c5uT0P0oMS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 These developments, particularly the strategic corporate accumulation of Bitcoin, indicate growing institutional interest in regulated Bitcoin exposure. In fact, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts spot Bitcoin ETFs could collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated 1.1 million BTC within one year. If the trend persists for a year, the current ETF inflows suggest institutional accumulation may exceed individual holdings exponentially. Regulatory Clarity Drives ETF Innovation and Adoption The filing arrives as the SEC streamlines crypto ETF regulations through new guidance issued July 1 . The new SEC’s guideline for token-based ETFs establishes structured disclosure frameworks that benefit companies like Figma, which seek regulated exposure to cryptocurrency. The SEC has issued new guidance to clarify crypto ETF filings, aiming to streamline approvals for token-based exchange-traded products. #CryptoETFs #SEC https://t.co/gshzi1Qa55 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 New requirements cover net asset value calculations, custody practices, service provider selection, and potential conflicts of interest for crypto ETF issuers. The regulatory framework enables generic listing processes that could allow qualifying crypto ETPs to bypass traditional 19b-4 rule changes. Exchanges may list crypto ETFs after 75-day reviews, significantly reducing time-to-market for new products and expanding investment options. Notably, Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund conversion to spot ETF status demonstrates regulatory progress toward multi-asset cryptocurrency funds. The fund, which has been approved, holds Bitcoin (79.9%), Ethereum (11.3%), as well as XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This provides diversified crypto exposure through a single, regulated vehicle. This development is not isolated to Bitcoin. Similarly, Bloomberg analysts assign 95% approval odds for Solana, Litecoin, and XRP spot ETFs to arrive in the second half of 2025, with approval for a crypto index ETF possible this week. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Over 70 cryptocurrency ETFs currently await SEC review, spanning various digital assets beyond Bitcoin. In fact, the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF launched on Wednesday as the first US-listed fund to incorporate crypto staking. The ETF was approved after meeting SEC requirements, which included a 40% allocation to overseas exchange-traded products.

2025-07-02T18:45:16,"Bitfinex Warns Momentum Fading for Bitcoin, Hints at Local Top Rather Than Vertical Acceleration for BTC","The research arm of a top crypto exchange thinks Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be losing momentum. In a new research report , Bitfinex notes that BTC’s broader market structure remains healthy, with longer-term support levels still standing. Current data, however, suggests the top crypto asset is heading into a transition phase, according to the exchange. “Both order flow data and on-chain metrics are now aligning to suggest consolidation or a local top, rather than continued vertical acceleration. Spot volume has cooled, taker buy pressure has weakened, and profit-taking has intensified – especially among short-term holders who rode the move from sub-$80,000 levels.” BTC is trading at $105,864 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 1% in the past 24 hours. Bitfinex’s researchers argue that Bitcoin could witness short-term price upticks but will likely remain range-bound until it sees a significant surge in new demand. “For now, Bitcoin is in a waiting game. Structural positioning remains intact, and there’s no major breakdown risk as long as $94-99,000 holds. But for new all-time highs to be reclaimed, a catalyst, either in the form of macro relief, strong ETF flow momentum, or a breakout in global liquidity, will be necessary.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:42:29,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF now earns more annual fees than its S&P 500 ETF","BlackRock is making more money from Bitcoin than from the S&P 500. No one expected it to happen this fast, but now it has. The $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is generating more annual fee revenue than the $624 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). The numbers are clear: IBIT brings in $187.2 million a year, just above the $187.1 million IVV earns. This comes from Bloomberg data calculated as of July 1. The reason this is happening? Fees. IBIT charges a 0.25% expense ratio, while IVV only charges 0.03%. And despite being almost nine times smaller, IBIT has drawn steady inflows in 17 out of the last 18 months, mostly from a mix of regular investors and huge institutions. BlackRock didn’t say anything when asked to comment, but the revenue shift speaks for itself. Bitcoin fund takes control of ETF cash Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, IBIT has pulled in $52 billion out of the $54 billion in total inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs. That gives it control of more than 55% of the total market, based on Bloomberg’s figures. It’s already one of the top 20 ETFs by trading volume. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said this showed how much investors wanted easy Bitcoin access without dealing with new platforms. “It’s an indication of how much pent-up demand there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio without having to open a separate account somewhere else,” he said. Hickey also pointed out how Bitcoin has completely outpaced smaller altcoins in how it’s seen by investors, as the clear store of value. Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management, said IBIT passing IVV in revenue shows two things: people want Bitcoin, and stock ETF fees are shrinking. “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios,” Nate said. The IBIT and IVV combo could help BlackRock pass State Street in overall ETF trading. Right now, BlackRock handles 25% of ETF trading by dollar volume, with State Street ahead at 31%, based on Bloomberg Intelligence numbers shared by Athanasios Psarofagis. Bitcoin’s rise has also been backed by Wall Street, especially Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has spent billions buying the coin outright. Hedge funds are also going after convertible debt linked to Strategy, using trades that involve shorting the stock while holding the bonds. Bitcoin stays stable while traders adjust But while the money keeps flooding in, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t been moving much lately. In the last two months, it’s been stuck in a range between $93,000 and $111,000, one of the tightest stretches in years. It was trading at around $108,480 on Wednesday, up about 2.4%. The low volatility is a major change from the wild swings of past years, when the price could move 5% or more in a single day. This quiet period is backed by the Deribit BTC Volatility Index, which tracks expected 30-day price swings. It’s now at the lowest level in two years. Source: Deribit Michael Longoria, a research analyst at GSR, said this signals a change in how Bitcoin is viewed. “Bitcoin is becoming less speculative and more akin to a volatile macro asset,” he said. With volatility down, traders looking to profit from big moves are seeing fewer chances. Some investors have shifted to writing call options on Bitcoin they already own, which gives them some income while limiting how far the price can move. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said this kind of trading is now common. “These are kind of covered call overwriting strategies, and they basically have the effect of lowering volatility,” David said. He added that in the past, most options investors were looking for leverage and quick upside. But now, more are focused on controlling risk and earning steady returns. This calmer market fits with who’s in control now. A report from Glassnode shows that while transaction volume is going down, settlement value is going up. That means fewer trades, but each one carries more value. More high-net-worth players are holding large positions, while individual traders are stepping back.

2025-07-02T18:41:49,"Peter Thiel and Billionaire Consortium To Launch New Bank Serving Cryptocurrency Startups: Report","PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and a handful of other tech billionaires are reportedly launching a new bank partially dedicated to serving crypto startups. According to a new report from Financial Times, Thiel and other investors – such as the CEO of military contracting company Anduril – to create a bank called Erebor, which references to popular fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. FT says the billionaires intend for the bank to serve crypto startups and take the place of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a crypto-friendly bank that ended up going bankrupt in 2023. However, the Erebor plans to lend traditionally as well. As stated by the bank in its public application to acquire the necessary licenses to operate in the US, according to FT, “The bank will be a national bank… providing traditional banking products, as well as virtual currency-related products and services, for businesses and individuals.” FT says the bank will focus on key industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), defense, manufacturing, digital assets as well as non-US companies looking to access the US banking system. People close to the matter say that Thiel and others have been mulling over launching Erebor since the collapse of SVB, which was the go-to bank for crypto firms for many years. According to the report, Erebor also said in its application filing that it would be looking to “differentiate itself” by serving those who “are not well served by traditional or disruptive financial institutions, in particular with respect to insufficient access to credit.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T18:32:38,"Top Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Predictions as of Late","TL;DR Despite being on a downtrend, SHIB has caught the attention of crypto analysts and even NBA legend Scottie Pippen, with predictions of a 40% rally and signs of a classic trend reversal forming. The lead developer Shytoshi Kusama teased multiple upcoming announcements, fueling speculation that July could be successful period for the meme coin. The Next Potential Targets Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a substantial resurgence on a couple of occasions last year, but it currently trades far below those peaks. As of this writing, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is worth roughly $0.00001136, meaning a 33% decline on a yearly scale. Still, it remains the subject of bullish price predictions. Earlier today (July 2), the X user Dami-Defi argued that SHIB “bounced off key daily support and broke its local downtrend.” The analyst described this as a “classic reversal setup,” envisioning a 40% spike to as high as $0.00001600. For their part, the X user PumpSwap Alpha expects a price explosion in the short term: I’m anticipating a major move on $SHIB soon. The pump feels overdue. Like this if you believe Shiba Inu is about to explode in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/tw8lhQmwR7 — PumpSwap Alpha (@PumpswapAlpha) June 30, 2025 It is worth noting that the NBA legend Scottie Pippen also put his name among the optimists. He recently asked his more than 700,000 followers on X which cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin (BTC) they are bullish on, saying his picks include SHIB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, and other well-known altcoins. This isn’t the first time Pippen has shown interest in assets different than BTC. In May, he claimed that the altcoin season “is here,” shifting his attention toward SHIB, XRP, ETH, SOL, ADA, and more. The Calm Before the Storm? Important elements that could trigger a price ascent for SHIB are potential partnerships that the project may ink in the near future or groundbreaking disclosures involving its ecosystem. Earlier this week, Shytoshi Kusama said on X that the community should be prepared for “many announcements, releases, and discussions around everything we’ve built thus far and where we see the future going.” Some of the people commenting on the post took this as a positive sign that the ongoing month could be highly successful for the meme coin. However, only time will tell whether this will be the case.
