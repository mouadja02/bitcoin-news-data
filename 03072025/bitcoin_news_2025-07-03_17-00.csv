2025-07-03T14:52:51,"Corporations Outpace ETFs in Bitcoin Purchases for Third Straight Quarter","The price of the first cryptocurrency remains resilient thanks to demand from publicly traded companies. In parallel, the SEC is accelerating the approval of exchange-traded funds based on crypto-assets. This was reported by analysts at QCP Capital . Public companies have outpaced ETFs in Bitcoin purchases for the third consecutive quarter. Firms like ProCap BTC LLC, Strategy, and Metaplanet continue to build positions in Bitcoin, viewing it as a strategic asset. This reinforces the narrative of buying on price drawdowns, QCP noted. Regulators Are Accelerating Adoption The Commission has approved the launch of Ethereum- and Solana-based ETFs with staking capabilities and has also given the green light to the Grayscale fund, which includes BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. The SEC is considering common listing standards for token-based funds. According to QCP, this initiative could simplify and expedite their approval process in the future. Corporate Adoption The trend of adding digital assets to corporate balance sheets is growing: Bitmine raised $20 million to accumulate Ethereum and generate staking revenue. DeFi Development received $100 million to acquire Solana and buy back shares. Infrastructure players are also expanding their presence. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle has applied for a banking license in the US. Robinhood has been active in Europe, launching open-ended futures and tokenized shares. Market Analysis Liquidity in the cryptocurrency market continues to grow. Solana futures volume on the CME reached a record 1.75 million contracts, and XRP futures trading volume exceeded $500 million in the first month. Meanwhile, implied volatility remains near historic lows. Traders' positions indicate accumulation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's dominance is holding at a multi-year high of 65–66%. Analysts noted that retail traders have taken a pause, while institutional traders are quietly building up positions. Experts expect a possible change in the volatility regime in the third and fourth quarters. Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. remain favorable for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. President Donald Trump has criticized Fed chief Jerome Powell and signaled that he intends to appoint a successor committed to cutting rates. Markets are already pricing in more rate cuts than the Federal Reserve is predicting. This positive sentiment has spread to digital assets, although the backdrop in the altcoin sector remains subdued. In June, QCP stated that Bitcoin would benefit from global uncertainty. On July 1, U.S. ETFs based on Bitcoin recorded an outflow of $342.2 million. That broke a 15-day streak totaling $4.7 billion.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9798/corporations-outpace-et-fs-in-bitcoin-purchases-for-third-straight-quarter,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T14:47:00,"BlackRock Buys $3.85B in Bitcoin as IBIT Overtakes S&P 500 ETF in Revenue","BlackRock Buys $3.85B in Bitcoin in June BlackRock added a significant sum to its Bitcoin holdings in June, adding around $3.85 billion worth of BTC, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham. The acquisitions included a $1.4 billion buy made in six consecutive days, demonstrating BlackRock’s growing confidence in the future worth of Bitcoin. This momentum occurs as institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains strong, with BlackRock being the clear leader in the space. IBIT Now Tops IVV in Fee Revenue Annually BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which launched last January 2024, has fast become a behemoth in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF space. According to Bloomberg (July 2), IBIT is now topping BlackRock’s own S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in fee revenue per annum. Even with IVV’s $624 billion in AUM overshadowing IBIT’s $52.4 billion, IBIT’s 0.25% fee has raked in the firm $187.2 million a year in fees—higher than the $187.1 million from IVV’s lower 0.03% fee. Quickest ETF to Reach $70 Billion AUM IBIT recently made history, too, as the fastest ETF to hit $70 billion in assets managed. It achieved this in just 341 days—approximately five times faster than the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which took 1,691 days. The fund presently holds over 55% of the overall U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF assets and accounts for 96% of the market’s net inflows. BlackRock’s Total Bitcoin Holdings Top $80B Following its June spree of shopping, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings are now valued at over 696,874 BTC, which is approximately $80.7 billion in today’s market value. The aggressive accumulation represents BlackRock’s wager on Bitcoin as a permanent institutional holding—and a bet that ETF-based access will remain the investors’ entry point of preference.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/blackrock-buys-3-85b-in-bitcoin-as-ibit-overtakes-sp-500-etf-in-revenue/,"BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T14:45:16,"BTC liveliness in 2025 shows a trend of accumulation","The first half of 2025 arrived with several price records. This cycle turned out differently, as whales tended to hold, instead of distribute. Since January 2025, a trend of holding has established itself for BTC. The liveliness metric shows that, compared to previous rallies, the current market has not led to coin distribution. Liveliness is a metric of how many coins are spent versus how many are held, and reflects directly on-chain activity. Large holders preferred to accumulate coins, turning into long-term BTC supporters. The BTC liveliness metric slowed down in 2025 | Source: Chain Exposed Since the start of 2025, the liveliness metric points to a holding trend, rather than distribution. BTC has also not seen panic-selling or capitulation during this year’s bull market, as retail already liquidated its holdings during previous bull markets. The recent trend of holding arrived at a time when BTC fluctuated in a new tight range, mostly above $100,000, with the occasional dip to the $80,000 range. This time, even the market drawdown did not create panic-selling. The recent accumulation continued as BTC traded above $109,000 during the latest market recovery. Later, BTC jumped again to $110,360, on track to new all-time peaks. BTC transactions slow down The 2025 market cycle also continues without a deep correction, as drawdowns rarely exceeded 25% of the market price. The perception of BTC also changed, turning from a speculative asset to a store of value. BTC transaction fees also indicate extremely low on-chain activity. Transaction fees range between $0.15 and $0.30, despite the price hovering within a few thousand dollars of a new all-time high. During previous market rallies, transactions would pick up for BTC, often creating network congestion. This cycle, even near-record prices, rarely spikes on-chain activity. At the same time, BTC accumulates into a new set of wallets, with the most rapid growth among wallets holding 100-1,000 and 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. The trend was especially clear in June, when whales accumulated a record 800,000 BTC in a single month. New wallets also shift to holding Almost all cohorts have shifted to holding, though short-term wallets sometimes distribute coins and tokens. Based on the holder heat map, all wallets aged six months or over have gradually increased their balances. By the end of June 2025, around 62% of BTC had not moved for over 12 months . Briefly, some of the whales distributed their coins, though not as dramatically as in previous market cycles. The biggest redistribution followed the 2018 rally, where only 42% of coins remained unmoved in older wallets. The current holding trend also comes from corporate buyers, who are buying new BTC almost daily, with the goal of holding for the long term. 2025, to date, has also shown much more lively inflows of BTC into accumulation addresses. BTC exchange reserves and OTC desks are getting depleted, while coins accumulate in whale wallets, including custodial services. At the same time, speculative trading mostly relies on perpetual futures, using stablecoin liquidity, with little demand for storing and sending BTC.

2025-07-03T14:32:08,"Investment Giant Franklin Templeton Issues Serious Warning About Bitcoin (BTC)!","Institutional Bitcoin (BTC) adoption has been increasing rapidly in recent months, with many companies adopting either a Bitcoin treasury strategy or a warning from the US asset management giant. According to The Block, Franklin Templeton, one of the leading asset management firms in the United States, warned about the risks associated with institutional Bitcoin treasury strategies. Franklin Templeton analysts said the future of institutional BTC and crypto treasury strategies is uncertain and depends on several critical factors. “Inspired by Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) move into Bitcoin, this speculative approach is rapidly gaining momentum. And it's not just limited to Bitcoin. While cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and XRP are the subject of corporate treasury strategy, 135 public companies accumulate only BTC. Strategy, Metaplanet and Twenty One are adopting a BTC strategy, while SharpLink ETH, Upexi and Sol Strategies are implementing a SOL strategy. However, there are risks to this.” At this point, Franklin Templeton analysts said that if the market-NAV ratio falls below 1, it brings with it a series of risks. According to analysts, if this ratio falls below 1, new stock issuances become dilutive and companies may have difficulty raising additional capital without hurting existing shareholders, which could halt capital formation. Worse still, if cryptocurrency prices fall, companies will be forced to sell their holdings to cover crypto losses and maintain stock prices, which will further drive down crypto prices, analysts said. Analysts added that institutional Bitcoin and the crypto treasury model will see greater adoption, but these companies could become quite risky investments in the event of a significant decline or a prolonged bear market. “If Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices fall, companies will sell their assets to protect their stock prices. This can undermine the value of cryptocurrencies and investor confidence, leading to a negative vicious cycle.” *This is not investment advice.

The Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank reported a breach that impacted 1,222 Texans, according to a notification published on the Texas Attorney General’s website. The notification doesn’t include the number of out-of-state residents that were impacted, so the total scope of the breach remains unknown. Stolen information includes names, addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, government-issued ID numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers, debit card numbers and birth dates. Western Alliance Bank reports nearly $83 billion in consolidated assets, according to U.S. Federal Reserve Statistics. In a separate filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General earlier this year, the bank reported that an unauthorized actor exploited a vulnerability in a third-party file transfer software system it uses, stealing information from 21,899 customers. It remains unclear if both filings are related to the same breach or not. The other recent breach involved the Texas-based Peoples Bank, which impacted 668 people in the state. Stolen info from Peoples Bank includes names, addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers, debit card numbers, medical information and birth dates.

2025-07-03T14:25:45,"XLM Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris Presale for Faster Returns","The post XLM Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris Presale for Faster Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Not every day do price prediction experts shift focus from a legacy coin to a rising star. But that’s exactly what’s happening right now. With Stellar’s XLM stuck in a cycle of slow growth, top analysts are quietly pivoting their eyes toward Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) as the next big breakout. And they’re not alone. Thousands of early crypto adopters are already placing their bets on this high-speed contender that’s built for the next generation of wealth creation. Stellar’s Legacy vs the Need for Speed There’s no denying XLM has played an important role in the crypto evolution. It’s helped shape the idea of fast, low-cost transactions for cross-border payments. However, as newer blockchains redefine what fast and scalable truly means, XLM’s progress has started to feel a little sluggish. Its vision remains noble, but its ceiling looks increasingly limited for investors hoping to ride a fresh wave of returns. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Turning Heads Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a fork or clone. It’s a reimagined financial engine, merging the value stability of Bitcoin with the scalability and energy efficiency of modern architectures. It introduces a dual-layer blockchain that uses Proof of Work for security and Delegated Proof of Stake for blazing-fast consensus. The result? A blockchain that clocks in at over 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality. And yes, it’s mobile-first. That means you can mine directly through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, designed to make wealth-building accessible to literally anyone with a smartphone. Even if you’ve never touched a mining rig in your life, you can start earning passively using just your device and the app’s energy-optimized algorithm. Visit the mining rewards tool at this calculator to preview potential income. What Makes BTC-S More Than Just Fast Speed is just the start. Bitcoin Solaris delivers a serious punch when it comes to decentralized functionality and sustainable scalability: Dual-consensus engine balances decentralization with usability. Smart contract support enables real-world DeFi and business apps. Validator rotation and slashing mechanisms improve security. Energy-efficient operation with over 99 percent less power draw than Bitcoin. Bridges under development for seamless asset transfer across chains. These features aren’t promises. They’re already being tested, optimized, and fine-tuned in preparation for the upcoming mainnet. More importantly, development is progressing fast. A recent dev update revealed public access to the testnet is nearing, alongside a complete developer toolkit and wallet upgrades. Influencers and Communities Backing the Move BTC-S isn’t growing in the shadows. Some of crypto’s most active influencers and review outlets are already buzzing about it. The review by Token Galaxy dives deep into why Bitcoin Solaris may be the best shot at early-mover wealth in 2025. Crypto Vlog highlights the app’s ease of use and growing hype among grassroots investors. Crypto Show explains the technical edge behind the Helios consensus system and how it’s beating legacy protocols. These aren’t paid spots. These are passionate crypto voices reacting to a project that feels like the perfect storm of timing, tech, and traction. Stop Chasing Crypto Hype Start Building With BTC-S Presale Momentum Is Heating Up With only around 4 weeks left in one of the shortest presales in crypto history, Bitcoin Solaris is running hot. The price is currently $10 with the next phase bumping it to $11 and a projected launch price of $20. That’s a potential 150 percent gain for anyone who acts now. So far, over 13,650 unique users have joined, and the $6M+ raised signals both community belief and investor urgency. As always, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. This isn’t just a presale. It’s a chance to enter a movement before it becomes mainstream. And if that sounds dramatic, ask the people who bought Bitcoin under $50. A Quick Look at the Token Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a fair and transparent distribution model. You can see the full breakdown here , but in short: 66.66% is reserved for mining over the next 90 years. Only 20% is in the presale, limiting dump risks. 0.33% allocated to the team, keeping the supply community-driven. This structure reflects a long-term vision that puts miners, users, and builders at the center of BTC-S’s future. More Than a Coin, It’s a Roadmap for Impact For those curious about what’s coming after the launch, you’ll be impressed by the BTC-S development arc. According to the official roadmap, upcoming milestones include Solana bridge integration, AI-optimized governance, a Mining Power Marketplace, and even Fortune 500 partnership targets. You can check the full timeline here . In short, this isn’t a quick pump. It’s a build. A bold one. Final Verdict If you’re scanning the crypto landscape wondering where your next big return will come from, Bitcoin Solaris deserves a front-row spot on your radar. It combines proven blockchain mechanics with next-gen design, delivering a system that is scalable, secure, and shockingly user-friendly. While legacy coins like XLM continue to serve their roles, BTC-S is here to build wealth. The window is short, the presale is moving fast, and the potential is massive. You’ve missed a few trains before. Don’t miss this one.

2025-07-03T14:24:41,"Bitcoin Breaks $110,000: What’s Fueling the Crypto Comeback?","On July 3, Bitcoin’s price hit a three-week high, crossing $110,000. The recovery came amid global money supply (M2) growth, which reached a new all-time high (ATH) of over $55 trillion. Bitcoin tested $110,000. Ethereum and altcoins gave positive signals. Market Overview In a commentary for The Block, BTC Markets crypto analyst Rachel Lucas attributed the day’s market growth to macroeconomic liquidity: “While it doesn't always lead to immediate price movements, such funds eventually find their way into risky assets like cryptocurrencies with some delay.” Lucas believes the market needs a ”sustained catalyst” for a true breakout to all-time highs. This could be a clearer understanding of future interest rates by the Federal Reserve or a further influx of investment in ETFs. “It is institutional investment that has quietly sustained this rise, and for a decisive breakthrough it must continue,” she said. ETF Flows and Investor Sentiment On July 1, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for the first time in 15 days, possibly indicating investor doubts. The next day, July 2, the chart of total inflows into exchange-traded funds reached a new all-time high (ATH), which pulled Bitcoin’s price higher. Possible Growth Factors Among the possible growth factors: U.S. President Donald Trump praised a new trade agreement with Vietnam, opening market access for U.S. manufacturers. Ripple confirmed its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a federal banking license. Renewed hopes for a Fed rate cut after a series of mild statements from U.S. central bank officials. Given Bitcoin’s solid breakout from its recent sideways range, analysts are becoming more confident that a new all-time high is imminent. Analyst Insights Market researcher Jackis noted a rare phenomenon: Bitcoin volatility recently reached its lowest levels since 2023. “Every time we reached these values, a massive spike in volatility followed within five weeks (and sometimes sooner),” Jackis observed. Titan of Crypto, a technical analysis specialist, drew attention to the bullish crossover of the MACD indicator on the daily chart. He considers this a strong momentum signal and noted that Bitcoin is trying to break out of a bullish flag pattern. If the breakout is successful, an exit to the $137,000 level is possible. Altcoins Emerge as Ethereum Accelerates Altcoins are coming out of the shadows, while Ethereum is accelerating. Ethereum and other altcoins have shown signs of life following Bitcoin. The price of ETH added more than 8% over the last 24 hours, breaking above the $2,600 mark. Grayscale’s head of research, Zach Pandl, said in a Decrypt commentary that he expects new highs for many tokens in the second half of the year, despite current asset valuations within recent ranges. “Recent crypto-ETP endorsements could boost investor confidence that capital from traditional finance will start flowing into altcoins as well,” Pandl said. He noted that the growing regulatory clarity in the U.S. is likely to attract more users and capital to the crypto ecosystem. “Bitcoin is like a backseat passenger today, with altcoins leading the market,” Pandl added. Ethereum Accumulation and Staking Trends CryptoQuant expert Carmelo Aleman is positive about Ethereum. According to his data, accumulation addresses that meet strict criteria (do not belong to centralized exchanges, have minimal or zero ETH withdrawals) have set a new historical record. As of June 30, they held approximately 22.75 million ETH, up 35.97% for the month. The average purchase price as of July 1 was $2,114.70. At Ethereum’s current price of around $2,600, these addresses are up over 23%. Aleman pointed out a new all-time high in liquid staking volume at 35.56 million ETH. This is because the majority of accumulation addresses belong to institutional investors, ETFs, and large holders who are profiting from liquid staking as they await further price appreciation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9796/bitcoin-breaks-110-000-what-s-fueling-the-crypto-comeback,"BTC|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Federal Police sources confirm that the breach is a massive infiltration of Brazil’s national payment system, with stolen funds immediately routed through cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter desks in an attempt to convert the money into Bitcoin and USDT. Central Bank technicians worked through the night to investigate the incident after C&M was immediately disconnected from the financial system, while multiple crypto service providers blocked suspicious transactions and froze accounts linked to the attack. Infrastructure Breach Exposes Crypto Conversion Network C&M Software confirmed in a statement to Valor Econômico that it was “ a direct victim of criminal action, which included the improper use of customer credentials to attempt to fraudulently access its systems and services. “ Hackers teriam desviado milhões de reais após invadir empresa que conecta instituições financeiras ao Pix https://t.co/K7s94En4OH — Valor Econômico (@valoreconomico) July 2, 2025 The attackers exploited C&M’s role as a messaging gateway for Brazil’s Instant Payment System (PIX), gaining unauthorized access to transfer protocols that connect banks, fintechs, and payment processors to the national financial infrastructure. Immediately after the theft, they began moving the stolen funds to cryptocurrency providers integrated with PIX, attempting to purchase USDT and Bitcoin through exchanges, gateways, and OTC desks. SmartPay CEO Rocelo Lopes noted in a statement released that his company “ detected that there was a problem at 00:18 on June 30, due to the atypical movement on both platforms ” and automatically raised validation filters on USDT and Bitcoin purchases. “ Large sums of money were withheld and, at the same time, the process of returning them to the institutions involved was carried out ,” Lopes explained, adding that many crypto OTC desks denied registration and operations by the hackers. Industry sources have revealed that blockchain monitoring tools detected significant transactions to various cryptocurrency companies, although the exact amount successfully converted to digital assets remains under investigation. However, despite the gravity of the attack, BMP emphasized in its official statement that “ no BMP customer was impacted or had their funds accessed ,” clarifying that the attack “ exclusively involved funds deposited in its reserve account at the Central Bank ” and that the institution “ has sufficient collateral to fully cover the impacted amount. “ Crypto Rails Become Highway for Traditional Financial Crime This attack adds to the growing concern of crypto’s expanding role as an exit ramp for traditional financial crimes, with digital assets providing liquidity and pseudo-anonymity that cash cannot match at scale. Stablecoins have become particularly attractive to illicit networks, with the Financial Action Task Force recently warning that their use by criminal organizations poses growing risks without coordinated global regulation. The FATF has urged governments to tighten crypto AML rules, warning that regulatory gaps still pose risks to global financial security. #FATF #AntiMoneyLaundering https://t.co/s6De83vskd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 27, 2025 The Brazilian heist follows a pattern of major crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit exchange hack and Chinese police uncovering a $136 million laundering network that used digital currencies for cross-border transfers. Global regulators are struggling to keep pace with these hybrid attacks, where traditional banking systems are breached but digital assets provide the escape route. Recent enforcement actions, such as OKX’s $505 million settlement for anti-money laundering violations , have particularly focused on the role of crypto platforms in facilitating illicit fund flows. Looking forward, the Brazilian authorities are taking steps to trace the stolen funds across multiple blockchain networks while coordinating with international partners to freeze assets and identify the perpetrators behind the country’s most significant financial cyberattack.

2025-07-03T14:10:41,"Bitcoin’s Rebound Pushed Most Investors Back into Profit","Bitcoin has rallied above $107,000, taking the vast majority of investors back into profit, says blockchain data platform Glassnode , with total unrealized gains hitting a whopping $1.2 trillion. The coin currently stands at $109,716, having appreciated 2% over the last 24 hours. The market overall is experiencing an uptick, with nearly all coins in green at the time of writing. Also, looking at both the Market Capitalization and Realized Cap measures, Glassnode found “substantial growth” this cycle. The former surged from $304 billion to $2.13 trillion, and the latter jumped from $400 billion to $955 billion. “Together, they highlight not only the substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin, but also its maturation toward becoming a multi-trillion-dollar asset,” it argues. As $BTC rebounds to $107k, most holders are back into profit. But distribution remains muted – investors are holding through. Realized profits decline, LTH supply hits ATH, and ETF inflows stay strong. Learn what to make of it in the latest Week On-Chain: https://t.co/Rc00Ql7P5x pic.twitter.com/g5OIvhk8lD — glassnode (@glassnode) July 2, 2025 Moreover, the total unrealized profit is currently at $1.2 trillion. This indicates “the substantial value appreciation” which BTC investors have seen, as well as “the incentive for potential sell-side pressure that may emerge if sentiment shifts.” Source: Glassnode Meanwhile, the average paper gains (losses held by the average market participant) stand at +125%. The report claims this suggests that BTC investors are “sitting on significant profits.” This number is still lower than the +180% profitability seen in March 2024 when the price hit the ATH of $73,000 and December 2024 when it hit $00,000. That said, some $872 million worth is locked in profit daily at this point. This is lower than the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in realized profit seen during the ATHs of $73,000 and $107,000, respectively. Notably, the report highlights, recent drops didn’t “significantly impact investor profitability.” Moreover, valuation frameworks show a positive profitability across holders of all coin ages. Source: Glassnode The market jump comes after several days of consecutive, albeit relatively minor, decreases that followed Israel’s attack on Iran , resulting in casualties and further conflict in the region. Given that geopolitical headlines influence the crypto market, the risk of further downside remains, Glassnode says. However, the decrease in tensions between the two countries helped stabilize market sentiment and fuel price recovery. Moreover, per the analysts, “the market’s ability to hold the Short-Term Holder cost basis during such a volatile and uncertain period is a constructive signal, suggesting that the bulls are still in control, and that underlying momentum may remain skewed to the upside.” You may also like: Crypto Market Enters Holding Pattern and Fatigue Grows, But Will the Bull Stay? The world’s first and most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has remained range-bound recently. This comes as crypto market profit-taking slows, spot volume fades, activity metrics cool, and futures sentiment turns cautious, according to the latest report by blockchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode. Without a notable influx of new demand, upside momentum will remain limited.BTC has been trading in a $100,000–$110,000 range, where it has been consolidating since 8 May. Macro... Investors Brace for Possible Increase in Market Volatility Citing Glassnode data, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , noted that “Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics continue to showcase the strength of its current market position.” BTC supply in profit rising reinforces “just how bullish recent momentum has been,” Chait says in an email. However, he also warns that elevated levels of profit are often followed by increased market volatility. “Historically, when such a high percentage of supply sits in profit, the chances of profit-taking rise. That, in turn, introduces short-term market movements even when there is a broadly optimistic outlook,” Chait argues. Meanwhile, the Glassnode report found that, despite a surge in profitability, investor behavior shows a strong preference for HODLing. The current price range seems insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking, it noted. Several metrics show this, namely declining realized profits, a downtrend in Liveliness, and Long-Term Holder supply hitting a new ATH. The decline in sell-side pressure can be seen in the total supply held by the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort. It reached a new all-time high of 14.7M BTC. “This underscores that HODLing remains the dominant market behavior amongst investors, with accumulation and maturation flows significantly outweighing distribution pressures,” Glassnode says. Moreover, the behavior of Long-Term Holders further reinforces this argument. After a brief uptick in sell-side pressure into the ATH, this cohort slowed their spending as well. Finally, the Liveliness metric saw significant upticks during the two previous BTC price ATH formations. This suggested that spending activity and profit taking took over the market. Yet, during the latest ATH formation, Liveliness trended downward, reinforcing “that HODLing remains the dominant behavior among investors, and that a range expansion in price may be necessary to incentivize renewed spending activity.” You may also like: Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 3, 2025 The crypto market is up today, after several days of trending mildly downwards.

As investors digested the non-farm payrolls report, the Dow opened more than 100 points higher, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite edging up to fresh all-time highs. The S&P 500 was up nearly 0.5% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite had added 0.6%. The gains followed upward momentum in the futures market, where the benchmark S&P 500 hovered near its previous record. The Dow, currently trading at 44,782, is now within striking distance of the 45,000 level, marking a strong run from the 38,000 level it traded at just in April.

According to the report, job gains were strongest in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. The unemployment rate also surprised to the upside, falling to 4.1% versus forecasts of a rise to 4.3%.

2025-07-03T14:06:44,"Bahrain Central Bank Launches First Stablecoin Issuance and Offering Rules—Will Crypto Soar?","The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has launched its first regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and offerings, establishing the Gulf nation as one of the few jurisdictions in the region with a formal rulebook governing the activity. The new rules issued under Volume 6 of the CBB Capital Markets Rulebook, are designed to provide legal clarity and oversight for stablecoin issuers operating in or from Bahrain. Bahrain Unveils Comprehensive Stablecoin Regulations, Marking a First for the Kingdom According to the framework , the offering, issuance, minting, and burning of stablecoins, as well as the custody and reserve asset management associated with them, will now be treated as regulated financial activities. The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has released its new Stablecoin Issuance and Offering (SIO) Module, the country’s first regulatory framework allowing the compliant issuance of stablecoins. Previously, CBB granted Binance subsidiary BPay Global a license to operate as a payment… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 3, 2025 Entities intending to offer such services must obtain a license from the CBB, and no stablecoin activity may occur in or from Bahrain without prior approval. Also, only fully fiat-backed stablecoins pegged to the Bahraini Dinar, the U.S. Dollar, or other fiat currencies are deemed acceptable by the CBB. In addition, CBB emphasized that issuers must maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio, backed by high-quality, liquid assets that meet stringent risk criteria. The framework also noted that issues must fulfill annual audit obligations, and adhere to robust standards on cybersecurity, internal controls, and consumer protection. Under the new module, the CBB also laid out a multi-layered licensing process in which applicants must demonstrate a minimum paid-up capital of BHD 250,000 and satisfy conditions related to shareholder transparency, governance, risk management, and IT system readiness. Notably, the new licensing framework introduces clear operational and prudential requirements such as issuers providing a stablecoin whitepaper and outlining key details of the project and its financial underpinnings. In particular, the regulations enforce a permanent right of redemption for stablecoin holders, prohibit the payment of interest, and require that all reserve assets be subject to external audits and held in segregated accounts. The CBB emphasized that the body retains the authority to reject any stablecoin issuance it deems contrary to the interests of Bahrain’s national economy or the general public. The body further warns that it reserves the right to impose additional capital buffers if the issuer’s activities are deemed to pose heightened risk to the financial system. Bahrain Expands Digital Asset Momentum with Licensing and Institutional Crypto Products Bahrain continues to reinforce its position as a regional crypto hub through regulatory clarity and growing institutional involvement. In April, BPay Global, a subsidiary of Binance, secured a Payment Service Provider license from the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB). Binance expands in the Gulf as BPay Global secures regulatory approval from Bahrain’s central bank for fiat payments. #CryptoRegulation #Fintech https://t.co/xt7sFsxwAW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 10, 2025 The license allows BPay to operate as a regulated entity, offering fiat on- and off-ramps, custodial services, and e-wallet functionality. This development enables Binance users in Bahrain to make fiat deposits and withdrawals via bank transfers and cards directly on the platform. “This license represents a positive step in enhancing Bahrain’s digital payments ecosystem, particularly in its support for the crypto-related sector as well as fiat payment solutions,” said Abdulla Haji, Director of the CBB’s Licensing Directorate. Bahrain’s push toward regulated crypto finance also extends to traditional institutions.

2025-07-03T14:06:17,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Consolidates After Bull Flag Breakout: What's Next?","Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its bull flag and is currently consolidating above $109,000. Is the all-time high next? How high could the king of the cryptocurrencies go? Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out, has come back to test the breakout, and is now consolidating before the next piece of price action. Could it dip back inside the bull flag? No particular price move can be discarded, and although it makes sense for this upside move to continue, the bulls may run out of steam. $BTC breakout and confirmation Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals the $BTC price breakout and the dip back down to confirm it. However, given that most of the shorter term Stochastic RSI momentum indicators are at or near the top of an overbought condition, it may well be that the price bounces along the top of the bull flag trendline for a while, or as mentioned above, dips back into the flag. All this said, this is a bull flag breakout and it would be more likely for the price to continue upward. At some point, the momentum indicators will need to reset, but this can come in the form of some sideways and downward movement which may not affect the price too much. The next targets for this current move are the higher high at $110,600, and then the all-time high just short of $112,000. Getting above the latter and making a new high should be the final confirmation signal that Bitcoin is heading to the next stage of its upward journey. Bullish daily engulfing candle Source: TradingView The daily chart is looking positive. Yesterday’s daily candle engulfed the previous one by quite some margin, and now a candle has opened well above the 50-day moving average (blue line). At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator is still angled upward, having bounced from the yellow moving average line and the 50.00 level. Current bull flag breakout has big potential upside Source: TradingView The weekly chart above shows the whole of the bull market so far. It can be seen that the price is just emerging from the current bull flag. Although this flag is a lot smaller in scale than the previous falling wedge or the long bull flag that went sideways for much of 2024, the length of the flag pole could translate into a measured move up to $137,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is in a bullish condition. Obviously, this does not confirm until the end of the week, but as it stands, the blue fast line is shaping to cross back above the orange slow line. This can signal the upside price momentum needed by the bulls for this next big move. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-03T14:00:45,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will BTC Hit $120K in the Next Few Days?","Bitcoin is gaining ground as it surges toward its all-time high of $111K, fueled by renewed buying interest and strong technical momentum. With market sentiment shifting positively, expectations are building for a potential breakout that could take BTC to the $120K range in the near future. BTC Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart Following a healthy pullback to the $106K support level, BTC attracted notable demand, leading to a renewed rally back toward its all-time high at $111K. The ongoing price action reflects solid bullish momentum, likely stemming from sustained accumulation within the $100K–$111K consolidation range. A key bullish signal has also emerged: the 100-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average, forming a Golden Cross, historically associated with longer-term bullish trends. This reinforces the current upward trajectory and investor confidence. However, BTC now faces a decisive test at the $111K ATH. A successful breakout above this psychological and technical barrier could ignite a fresh impulsive leg upward, with the $120K mark as the next major target. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, BTC initially faced rejection at the upper boundary of a descending wedge near $108K, triggering a brief dip to $106K. This move, however, was likely a liquidity sweep, a strategic pullback designed to trap retail sellers and enable smart money to accumulate long positions. Following this, the BTC price broke above the wedge structure and completed a bullish retest, confirming the breakout. The cryptocurrency is now gaining momentum again, eyeing the $111K liquidity pool, where a cluster of stop orders likely resides. This area is of high interest to large players seeking to trigger a buy-side liquidity cascade. If bulls can reclaim this level, a breakout is likely to follow, potentially propelling Bitcoin to new highs around $120K. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan This chart presents the Binance Liquidation Heatmap, which visualizes areas where significant liquidation events are likely to unfold. These zones often act as liquidity magnets, drawing price action toward them. Large market participants, commonly known as whales, strategically target these levels to enter or exit positions efficiently. At present, a notable cluster of liquidation levels sits just above Bitcoin’s all-time high of $111K, suggesting a strong probability that the price may be drawn toward this region. If reached, this could spark a short-squeeze, amplifying upward momentum and potentially pushing BTC to new highs. However, this liquidity cluster also reflects persistent selling pressure around current levels. Sellers remain active, keeping the $111K resistance firm. As such, this threshold stands as a critical decision point. A confirmed breakout above could initiate a powerful bullish continuation, while a failure to breach it may result in another rejection and possible retracement.

2025-07-03T14:00:13,"Hamak Limited transitions from gold mining business to Bitcoin corporate treasury","Hamak Gold Limited, a London-listed gold exploration company, announced plans on Thursday to adopt a Bitcoin treasury management policy. The news sent its shares up by 6%, now changing hands at 1.17 GBX. According to a press statement published on July 3, Hamak successfully raised gross proceeds of £2.47 million through a placing and subscription round priced at 0.8 pence per share, a 27% discount from the previous close on July 2, 2025. The deal introduced 308.4 million new ordinary shares, representing 68.2% of Hamak’s newly enlarged share capital of 452.1 million shares. Each new share is accompanied by a two-year warrant exercisable in the second year, with a one-year lock-in period. Hamak Gold funding round to finance Bitcoin treasury Per the company’s statement, existing shareholders will receive warrants on equivalent terms, with the cut-off set as the close of business on July 2, the day before the official announcement. The share issuance process faced regulatory limitations, with Hamak unable to admit all the new shares without publishing an FCA-approved prospectus. As a workaround, the 308 million shares were issued to newly appointed directors Nick Thurlow and James Lawrence, who agreed to resell 283 million of those shares to investors at the issue price. The financing round came against the backdrop of an office shuffle, where former Executive Chairman Amara Kamara and Non-Executive Director Niall Young stepped down, and Thurlow and Lawrence took over as executive chairman and executive director, respectively. One of the investors in the fundraising was MBS Global Investments, which subscribed for £100,000. MBS is the investment arm of the Private Office of Sheikh Nayef Bin Eid Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family. The Qatari investors will see to it that part of the proceeds are used to create a Bitcoin treasury. “ With the injection of additional capital, we are now well-positioned to pursue two core objectives in parallel, maximising our gold exploration opportunities and leading the UK market in bitcoin treasury management as a Main Market-listed company ,” Chair Thurlow said in a statement. Earlier this week, Hamak submitted applications to the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) and the London Stock Exchange for the admission of 308,375,000 new shares to the equity shares (transition) category of the FCA’s Official List. The company expects the shares to begin trading on the main market on or around July 4, 2025. London-registered companies are buying Bitcoin Alongside Hamak, at least nine companies in London have disclosed their intent to purchase digital assets in the past two weeks, taking a similar approach to business intelligence firm Strategy, led by the pro-BTC Michael Saylor in the US. Among these firms is Panther Metals, which recently purchased its first Bitcoin after reporting a £2.2 million loss last year. Panther’s shares have surged over 60% in the last month. Its CEO Darren Hazelwood stated the firm will build up its Bitcoin holdings “quickly,” with a short-term goal of accumulating £4 million worth of the asset. Bluebird Mining Ventures, another natural resources company, raised £2 million in debt to buy Bitcoin and is seeking to secure another £10 million. “The company was on life support before this,” Founder Aidan Bishop remarked, adding that Bluebird had reported a $898,000 loss last year. Vinanz, a company originally formed as a Bitcoin mining operation, announced more Bitcoin acquisitions last week, funded by equity and debt offerings. Its current holdings now total $3.85 million. The market value of Smarter Web Company, a Guildford-based website builder listed on the Aquis Exchange, reportedly surged to £806.2 million in just two months since disclosing its Bitcoin-buying plans in April.

Public firms added 245,510 BTC to their balance sheets from January through June, a 375% jump over the 51,653 BTC they bought in the same stretch last year. At the same time, spot ETF issuers purchased 118,424 BTC, leaving them well behind their corporate counterparts. Related Reading: Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Near Pain Point Last Seen In October 2024 Public Firm Purchases Smash ETF Buys According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, the 245,510 BTC bought by public companies during H1 2025 is more than four times the 118,424 BTC ETF issuers gathered. That ETF component is 56% lower than the 267,878 BTC they purchased in H1 2024, despite the funds experiencing more robust inflows than they experienced towards the end of 2024. The difference indicates increasingly companies are holding Bitcoin directly instead of relying on exchange‑traded products. More Companies Join Bitcoin Rush Data shows 254 entities now hold Bitcoin, and 141 of those are public companies. That marks big growth from the start of the year, when only 67 firms had BTC, and the end of March, when the number hit 79. Those counts translate to a 140% rise in six months and a nearly 80% gain in three months, underlining how many new players have jumped in. Strategy’s Share Of Acquisition Dips Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) still leads corporate buyers, but its slice of the total has shrunk. In H1 2024, Strategy’s purchase of 37,190 BTC made up 72% of all corporate buys. In the first half of 2025, the Michael Saylor‑led company purchased 135,600 BTC but now accounts for 55% of the total—down from its previous dominance. Firms such as Metaplanet, GameStop and ProCap have stepped into the spotlight, each adding large sums to their Bitcoin holdings. Supply Shock Could Be Coming According to industry commentary, the increase in corporate purchasing in addition to continuing ETF demand could take a bite out of available supply. When the next halving event reduces new Bitcoin issuance, less will flow into the market. Analysts caution that increasing institutional interest and declining supply might produce a significant price response. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming As public firms climb aboard and ETFs keep on buying—though at a reduced rate—the battle for Bitcoin is escalating. Although Strategy’s investments have increased in absolute value, the arrival of new buyers indicates the market is expanding. If that trend continues and reward for miners decreases following the halving, the battle for Bitcoin’s scarce supply could get fiercer. Investors and analysts alike will be paying close attention to how these forces influence the price of Bitcoin in the second half of 2025.

2025-07-03T14:00:00,"Hayes’s Warning Shot: A $90K Bitcoin Dip Before a Wall Street-Fueled Boom","Arthur Hayes has predicted a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000. Bitcoin’s price pullback will precede the next rally to higher levels. Bank-issued stablecoins will push trillions of dollars into digital assets. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has predicted a Bitcoin price correction to the $90,000 region before the cryptocurrency’s next rally towards new highs. Hayes analyzed the central bank policy and Wall Street incentives supporting US bank-issued stablecoins, highlighting their potential effect on the digital assets market. The Short-Term Case: A Correction to $90,000 Before the next leg up, Hayes foresees a period of turbulence. He believes a combination of historical market cycles and profit-taking from speculators will weigh on Bitcoin’s price. This pullback could be amplified as traders wait for clearer policy signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve before committing new capital. This potential “summer lull” could see Bitcoin’s price wash out weak hands and establish a new floor around the $90,000 mark, creating a healthier base for future growth.

2025-07-03T13:50:01,"IMF Turns Down Pakistan’s Proposal To Subsidize Electricity For Bitcoin Mining: Report","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s bid to offer subsidised electricity to Bitcoin mining operations, dealing a significant blow to the nation’s bold plans to become a regional crypto hub shortly after its high-profile debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve. While testifying before the Senate Standing Committee on Energy on Thursday, Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan said that the IMF was concerned about creating market distortions. The government had proposed allocating 2,000 megawatts from its 7,000 MW electricity surplus to cryptocurrency mining and other energy-intensive industries at rates of 23-24 Pakistani rupees ($0.08) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). But, the IMF remains skeptical despite surplus power during winter months, cautioning that such incentives resemble tax holidays that have historically undermined market efficiency. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” Irfan told lawmakers, suggesting that the project hasn’t been shelved entirely and is under review by the World Bank and other international partners. The IMF has raised red flags about how the government would transition the subsidized electricity back to market rates and contended that similar initiatives had previously failed to yield results. Pakistan’s Pivot Toward Crypto The development follows Pakistan’s creation of a “National Crypto Council” to oversee the formulation of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and to lure in foreign investors. The newly formed council tapped former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao as strategic advisor. Pakistan’s crypto embrace also includes the announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in May, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib revealed that the government followed the United States’ example in establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve and is embracing pro-crypto regulatory policies. Saqib promised that the country would “never, ever sell” its holdings of the flagship cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, it’s still unknown how many Bitcoins the country plans to hold, and whether these assets will be bought or acquired via other means.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/imf-turns-down-pakistans-proposal-to-subsidize-electricity-for-bitcoin-mining-report/,"BTC|MINING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|IMF",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:45:13,"YZi Labs joins Goldman Sachs, Citadel in $135m Canton Network push","YZi Labs is now part of a growing alliance of regulated and crypto-native players funding Digital Asset’s Canton Network, a blockchain aiming to merge Wall Street-scale operations with on-chain privacy and composability. On July 3, YZi Labs, the venture capital and incubation firm formerly known as Binance Labs, announced its participation in Digital Asset’s $135 million Series E round, which attracted Wall Street heavyweights like Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities, and DTCC. The investment, following Digital Asset’s initial June 24 funding reveal, positions YZi Labs alongside traditional finance’s most influential institutions in backing the Canton Network, a public Layer 1 blockchain seeking to reconcile institutional compliance with decentralized infrastructure. The convergence of companies in the multimillion-dollar funding round represents a strategic alignment between crypto’s builders and TradFi’s gatekeepers. Canton’s configurable privacy model has already processed over $1.5 trillion in monthly tokenized U.S. Treasury repo activity, demonstrating that regulated finance is ready to embrace blockchain, but only on certain terms. You might also like: Michael Saylor’s Strategy hit with class-action lawsuit over $5.9 billion BTC loss The institutional onchain revolution takes shape YZi Labs’ investment in Digital Asset can be seen as a strategic play to participate in the growth of blockchain infrastructure that finally meets Wall Street’s demands. Traditional finance has long viewed public blockchains with skepticism, wary of exposing sensitive transactions to full transparency, while private chains remain isolated and cumbersome. Canton Network’s configurable privacy model changes that equation, allowing institutions to control data visibility without sacrificing interoperability. That’s why YZi Labs, alongside Goldman Sachs and Citadel, sees Canton as the missing link for tokenizing real-world assets at scale. With the $135 million capital injection, the Canton Network plans to accelerate its expansion, focusing on three key areas: infrastructure scalability, faster onboarding for regulated entities, and deeper interoperability between applications. According to the announcement, the network’s roadmap over the next 12 to 18 months includes new live deployments, global market expansion, and more seamless application-level composability. “This investment from YZi Labs reinforces the growing demand for blockchain infrastructure that meets the rigorous standards of global financial markets, Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset, said. “With this new backing, we’re advancing our mission to bring trillions of dollars more in real-world assets on-chain, creating a more connected and efficient financial ecosystem.” YZi Labs’ involvement also signals a strategic pivot under its rebrand from Binance Labs. Since Changpeng Zhao stepped back from Binance’s exchange operations, YZi has doubled down on infrastructure bridging crypto and traditional systems. Its March investment in Plume Network , a modular blockchain for real-world assets, mirrors the Canton playbook: enabling institutions to tokenize everything from carbon credits to private equity. Similarly, backing AI-data startup Vana and token distribution platform Sign earlier this year reveals a pattern: YZi isn’t chasing speculative DeFi trends but funding rails for mass adoption. The firm claims to manage over $10 billion in assets globally.

2025-07-03T13:43:24,"Fight for 40,000 BTC Continues: Judge Allows Celsius’s Lawsuit Against Tether to Proceed","A U.S. bankruptcy judge has ruled that Celsius Network can proceed with its $4.3 billion lawsuit against Tether. The case focuses on claims that the USDT issuer improperly sold nearly 40,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in June 2022. The Judge’s Ruling In court documents filed in New York on Monday, Judge Martin Glenn ruled that some aspects of the multibillion-dollar lawsuit had merit. Celsius had accused the stablecoin company of carrying out a “fire sale” of more than 39,500 BTC and applying the proceeds to a debt of $812 million. The now-defunct crypto lender claimed this was done without following agreed-upon procedures, resulting in losses exceeding $4 billion based on current prices. Judge Glenn argued that the alleged verbal permission from former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to liquidate the collateral was “insufficient.” He added that failing to observe a 10-hour grace period for posting collateral could still count as a breach, “oral permission or not.” The judge also said that the digital asset firm’s awareness of Celsius’s insolvency at the time did not give it a legal basis to act independently. However, he dismissed some parts of the lawsuit. For instance, claims against certain Tether entities were dropped due to a lack of personal jurisdiction. Allegations that rely on applying U.S. bankruptcy law outside the country were also dismissed. The judge further decided that Celsius did not prove the defendant had breached its duties under British Virgin Islands (BVI) law regarding good faith and fair dealing. Details of The Case The dispute is centred on a margin call the USDT provider issued during a decline in BTC’s prices three years ago. Celsius says the agreement included a 10-hour window to post additional collateral, but Tether sold the Bitcoin before that period expired. The crypto lender says the respondent’s actions breached their agreement, violated “good faith and fair dealing” under BVI law, and involved fraudulent and preferential transfers that violate the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to the filing, the assets were liquidated at an average price of $20,656 per coin, which was below market value. Celsius further alleged that the proceeds were later transferred to the stablecoin operator’s Bitfinex accounts. The transactions also involved U.S.-based staff, accounts, and communications, which it believes gives the case enough ties to be handled in a U.S. court. In August 2024, Tether moved to dismiss the case, arguing the court lacked jurisdictional authority and that the crypto lender’s claims had no legal ground. The company called the lawsuit “baseless” and a “shameless litigation money grab.” CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement that Celsius executives had told his organization to sell the BTC “in order to close out its roughly 815 million USDT position.” He added that the lawsuit was an attempt by the bankrupt firm to shift blame for its mismanagement. Celsius completed its bankruptcy process on January 31, 2024, and is currently repaying its creditors. More recently, its former top executive, Mashinsky, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud.

2025-07-03T13:41:39,"Dogecoin’s Wall Street Moment: Why Big Money Is Pouring Into DOGE","Dogecoin (DOGE) is witnessing a surge in institutional interest, mostly fueled by growing optimism over the potential approval of multiple DOGE spot ETFs and regulatory clarity in the U.S. This trend is underscored by significant investments from major companies, with Remixpoint, a Tokyo-based energy consulting firm, ramping up its crypto holdings over the past year. According to an earnings report published Friday, Remixpoint’s crypto holdings surged from just $446,500 on March 31, 2024, to $38 million by December 31, 2024. By February 2025, the company had expanded its crypto portfolio to approximately $59.1 million, representing a 13,000% increase in just nine months, as it moves closer to its $65 million investment target. Notably, the company’s diversified cryptocurrency portfolio includes substantial holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. This strategic move, similar to fellow Japanese company Metaplanet, which has been doubling down on Bitcoin , aims to hedge against the declining value of the yen and broaden Remixpoint’s financial assets. Once regarded primarily as a speculative cryptocurrency propelled by retail traders and online communities, Dogecoin is now gaining traction among institutional investors. Remixpoint’s inclusion of DOGE in its portfolio highlights the evolving perception of the cryptocurrency, which has transitioned from a meme coin to a functional digital asset with expanding real-world applications in payments and blockchain-based innovations. This trend extends beyond Remixpoint. Neptune Digital Assets, a publicly traded Canadian blockchain company, purchased approximately 1 million DOGE tokens for $258,000 in December 2024, reinforcing its position in the cryptocurrency market. Elsewhere, last November, Spirit Blockchain Capital acquired Dogecoin Portfolio Holding Corp to expand Dogecoin’s ecosystem and utility. However, the acquisition focused on intellectual property and cash assets rather than direct DOGE holdings on its balance sheet. Similarly, in July 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company had not sold any of its Dogecoin holdings, though the exact amount remains undisclosed. Notably, Tesla began accepting Dogecoin for select merchandise in December 2021, reinforcing Musk’s ongoing support for the cryptocurrency. That said, the surge in interest for DOGE comes amid discussions surrounding the potential approval of Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale Dogecoin ETFs by the SEC. If approved, these ETFs could further strengthen Dogecoin’s presence in financial markets, potentially boosting its price. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.17, reflecting a 7.01% surge in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/dogecoins-wall-street-moment-why-big-money-is-pouring-into-doge/,"DOGE|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:32:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Sets Sights On $110,000 As Market Rallies","Bitcoin (BTC) rallied sharply on Wednesday, recovering from Tuesday’s low of $105,328 to register an increase of nearly 3%, reclaiming $108,000, and settling at $108,845. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $109,672 as buyers eye the $110,000 mark. BTC’s rally was driven by President Trump’s announcement that the US had struck a trade deal with Vietnam to lower tariffs on exported goods from 46% to 20%. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Seven-Year Low Bitcoin (BTC) exchange reserves have dropped below 15% for the first time since 2018, according to data from Glassnode. A drop in Bitcoin supply could indicate an incoming price rally driven by a “supply shock.” A supply shock occurs when strong buyer demand is met with low BTC supply. Falling exchange reserves are typically associated with growing investor confidence and a shift towards long-term holding patterns. During such events, investors transfer their Bitcoin to cold wallets, reducing the liquid supply of the asset. Bitcoin whales often withdraw their assets from exchanges when the market enters an accumulation phase. Over-the-counter (OTC) desks are also facing a tightening supply. These desks facilitate large, private cryptocurrency trades by matching buyers and sellers. However, they depend on maintaining BTC reserves for swift and reliable trade execution. The cumulative balance of BTC held in known OTC addresses is at historic lows. CryptoQuant data showed a 21% decline in OTC address balances linked to miners since January. BlackRock Earns More Annual Fees From Bitcoin ETF Than Flagship S&P 500 Fund BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is earning more in annual fees from its spot Bitcoin ETF than from its flagship S&P 500 fund. NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci stated, “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF has over $75 billion in assets under management (AUM), and has generated $187.2 million in annual fees, $100,000 more than the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). IVV, launched in 2000, is eight times larger than IBIT and holds $624 billion in assets under management (AUM). However, it charges almost nine times less at just 0.03%. Crypto executives were quick to praise the report, with Anthony Pompliano stating, “BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund. Bitcoin has Wall Street's full, undivided attention now.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is eying a move past $110,000 as market sentiment turned bullish after President Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week in the red, dropping 1.09% on Monday and 1.33% on Tuesday to settle at $105,742. However, market sentiment flipped to bullish on Wednesday and BTC rallied, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. The price reached an intraday high of $110,281 during the ongoing session before declining to current levels. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied past $109,000 on Wednesday on the back of the global money supply (M2) reaching a new all-time high above $55 trillion. The price increase was outlined by a spike in derivatives activity, indicating renewed momentum. Open interest (OI) across major exchanges rose by 10% or $3.2 billion, thanks to a significant increase in capital in the market. The price increase was primarily driven by long positions, suggesting investor confidence in further upside. The recent price jump has prompted analyst optimism about an imminent new all-time high. According to Rekt Capital, a record weekly close above $109,000 could put BTC above its final resistance zone, unlocking price discovery and pushing it to new highs. BTC traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping 1.17% on Saturday and plunging below $100,000 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. The price fell to an intraday low of $98,385 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,985. Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,443. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose 0.66%, crossing the moving averages and $106,000 to settle at $106,137. BTC continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising 1.19% to cross $107,000 and settle at $107,397. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Thursday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,980. Source: TradingView BTC recovered despite the overwhelming selling pressure, rising 0.14% on Friday and 0.20% on Saturday to reclaim $107,000 and settle at $107,339. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rose nearly 1%, crossing $108,000 and settling at $108,350.

2025-07-03T13:27:41,"PEPE Price Targets $0.00001600 After Breaking Falling Wedge","The post PEPE Price Targets $0.00001600 After Breaking Falling Wedge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After weeks of choppy price action, meme coin PEPE is showing technical strength again. According to a crypto analyst’s recent chart shared on social media, the PEPE price has just pierced above a falling wedge pattern. This seems a potential bullish breakout that may set the stage for a new short-term rally. PEPE Gives Falling Wedge Breakout In Short-Term As seen in the chart, PEPE crypto has broken above the upper boundary of a falling wedge that had formed since the mid-May correction. This wedge has contained PEPE’s lower highs and lower lows for nearly seven weeks. $PEPE bullish wedge playing out pic.twitter.com/UupIdWlIZd — Greeny (@greenytrades) July 3, 2025 The breakout, occurring at the start of July, may now open the door to a potential retest of the $0.00001600 level, which marked the mid-May peak. The analyst suggests that if price action continues to hold above the wedge and gains follow through, this target could be reached swiftly in the short term. The short-term optimism for PEPE crypto was also aligned with another analyst’s post, where he said the current level is pivotal and breaking further would give $0.000016 and $0.000019. Source: coinglass Moreover, this short-term optimism in meme coin PEPE is backed by derivatives data, as open interest is $559.75 million, up 19.37% from the previous session. Additionally, the 24-hour long/short ratio is 1.0263, and huge shorts got liquidated, amounting $3.13 million compared to $269.49 longs. The last couple of days have seen less liquidation compared to shorts, which backs the current short-term bullishness. [post_titles_links postid=”478186″] Long-Term Trend Reversal Still in Play Beyond this breakout, the analyst also draws attention to the Q2 rally as a breakout from a long-term descending trendline that had been in place since late 2023. This previous breakout structure resembled a broader wedge formation suggesting the current move is part of a much larger bullish shift. Despite heavy selling pressure in mid-May, PEPE never fell below its April lows, signaling a strong defense from bulls. If the token manages to close above $0.00001600 with strong daily candle confirmation, it would further validate the breakout and set the stage for a move toward Q4 2024’s peak of around $0.00002800. Source: Santiment In addition, the early July rise seems very important for the long-term uptrend, as the number of transactions transferring more than $1 million and $100K metrics were declining since mid-May alongside PEPE price, and more spikes in these metrics would boost PEPE price in the long term.

According to our Pepecoin price forecast, the altcoin’s price could surge to a maximum of $0.000028 this year. Can Pepe coin reach 1 dollar in 2030 No, most predictions do not foresee PEPE reaching $1 by 2030. While some optimistic forecasts suggest a maximum price of around $0.0002733 to $0.00843 by 2030, this is still far from $1. The sheer circulating supply makes such a valuation economically unfeasible within that timeframe. Will PEPE coin ever reach $1 dollar? No, PEPE coin reaching $1 is considered highly improbable and “virtually impossible” by most analysts. With a total supply of over 420 trillion tokens, a $1 price would require an astronomical market capitalization exceeding $420 trillion, which is vastly larger than the entire global economy and well beyond Bitcoin’s peak market cap. Does PEPE coin have a long-term future? PEPE coin’s long-term future is highly speculative and dependent on sustained community hype and cultural relevance, as it lacks intrinsic utility or a formal development roadmap. While it can experience significant short-term pumps, its volatility and “useless” design make it a high-risk investment. Its survival hinges on continued meme coin cycles and strong community engagement.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/pepe-price-targets-0-00001600-after-breaking-falling-wedge/,"TRADING|PEPE|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC","Price Analysis|Meme Coins",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T13:24:13,"Bitwise: Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, ETH and SOL won’t update ATHs this year","On June 30, 2025, a reputable asset management company, Bitwise, released a Mid-Year Scorecard document, containing predictions for the second half of the year and analyzing how correct they were about the first half of 2025 in December 2024. According to Bitwise, the Bitcoin price will reach $200,000, while ETH and SOL will not get new highs in the remainder of 2025. The document , penned by the Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan and head of research Ryan Rasmussen, is the follow-up to the December 2024 text in which the authors made “bold predictions” about 2025. Now they analyze whether they were right or not and offer more predictions for the second half of 2025. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s, Ether’s, and Solana’s new all-time highs Bitcoin ETFs inflows growth, RWA tokenization hitting $50 billion, and other bets Reservations about some of the Bitwise predictions Bitcoin’s, Ether’s, and Solana’s new all-time highs In December 2024, Bitwise’s experts predicted that Bitcoin would reach $200,000 in 2025. They turned out to be correct that the BTC price will get a new all-time high. However, it was only $112,000 in May, not $200,000. The reasons for the growth cited by Bitwise include the strong ETF flows, hefty Bitcoin purchases by treasury companies, and the creation of the U.S. Bitcoin stockpile. Hougan and Rasmussen reaffirm their optimism on Bitcoin, saying they are still sure the first cryptocurrency is going to reach $200,000 by the end of the year, citing pro-crypto efforts of the Trump Administration 2.0, high institutional demand, and the rise of stablecoins as factors that will contribute to the BTC price growth. As for Ether and Solana reaching new ATHs in 2025, Bitwise experts reversed their expectations, saying that they are not that confident anymore. They see hope in stablecoin ETFs approvals and the rise of SOL and ETH treasury companies (which we don’t see yet). Bitcoin ETFs inflows growth, RWA tokenization hitting $50 billion, and other bets Bitwise predicted that 2025 will outperform 2024 in terms of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 2024 saw $35 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows. This year saw only $13 billion. Still, Bitwise experts are sure they were correct, as the number of platforms supporting Bitcoin ETFs keeps growing. As tokenization has actively been adopted in various countries throughout the first half of 2025, Bitwise experts confirm they still believe that the value of tokenized real-world assets (like real estate) will cross the $50 billion mark this year. During the first half of the year, this amount grew from $13 billion to $25 billion. In December 2024, Bitwise predicted that the number of countries holding Bitcoin would double, going from nine to 18. While it didn’t happen, Hougan and Rasmussen believe that Bitcoin accumulation by countries is happening in secret, and the trend of Bitcoin reserves will continue. In 2024, Hougan and Rasmussen claimed that the stablecoins’ AUM will reach $400 billion in 2025. Now, they believe that this amount was too high, however, according to them, the actual amount will be close as the GENIUS act adoption (for which they hope) and stablecoin boost by Mastercard with its 150 million merchants across the globe will propel stablecoins’ AUM up from the current $230 billion level. Read more: MoonPay and Mastercard partner to launch global stablecoin payments Bitwise admitted its mistake in betting that Coinbase would outperform Charles Schwab as the most valuable brokerage in 2025. Now, Bitwise claims such an outcome is unlikely. However, they turned out to be correct about predicting that Coinbase would enter the S&P 500 in 2025. Another prediction from 2024 that turned out to be a mistake, Bitwise recognized, is that the AI memecoin mania will continue in 2025 and will be even stronger than in 2024. Now Bitwise says with the downfall of LIBRA, Official Trump, and MELANIA, the memecoin and AI coin craze has taken a break. Reservations about some of the Bitwise predictions While Bitwise cites the D.C. efforts on clearing the way for cryptocurrencies in America as the factor that will push the BTC Price up, this path has been bumpy. Recently, crypto lobbyists in the administration failed to push crypto-friendly amendments to the “big, beautiful tax bill.” Earlier, a fierce battle between Republicans and Democrats surrounded the efforts to set a framework for stablecoin regulation. The creation of the Strategic Bitcoin reserve turned out to be such a disappointment for the crypto enthusiasts that it didn’t even ignite the market. While the reserve creation was declared, it meant only keeping bitcoins acquired through seizing. New purchases of bitcoins via budget money are forbidden, meaning that the reserve growth prospects are still unclear. On top of that, although the audit of the seized bitcoins was discussed, the government didn’t provide any results of that, leaving the general public in doubt whether over 200,000 bitcoins are actually owned by the U.S. and stored properly. He still hasn’t told us how much bitcoin the US government has and there has been zero move forward with any meaningful policy regarding BTC. — Rumple (@StilsonGR) July 1, 2025 The efforts of Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who advocated for spending money to buy at least 1,000,000 bitcoins for the strategic reserve, failed just like her work to include crypto-friendly tax cuts in the new bill. It’s hard to say if these facts overshadow all the positive steps, like the SEC dropping Biden-era cases against huge crypto companies and the general pro-crypto stance of the Trump Administration.
