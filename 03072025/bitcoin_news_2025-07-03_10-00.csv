Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,138.45 and $109,763.65 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-03T07:39:07,"Market Prophet Tom Lee Reveals His Prediction About Ethereum (ETH) – “Banks…”","Famous investor and Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicts that banks will buy Ethereum (ETH) not only for speculative gains but also to secure their infrastructure. Lee states that this strategy will initiate institutional-level Ethereum accumulation, similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments. According to Lee, the financial sector and the cryptocurrency world will become increasingly intertwined by 2025. The basis of this convergence is stablecoins, which are rapidly being adopted and used by both consumers and large institutions. The majority of these stablecoins are built on the Ethereum infrastructure. Lee, who says, “ETH is the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem,” argues that banks will aim to ensure the security of the network by investing in Ethereum. Lee predicts that stablecoins will be one of the key components of the future banking infrastructure. Stating that especially large banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan will start issuing their own stablecoins using the ETH network, Lee stated that these institutions will contribute to network security by staking Ethereum. Related News: How Much U.S. President Donald Trump Has Earned from Cryptocurrency Ventures Revealed - Here Are the Hard-to-Believe Number In the Ethereum network, which operates with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, institutions that stake ETH on the network become transaction validators, which both ensures network security and provides income to the staking institutions. According to Lee, this will play a critical role, especially in ensuring the security of stablecoins. Lee also said that Ethereum currently hosts 51% of stablecoins and 30% of network fees come from stablecoin transactions. He stated that this situation will further increase the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. “If the stablecoin market reaches $2 trillion from $250 billion, transaction fees and therefore returns on the ETH network will also increase exponentially,” he said. Bitmine Immersion, a company led by Lee, has launched a $250 million private investment round in line with this strategy. All funds raised will be used to purchase ETH. Investors include leading institutions in both traditional finance and crypto, such as Founders Fund, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Pantera. The company’s strategy will be evaluated based on the amount of Ethereum earned per share. It is also expected that the company’s value will increase over time through methods such as generating returns by staking Ethereum, financing transactions with ETH in hand, and increasing the price of Ethereum. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of pushing toward potential new highs in July as ETF inflows return and investor sentiment strengthens. But while the spotlight shines on BTC’s macro momentum, a wave is building underneath, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding it fast. The project is 5th stage of presale that is already sold out more than 50%. The current amount amassed by Mutuum Finance is already over $11.5 million with over 12,700 holders. Mutuum Finance is checking both boxes, and sliding into watchlists for the best crypto to buy in 2025 before June is out. Bitcoin Holds Firm as July Rally Approaches Bitcoin is now selling at about $108,526, recovering gradually after its April crash on about $74,000 and just short of its new all-time record of about $111,970. This uptrend is supported by technical data: BTC itself re-took its 50-day moving average, which is around $106,000, and has not fallen beneath good support, which shows BTC to have a solid base. As macro trends and regulatory clarity work in favor of BTC, the case is made to reach new highs BTC finds itself in arguably its best position all year, substance, clarity on regulations, and an at-long-last climate. Mutuum Finance Presale Achieves Outstanding Results More than $11.5 million and over 12,700 investors were drawn as part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. This kind of winds is the sign of the increased confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project and its long-term perspective. $50K Up for Grabs as Mutuum Finance Pushes Development Forward Mutuum Finance has launched a USDT Bug Bounty in the amount of $50,000 with CertiK. It is a bounty that is all-inclusive in the sense that, it is partitioned based on the four variable levels of severity which include, critical, major, minor and low. It is also the way of presenting the fact that the project is attentive regarding security and transparency. Proven Dual-Lending Formula Transformation of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to a mixed lending platform that will service the requirement of passive and active DeFi users. The need of any investor to want to earn passive income by depositing his USDT into smart contracts pools which guarantee stable passive income determined by its interest rate which goes up or down depending upon the changes in the market conditions is satisfied by its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. Moreover, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model lets the lenders and borrowers be as engaged as possible in resolving terms of a trade and do not require a third party. The model is more prevalent among the users of less stable assets. Leaderboard and 100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance is grateful to its early investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway where 10 lucky participants will be rewarded with $10,000 MUTM. This celebrates the investors’ early belief in the project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $11.5 million and attracted more than 12,700 holders, placing it firmly among the top crypto contenders to watch heading into 2025. Bitcoin is regaining its footing, aiming for new all-time highs in July, but under-the-radar gems like Mutuum are capturing the attention of smart investors early.

2025-07-03T07:24:25,"Bitcoin and JPMorgan Will Soar on the Back of Big Bank Stablecoins: Hayes","The premise is driven by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s agenda to engineer a liquidity injection that resembles past Federal Reserve interventions, said Hayes in a lengthy blog post on July 3. However, this will be done via financial innovation and regulatory tweaks, not overt money printing, he added. Bessent is “done getting fluffed,” and it’s time for him to “soak the world with his liquidity juices,” he exclaimed. Trillions in T-Bill Buying Power Hayes stated that this stealth liquidity injection strategy has two massive beneficiaries: Bitcoin and JPMorgan. JPMorgan’s stablecoin ( JPMD ) allows it to digitize deposits, eliminate compliance costs, and earn a risk-free spread by buying US Treasury bills. “Quid Pro Stablecoin” is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC’s shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Additionally, regulatory changes such as the GENIUS Act could effectively hand “too big to fail” banks a monopoly on stablecoins, which could lock out fintech firms such as Circle. “The adoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power.” Moreover, if JPMorgan converts even a fraction of its deposits into stablecoins, it unlocks hundreds of billions in low-risk, high-margin earnings, potentially doubling or tripling its market cap. Bitcoin would also benefit because stablecoin issuance creates massive Treasury bill demand without quantitative easing, which suppresses yields and reflates risk assets. The primary cryptocurrency thrives when liquidity expands and rates drop. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’.” Ethereum to Benefit The JPMD stablecoin will ride on Base, a layer-2 operated by Coinbase built on top of Ethereum, confirming that the asset will use Ethereum infrastructure. This positions the protocol as the settlement layer for the new banking liquidity engine. “This is debt monetization dressed in Ethereum drag,” said Hayes. If big banks settle stablecoins on Ethereum, the current industry standard for real-world asset tokenization, demand for the network’s blockspace, layer-2s, and validators increases. The Ethereum infrastructure is quietly powering the entire play, so it is also likely to benefit, though Hayes didn’t directly address it. It could also become the next corporate treasury gold rush due to its staking yields, which are not available with Bitcoin, according to analysts.

2025-07-03T07:14:48,"Crypto Tycoon Tim Heath Foils Kidnapping Attempt by Biting Off Attacker’s Finger","Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath narrowly escaped a violent kidnapping attempt in Tallinn, Estonia, last July by biting off part of an attacker’s finger, an Estonian court heard this week. Key Takeaways: Tim Heath escaped a kidnapping attempt in Estonia by biting an attacker’s finger. The suspects stalked Heath for weeks, using disguises and a GPS tracker. Seven men are accused of plotting to abduct Heath and steal his crypto assets. The chilling incident highlights the growing wave of targeted abductions against wealthy crypto figures in 2025, which has forced many executives to bolster their security measures. Heath, a prominent investor and founder of the Estonian-based Yolo Group, was ambushed by two men disguised as painters in the stairwell of his apartment building. Ex-Boxer Tries to Muzzle Crypto Tycoon in Failed Kidnapping According to testimony cited by Estonian outlet Eesti Ekspress and the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the attackers, Azerbaijani national Allahverdi Allahverdiyev, a former boxer and wrestler, tried to silence Heath by covering his mouth. In a desperate act of self-defense, Heath bit through Allahverdiyev’s index finger, managing to break free and retreat into his apartment. The struggle, which lasted about 30 seconds, cost Heath a tooth but forced the kidnappers to flee. The attackers abandoned a rented van nearby, and police later discovered part of Allahverdiyev’s severed finger about 100 meters from the scene. Court documents revealed the attackers had been stalking Heath in the weeks before the assault, both physically and with a GPS tracker placed on his vehicle. The group allegedly planned to force Heath into the van, transport him to a rented sauna house, and coerce him into transferring his crypto holdings. This is David Balland. He co-founded Ledger, one of the biggest companies in crypto This week, he was kidnapped and tortured Here’s the full story of what happened: (and why it’s a wake-up call for everyone in crypto) pic.twitter.com/0NpLlN8aZm — Pix (@PixOnChain) January 24, 2025 Prosecutors say a hacker was also involved to expedite the digital theft. The group of seven suspects reportedly entered Estonia using fake Georgian passports. In the days before the attack, they bought painters’ uniforms and equipment to pose as workmen. Two men have been arrested so far: Allahverdiyev and Georgian citizen Ilgar Mamedov, who prosecutors claim was the getaway driver. Mamedov has denied involvement, insisting he ended up in Estonia by accident. Three other suspects remain unidentified, and two, including the alleged ringleader Najaf Najafli, are wanted by authorities. Kidnappers Demanded 30 Bitcoin After Failed Abduction After the failed abduction, Heath allegedly received a Telegram message containing photos of his apartment along with a demand for 30 Bitcoin, worth about $3.3 million at the time. When Heath didn’t respond, there were no further attempts to contact him, but prosecutors argue the threat could still be active. Heath has since spent over $3.1 million on private security and relocated to a new home. His legal team is pursuing reimbursement of these costs from the accused kidnappers as the court case continues in Estonia. The recent attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. In another incident, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

2025-07-03T07:04:40,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Says US Government Will Be Forced To Deal With Incoming ‘Debt Bomb’ – Here’s How","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio says that America is going to be forced to deal with its soaring debt problem. The billionaire tells his 1.7 million followers on the social media platform X that the US will likely lower interest rates and print money to address the nation’s ballooning debt obligations. However, he warns that such measures are not very effective. “When countries have too much debt, lowering interest rates and devaluing the currency that the debt is denominated in is the preferred path government policy makers are most likely to take, so it pays to bet on it happening. At the moment of my writing, we know that the projections are for big deficits and big increases in government debt and debt service expenses ahead… I also shared last week why I believe the political system in the US won’t be able to get its debt problems under control. We know how debt service costs (paying back interest and principal) will grow rapidly to squeeze out spending, and we also know that, at best, it is highly doubtful that there will be an increase in demand for the debt commensurate with the supply that needs to be sold. I laid out in detail what I think the implications of all this are in ‘How Countries Go Broke,’ where I offer a description of the mechanics behind my thinking. Others have stress tested it, and thus far there has been almost total agreement that the picture I am painting is accurate.” Dalio believes the US will eventually have to both cut spending and raise taxes to save itself from the looming fiscal crisis. “There is no way that the deficit/debt bomb problem can be sustainably dealt with unless there is a mix of tax revenue increases and spending decreases that are determined in a bipartisan way. Our representatives in Washington, D.C., both Republicans and Democrats, know this is true. They understand the need to reduce the deficit by having those from both sides chip in a bit (e.g., a 4% increase in tax revenue and a 4% spending cut) which would lead to a supply/demand balance improvement for US debt which in turn would lower interest rates.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-03T07:04:21,"Donald Trump Crypto Holdings Now Make Up 8% of His Net Worth","The post Donald Trump Crypto Holdings Now Make Up 8% of His Net Worth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio is making headlines. A recent Bloomberg report reveals that Donald Trump holds at least 8% of his net worth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This revelation comes amid growing speculation that Trump’s pro-crypto stance may not be just political, but personal. Donald Trump Net Worth: Real Estate, Truth Social, and Crypto As of now, Trump’s total net worth is estimated at $6.4 billion, largely made up of: Real estate assets, including 19+ properties valued over $50 million each His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (Truth Social) And now, a rapidly growing share of crypto holdings While Trump’s real estate empire remains the backbone of his business, the report suggests that cryptocurrencies are becoming a larger slice of Trump’s financial pie. World Liberty Financial: The Core of Trump’s Crypto Holdings The centerpiece of Donald Trump’s crypto wealth is a project called World Liberty Financial (WLFI). WLFI has raised over $550 million from token sales $390 million of that amount reportedly went directly to the Trump family Trump and his family also own 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, valued at approximately $2 billion (though currently non-transferable, hence not included in his official net worth) USD1 Stablecoin and TRUMP Memecoin Fuel Trump’s Crypto Empire Trump’s crypto holdings don’t stop with WLFI. The report highlights two other major assets in his portfolio: 1. USD1 Stablecoin Market Cap: $2.2 billion+ 24H Trading Volume: $1.5 billion+ Annual Earnings from Reserves: $100 million [post_titles_links postid=”477986″] 2. TRUMP Memecoin Market Cap: $1.79 billion 24H Trading Volume: $269 million Total Supply: 1 billion TRUMP tokens Circulating Supply: ~200 million CIC Digital, the firm controlling 80% of TRUMP tokens, is reportedly linked to the Trump Organization Trump Steps Into the Crypto Mining Business Donald Trump has a 20% stake in American Bitcoin, a U.S.-based crypto mining firm. The company recently merged with Gryphon Digital Mining and is now valued at over $3 billion. This move places Trump directly in the mining sector, further diversifying his crypto interests. Final Thoughts While Trump’s public support for cryptocurrencies has often made headlines, this new report suggests something more: Donald Trump’s crypto holdings are now a central piece of his fortune. With over $500 million directly tied to crypto and even more in token valuations, Trump may be one of the most crypto-exposed political figures in the world. As the next election cycle heats up, Trump’s net worth and growing crypto empire are likely to remain in the spotlight. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs How did Donald Trump accumulate such a large crypto portfolio, and when did he start investing in crypto? Donald Trump’s significant crypto wealth rapidly grew, especially after October 2024. It stems from the launch of his own meme coins ($TRUMP, $MELANIA) and a substantial stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with his family. He has also directly engaged with the crypto mining sector. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and how does it generate value for the Trump family? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a crypto venture co-established by Donald Trump, with his sons Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron listed as Web3 ambassadors. It generates value through token sales (raising over $550 million), with a Trump family entity receiving 75% of net revenues from these sales and holding 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. How does Trump’s crypto wealth compare to other political figures or billionaires? Donald Trump is likely one of the most crypto-exposed political figures globally, with over 8% of his estimated $6.4 billion net worth tied to crypto. While exact comparisons with other politicians are hard, his direct involvement in crypto projects and substantial holdings make him an outlier among major political figures.

We are not affiliated with Robinhood, were not involved in this process, and do not endorse this product,” OpenAI said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). The company also stated that the transfer of its own shares is only possible with its own approval, and warned, “Any share transfer requires our approval, we have not approved any transfer. Please be careful.” Robinhood, meanwhile, introduced its new crypto and blockchain-focused products in Cannes, France. The company attracted attention with its tokenized shares, staking services, and a new blockchain infrastructure move. Following the introduction, Robinhood shares rose above $100, hitting an all-time high. Related News: One of Belgium's Largest Banks Takes Important Step with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) “These tokens create new opportunities for individual investors by providing indirect access to private markets.

Robinhood, in line with looser investor regulations in the European Union, has distributed €5 worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens to eligible users who sign up to buy equity tokens by July 7. The tokens are being offered through the company’s crypto platform. Robinhood’s Crypto General Manager Johann Kerbrat said, “Our goal is to expand access. With tokenization, we want everyone to be able to participate in this economy.” However, this development has once again highlighted the clash between crypto platforms’ efforts to democratize access to financial products and the desire for control of the companies on which these products are based.

2025-07-03T07:00:44,"Bitcoin Short-Term Upper Bound Is $117,000, Glassnode Says","The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed Bitcoin has recently been trading within a short-term band that has its upper level currently located at $117,000. Bitcoin Is Trading Between These Two Short-Term Holder Price Bands In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the short-term price band that Bitcoin has been trading inside lately. The band in question is based on two levels relevant to the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Related Reading: This Altcoin Looks Like PEPE Before It Exploded, Analyst Says The indicator related to the STHs that’s of interest here is the Realized Price, which keeps track of the average cost basis or acquisition level of the BTC addresses belonging to the group. When the value of this metric is greater than the asset’s spot price, it means the STHs as a whole can be considered to be in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the coin’s value suggests the dominance of loss among this cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode, which shows the trend in the STH Realized Price and a few lines corresponding to different standard deviations (SDs) from it: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin price has interestingly traded in a range defined by two of these lines over the last six months. The lower bound of the range has been the -1 SD and the upper one the +1 SD. The STHs are made up of the new entrants into the sector and fickle-minded traders, so the group tends to easily react to happenings in the market. As such, the cryptocurrency’s price can have some interactions with the STH Realized Price, due to the cohort’s panic buying/selling. From the chart, it’s apparent that the same has been true in this period of consolidation as well. While the indicator has certainly not acted as an absolute support or resistance, the asset has still seen such effects around it in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum In Demand: ETF Inflow Streak Extends To 7 Weeks Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the metric after finding a rebound at it last month. The level ahead of the asset now is the +1 SD. In this period of sideways movement, it has so far only been able to test this line once. “This level can be seen as the upper band of the short-term price action,” notes the analytics firm. The +1 SD is located at around $117,000 right now. It only remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will test this level in the near future or not.

2025-07-03T07:00:00,"88% of Bitcoin’s Bull Run Is Over: Here’s What Comes Next","Bitcoin is still in a bull market but moving more slowly now. This cycle had the longest post-halving reaccumulation phase yet. Upside to $130K–$150K is possible, but risk of correction grows. Bitcoin’s bull run is still alive, but it’s taking a slower and more deliberate path this time around, according to a market update from analyst Rekt Capital, where it was explained how Bitcoin moves in clear cycles, with periods of strong rallies, quiet consolidations, and occasional pullbacks before it finally reaches a peak. Interestingly, this current cycle saw one of the longest re-accumulation periods ever after the halving event, lasting nearly eight months. The longer than expected consolidation gave the Bitcoin market time to cool off after a period of rapid gains, bringing prices back in line with long-term trends. While Bitcoin did eventually climb to new highs, the move was much slower compared to past cycles. Looking at the bigger picture, the analyst said that the risk of a market drop from current Bitcoin prices is starting to outweigh the remaining upside. While prices could still rise to $130,000, $140,000, or even $150,000, there’s also the… The post 88% of Bitcoin’s Bull Run Is Over: Here’s What Comes Next appeared first on Coin Edition .",coinquora,https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-bull-run-end-rekt-capital-price-analysis/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

While many are unsure what it means, popular crypto trader CryptoBusy thinks this bill could help Bitcoin and the whole crypto market in ways most people don’t expect. Here’s how this bill will be bullish for bitcoin & the entire crypto market. More Money, More Bitcoin In a recent tweet post , CryptoBusy points out that the bill’s massive $4.5 trillion tax cuts would leave people and companies with more money in their pockets. When there’s extra cash floating around, some of it usually ends up in hard assets like Bitcoin, especially when people worry about inflation or a weaker dollar. CryptoBusy further highlights that the bill doesn’t just cut taxes, it also makes it easier for companies to spend and invest by giving them 100% bonus depreciation and bigger write-offs for research. Some companies might decide to put part of that cash into Bitcoin, just like MicroStrategy did when it made headlines by holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Big Debt Makes Bitcoin Look Safer Meanwhile, one thing CryptoBusy warns about is that this bill would add about $3.3 trillion to America’s debt over the next decade. More debt often means more people looking for safer, non-government money, and that’s where Bitcoin steps in. For many, Bitcoin will act as a safer haven against a weaker dollar. Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Approach On top of all this, Trump has shown a friendlier tone toward crypto than many expected. Less regulation and clearer rules could make big companies feel safer adding Bitcoin to their books. Has the Bill Passed Yet? Right now, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is still just a proposal; it hasn’t passed yet. His team is trying hard to get it through Congress, but it’s hitting roadblocks. After one round of voting on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson met with a few Republicans to save the bill. So far, four Republicans have voted against it, including Andrew Clyde, Victoria Sparta, and Keith Self, which is a big problem. To pass the bill, Republicans need a simple majority. If the bill passes, it could give Bitcoin an even bigger boost.

2025-07-03T06:49:11,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Pullback to $90K Before Fed-Backed Stablecoins Trigger Next Rally","Bitcoin could dip to $90,000 before climbing to new highs, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who sees a brief correction ahead of a fresh rally powered by US bank-issued stablecoins. In a Thursday blog post , Hayes outlined a scenario where central bank policy and Wall Street incentives converge to push trillions of dollars into digital assets. Arthur Hayes argues that the market has not yet priced in the transformative impact of fully regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by too-big-to-fail banks like JPMorgan. These coins, he suggests, will not just rival existing players such as Tether or Circle’s USDC, but will become critical tools for absorbing bank reserves and retail deposits now stranded in low-yield accounts. ""Quid Pro Stablecoin"" is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC's shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Stablecoins Could Fuel Next Rally, But Hayes Warns of Short-Term Dip Hayes argues that the launch of such stablecoins would effectively function as a new form of liquidity injection, similar in impact to quantitative easing, without requiring formal Fed action. By enabling banks to funnel retail money into short-term Treasury bills without triggering capital rule penalties, these tokens would unlock a new wave of liquidity for risk assets like Bitcoin and tech stocks. But before that happens, Hayes sees a period of volatility. Citing historical cycles and market sentiment, he predicts that Bitcoin may fall to $90,000 as speculators take profits and traders wait for clearer signals from the Federal Reserve. Still, he remains bullish over the longer term, noting that once Wall Street moves in with tokenized dollars, capital flows will accelerate. With GENIUS Act Passed, Hayes Sees Stablecoins Giving Banks a Market Edge The forecast comes as stablecoins return to the spotlight, with US lawmakers advancing bipartisan proposals that could give federal approval to banks issuing tokenized dollars. Last month, the US Senate passed the long-anticipated GENIUS Act with broad bipartisan backing, marking the most comprehensive crypto legislation to date. Approved by a 68–30 vote, it represents the Senate’s first move toward a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing segments in the digital asset space. Hayes believes that this regulatory direction hands legacy banks a strategic edge. Not only do they already have massive retail networks and regulatory compliance structures, they also have direct access to the Federal Reserve. This makes it easier for them to profit from turning deposits into short-term Treasuries through stablecoin issuance. He estimates that if banks shift even part of their $17t in deposits into stablecoin products, it could create $6.8t in new demand for US government debt. Combined with changes in how the Fed pays interest on reserves, that shift could flood markets with fresh liquidity, fuelling asset inflation across crypto and equities alike. Until then, Hayes sees the coming dip as a buying opportunity. He believes that once USD-backed stablecoins from major banks enter the market, they will unlock a wave of liquidity that could send Bitcoin and other risk assets sharply higher. In his view, the arrival of these tokens will mark the start of a new phase in the market cycle.

He believes people will be able to get car loans, home loans, and even borrow money from each other using these platforms. He sees them becoming full financial centers soon. Ripple and Uphold Deal Could Financial Game Deaton also pointed out the speculation that Ripple might buy Uphold. If that happens, he believes Uphold will also become a major player in this new financial system. Ripple, already a leader in digital payments, could get a major boost with this deal, allowing it to serve more users and offer more financial tools. Why Traditional Banks Are Falling Behind According to Deaton, banks that don’t innovate or adopt modern technology will not survive. With the rise of DeFi ( Decentralized Finance ), people now expect faster services and better access to their money. They also want the chance to earn higher returns and gain more control over their finances. Deaton says this is why many younger people are already turning away from big banks in favor of crypto platforms.

More people are using these platforms every day, and he believes they will only get bigger as crypto grows. Recently, Cathie Wood said Bitcoin holders may soon use Coinbase to get mortgages by using their crypto as collateral. John Deaton agrees with Cathie Wood, calling Coinbase a top stock to own, just like big names such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Referring to these changes, he said Coinbase isn’t just a crypto app anymore, as it’s becoming a major player in traditional finance. The COIN stock surged, nearly 100% in two months, which shows that more people are buying into this story. He also says the change is already happening. The world of money is shifting.

Despite the bearish trend on the higher timeframe, SOL is showing signs of extending its recovery after adding nearly 4% to its value in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 60 shows that SOL is no longer facing selling pressure, with buyers increasingly taking control of the market. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are also within the positive territory, suggesting a bullish bias. SOL could be targeting the Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $162 over the next few hours or so. If the rally continues, SOL could retest the next major resistance level at $174, its highest price since May 29.

The ETF’s launch was not without hurdles. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially raised objections in late May, questioning whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under federal securities laws. REX-Osprey navigated these challenges by structuring the fund to invest at least 40% of its assets in other exchange-traded products, many of which are listed outside the United States. The regulatory workaround allowed the fund to avoid the traditional 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot crypto ETFs.

Seyffart added that a wave of new ETFs, including products tied to XRP and Litecoin, could arrive in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Solana’s price saw muted movement, gaining 3.6% over the past 24 hours and trading around $153 at press time. Despite the ETF launch, SOL remains down nearly 48% from its highs earlier this year. However, Solana CME futures showed rising institutional appetite, with open interest reaching $167 million after the ETF’s debut, according to data from SolanaFloor. As reported, digital asset investment funds pulled in $2.7 billion last week, capping an 11-week streak of inflows that now totals $16.9 billion. The bulk of the inflows came from the United States, accounting for $2.65 billion. Switzerland and Germany recorded modest additions of $23 million and $19.8 million, respectively, while Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil posted small outflows. Bitcoin remained the primary magnet for capital, drawing $2.2 billion last week, a commanding 83% of total inflows, while short-Bitcoin products extended their year-to-date outflows to $12 million.

2025-07-03T06:00:56,"Arizona Governor Vetoes Revived Bitcoin Reserve Bill For Seized Assets","Arizona’s governor has rejected a recently revived bill that would have established a Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve comprised of seized digital assets. The legislation became the third crypto bill to be rejected by the governor this session. Governor Hobbs Says No To Bitcoin Reserve Bill On Tuesday, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a crypto legislation that aimed to update the state’s forfeiture law to include digital assets and create a Bitcoin Reserve out of seized assets. Notably, the Arizona State Senate revived House Bill 2324 (HB 2324) two weeks ago after it failed to pass the House of Representatives’ third reading in May. The Senate voted in favor of the motion to reconsider the legislation, sending it back to the House for consideration. On June 24, the bill passed the House with a 34-22 vote in favor before sending it to Governor Hobbs’ desk last week, where it became the third Bitcoin Reserve proposal rejected over the past two months. According to the July 1 decision, the governor considers that HB 2324 “disincentivizes local law enforcement from working with the state on digital asset forfeiture by removing seized assets from local jurisdictions.” The legislation would have updated Arizona’s forfeiture laws to include digital assets and establish new provisions for seizing, storing, and allocating cryptocurrencies and other assets. Additionally, it would have established new procedures for law enforcement to seize digital assets and clarified rules around property forfeiture, including protections for innocent owners and limitations on when properties can be seized, aiming to modernize forfeiture laws to address the complexity of crypto in criminal investigations. The bill would have also created a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” to manage crypto assets obtained through criminal asset forfeiture. HB 2324’s revival followed the enactment of House Bill 2749 (HB 2749), which was signed into law on May 7. The legislation updated Arizona’s unclaimed property laws to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies , technically creating the state’s first and only reserve for crypto assets. The bill allows authorities to hold unclaimed cryptocurrencies and establish a “Bitcoin Reserve Fund” without using state funds or taxpayers’ money. Nonetheless, the “pro-crypto” nod from Governor Hobbs has been outshone by her veto of two other bills, Senate Bill 1025 (SB 1025) and Senate Bill 1373 (SB 1373). The Governor argued that crypto assets were too “untested” and volatile for state funds. Connecticut Bans BTC Reserve Meanwhile, Connecticut has followed a similar path to Arizona after Governor Ned Lamont officially signed into law a “Bitcoin Reserve Ban” on Monday. Starting October 1, the state will be prohibited from accepting, holding, or investing in crypto assets. As reported by Bitcoinist, House Bill 7082 (HB 7082), or “An Act Concerning Various Revisions to the Money Transmission Statutes, State Payments and Investments in Virtual Currency (…),” passed both the House and the Senate unanimously in mid-June. The bill updated Connecticut’s money transmission laws, with a focus on regulating digital assets, and expanded the definition of money transmission to include the use of digital wallets and crypto kiosks. Moreover, it imposed several new provisions for money transmitters, including strict licensing, compliance, and disclosure requirements on businesses that hold, transmit, or store virtual currency on behalf of others. Notably, HB 7082 specifically prohibited the establishment of a strategic reserve, detailing that “Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state shall (…) establish a reserve of virtual currency.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/arizona-governor-vetoes-revived-bitcoin-reserve-bill-for-seized-assets/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|Arizona Bitcoin|Arizona Governor|Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|bitcoin|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTCUSDT|Connecticut legislation|Connecticute Lawmakers|Crypto Bill|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T06:00:52,"Whales Are Quietly Repositioning, Here’s What Bitcoin’s $107K Price Isn’t Telling You","Bitcoin continues to show little upward momentum as it trades below the $110,000 mark. As of the time of writing, the asset is priced at $108,071 after recording a modest 2% gain in the past 24 hours. Despite nearing its all-time high in recent weeks, Bitcoin appears to be caught in a holding pattern as institutional rebalancing and on-chain dynamics take center stage. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi has drawn attention to unusual on-chain activity during the final days of June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Institutional Rebalancing and Local Exhaustion Signals In a post titled “Whale Profit-Taking and Loss Realizations: Was Late June a Local Pivot Point?” the analyst noted conflicting behaviors among Bitcoin whales. A notable $641 million in realized profits was recorded alongside more than $1.24 billion in realized losses, a combination that suggests a potential inflection point in market sentiment. Mevsimi emphasized that this mixed realization trend came at the close of the second quarter, a period often associated with institutional portfolio adjustments. “Structurally, late June is also the end of H1, when ETFs and institutional funds often rebalance portfolios,” he wrote. Mevsimi added: “That timing adds weight: this wasn’t just noise — it may have been a deliberate repositioning.” Notably, these large movements in realized profit and loss did not extend into early July, which may imply either a temporary stabilization or the beginning of a new market phase. The report also detailed divergent whale behavior. Newer whales, likely short-term participants entering in Q2, showed signs of capitulation, realizing both profits and significant losses. In contrast, older whales locked in $91 million in profits with negligible losses. This division may indicate a shift in control, with experienced holders offloading risk while short-term players exited amid market uncertainty. According to Mevsimi, the convergence of these trends hints at a local exhaustion phase rather than a continued rally. Bitcoin LTH Unrealized Profits and Historical Context In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant’s Darkfost explored the unrealized profit profile of Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs), revealing a downward trend despite BTC’s proximity to record highs. Citing the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, Darkfost noted that average unrealized profits have fallen to around 220%. This is well below the peaks recorded during market tops in March and December 2024, which reached 300% and 350%, respectively. “Although these profits may seem substantial, we’re still far from the levels observed during the tops of this cycle,” Darkfost stated. The realized price for LTHs now stands at approximately $39,000, suggesting a strong cushion but also reinforcing that speculative excess has yet to return in full force. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon The analyst added that a return to top-cycle unrealized profit levels would require BTC to rise to around $140,000, a target echoed by several bullish forecasts.

2025-07-03T06:00:33,"Ripple Follows Circle’s Lead and Applies for US Banking License","Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. These applications aim to bring Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin under dual state and federal oversight to align with new legislation like the GENIUS Act. This follows a similar move by Circle, the issuer of USDC, which also applied for OCC approval. Meanwhile, billionaire Peter Thiel is backing a new startup- and crypto-focused bank called Erebor, which will fill the gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. In Europe, Belgium’s KBC Bank is set to offer crypto investments via its Bolero platform. Ripple Makes Power Play in US Banking Ripple Labs is seeking a US banking license to deepen its ties with traditional finance and comply with emerging stablecoin regulations. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that Ripple formally applied for a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, it would bring Ripple under both federal and state regulatory oversight. The New York Department of Financial Services already supervises Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, and Garlinghouse said that this added federal oversight will set a new standard of trust in the stablecoin industry. This development happened after a similar application by Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Just days earlier, Circle applied to the OCC to form a national trust bank responsible for managing its stablecoin reserves. Both moves come on the heels of the US Senate passing the GENIUS Act, which is legislation that outlines regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers and designates the OCC as the key federal watchdog for larger players in the space. Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the company is aligning itself with the changing regulatory landscape around dollar-pegged payment stablecoins. In addition to its OCC application, Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. This would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed. Garlinghouse described this feature as a critical safeguard to reinforce long-term trust in the stablecoin. The application was made via Standard Custody, a crypto custody firm that Ripple acquired in early 2024. Garlinghouse explained that the tide is turning in Washington, with Congress advancing clearer crypto regulations and traditional banks showing renewed interest in engaging with digital asset firms. This is in stark contrast to the restrictive environment of previous years, which was often referred to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” XRP’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Market reaction to Ripple’s banking ambitions has been positive. XRP climbed 2.87% to $2.24. The rally began shortly after Garlinghouse’s announcement and peaked at $2.27 before slightly retreating. Peter Thiel Backs New Bank for Startups and Crypto Meanwhile, a group of billionaires, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, is reportedly working on launching a new financial institution named Erebor to fill the void left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March of 2023. According to the Financial Times , Erebor will focus on serving startups and cryptocurrency companies, and has already applied for a US bank charter to operate as a fully licensed bank . Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, is said to be among the early investors in the new bank. Other backers reportedly include Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense contractor Anduril, and Joe Lonsdale, founder of investment firm 8VC. Thiel is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem, and he is also known for backing Bullish, a crypto exchange that recently filed for an initial public offering in the United States. Erebor’s strategy seems to be centered on providing banking services and loans to early-stage startups and other high-risk ventures that have found it difficult to access capital in the wake of tighter financial regulations. The initiative is also seen as an attempt to reestablish a specialized financial services institution that mirrors the role Silicon Valley Bank once played in the innovation economy. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 sent shockwaves through the banking and crypto industries. It was shut down by California’s financial regulator after rapidly rising interest rates devalued its bond holdings. The bank failed when a flood of clients tried to withdraw funds, triggering a liquidity crisis. At the time, the bank served around half of all venture capital-backed tech and life sciences firms in the country. Bank failures in the year 2023 (Source: FDIC ) The demise of Silicon Valley Bank also contributed to a wider crisis that saw the downfall of other institutions like Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The crypto sector was particularly hard-hit, with investment funds losing roughly 10% of their assets under management in a single week. According to Harvard Business Review, the bank's failure tightened credit access for venture-backed startups, which created an urgent need for a replacement institution. Although Silicon Valley Bank still operates as a division of First Citizens Bank after its acquisition in March of 2023, its collapse shed some light on the vulnerabilities in the venture capital and digital asset banking landscape. Erebor now plans to fill that gap. KBC Bank to Offer Crypto Investments KBC Bank, one of Belgium’s largest financial institutions, is preparing to allow its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies through its online investment platform Bolero. The bank confirmed that Bolero will provide access to Bitcoin and Ethereum investments later this year. A spokesperson for KBC stated that the bank is currently undergoing an analysis to become recognized as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP), with the aim of launching the service by autumn. The initiative is expected to give private investors the opportunity to invest directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum in a secure and regulated environment, with an emphasis on education and compliance. If the rollout proceeds as planned, KBC will become the first major Belgian bank to offer crypto investment services to retail clients. Currently, most Belgian investors rely on international exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, or on fintech platforms like Revolut and N26 to access crypto markets. KBC’s move forms part of the trend among European banks that are increasingly exploring crypto investment and custody solutions. In Germany, both Deutsche Bank and Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe are reportedly preparing to introduce crypto offerings in the near future. Meanwhile, Spain’s BBVA has been advising its high-net-worth clients to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This wave of crypto adoption by banks was anticipated by industry leaders. In April, executives from major crypto firms Messari and Sygnum predicted that banks would start entering the space more aggressively in the second half of 2025, encouraged by a more favorable global regulatory landscape. Supporting this trend, Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the payments giant has been in discussions with several banks interested in experimenting with stablecoins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9786/ripple-follows-circle-s-lead-and-applies-for-us-banking-license,"FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Per local reports, the government is still engaged with international institutions to refine the plan. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan, during a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power. According to a report by Profit , the IMF has warned that the plan could add strain to the power sector. Dr Irfan told the committee that the agency is concerned about market distortions over Pakistan’s subsidised energy rates proposal. IMF Flags Several Concerns Against Pakistan’s Power Proposal for Bitcoin Mining Last month, the IMF questioned Pakistan’s power push for Bitcoin mining, raising concerns over legal issues and power strain. The international financial body laid out several concerns, including the legality of crypto mining in Pakistan and the additional strain on the already burdened power grid. The @IMFNews is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. #IMF #Bitcoin https://t.co/X9YHqz9qTO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 1, 2025 Further, the fund warned about resource distribution and knock-on effects on power tariffs. The IMF noted that Pakistan did not consult the fund ahead of the announcement. In May, Pakistan announced that it will allocate 2,000MW to power crypto mining and data centres, in a move to attract foreign investment. The initiative is driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance. Pakistan in Talks With International Institutions Dr Irfan confirmed that the government is still in talks to redefine its power subsidiary plan after the IMF has rejected the proposal. The committee further discussed technological solutions aimed at combating electricity theft. They also discussed the government’s recent agreement with scheduled banks to reduce the circular debt stock. Senator Shibli Faraz criticised that banks were “forced at gunpoint” to offer the loans.

According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund ended its first trading day with around $33 million in volume. Another Bloomberg analyst, James Seyffart, reported that the ETF had about $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes of its launch. While the trading volume of the ETF was impressive, it still fell short of the levels seen during the debut of Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Balchunas commented : SSK ended the day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch), but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Eric Balchunas The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF reached about $1 million in AUM on Wednesday The Solana staking ETF also wrapped up its debut day with about $1 million worth of assets under management. Balchunas believes the ETF could soon manage $10 million in assets on its second trading day, given its current trading volume. The ETF differs quite from others, which are still awaiting the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval. The commission registered the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940—an investor-focused framework with stricter regulations. That means the fund must hold its assets with a qualified and trusted custodian. The ETF’s founders selected Anchorage Digital for the role, seeing that it’s the sole federally regulated crypto bank authorized to handle both custody and staking of digital assets. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley commented on the ETF’s launch, describing staking as the next evolution in the crypto ETF space and calling the fund’s debut a significant step toward offering institutions secure and regulated crypto access. The SEC announced that Grayscale’s ETF conversion plans are still under review On Tuesday, Grayscale also earned the SEC’s approval to change its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF. The fund includes the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap: Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, and Cardano’s ADA. Arbitrage traders once profited by exploiting gaps in market prices and NAV in Grayscale’s crypto trusts, mostly fueled by restricted redemptions and mandatory lock-up periods. However, with the firm moving to convert its private trusts into ETFs, those opportunities have significantly narrowed. Grayscale even explained that moving forward, it wants the values of the shares to reflect the value of the digital assets held by the fund. The SEC, however, is still reviewing the firm’s ETF conversion plans. On Wednesday, in a letter to the New York Stock Exchange, the agency’s deputy secretary announced that the commission would reexamine the approval for Grayscale’s ETF conversion, signaling continued hesitation to loosen its approach to crypto ETFs. In June 2022, the firm also faced trouble when it tried to convert the BTC Trust into an ETF. It filed a petition in court after the agency rejected its application. The legal battle stretched over a year until August 2023, when a US judge ruled that the SEC’s rejection of the conversion was “arbitrary and capricious,” ultimately granting Grayscale’s petition. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust operates as an ETF with a 1.5% expense ratio—the highest among Bitcoin ETFs—and remains the top-earning BTC investment product.

2025-07-03T05:13:21,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF ‘Machine’ Outearns Legendary S&P 500 Fund: Details","The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has achieved a remarkable milestone by generating more annual fee revenue than the firm’s flagship S&P 500 tracker, despite being much smaller in size. The crypto fund generates an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees from its $75 billion in assets with a 0.25% expense ratio. In contrast, the BlackRock iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) makes $187.1 million from $624 billion in assets and a 0.03% expense ratio, reported Bloomberg on July 2. IBIT is nearly nine times smaller but charges over eight times more in fees. Simply a Machine Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly ETF Store), told the outlet that “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure.” “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios.” The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF. Simply a machine. I offer a few thoughts here. via @isabelletanlee https://t.co/uDv6eiVb4b pic.twitter.com/pPwMQbfplW — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 3, 2025 Since launching in January 2024, IBIT has captured $52 billion of the $54 billion in total spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and holds over 55% of all Bitcoin ETF assets. The fund has also seen inflows in 17 of its first 18 months. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told the outlet that it was an indication of how much “pent-up demand” there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio. “It also illustrates the leadership of Bitcoin in the crypto space where its perceived utility as a store of value has essentially left the others in its dust,” he added. The BlackRock fund has not seen an outflow day since June 6 and has had $1.47 billion in inflows over the past fortnight. It is “simply a machine,” said Geraci. Busy Week For Crypto ETFs The REX-Osprey Solana staking ETF launched on Wednesday and saw $33 million in trading volume on its first day. Solana fans were celebrating the statistic, but it is dwarfed by the first days of trading for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds. In related news, the SEC has approved Grayscale’s filing to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF, which is comprised of a basket of the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

2025-07-03T05:10:56,"SEC Freezes Grayscale Digital Fund ETF Conversion One Day After Approval — What Changed?","The US SEC has abruptly frozen the approval of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund’s conversion into an exchange-traded fund, halting its launch just a day after the green light was given. On July 1, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approved the NYSE Arca’s proposal to list and trade shares of the Grayscale fund under an amended rule. The approval came with accelerated status, signaling initial confidence in the product’s readiness for market. But within 24 hours, the Commission exercised its right to review the decision, automatically staying the approval under Rule 431 of the SEC’s Rules of Practice. The reversal adds an unexpected twist to what had been hailed as a landmark moment for multi-asset crypto ETFs in the US. Fund’s Heavy Bitcoin-Ethereum Mix Offset by Riskier Altcoin Holdings Launched in 2018, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund holds a basket of top cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for more than 91% of its portfolio. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana and Cardano make up the rest, each carrying differing degrees of regulatory uncertainty. The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling $GDLC it can't launch until otherwise notified. Not sure why, no other info than this letter. My guess tho: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any '33 act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins. So likely… https://t.co/Za7rYk1o0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 By intervening directly, the SEC’s commissioners have signaled that the conversion merits closer inspection beyond what staff-level approval typically requires. Historically, this kind of review is rare and often suggests internal debate over regulatory implications, investor protection or market readiness. Unlike single-asset ETFs such as those tied to Bitcoin, multi-asset products like Grayscale’s bring new complexity. The inclusion of tokens with unsettled legal status, like XRP and Solana, may have prompted concerns over clarity in investor disclosures or the legal treatment of underlying assets. No Timetable Given as SEC Weighs Path Forward for Multi-Asset Crypto Funds Some analysts believe the Commission’s caution could reflect a broader effort to establish a unified approach before opening the gates to more diversified crypto products. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas has suggested the SEC is holding off on GDLC’s ETF conversion until a more consistent regulatory framework for crypto ETPs is in place. Grayscale’s ETF bid comes at a time of renewed momentum for digital asset firms under a more crypto-friendly political backdrop. However, the Commission’s move illustrates that regardless of shifting sentiment, regulatory rigor still holds sway over timing. For Grayscale and NYSE Arca, the stay means an indefinite delay. The SEC has not offered a timeline for its review or any additional guidance on next steps.

2025-07-03T05:03:22,"Will Trump Fire Jerome Powell? Fed Chair Faces Rising Pressure","The post Will Trump Fire Jerome Powell? Fed Chair Faces Rising Pressure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump is once again targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, demanding his immediate resignation as tensions over interest rate policy boil over. Trump is furious that Powell has not slashed rates, blaming the Fed for rising debt-servicing costs that he claims are burdening the U.S. economy. His frustration intensified after Powell suggested that Trump’s tariffs are contributing to inflation, making it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Trump quickly fired back, accusing Powell of standing in the way of economic recovery. Trump Amplifies Resignation Demands The situation escalated when Bill Pulte , head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of lying during Senate testimony and acting with political bias. Trump reposted Pulte’s remarks on social media and doubled down on his demand that Powell step down immediately. This leads to the big question: Will Trump fire Jerome Powell? Can Trump Fire Powell? Legal Obstacles Remain While Trump has previously threatened to remove Powell , experts say the legal route is not that simple. The Supreme Court has reinforced that the Federal Reserve’s independence is protected, and forcibly removing the Fed Chair before the end of his term could face major legal challenges. When Does Jerome Powell’s Term End? Jerome Powell is currently serving a four-year term as Chair of the Federal Reserve, which began in May 2022. His term is set to end in May 2026. Unless he resigns voluntarily, Powell is legally protected from being removed without cause, making Trump’s threats more political than practical. [post_titles_links postid=”477927″] Powell Blames Tariffs, Trump Blames Powell Powell has repeatedly pointed out that the ongoing tariff policies introduced by Trump are driving inflationary pressure. This gives the Fed reason to remain cautious with rate cuts, regardless of political demands. Some analysts are watching a possible tariff expiration around July 9, which may create room for the Fed to ease its stance — but that’s far from guaranteed. Analysts and Crypto Experts Join the Criticism The pressure isn’t limited to politics. Crypto analyst Matt criticized Powell’s refusal to cut rates, noting that inflation is already near the Fed’s 2% target. He compared it to past election years when rate cuts were more aggressive and suggested Powell’s current stance may be politically influenced. Bitcoin Price Reacts Bitcoin jumped 2.62% to over $108,000 in the wake of the political drama, signaling the market’s sensitivity to Fed policy uncertainty. While Powell’s resignation is still unlikely, the growing war of words between Trump and the Fed is keeping both traditional and crypto markets on edge. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why is President Donald Trump demanding Jerome Powell’s resignation? President Trump is demanding Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s resignation because he believes Powell has not cut interest rates aggressively enough. Trump blames the Fed’s high rates for increasing U.S. debt-servicing costs and hindering economic recovery, especially after Powell linked Trump’s tariffs to inflation. How do Jerome Powell and Donald Trump differ on the cause of current inflation? Jerome Powell attributes current inflationary pressures partly to President Trump’s ongoing tariff policies, which he states make it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Donald Trump, however, blames Powell and the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, arguing that rising debt costs are hindering the economy. How is the financial market, including Bitcoin, reacting to the Trump-Powell conflict?

2025-07-03T05:00:59,"Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade within striking distance of its all-time high (ATH), a noticeable shift is underway in the cryptocurrency’s Realized Dominance metric, reflecting changes in behavior between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH). Bitcoin Realized Dominance Shows Shift In Market Sentiment According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, the latest trend in BTC’s Realized Dominance metric highlights a significant shift in overall market structure and sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Realized Dominance metric tracks how much of the realized cap is held by STH vs LTH. A rising LTH cohort share signals strong conviction and maturing supply, while a falling STH share suggests reduced speculation or loss-taking. The latest on-chain data shows that STH Realized Cap has dropped to around 45%, signalling reduced activity from recent buyers. This implies that new BTC entering the market is either being sold at a loss or maturing into long-term holdings – easing short-term speculative pressure. Conversely, the LTH Realized Cap has risen, suggesting long-held coins are being moved at a profit – typically seen during late-stage bull markets. This increase also indicates aging supply, as coins held by short-term investors transition into the LTH category, reflecting strong holder conviction. The analyst added: The divergence between falling STH Realized Cap and rising LTH Realized Cap highlights a supply transfer dynamic: recent entrants struggle with profitability amid lackluster price action, while long-term participants maintain control of an increasing share of network value. Such transitions often precede bullish reversals. As short-term realized cap shrinks, selling pressure typically declines, paving the way for more sustainable upside, provided fresh demand returns. In conclusion, Crazzyblockk noted that the Bitcoin market is currently in a consolidation phase, with weaker hands exiting and stronger holders gaining dominance. If this trend continues, it could establish a more resilient price base for BTC and potentially pave the way for a new ATH. BTC Apparent Demand Has Declined Despite the rise in LTH Realized Dominance, some on-chain signals point to weakening demand. This has raised concerns of a potential short-term drawdown, which could be as severe as the April 2025 pullback to almost $75,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K–$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest Notably, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand – a metric that assesses whether new buyer demand is sufficient to offset selling from miners and LTHs – has dropped to -37,000 BTC. This sharp decline suggests fading buying interest. That said, one positive indicator remains. The STH floor price has been steadily rising over the past few months and is now nearing the psychologically important $100,000 level. At press time, BTC trades at $107,796, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.

Amid finger-pointing and fear, attorney John Deaton is now stepping into the chaos, not just with commentary, but a promise to fight for those affected. MY RESPONSE TO ALL THE EXPERTS REGARDING LINQTO As I said during the spaces, anyone who claims they know exactly what will happen in bankruptcy is either ignorant, lying, or intentionally spreading fear, causing innocent people to stress more than necessary. Some people have… https://t.co/IjzyGruqXX — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 3, 2025 With many holding their life savings in private equity deals through the platform, confusion and fear are running high. But Deaton says there’s more hope here than people realize. Investors Still Come First in Court Deaton pointed out something important that needs attention. He explained that in this bankruptcy, Linqto has no major creditors standing in front of its customers. That means the 11,500 people who bought into Ripple and other private companies through Linqto’s SPV units are first in line. Regular shareholders of Linqto, on the other hand, are last in the queue. This legal structure gives investors a real shot at getting their money back, and maybe even more. All the Big Shares Are Still There Despite all the chaos, Deaton confirmed that the investments are still accounted for. Ripple, Circle, Kraken, SpaceX, and other holdings are still on the books. Ripple alone makes up 4.7 million shares, and the value of those has increased since Linqto made the purchases. Circle shares have gone up even more. According to Deaton, Circle holdings have grown by more than six times the original purchase value. Ripple also bought back shares in June 2025 at 175 each. If that price is used to value what investors hold, their portion of Ripple could be worth over 800 million dollars. Ripple Confirms the Shares Are Real In response to the controversy, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that Linqto owns 4.7 million shares of Ripple. These were bought from secondary market sellers, not from Ripple itself. He made it clear that Ripple has no business ties with Linqto and didn’t participate in their resale schemes. He also stressed that XRP, the cryptocurrency, has nothing to do with these shares. This matters because many investors were confused or misled into thinking they were dealing directly with Ripple. [post_titles_links postid=”477688″] No More Guessing Games Some former employees and the Wall Street Journal claimed that Linqto’s founder is the real culprit, potentially implicated in fraudulent practices and severe securities violations. Meanwhile, others allege that the current CEO is leveraging the bankruptcy as a strategic power tool by turning a small issue into a big power play. Deaton said people should stop guessing because the truth will come out. Internal emails and financial records will all be revealed in court. If all sides work together, a plan could be approved in under a year. But if it turns into a long legal fight, it could drag on for years and eat away at the value. For now, Deaton is focused on protecting the investors and helping them recover.

Why did Linqto collapse, leading to federal investigations? Linqto collapsed due to alleged widespread securities violations and potentially fraudulent practices. Key reasons include former CEO William Sarris allegedly inflating Ripple share prices by over 60% and selling client stock without consent.
