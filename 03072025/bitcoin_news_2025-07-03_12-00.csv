Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate.

The key level to watch in July is $0.60 . If ADA holds and reclaims this level, it could trigger a move back toward the upper boundary of its falling wedge pattern. A breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.74 , and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 in the long term. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55 , with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF, which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high, there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-07-03T09:50:06,"Grayscale GDLC ETF: SEC’s Shocking Delay Rocks Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Grayscale GDLC ETF: SEC’s Shocking Delay Rocks Crypto Market The cryptocurrency world was once again on the edge of its seat, holding its breath for what promised to be another significant step towards mainstream adoption. Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, had seemingly cleared a major hurdle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). The initial nod to convert GDLC into a suite of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) covering Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) sent ripples of excitement through the market. However, just as quickly as the good news emerged, a swift and unexpected stay order from the SEC slammed the brakes on the conversion. This sudden turn of events, particularly concerning the Grayscale GDLC ETF , has left many wondering: what exactly happened, and what does it mean for the future of digital asset investments? So, What Exactly Just Happened with the Grayscale GDLC ETF? For those closely following the digital asset space, Grayscale’s efforts to convert its existing trusts into spot ETFs are well-known. Their landmark victory against the SEC last year, which paved the way for the spot Bitcoin ETFs, set a precedent. The approval for GDLC to transform into ETFs was seen as a natural progression, a testament to the growing maturity and acceptance of a broader range of cryptocurrencies by institutional bodies. The GDLC fund, a diversified portfolio of large-cap digital assets, was poised to offer investors a regulated, easily accessible way to gain exposure to a basket of leading cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. The initial approval signaled a potential paradigm shift, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to embrace other significant altcoins. But the celebration was short-lived. A stay order, essentially a temporary halt, was issued by the SEC, putting the conversion process on hold. This means that while the intent to approve was there, the actual execution is now delayed, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. It’s a classic case of ‘one step forward, two steps back’ in the often-turbulent world of crypto regulation. Why is the SEC Throwing a Wrench in the Works? Understanding the SEC ETF Delay The immediate question on everyone’s mind is, of course, ‘Why?’ The SEC’s actions are often shrouded in regulatory jargon, but insights from industry analysts provide some clarity. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed to a few potential reasons behind the SEC ETF delay : Broader Standard Setting: The SEC might be aiming to establish a comprehensive framework or set clear standards for all digital asset ETFs, rather than approving them on a piecemeal basis. This suggests a more cautious and holistic approach to integrating crypto products into traditional finance. Unresolved Issues with GDLC’s Structure: Despite the initial approval, there might be lingering structural or operational concerns specific to the GDLC fund that the SEC wishes to address before allowing its conversion. This could relate to custody, valuation, or other technical aspects. Another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, offered a slightly different perspective, suggesting the delay could be more directly related to establishing robust listing standards for Altcoin ETFs . While Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained some regulatory footing, the path for other altcoins is far less clear. The SEC might be grappling with how to ensure market integrity, investor protection, and surveillance capabilities for a wider array of digital assets. This regulatory pause highlights the SEC’s ongoing struggle to balance innovation with its mandate to protect investors. It’s a complex dance between allowing new financial products and ensuring they adhere to stringent regulatory requirements. Are Altcoin ETFs Now on Shaky Ground? What the Delay Implies The GDLC fund’s diverse holdings make this delay particularly impactful for the broader altcoin market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant progress in their ETF journey, the path for XRP, Solana, and Cardano has always been less certain due to various regulatory classifications and market structures. The SEC’s stay order on GDLC’s conversion could be a signal of increased scrutiny for any future Altcoin ETFs . What does this mean for investors and issuers hoping for a wave of altcoin-specific ETFs? Increased Scrutiny: Expect the SEC to apply even more rigorous standards to altcoin-focused products. This could involve deeper dives into market manipulation risks, liquidity, and the underlying technology of each asset. Slower Pace of Approvals: The dream of a rapid succession of altcoin spot ETFs might be put on hold. The SEC appears to be taking a deliberate, cautious approach, prioritizing regulatory clarity over speed. Focus on Surveillance Sharing Agreements: A key hurdle for spot ETFs has been the requirement for robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size. For altcoins, identifying such markets and establishing these agreements can be more challenging than for Bitcoin or Ethereum. This delay doesn’t necessarily spell the end for altcoin ETFs, but it certainly suggests a more challenging and protracted journey than some might have anticipated. It underscores the need for clearer regulatory guidelines for these assets. Beyond Bitcoin: The Grand Vision for Digital Asset ETFs The broader context of this delay is the evolving landscape of Digital Asset ETFs . The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a monumental achievement, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream investors. It validated Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The vision, however, extends far beyond Bitcoin. Industry players envision a future where various digital assets, from large-cap altcoins to potentially even tokenized real-world assets, are accessible through regulated ETF structures. These products offer: Benefits of Digital Asset ETFs: Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto without managing private keys or navigating complex exchanges. Liquidity: Traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying/selling. Regulation: Provides a layer of investor protection and oversight that direct crypto investments often lack. Diversification: Enables easy diversification into a basket of digital assets through a single product, like the GDLC. However, the SEC’s cautious approach, as seen with the GDLC delay, highlights the inherent challenges. The lack of a clear regulatory framework for many digital assets, concerns over market manipulation, and the unique characteristics of blockchain technology all contribute to the complexities faced by regulators. What’s Next for Crypto ETF Approval? Navigating the Regulatory Maze The road to full Crypto ETF approval for a wide range of assets remains a winding one. The Grayscale GDLC delay serves as a stark reminder that even after initial positive signals, regulatory hurdles can emerge unexpectedly. What steps might be crucial for the industry and regulators moving forward? Key Considerations for Future Approvals: Regulatory Clarity: The industry desperately needs clear, consistent guidelines on how various digital assets are classified and regulated. This includes clarity on whether an asset is a security, commodity, or something else entirely. Market Surveillance: Establishing robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated spot markets is paramount. This helps the SEC ensure that the underlying markets are not susceptible to fraud and manipulation. Investor Education: Both regulators and issuers need to prioritize educating investors about the risks and rewards associated with digital asset ETFs. Dialogue and Collaboration: Continued open dialogue between industry participants, regulators, and policymakers is essential to finding common ground and fostering innovation responsibly. While the delay is undoubtedly frustrating for Grayscale and investors, it also provides an opportunity for the SEC to refine its approach and for the industry to address any lingering concerns. The ultimate goal is to create a secure and transparent environment for digital asset investments within the traditional financial system. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Halt, in the Crypto ETF Journey The SEC’s stay order on the Grayscale GDLC ETF conversion is a significant development, underscoring the complexities and cautious approach regulators are taking towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin. It highlights the ongoing efforts to establish clear standards for Digital Asset ETFs and address specific concerns related to Altcoin ETFs . While the immediate impact is a delay in offering a diversified basket of crypto ETFs, it doesn’t necessarily signal a complete halt to future Crypto ETF approval . Instead, it serves as a powerful reminder that the regulatory landscape is still evolving, and patience, coupled with persistent advocacy and clear communication, will be key for the crypto industry’s continued integration into mainstream finance. The journey towards comprehensive crypto adoption through regulated products is undoubtedly long, but each step, even a delayed one, contributes to building a more robust and understood ecosystem.

The buzz is undeniable: analysts are forecasting an astonishing new target for Bitcoin, potentially reaching as high as $117,000! This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a projection rooted in robust Bitcoin analysis and a close look at key technical indicators. For anyone interested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these insights is crucial for navigating the volatile yet exhilarating journey of digital assets. Let’s dive deep into what’s driving this optimistic Bitcoin price prediction and what it could mean for the market. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin Price Prediction : Is $117,000 Within Reach? The cryptocurrency community is abuzz with the latest projections, suggesting Bitcoin could be on a direct path to an impressive $117,000. This isn’t a random number pulled from thin air; it’s a figure derived from careful observation of market behavior and specific on-chain metrics. For months, Bitcoin has been consolidating within a defined trading range, oscillating between approximately $78,000 and $110,000. This period of consolidation is often seen as a precursor to a significant price movement, and the current sentiment points towards an upward breakout. Analysts highlight that a decisive move above the $109,000 mark would be a critical trigger, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs. This isn’t just about breaking a psychological barrier; it’s about confirming strong buying pressure and diminishing selling resistance at those levels. The journey to $117,000, while ambitious, is seen as a logical progression if these technical thresholds are surpassed, backed by the underlying strength of the network and growing institutional interest. Deep Dive into Bitcoin Analysis : What Are the Charts Telling Us? When we talk about Bitcoin analysis , we’re looking beyond simple price charts. We’re examining the intricate dance between supply and demand, investor behavior, and the fundamental health of the Bitcoin network. The current market structure suggests a strong accumulation phase, where long-term holders are increasing their positions, and short-term holders are showing resilience. Several factors contribute to this optimistic outlook: Consolidation Period: The prolonged trading range between $78,000 and $110,000 has allowed for a healthy reset, shaking out weaker hands and strengthening the base for the next leg up. Volume Trends: Observing trading volumes during price dips and rallies can reveal underlying strength. High volume on upward moves and lower volume on corrections often indicate bullish sentiment. Market Structure: Higher lows and higher highs on the macro scale suggest an intact bull market, despite periodic corrections. Understanding these patterns is key to appreciating the current Bitcoin price prediction and why analysts are confident in its potential. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about interpreting data. Understanding Key Technical Indicators Driving the Forecast The $117,000 target isn’t arbitrary; it’s heavily influenced by specific technical indicators that provide insights into market psychology and potential price ceilings or floors. Two primary indicators cited by analysts, particularly from Glassnode, are the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis and the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. What are these indicators? Indicator Explanation Significance Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis The average price at which short-term holders (those who have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days) acquired their coins. Historically, when Bitcoin’s price approaches the STH Cost Basis, it often acts as a strong support level during pullbacks or a resistance level during rallies. The fact that it’s currently near $117,000 suggests this could be a significant target or resistance point. Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio Compares Bitcoin’s market capitalization (market value) to its realized capitalization (realized value), which is the sum of all coins valued at the price they last moved on-chain. A high MVRV ratio indicates that the market is overvalued and holders are sitting on significant unrealized gains, potentially signaling a top. A low MVRV suggests undervaluation. Analysts use MVRV to gauge if the market is overbought or has room to grow. The fact that the STH cost basis is currently near $117,000 suggests it acts as a magnetic target or a significant resistance level that Bitcoin aims to test. Coupled with the MVRV metric, which indicates there’s still considerable room for growth before hitting historically “overbought” levels, these technical indicators paint a compelling picture for continued upside potential. The Role of Glassnode Data : STH Cost Basis and MVRV When we delve into on-chain analytics, Glassnode data provides an unparalleled view into the fundamental health and investor behavior within the Bitcoin network. Their comprehensive suite of metrics allows analysts to go beyond simple price action and understand the underlying dynamics of supply and demand. The STH Cost Basis, for example, is particularly insightful because short-term holders are often more reactive to price changes. Their average acquisition cost can become a psychological pivot point for the entire market. Similarly, the MVRV ratio, a cornerstone of Glassnode data , helps determine if Bitcoin is currently trading at a fair value, undervalued, or overvalued. As Cointelegraph reported, the current MVRV readings suggest that despite recent gains, Bitcoin is not yet in “euphoria” territory, meaning there’s still significant room for price appreciation before the market becomes overheated. This implies that the journey towards $117,000 could occur without triggering an immediate, sharp correction often seen at market peaks. These sophisticated metrics from Glassnode offer a deeper layer of confidence to the $117,000 Bitcoin price prediction , moving it from mere speculation to an evidence-backed possibility. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends : Opportunities and Challenges Beyond the specific technical indicators, understanding the broader crypto market trends is crucial for any investor. The current environment is shaped by a confluence of factors, including the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the ongoing macroeconomic landscape. Opportunities: Institutional Inflow: The entry of major financial institutions through ETFs has provided a new, regulated avenue for capital to flow into Bitcoin, creating sustained demand. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving further reduced the supply of new Bitcoin, historically a bullish catalyst that tightens supply against rising demand. Growing Retail Interest: Renewed interest from individual investors, often spurred by positive price action and mainstream media coverage, adds momentum. Challenges: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and central bank policies can still introduce volatility into the market. Regulatory Scrutiny: While progress has been made, evolving regulatory frameworks worldwide can still pose challenges for the broader crypto ecosystem. Market Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. While the potential for significant gains is real, so is the risk of sharp corrections. Keeping an eye on these overarching crypto market trends allows investors to better position themselves, understanding both the immense opportunities and the inherent risks. It’s about being informed and prepared, not just reacting to price movements. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the compelling Bitcoin analysis and the optimistic forecasts, what should investors consider? Monitor Key Levels: Pay close attention to the $109,000 resistance level. A clear breakout above this could signal the next leg up towards the $117,000 target. Understand On-Chain Data: While complex, familiarize yourself with basic concepts of STH Cost Basis and MVRV. Resources like Glassnode provide accessible dashboards. Practice Risk Management: Despite bullish predictions, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility is inherent in crypto. Diversify (Wisely): While Bitcoin often leads the market, consider a diversified portfolio if it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves fast. Follow reputable news sources and analysts to stay updated on the latest developments and shifts in crypto market trends . These insights empower you to make more informed decisions, leveraging the power of data and expert analysis. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Bitcoin The journey towards $117,000 for Bitcoin is not just a speculative fantasy; it’s a meticulously analyzed possibility backed by strong technical indicators and on-chain data, particularly from Glassnode. While the path to new all-time highs will undoubtedly have its twists and turns, the current Bitcoin analysis suggests a robust foundation for continued growth. As the digital asset landscape matures and institutional adoption deepens, understanding these underlying metrics becomes paramount for any serious investor. The stage is set for what could be an exhilarating period for Bitcoin, reaffirming its position as a leading force in the financial world.

This uptick comes at a time when a key company is considering ETH as a potential treasury reserve asset, underscoring renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. Forecasting $7,000 Potential Despite being one of the poorer performers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a year-to-date decline of 24%, Ethereum’s recent 6% surge has allowed it to outpace competitors, including Bitcoin (BTC), which is close to its all-time high. Crypto analyst Alek Carter has also expressed a bullish outlook on Ethereum (ETH), drawing parallels between the current price patterns and those observed in 2020. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases He describes the recent movements in ETH’s chart as reminiscent of the “dead cat bounce” phenomenon—a term used to describe a temporary recovery in price after a significant decline—followed by a final retest before a substantial upward trend. Carter points out that Ethereum underwent a similar trajectory in 2020, where it initially experienced a dip before rebounding sharply to reach a peak of over $3,500. He believes that the recent completion of what he terms the “final retest” suggests that Ethereum is poised for another significant rally. If the current setup mirrors the previous cycle, Carter anticipates that ETH could potentially reach a new high of $7,000. Bullish Sentiment For Ethereum The bullish sentiment surrounding ETH is further reflected in the performance of stocks associated with the cryptocurrency. BitMine, a Bitcoin mining company that recently announced plans to make ETH its primary treasury reserve, saw its stock soar by about 20%, with an increase of over 1,000% since the announcement. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming, which has adopted an ETH treasury strategy, experienced an 11% rise, while Bit Digital, which shifted its focus from Bitcoin mining to Ethereum treasury and staking, gained more than 6%. Moreover, the recent interest in ETH is evident in the performance of Ethereum ETFs, which saw inflows of $40 million on Tuesday, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. A Experts also highlight that ETH’s smart contract capabilities have established it as a leading platform for the tokenization of traditional assets, including US dollar-pegged stablecoins. The ‘Backbone’ Of Stablecoins? Fundstrat’s Tom Lee characterized Ethereum as “the backbone and architecture” of stablecoins, given that issuers like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) operate on its network. Additionally, BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last year. Tokenization itself represents a transformative process, allowing digital representations of publicly traded securities and real-world assets to be issued on blockchain networks. While holders of tokenized assets do not possess outright ownership, the mechanism opens up new avenues for investment and asset management. Related Reading: Michael Saylor’s Strategy Set To Yield $14 Billion Profit In Q2, Bloomberg The latest wave of interest in Ethereum and related assets follows Robinhood’s announcement to enable trading of tokenized US stocks and ETFs across Europe. This development comes on the heels of a growing interest in stablecoins, spurred by Circle’s IPO and the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin bill that aims to provide a new framework for these assets to integrate in the broader financial landscape.

Despite Bitcoin’s rise, Kiyosaki believes it remains valuable and will continue buying. Kiyosaki emphasizes Bitcoin as a long-term investment to protect against fiat instability. To frame Bitcoin as a timeless asset, “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki is reaching back to America’s founding, citing President George Washington’s stark warnings about paper money to champion the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Kiyosaki argues that Bitcoin represents the modern solution to the exact “fraud” and economic ruin that Washington predicted would result from fiat currency.

Solana just made a bold entry into the U.S. ETF market! The first-ever Solana staking ETF launched by REX Shares under the ticker SSK recorded over $33 million in trading volume on its first day, with $12 million in inflows. That’s more than what we saw with the XRP and Solana futures ETFs when they launched earlier this year and well above the average ETF debut in the U.S., according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “$SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs,” Balchunas posted on X. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume.

It’s structured as a C-corporation, which allowed it to skip the usual SEC approval process. That legal move was made so the fund could offer staking rewards, something traditional ETFs can’t do yet. That feature gives SSK a unique edge. Investors get indirect exposure to SOL, while also benefiting from the network’s staking yields. The fund is custodied by Anchorage Digital, a well-known name in digital asset custody. What Comes Next? Spot Solana ETFs Are in the Pipeline The success of SSK has sparked fresh interest in pure spot Solana ETFs, which are still waiting for regulatory green lights. Big players like Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have filings in progress, and Balchunas recently said he sees a 95% chance of approval later this year. That puts Solana ahead of XRP in the ETF race, at least for now. Here are mine and @EricBalchunas ' most recent odds on spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025.

Traders are watching the $160 resistance level closely, with bullish momentum building on both the RSI and MACD indicators. If that level breaks, analysts expect a possible move toward $184. Why This Matters for Solana This launch shows real demand for Solana from larger investors. A staking ETF is a first in the U.S., and while it’s not a full spot ETF, it’s a big step forward.

2025-07-03T09:10:37,"Unprecedented Fortune: How Donald Trump’s Family Built a $620M+ Crypto Empire","BitcoinWorld Unprecedented Fortune: How Donald Trump’s Family Built a $620M+ Crypto Empire In a surprising and significant pivot, the U.S. President Donald Trump and his family have reportedly amassed an astounding fortune exceeding $620 million through their strategic foray into the cryptocurrency space. This monumental shift marks a profound departure from their long-standing reliance on traditional real estate and licensing agreements, signaling a bold embrace of the faster-moving, high-stakes digital asset markets. For those keenly observing the intersection of high-profile figures and the burgeoning crypto world, this development underscores the immense, often unpredictable, wealth-building potential that digital currencies offer. The Astounding Rise of Trump Crypto Ventures The Trump family’s deep dive into digital assets represents a fascinating case study in wealth diversification. Traditionally synonymous with towering skyscrapers and golf courses, their financial interests have now expanded dramatically into the volatile yet lucrative realm of cryptocurrencies. This strategic move highlights a growing trend among influential figures to explore alternative investment avenues beyond conventional markets. A significant portion of their reported earnings stems from their involvement with the DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). This venture alone has seen tokens sold worth over $550 million, with a substantial chunk—approximately $390 million—directly benefiting the Trump family. Beyond these sales, the family also holds a considerable amount of WLFI-branded tokens, whose value was reported to exceed $2 billion as of June. This dual approach of token sales and strategic holdings demonstrates a comprehensive engagement with the DeFi ecosystem. Key Aspects of WLFI’s Contribution: Direct Earnings: Over $390 million from token sales. Asset Holdings: More than $2 billion in WLFI-branded tokens. Strategic Shift: A clear move from traditional real estate to digital assets. Unpacking the Trump Family’s Digital Fortune Beyond WLFI, the Trump family’s crypto portfolio is surprisingly diverse, encompassing stablecoins and even the highly speculative memecoin market. This multi-pronged approach showcases an aggressive strategy to capitalize on various facets of the crypto economy. The USD1 Stablecoin Initiative One notable initiative is the launch of their proprietary stablecoin, USD1. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. The USD1 stablecoin gained significant traction following a major investment from MGX, indicating institutional confidence in its potential. The success of USD1 highlights the growing demand for stable, reliable digital currencies in an often-turbulent market. Venturing into Memecoins and Branded Tokens Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of their crypto journey is the embrace of memecoins, including a dedicated Trump-branded coin. Memecoins, characterized by their community-driven nature and often rapid price fluctuations, represent a high-risk, high-reward segment of the crypto market. The launch of a Trump-branded memecoin generated significant attention, leveraging the family’s public profile to drive engagement and, reportedly, substantial profits. This move blurs the lines between political branding and speculative digital assets, creating a unique phenomenon in the crypto landscape. Navigating the Future of Political Crypto Earnings The Trump family’s crypto ventures extend further, with a strategic investment in a significant crypto entity. Their 20% stake in American Bitcoin, a company reportedly planning to go public, represents another potential avenue for massive wealth generation. An Initial Public Offering (IPO) of American Bitcoin could add even more substantial value to their already burgeoning digital portfolio, solidifying their position as major players in the crypto investment sphere. The involvement of such a high-profile political family in digital assets raises important questions about the future of finance, regulatory oversight, and the evolving relationship between traditional power structures and decentralized technologies. As more public figures and institutions engage with cryptocurrencies, the landscape of wealth accumulation continues to transform. Examining the Impact of Donald Trump’s Crypto Foray The Trump family’s substantial earnings from their Trump crypto ventures offer a compelling case study into the benefits and challenges inherent in the digital asset space. Their success highlights the unprecedented speed at which wealth can be generated in crypto markets, far surpassing the traditional timelines associated with real estate or conventional investments. Benefits Observed: Rapid Wealth Generation: Crypto markets offer unparalleled speed for capital appreciation compared to traditional assets. Diversification: A significant shift away from traditional real estate, diversifying their wealth portfolio. New Market Access: Tapping into a global, digital-native investor base. Leveraging Brand Power: Utilizing public recognition to drive interest in branded digital assets like memecoins. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: The inherent price swings in crypto markets pose significant risks. Regulatory Scrutiny: High-profile involvement can attract increased attention from financial regulators. Public Perception: The association with speculative assets like memecoins can be polarizing. Security Risks: Digital assets are vulnerable to hacks and technological failures. Strategic Insights from Trump’s Crypto Portfolio The journey of Donald Trump crypto earnings provides several actionable insights for both seasoned investors and newcomers to the digital asset space. The Trumps’ approach underscores the importance of exploring diverse crypto segments, from foundational DeFi protocols and stablecoins to the more speculative memecoins and equity stakes in crypto companies. Lessons for Investors: Embrace Diversification: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. Explore different types of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Understand Risk Tolerance: High-reward opportunities often come with high risks. Assess your comfort level with volatility. Stay Informed: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Continuous learning about new protocols, technologies, and regulatory changes is crucial. Consider Long-Term Holdings vs. Short-Term Trading: The Trumps hold significant amounts of WLFI tokens, indicating a long-term belief in the asset, alongside more speculative ventures. The Trump family crypto ventures illustrate a broader trend: the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream finance and even political narratives. This intertwining of high-stakes finance and public personas will likely continue to shape the future of both sectors. The remarkable accumulation of wealth by the Trump family through their diverse crypto ventures signals a paradigm shift in how prominent figures approach wealth creation. From substantial earnings via the World Liberty Financial DeFi protocol and the successful launch of their USD1 stablecoin, to the high-profile engagement with memecoins and a significant stake in American Bitcoin, their digital portfolio is both extensive and lucrative. This bold pivot from traditional real estate to the dynamic world of digital assets underscores the transformative power of cryptocurrencies, while also highlighting the inherent complexities and considerations that accompany such high-profile involvement in the nascent industry. Their journey serves as a powerful testament to the evolving landscape of global finance, where political crypto engagement is becoming an increasingly visible and impactful force.

2025-07-03T09:02:37,"Bitcoin Treasury Trend: Scaramucci’s Stark Warning on Corporate Adoption","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Trend: Scaramucci’s Stark Warning on Corporate Adoption The world of corporate finance has seen a fascinating, albeit controversial, trend emerge in recent years: companies adding Bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets as a treasury asset. While some hailed this as a revolutionary shift, a prominent voice in the financial world is now suggesting this trend might be short-lived. Anthony Scaramucci, the astute founder of U.S. hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, has cast a sobering shadow over the enthusiasm, predicting that the era of companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies is likely to fade. Scaramucci’s Prediction: Why the Corporate Bitcoin Trend May Diminish In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Scaramucci articulated his view that the “replicative treasury company idea” – where businesses primarily gain value from holding Bitcoin – will lose momentum in the coming months. This isn’t a dismissal of Bitcoin itself, but rather a realistic assessment of its suitability as a primary corporate treasury strategy for most businesses. His perspective suggests that while the initial excitement led many to consider mirroring successful early adopters, the fundamental economics for the majority of companies simply won’t support it long-term. He believes that the novelty will wear off, and traditional financial metrics will regain their prominence in investor evaluations. The focus for investors will inevitably shift back to core business operations, revenue generation, and sustainable profitability, rather than merely the fluctuating value of a digital asset on the balance sheet. The Michael Saylor Phenomenon: An Unreplicable Success? It’s impossible to discuss corporate Bitcoin adoption without acknowledging the undeniable success of Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy (MSTR). Saylor’s aggressive and unwavering strategy of converting company cash reserves into Bitcoin has indeed yielded significant gains, making MicroStrategy synonymous with institutional BTC investment. Scaramucci readily acknowledges Saylor’s remarkable achievements. However, he highlights a crucial distinction: MicroStrategy is unique. Beyond its massive Bitcoin holdings, the company possesses multiple business lines, including its enterprise analytics software, which provide a foundational layer of revenue and operational value. This diversified structure allows MSTR to absorb the volatility inherent in Bitcoin in a way that a typical company, without such robust alternative revenue streams, might not be able to. Saylor’s unique vision and the specific context of MicroStrategy’s existing business make it an outlier, not a blueprint for every other corporation. Challenges Facing General BTC Investment Strategy for Companies While MicroStrategy’s journey has been impressive, it also serves as a cautionary tale for those seeking to simply replicate its model. What are the inherent difficulties that Scaramucci sees for other companies trying to maintain high valuations simply by holding Bitcoin? Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin’s price swings are legendary. While this can lead to massive gains, it also exposes a company’s balance sheet to significant risk, potentially impacting investor confidence and credit ratings. Investor Scrutiny: Investors, particularly institutional ones, are increasingly looking for stable, predictable returns driven by core business operations. A company whose valuation is primarily tied to a volatile asset like Bitcoin might be seen as speculative rather than fundamentally sound. Operational Focus vs. Speculation: The primary goal of most businesses is to generate profit through their products or services. Diverting significant attention and capital to managing a highly volatile treasury asset can distract from core operational efficiency and innovation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and uncertain across jurisdictions. This adds another layer of risk and complexity for companies holding large amounts of Bitcoin. Scaramucci’s viewpoint suggests that the initial euphoria around simply holding BTC as a treasury asset will give way to a more pragmatic evaluation of a company’s true value proposition. The market will eventually demand to see how a company creates value through its primary business, not just through its digital asset portfolio. Beyond Bitcoin: The Importance of Core Business Profitability Scaramucci’s Scaramucci prediction isn’t just about the fading trend; it’s a powerful reminder of fundamental investment principles. He posits that investors will ultimately focus on a company’s business profitability and value creation. This means scrutinizing revenue streams, profit margins, market share, innovation, and sustainable growth models. For companies considering or currently holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, this implies a need to clearly articulate how their core business generates value, independent of their crypto holdings. The allure of quick gains from a rising Bitcoin price might be tempting, but a robust, profitable business model is what sustains long-term investor confidence and delivers enduring value. Companies that cannot demonstrate this will find it increasingly difficult to justify high valuations based solely on their digital asset exposure. Navigating the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption So, what does this mean for the future of BTC investment strategy within corporate finance? While a widespread, “replicative” trend of holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset may indeed fade, it doesn’t necessarily signal the end of corporate engagement with Bitcoin entirely. Companies might still find strategic ways to incorporate digital assets: Payment Rails: Using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for international payments or remittances to reduce transaction costs and speed. Web3 Integration: Businesses deeply involved in the blockchain, NFT, or metaverse space might naturally hold crypto assets as part of their operational infrastructure. Treasury Diversification (Minor Allocation): A small, carefully managed allocation as part of a broader, diversified treasury strategy, similar to holding gold or other alternative assets, but not as a primary driver of valuation. Strategic Investments: Investing in blockchain startups or technologies rather than direct asset holding. The key takeaway from Scaramucci’s insights is that the market will mature. Speculation alone won’t be enough to sustain corporate valuations. Real value creation, driven by innovative business models and strong financial performance, will always be the bedrock of long-term success. Companies need to ask themselves: are we holding Bitcoin because it aligns with our core business strategy, or simply because others are doing it? The answer will dictate their sustainability in the eyes of discerning investors. Conclusion: A Reality Check for Corporate Crypto Enthusiasts Anthony Scaramucci’s forecast serves as a crucial reality check for the corporate world. While the initial surge in companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset captured headlines and generated excitement, his seasoned perspective suggests that this particular wave is unlikely to sustain its momentum. The unique success of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy stands as an exception, not a rule, primarily due to its distinct business model beyond just holding Bitcoin. For the vast majority of companies, the path to long-term valuation and investor confidence lies not in speculative asset holdings, but in robust business profitability, value creation, and a clear, sustainable operational strategy. As the market evolves, the focus will undoubtedly shift back to the fundamentals, reminding us that true corporate strength is built on innovation and earnings, not just a volatile digital asset on the balance sheet.

The US’s first Solana (SOL) Staking ETF (SSK), launched by REX-Osprey, attracted a lot of attention on its first day. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, the first approved spot staking crypto ETF in the U.S., saw $33 million in first-day trading volume, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also noted the success of the Solana ETF and said, “The first Solana Staking ETF in the US has been launched. SSK recorded approximately $8 million in trading volume in just 20 minutes after its launch.” The ETF also achieved $1 million in assets under management. The Solana ETF's performance has outpaced the Solana and XRP futures ETFs and the average ETF outflow. However, it still fell short of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Admitted under stricter oversight and regulations under the Securities Act of 1940, the ETF chose Anchorage as its custodian. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume.

In contrast, Ethereum ETFs faced modest $1.8 million outflows, according to data from SosoValue . The stark difference resulted from Bitcoin’s continued institutional appeal as BTC reached weekly highs of $109,000 on July 2, positioning it for potential breakouts toward $112,000 targets. Source: Cryptonews Fidelity’s FBTC led Bitcoin ETF inflows with $183.96 million , followed by ARK21Shares’ ARKB at $83 million and Bitwise’s BITB contributing $64.94 million . BlackRock’s IBIT, despite recording zero inflows on the day, maintains its dominant position with $76.31 billion in net assets and $52.42 billion in cumulative inflows since launch. Source: SosoValue The performance disparity between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs followed the broader market trend, as Bitcoin maintains psychological support above the $100,000 level defended since early May. Total Bitcoin ETF assets under management reached $136.68 billion , representing 6.30% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. This indicates a significant level of institutional adoption. Trading volumes also surged to $5.22 billion across Bitcoin ETFs, with IBIT alone generating $4.08 billion in daily trading activity. Institutional Momentum Drives Record Bitcoin ETF Adoption Bitcoin ETF inflows demonstrate sustained institutional conviction, despite broader market volatility, with the latest inflows representing the continuation of aggressive accumulation patterns seen so far in 2025. Particularly, Fidelity’s FBTC leadership, with $183.96 million in inflows, resulted from the growing competition among major asset managers for Bitcoin market share, following BlackRock’s early dominance. The growing competition has led to a broad-based institutional adoption, rather than concentrated buying from a single entity. Interestingly, corporate treasury strategies are increasingly embracing ETF structures over direct ownership of Bitcoin. Design giant, Figma, recently revealed in its IPO filing that it has $69.5 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings , plus $30 million earmarked for future cryptocurrency investments. Design giant @figma goes public revealing $70M Bitcoin ETF holdings and $30M ready to buy more as corporate Bitcoin adoption explodes to 141 public companies holding $91 billion. #Figma #IPO #Bitcoin https://t.co/Q9CtjTalum — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 This pattern is becoming increasingly adopted, and public companies that can’t hold directly prefer regulated exposure through established financial products. Regionally, European expansion is also accelerating through structured products, such as the recent UniCredit’s Bitcoin ETF certificate , designed for Italian professional clients. The five-year instrument offers capital protection with 85% upside participation. Moreover, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve favorably with the SEC’s July 1 guidance streamlining token-based ETF approvals and enabling a 75-day review process. The new guidance establishes clearer pathways for crypto ETF approvals by implementing standardized disclosure frameworks that encompass custody practices, conflicts of interest, and creation and redemption mechanisms. Ethereum ETFs Face Headwinds Despite Previous Momentum Ethereum ETFs experienced modest $1.8 million outflows on July 2, contrasting sharply with their previous dominance, as they had recorded $240.29 million in daily inflows during June , surpassing Bitcoin ETFs’ performance at that time. The June surge represented the strongest performance of Ethereum ETFs in four months, coinciding with ETH climbing above $2,800 for the first time since February. Source: Cryptonews BlackRock’s ETHA led that momentum with $163.6 million in single-day inflows, maintaining a 23-day streak without outflows while managing over 1.55 million ETH valued at $4.23 billion. Current outflows may result from profit-taking following Ethereum’s technical breakout above multi-year descending trendlines. The asset completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with projected targets around $3,300, but recent rejection from $2,834 highs suggests consolidation phases before continued advances. Ethereum staking also reached an all-time high of 34.65 million ETH locked on the Beacon Chain, representing nearly 29% of the circulating supply. Long-term holders are holding on through staking despite short-term ETF flow volatility. They’re prioritizing yield generation over immediate liquidity. Regulatory developments further support the growth of multi-asset crypto ETFs, as seen in Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund conversion , which holds Bitcoin (79.9%), Ethereum (11.3%), and also XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Similarly, the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF was launched on Wednesday as the first US-listed fund to incorporate crypto staking. This regulatory development could enable similar Ethereum staking products that combine institutional access with yield generation.

2025-07-03T08:33:08,"Arthur Hayes Warns Bitcoin Could Dip to $90K Before Next Bull Run","The post Arthur Hayes Warns Bitcoin Could Dip to $90K Before Next Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In his latest blog post titled “ Quid Pro Stablecoin ,” Arthur Hayes delivers a sharp analysis of the current macroeconomic landscape and how it may affect the crypto market. He warns that crypto prices could move sideways—or slightly lower—between now and the Jackson Hole economic symposium in August. Why Hayes Expects a Bitcoin Price Dip Hayes believes a market correction is likely in the near term. With Bitcoin’s recent price surge , traders may take profits while waiting for clearer signals from the Federal Reserve. He highlights one key factor: if the U.S. Treasury begins replenishing its General Account (TGA), it could withdraw liquidity from the system, placing pressure on risk assets like crypto. Drawing from past market cycles and sentiment shifts, Hayes projects a temporary dip in Bitcoin’s price to around $90,000, potentially flushing out weak hands before the next leg up. He also warns that this liquidity squeeze could create a “summer lull”—a period of sideways or downward movement—until at least the Jackson Hole event in late August. If macro conditions worsen, Hayes may reduce Maelstrom’s Bitcoin exposure, though the fund has already exited its illiquid altcoin positions. Traditional Banks and Stablecoins Could Drive the Next Bull Run What makes this cycle different, according to Hayes, is the growing role of traditional banks in crypto. With the U.S. government signaling support for stablecoins—especially after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act —banks like JPMorgan may soon launch their own USD-backed tokens. Unlike existing stablecoins like USDC or Tether, these bank-issued tokens would come with full regulatory backing and access to the Federal Reserve system. Hayes emphasizes that the stablecoin push is not just about consumer safety—it’s also a strategy for the U.S. government to exert greater control over crypto’s monetary flows. This shift could change how liquidity moves within the crypto market and force issuers to meet stricter reserve requirements or obtain special licenses. [post_titles_links postid=”477986″] A Game-Changer for Crypto Liquidity Hayes calls these developments a “game-changer.” He explains that regulated bank-issued stablecoins would allow banks to channel retail deposits into short-term U.S. Treasuries without violating capital rules. This could act like a new form of quantitative easing, injecting fresh liquidity into markets—without any official intervention from the Federal Reserve. Could $6.8 Trillion Flow Into Crypto? Hayes estimates that if even a portion of the $17 trillion currently sitting in U.S. bank deposits flows into these new stablecoins, it could result in $6.8 trillion in demand for Treasury securities. This massive wave of liquidity wouldn’t just stay confined to bonds—it could spill over into crypto and tech stocks, potentially igniting the next major bull market. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs How is the crypto market performing today? As of July 3, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed movements. Bitcoin is holding steady around $107,000, recovering from recent dips below $100,000. Ethereum has seen a notable surge, reaching $2,600 USDT, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, and TRON are showing relative strength. This suggests some market resilience, despite Hayes’ prediction of a “summer lull.” Are Arthur Hayes’ Bitcoin predictions realistic? Arthur Hayes’ predictions are considered bold and often contrarian, yet he openly acknowledges when he’s wrong. While his short-term calls can be volatile, his longer-term forecasts, such as Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2028, are based on his macroeconomic analysis of global liquidity, U.S. debt, and the potential for a new form of quantitative easing through regulated stablecoins. Many analysts consider his macro view influential, even if his exact price targets are ambitious. What is the “GENIUS Act,” and how does it relate to stablecoins? The “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,” or GENIUS Act, is U.S. legislation passed by the Senate (June 17, 2025) to create a comprehensive federal framework for regulating payment stablecoins. It signals government support while setting stricter reserve and licensing requirements, potentially favoring bank-issued stablecoins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-warns-bitcoin-could-dip-to-90k-before-next-bull-run/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T08:22:07,"Chinese Analyst Reveals: “If Ethereum Surpasses This Price Level, the Bull Run Will Begin”","Jack Yi, the founder of LD Capital, stated on social media that the volatility in the crypto market is nearing an end. Yi argued that when the market starts to rise, sudden drops can sometimes disrupt the process, but these fluctuations will not change the general trend. JackYi, who claimed that the expected interest rate cuts and developments in the Ethereum ecosystem in the near future will surprise patient investors, said that especially if the Ethereum (ETH) price exceeds the $ 3,000 level, this will be a harbinger of a real bull market not only for investors but for the entire sector. Yi said, “In a bull trend, we only buy on declines.” Related News: One of Belgium's Largest Banks Takes Important Step with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) So why is ETH lagging behind Bitcoin? According to Yi, the main reason for this situation is that institutional investors have embraced Bitcoin’s narrative. While Bitcoin is seen as a “store of value” with a simple and clear value proposition, ETH’s function is much broader and more versatile. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency, it is the programmable infrastructure of the entire tokenized economy. Therefore, the narrative of Ethereum is more comprehensive, which leads to a delay in institutional adoption. However, Yi believes that Ethereum’s broader potential will become more widely understood over time, and price action will reflect that. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-03T08:00:51,"Bitcoin Price To Hit New ATH in Coming 1-2 Weeks","The post Bitcoin Price To Hit New ATH in Coming 1-2 Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price is now trading at $109,236 , a level it hasn’t touched in nearly a month. But this isn’t just any price rally. According to top crypto trader Michael van de Poppe, Bitcoin is showing strong momentum that could soon push it past its previous all-time high of $111,970. If this rally holds, a new record could be just a week or two away. BTC Price Breakout In Weeks In a recent bitcoin price analysis, Michael shared a key 4-hour chart showing that Bitcoin has cleared a big hurdle, the $106,500 level. Breaking this barrier pushed BTC up past $108,000, where it’s now holding firm near $109,000. This shows that buyers are back and momentum is building. He notes that when Bitcoin passed $106,500 earlier, it took liquidity from lower levels, which pushed out short traders and gave BTC more energy to rise. Michael believes the next target is around $110,500. If Bitcoin stays above this mark, it could break its old all-time high of $111,970, or even go higher in the next couple of weeks. Key Levels to Watch Next Even with strong momentum, Michael believes that Bitcoin could see small dips along the way. If there’s a pullback, traders are watching the $105,500 area and the $100,000 zone as good spots to add more positions.

2025-07-03T08:00:50,"Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 –  Here Are The Levels To Watch","Ethereum (ETH) has surged 7.5% in the daily timeframe to break above a key resistance level for the first time in weeks. Following its breakout, some analysts forecasted that a retest of the range highs could be around the corner. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Ethereum Reclaims Crucial Area On Wednesday, Ethereum jumped over 7% from its local low to the $2,550 mark, setting the stage to reclaim another crucial resistance. The King of Altcoins climbed from the $2,380 support to the $2,585 area, hitting a two-week high. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $2,400-$2,800 price range since the early May breakout, but briefly lost this area after failing to hold the $2,550 support two weeks ago. After recovering its local range, ETH struggled to break past the $2,500 barrier, trading between the range low and this resistance for a week. Nonetheless, today’s market recovery, which also saw Bitcoin jump to the $109,600 mark, has sparked bullish sentiment among investors. Amid today’s performance, Daan Crypto Trades called ETH’s price action a “nice move out of the local range.” However, he suggested that bulls must hold the $2,520 area to confirm it isn’t another deviation or liquidity grab in a “bigger chop.” To the trader, failing to hold this area would send the cryptocurrency to the range lows again. As a result, the major levels to watch remain the $2,310 support and $2,735 resistance. Market watcher Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum has “respected support every single time,” forming “one of the cleanest breakouts we’ve ever seen.” He highlighted a three-month ascending triangle in ETH’s chart, pointing out that the King of Altcoins bounced from the rising support line during the recent price deviation and now targets the next key resistance around the $2,700 mark. Ethereum is charging up. Higher lows, strong base, bullish MACD crossover. A clean break of $2,700… and ETH will fly. $3,000 is just the beginning. The real move comes after that. ETH To Repeat ATH Set Up? Merlijn also affirmed that ETH’s two-year setup is repeating, which could signal that a massive breakout is coming. According to the chart, the Ethereum price has moved in stages that last about two years since 2018. During the first stage, the cryptocurrency’s price forms a base, which later leads to the second stage, where the price rejects and retests the base lows. Lastly, Ethereum experiences the liftoff phase, where the price breaks out to new highs. The last liftoff phase, between 2020 and 2022, saw ETH surge from the $100 mark to its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). To the trader, “This time we start from $1,500. Not a dip. A launchpad.” Similarly, analyst Kaleo pointed out the structural resemblance between ETH’s performance this cycle and last cycle. He noted that, while BTC hit a new ATH in December 2020, Ethereum was 60% down from its previous cycle highs, leading many investors to suggest it was “dead.” Related Reading: Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout Nonetheless, ETH climbed over 800% from there, outperforming Bitcoin’s 250% increase in the following months. This time, the cryptocurrency has also seen up to a 68% retrace from its previous ATH, while BTC soared to new highs. If history repeats, “The bottom for ETH is in. Up only from here,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,568, a 6.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Secretary Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan informed the Senate Standing Committee on Power that although surplus electricity is available during winter, the IMF strictly stands against it. Pakistan’s 2,000 MW Crypto Mining Plan Gets Rejected In a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Mohsin Aziz, the ongoing discussions with the IMF on crypto mining were outlined. IMF cited concerns about market distortions before rejecting the proposal to offer subsidized rates to energy-intensive industries such as crypto mining, data centres, and metal industries. Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts for crypto mining , aiming at interest foreign investments, has now been rejected by the IMF. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary Irfan. However, ongoing discussions suggest that Pakistan is committed to refining its energy plan to align with global standards and recommendations. [post_titles_links postid=”478042″] Pakistan in Talks With International Institutions Dr. Irfan confirmed that the government is still in talks with international institutions to redefine its power subsidiary plan after the IMF rejected the proposal. The committee also discussed the technological solutions aimed at combating electricity theft. Pakistan government’s recent agreement with scheduled banks to reduce the circular debt stock of Rs. 1.275 trillion was also discussed during the meeting. Senator Shibli Faraz criticized the deal, accusing the banks of being “forced at gunpoint” to offer loans. Power Theft in Pakistan The Secretary Power added that 58% of users pay a subsidized rate of Rs. 10 per unit, which is a lot less than the government standard price. The government is planning to allocate Rs. 250 billion in subsidies this year and expand anti-theft technology in he country. The committee has directed the power division to submit a comprehensive answer to various issues at the next meeting.

Pakistan’s 2,000 MW crypto mining plan aimed to allocate surplus electricity, especially during winter, to energy-intensive industries like crypto mining, data centers, and metal industries. Its goal was to attract foreign investment, monetize underutilized power, and create high-tech jobs, turning surplus energy into a revenue-generating asset. What are the implications of the IMF’s rejection for Pakistan’s crypto ambitions? The IMF’s rejection creates significant hurdles for Pakistan’s crypto ambitions, particularly regarding large-scale, subsidized crypto mining operations. It means Pakistan must refine its energy plan to align with global standards and avoid market distortions, potentially slowing down its aim to become a regional crypto and AI hub. How does electricity theft in Pakistan impact the feasibility of large-scale crypto mining? Widespread electricity theft in Pakistan poses a significant challenge to the feasibility of large-scale crypto mining. It contributes to financial losses for utilities, potentially leading to higher tariffs for honest consumers and instability in the power grid. Such issues make it difficult to guarantee a stable and cost-effective power supply for energy-intensive operations like crypto mining.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/imf-rejects-pakistans-2000-mw-crypto-mining-proposal/,"MINING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN|BTC","News|Mining",cryptocompare

The malicious apps spoof the most widely used wallets, stealing private phrases and leaving users vulnerable to being drained. An ongoing campaign is spreading malicious extensions, spoofing some of the most common crypto wallets on Firefox. Koi security discovered some of the apps were removed, while others were still active, posing as legitimate wallets. The SlowMist attack team also warned users to be vigilant, as the attack is still active. The fake apps are spreading through the official Firefox app store, making them potentially more misleading and dangerous. 🚨SlowMist TI Alert🚨 A massive malicious campaign involving dozens of fake #Firefox extensions designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet credentials is underway. Over 40 fake extensions impersonating trusted #wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Phantom, OKX,… pic.twitter.com/IIfE5ifxJi — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) July 3, 2025 The attack is relatively simple, but targets the easiest type of user, who seek casual access to crypto. Using a compromised app, or inputting private phrases into one may lead to significant losses. Users are already reporting losses from the fake apps. Hacks and exploits accelerated in the first half of 2025, as crypto increased in value. Threats also came from DPRK hackers infiltrating projects, with hundreds potentially affected by malicious code. Firefox fake extensions target the most widely used wallets Koi intercepted fake apps for some of the most widely used wallet extensions, including Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. The researchers discovered over 40 apps posing as wallets, with new ones appearing. Some of the fake wallets are still active on unofficial links. According to researchers, the fake apps started spreading around April 2025. The extensions extract and send out wallet extensions, reaching a server controlled by the attacker. The apps also transmit the user’s IP address for tracking and further targeting. Attackers cloned the open-source code of legitimate wallets The attack was relatively simple, often using the legitimate wallet code for open-source projects like MetaMask. The fake apps then injected the malicious code to allow the wallet to steal data and credentials. The fake wallet apps were active on app stores, using the same logos and style as the original wallet. Previously, faked wallets have targeted specific niche projects, but this time, the attacker spoofed multi-asset wallets, widely used for DeFi, trading, NFT and other on-chain tasks. Code analysis concluded the attack most likely originated from Russia, as Russian-language code comments were discovered in some of the apps. Metadata from a file on one of the command-and-control servers also points to a Russian attacker. Koi advices users to install an allow list filter and avoid downloading apps without vetting. Some of the apps may not show problems, but later update and change their behavior. Security researchers also advice against searching apps directly, as the results may point to fake wallets with deliberately inflated five-star reviews. The best approach is to use the wallet’s official web page or social media. Users were also advised to be skeptical when seeing an app with too many five-star reviews, that were artificially placed to make the app seem established and legitimate.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,138.45 and $109,763.65 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-03T07:39:07,"Market Prophet Tom Lee Reveals His Prediction About Ethereum (ETH) – “Banks…”","Famous investor and Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicts that banks will buy Ethereum (ETH) not only for speculative gains but also to secure their infrastructure. Lee states that this strategy will initiate institutional-level Ethereum accumulation, similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments. According to Lee, the financial sector and the cryptocurrency world will become increasingly intertwined by 2025. The basis of this convergence is stablecoins, which are rapidly being adopted and used by both consumers and large institutions. The majority of these stablecoins are built on the Ethereum infrastructure. Lee, who says, “ETH is the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem,” argues that banks will aim to ensure the security of the network by investing in Ethereum. Lee predicts that stablecoins will be one of the key components of the future banking infrastructure. Stating that especially large banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan will start issuing their own stablecoins using the ETH network, Lee stated that these institutions will contribute to network security by staking Ethereum. Related News: How Much U.S. President Donald Trump Has Earned from Cryptocurrency Ventures Revealed - Here Are the Hard-to-Believe Number In the Ethereum network, which operates with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, institutions that stake ETH on the network become transaction validators, which both ensures network security and provides income to the staking institutions. According to Lee, this will play a critical role, especially in ensuring the security of stablecoins. Lee also said that Ethereum currently hosts 51% of stablecoins and 30% of network fees come from stablecoin transactions. He stated that this situation will further increase the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. “If the stablecoin market reaches $2 trillion from $250 billion, transaction fees and therefore returns on the ETH network will also increase exponentially,” he said. Bitmine Immersion, a company led by Lee, has launched a $250 million private investment round in line with this strategy. All funds raised will be used to purchase ETH. Investors include leading institutions in both traditional finance and crypto, such as Founders Fund, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Pantera. The company’s strategy will be evaluated based on the amount of Ethereum earned per share. It is also expected that the company’s value will increase over time through methods such as generating returns by staking Ethereum, financing transactions with ETH in hand, and increasing the price of Ethereum. *This is not investment advice.

But while the spotlight shines on BTC’s macro momentum, a wave is building underneath, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding it fast. The project is 5th stage of presale that is already sold out more than 50%. The current amount amassed by Mutuum Finance is already over $11.5 million with over 12,700 holders.

Bitcoin Holds Firm as July Rally Approaches Bitcoin is now selling at about $108,526, recovering gradually after its April crash on about $74,000 and just short of its new all-time record of about $111,970. This uptrend is supported by technical data: BTC itself re-took its 50-day moving average, which is around $106,000, and has not fallen beneath good support, which shows BTC to have a solid base. As macro trends and regulatory clarity work in favor of BTC, the case is made to reach new highs BTC finds itself in arguably its best position all year, substance, clarity on regulations, and an at-long-last climate.

2025-07-03T07:24:25,"Bitcoin and JPMorgan Will Soar on the Back of Big Bank Stablecoins: Hayes","The premise is driven by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s agenda to engineer a liquidity injection that resembles past Federal Reserve interventions, said Hayes in a lengthy blog post on July 3. However, this will be done via financial innovation and regulatory tweaks, not overt money printing, he added. Bessent is “done getting fluffed,” and it’s time for him to “soak the world with his liquidity juices,” he exclaimed. Trillions in T-Bill Buying Power Hayes stated that this stealth liquidity injection strategy has two massive beneficiaries: Bitcoin and JPMorgan. JPMorgan’s stablecoin ( JPMD ) allows it to digitize deposits, eliminate compliance costs, and earn a risk-free spread by buying US Treasury bills. “Quid Pro Stablecoin” is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC’s shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Additionally, regulatory changes such as the GENIUS Act could effectively hand “too big to fail” banks a monopoly on stablecoins, which could lock out fintech firms such as Circle. “The adoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power.” Moreover, if JPMorgan converts even a fraction of its deposits into stablecoins, it unlocks hundreds of billions in low-risk, high-margin earnings, potentially doubling or tripling its market cap. Bitcoin would also benefit because stablecoin issuance creates massive Treasury bill demand without quantitative easing, which suppresses yields and reflates risk assets. The primary cryptocurrency thrives when liquidity expands and rates drop. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’.” Ethereum to Benefit The JPMD stablecoin will ride on Base, a layer-2 operated by Coinbase built on top of Ethereum, confirming that the asset will use Ethereum infrastructure. This positions the protocol as the settlement layer for the new banking liquidity engine. “This is debt monetization dressed in Ethereum drag,” said Hayes. If big banks settle stablecoins on Ethereum, the current industry standard for real-world asset tokenization, demand for the network’s blockspace, layer-2s, and validators increases. The Ethereum infrastructure is quietly powering the entire play, so it is also likely to benefit, though Hayes didn’t directly address it. It could also become the next corporate treasury gold rush due to its staking yields, which are not available with Bitcoin, according to analysts.

2025-07-03T07:14:48,"Crypto Tycoon Tim Heath Foils Kidnapping Attempt by Biting Off Attacker’s Finger","Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath narrowly escaped a violent kidnapping attempt in Tallinn, Estonia, last July by biting off part of an attacker’s finger, an Estonian court heard this week. Key Takeaways: Tim Heath escaped a kidnapping attempt in Estonia by biting an attacker’s finger. The suspects stalked Heath for weeks, using disguises and a GPS tracker. Seven men are accused of plotting to abduct Heath and steal his crypto assets. The chilling incident highlights the growing wave of targeted abductions against wealthy crypto figures in 2025, which has forced many executives to bolster their security measures. Heath, a prominent investor and founder of the Estonian-based Yolo Group, was ambushed by two men disguised as painters in the stairwell of his apartment building. Ex-Boxer Tries to Muzzle Crypto Tycoon in Failed Kidnapping According to testimony cited by Estonian outlet Eesti Ekspress and the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the attackers, Azerbaijani national Allahverdi Allahverdiyev, a former boxer and wrestler, tried to silence Heath by covering his mouth. In a desperate act of self-defense, Heath bit through Allahverdiyev’s index finger, managing to break free and retreat into his apartment. The struggle, which lasted about 30 seconds, cost Heath a tooth but forced the kidnappers to flee. The attackers abandoned a rented van nearby, and police later discovered part of Allahverdiyev’s severed finger about 100 meters from the scene. Court documents revealed the attackers had been stalking Heath in the weeks before the assault, both physically and with a GPS tracker placed on his vehicle. The group allegedly planned to force Heath into the van, transport him to a rented sauna house, and coerce him into transferring his crypto holdings. This is David Balland. He co-founded Ledger, one of the biggest companies in crypto This week, he was kidnapped and tortured Here’s the full story of what happened: (and why it’s a wake-up call for everyone in crypto) pic.twitter.com/0NpLlN8aZm — Pix (@PixOnChain) January 24, 2025 Prosecutors say a hacker was also involved to expedite the digital theft. The group of seven suspects reportedly entered Estonia using fake Georgian passports. In the days before the attack, they bought painters’ uniforms and equipment to pose as workmen. Two men have been arrested so far: Allahverdiyev and Georgian citizen Ilgar Mamedov, who prosecutors claim was the getaway driver. Mamedov has denied involvement, insisting he ended up in Estonia by accident. Three other suspects remain unidentified, and two, including the alleged ringleader Najaf Najafli, are wanted by authorities. Kidnappers Demanded 30 Bitcoin After Failed Abduction After the failed abduction, Heath allegedly received a Telegram message containing photos of his apartment along with a demand for 30 Bitcoin, worth about $3.3 million at the time. When Heath didn’t respond, there were no further attempts to contact him, but prosecutors argue the threat could still be active. Heath has since spent over $3.1 million on private security and relocated to a new home. His legal team is pursuing reimbursement of these costs from the accused kidnappers as the court case continues in Estonia. The recent attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. In another incident, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

2025-07-03T07:04:40,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Says US Government Will Be Forced To Deal With Incoming ‘Debt Bomb’ – Here’s How","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio says that America is going to be forced to deal with its soaring debt problem. The billionaire tells his 1.7 million followers on the social media platform X that the US will likely lower interest rates and print money to address the nation’s ballooning debt obligations. However, he warns that such measures are not very effective. “When countries have too much debt, lowering interest rates and devaluing the currency that the debt is denominated in is the preferred path government policy makers are most likely to take, so it pays to bet on it happening. At the moment of my writing, we know that the projections are for big deficits and big increases in government debt and debt service expenses ahead… I also shared last week why I believe the political system in the US won’t be able to get its debt problems under control. We know how debt service costs (paying back interest and principal) will grow rapidly to squeeze out spending, and we also know that, at best, it is highly doubtful that there will be an increase in demand for the debt commensurate with the supply that needs to be sold. I laid out in detail what I think the implications of all this are in ‘How Countries Go Broke,’ where I offer a description of the mechanics behind my thinking. Others have stress tested it, and thus far there has been almost total agreement that the picture I am painting is accurate.” Dalio believes the US will eventually have to both cut spending and raise taxes to save itself from the looming fiscal crisis. “There is no way that the deficit/debt bomb problem can be sustainably dealt with unless there is a mix of tax revenue increases and spending decreases that are determined in a bipartisan way. Our representatives in Washington, D.C., both Republicans and Democrats, know this is true. They understand the need to reduce the deficit by having those from both sides chip in a bit (e.g., a 4% increase in tax revenue and a 4% spending cut) which would lead to a supply/demand balance improvement for US debt which in turn would lower interest rates.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-03T07:04:21,"Donald Trump Crypto Holdings Now Make Up 8% of His Net Worth","The post Donald Trump Crypto Holdings Now Make Up 8% of His Net Worth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio is making headlines. A recent Bloomberg report reveals that Donald Trump holds at least 8% of his net worth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This revelation comes amid growing speculation that Trump’s pro-crypto stance may not be just political, but personal. Donald Trump Net Worth: Real Estate, Truth Social, and Crypto As of now, Trump’s total net worth is estimated at $6.4 billion, largely made up of: Real estate assets, including 19+ properties valued over $50 million each His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (Truth Social) And now, a rapidly growing share of crypto holdings While Trump’s real estate empire remains the backbone of his business, the report suggests that cryptocurrencies are becoming a larger slice of Trump’s financial pie. World Liberty Financial: The Core of Trump’s Crypto Holdings The centerpiece of Donald Trump’s crypto wealth is a project called World Liberty Financial (WLFI). WLFI has raised over $550 million from token sales $390 million of that amount reportedly went directly to the Trump family Trump and his family also own 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, valued at approximately $2 billion (though currently non-transferable, hence not included in his official net worth) USD1 Stablecoin and TRUMP Memecoin Fuel Trump’s Crypto Empire Trump’s crypto holdings don’t stop with WLFI. The report highlights two other major assets in his portfolio: 1. USD1 Stablecoin Market Cap: $2.2 billion+ 24H Trading Volume: $1.5 billion+ Annual Earnings from Reserves: $100 million [post_titles_links postid=”477986″] 2. TRUMP Memecoin Market Cap: $1.79 billion 24H Trading Volume: $269 million Total Supply: 1 billion TRUMP tokens Circulating Supply: ~200 million CIC Digital, the firm controlling 80% of TRUMP tokens, is reportedly linked to the Trump Organization Trump Steps Into the Crypto Mining Business Donald Trump has a 20% stake in American Bitcoin, a U.S.-based crypto mining firm. The company recently merged with Gryphon Digital Mining and is now valued at over $3 billion. This move places Trump directly in the mining sector, further diversifying his crypto interests. Final Thoughts While Trump’s public support for cryptocurrencies has often made headlines, this new report suggests something more: Donald Trump’s crypto holdings are now a central piece of his fortune. With over $500 million directly tied to crypto and even more in token valuations, Trump may be one of the most crypto-exposed political figures in the world. As the next election cycle heats up, Trump’s net worth and growing crypto empire are likely to remain in the spotlight. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs How did Donald Trump accumulate such a large crypto portfolio, and when did he start investing in crypto? Donald Trump’s significant crypto wealth rapidly grew, especially after October 2024. It stems from the launch of his own meme coins ($TRUMP, $MELANIA) and a substantial stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with his family. He has also directly engaged with the crypto mining sector. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and how does it generate value for the Trump family? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a crypto venture co-established by Donald Trump, with his sons Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron listed as Web3 ambassadors. It generates value through token sales (raising over $550 million), with a Trump family entity receiving 75% of net revenues from these sales and holding 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. How does Trump’s crypto wealth compare to other political figures or billionaires? Donald Trump is likely one of the most crypto-exposed political figures globally, with over 8% of his estimated $6.4 billion net worth tied to crypto. While exact comparisons with other politicians are hard, his direct involvement in crypto projects and substantial holdings make him an outlier among major political figures.

We are not affiliated with Robinhood, were not involved in this process, and do not endorse this product,” OpenAI said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). The company also stated that the transfer of its own shares is only possible with its own approval, and warned, “Any share transfer requires our approval, we have not approved any transfer. Please be careful.” Robinhood, meanwhile, introduced its new crypto and blockchain-focused products in Cannes, France. The company attracted attention with its tokenized shares, staking services, and a new blockchain infrastructure move. Following the introduction, Robinhood shares rose above $100, hitting an all-time high. Related News: One of Belgium's Largest Banks Takes Important Step with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) “These tokens create new opportunities for individual investors by providing indirect access to private markets. The tokens are offered through shares we own through a special purpose company,” a Robinhood spokesperson said in response to OpenAI’s statement. Robinhood, in line with looser investor regulations in the European Union, has distributed €5 worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens to eligible users who sign up to buy equity tokens by July 7. The tokens are being offered through the company’s crypto platform. Robinhood’s Crypto General Manager Johann Kerbrat said, “Our goal is to expand access. With tokenization, we want everyone to be able to participate in this economy.” However, this development has once again highlighted the clash between crypto platforms’ efforts to democratize access to financial products and the desire for control of the companies on which these products are based.

2025-07-03T07:00:44,"Bitcoin Short-Term Upper Bound Is $117,000, Glassnode Says","The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed Bitcoin has recently been trading within a short-term band that has its upper level currently located at $117,000. Bitcoin Is Trading Between These Two Short-Term Holder Price Bands In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the short-term price band that Bitcoin has been trading inside lately. The band in question is based on two levels relevant to the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Related Reading: This Altcoin Looks Like PEPE Before It Exploded, Analyst Says The indicator related to the STHs that’s of interest here is the Realized Price, which keeps track of the average cost basis or acquisition level of the BTC addresses belonging to the group. When the value of this metric is greater than the asset’s spot price, it means the STHs as a whole can be considered to be in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the coin’s value suggests the dominance of loss among this cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode, which shows the trend in the STH Realized Price and a few lines corresponding to different standard deviations (SDs) from it: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin price has interestingly traded in a range defined by two of these lines over the last six months. The lower bound of the range has been the -1 SD and the upper one the +1 SD. The STHs are made up of the new entrants into the sector and fickle-minded traders, so the group tends to easily react to happenings in the market. As such, the cryptocurrency’s price can have some interactions with the STH Realized Price, due to the cohort’s panic buying/selling. From the chart, it’s apparent that the same has been true in this period of consolidation as well. While the indicator has certainly not acted as an absolute support or resistance, the asset has still seen such effects around it in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum In Demand: ETF Inflow Streak Extends To 7 Weeks Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the metric after finding a rebound at it last month. The level ahead of the asset now is the +1 SD. In this period of sideways movement, it has so far only been able to test this line once. “This level can be seen as the upper band of the short-term price action,” notes the analytics firm. The +1 SD is located at around $117,000 right now. It only remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will test this level in the near future or not. BTC Price Bitcoin has enjoyed a surge of more than 3% over the past day that has taken its price to $109,500.
