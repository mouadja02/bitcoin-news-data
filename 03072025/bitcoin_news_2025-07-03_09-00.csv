2025-07-03T06:54:43,"Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” Could Push Bitcoin Even Higher, If Passed","The post Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” Could Push Bitcoin Even Higher, If Passed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The House is getting ready to vote on President Trump’s new “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) . While many are unsure what it means, popular crypto trader CryptoBusy thinks this bill could help Bitcoin and the whole crypto market in ways most people don’t expect. Here’s how this bill will be bullish for bitcoin & the entire crypto market. More Money, More Bitcoin In a recent tweet post , CryptoBusy points out that the bill’s massive $4.5 trillion tax cuts would leave people and companies with more money in their pockets. When there’s extra cash floating around, some of it usually ends up in hard assets like Bitcoin, especially when people worry about inflation or a weaker dollar. CryptoBusy further highlights that the bill doesn’t just cut taxes, it also makes it easier for companies to spend and invest by giving them 100% bonus depreciation and bigger write-offs for research. Some companies might decide to put part of that cash into Bitcoin, just like MicroStrategy did when it made headlines by holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Big Debt Makes Bitcoin Look Safer Meanwhile, one thing CryptoBusy warns about is that this bill would add about $3.3 trillion to America’s debt over the next decade. More debt often means more people looking for safer, non-government money, and that’s where Bitcoin steps in. For many, Bitcoin will act as a safer haven against a weaker dollar. Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Approach On top of all this, Trump has shown a friendlier tone toward crypto than many expected. Less regulation and clearer rules could make big companies feel safer adding Bitcoin to their books. Has the Bill Passed Yet? Right now, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is still just a proposal; it hasn’t passed yet. His team is trying hard to get it through Congress, but it’s hitting roadblocks. After one round of voting on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson met with a few Republicans to save the bill. So far, four Republicans have voted against it, including Andrew Clyde, Victoria Sparta, and Keith Self, which is a big problem. To pass the bill, Republicans need a simple majority. If the bill passes, it could give Bitcoin an even bigger boost. Right now, Bitcoin has already jumped 3% and is trading close to its all-time high.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-could-push-bitcoin-even-higher-if-passed/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T06:49:11,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Pullback to $90K Before Fed-Backed Stablecoins Trigger Next Rally","Bitcoin could dip to $90,000 before climbing to new highs, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who sees a brief correction ahead of a fresh rally powered by US bank-issued stablecoins. In a Thursday blog post , Hayes outlined a scenario where central bank policy and Wall Street incentives converge to push trillions of dollars into digital assets. Arthur Hayes argues that the market has not yet priced in the transformative impact of fully regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by too-big-to-fail banks like JPMorgan. These coins, he suggests, will not just rival existing players such as Tether or Circle’s USDC, but will become critical tools for absorbing bank reserves and retail deposits now stranded in low-yield accounts. ""Quid Pro Stablecoin"" is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC's shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Stablecoins Could Fuel Next Rally, But Hayes Warns of Short-Term Dip Hayes argues that the launch of such stablecoins would effectively function as a new form of liquidity injection, similar in impact to quantitative easing, without requiring formal Fed action. By enabling banks to funnel retail money into short-term Treasury bills without triggering capital rule penalties, these tokens would unlock a new wave of liquidity for risk assets like Bitcoin and tech stocks. But before that happens, Hayes sees a period of volatility. Citing historical cycles and market sentiment, he predicts that Bitcoin may fall to $90,000 as speculators take profits and traders wait for clearer signals from the Federal Reserve. Still, he remains bullish over the longer term, noting that once Wall Street moves in with tokenized dollars, capital flows will accelerate. With GENIUS Act Passed, Hayes Sees Stablecoins Giving Banks a Market Edge The forecast comes as stablecoins return to the spotlight, with US lawmakers advancing bipartisan proposals that could give federal approval to banks issuing tokenized dollars. Last month, the US Senate passed the long-anticipated GENIUS Act with broad bipartisan backing, marking the most comprehensive crypto legislation to date. Approved by a 68–30 vote, it represents the Senate’s first move toward a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing segments in the digital asset space. Hayes believes that this regulatory direction hands legacy banks a strategic edge. Not only do they already have massive retail networks and regulatory compliance structures, they also have direct access to the Federal Reserve. This makes it easier for them to profit from turning deposits into short-term Treasuries through stablecoin issuance. He estimates that if banks shift even part of their $17t in deposits into stablecoin products, it could create $6.8t in new demand for US government debt. Combined with changes in how the Fed pays interest on reserves, that shift could flood markets with fresh liquidity, fuelling asset inflation across crypto and equities alike. Until then, Hayes sees the coming dip as a buying opportunity. He believes that once USD-backed stablecoins from major banks enter the market, they will unlock a wave of liquidity that could send Bitcoin and other risk assets sharply higher. In his view, the arrival of these tokens will mark the start of a new phase in the market cycle.

They’re drawn to things like higher returns, tokenized stocks, and access to Web3 tools that offer more control and flexibility. Paul Barron recently shared that big banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America are now feeling the heat.

He believes people will be able to get car loans, home loans, and even borrow money from each other using these platforms. He sees them becoming full financial centers soon. Ripple and Uphold Deal Could Financial Game Deaton also pointed out the speculation that Ripple might buy Uphold. If that happens, he believes Uphold will also become a major player in this new financial system. Ripple, already a leader in digital payments, could get a major boost with this deal, allowing it to serve more users and offer more financial tools. Why Traditional Banks Are Falling Behind According to Deaton, banks that don’t innovate or adopt modern technology will not survive. With the rise of DeFi ( Decentralized Finance ), people now expect faster services and better access to their money. They also want the chance to earn higher returns and gain more control over their finances. Deaton says this is why many younger people are already turning away from big banks in favor of crypto platforms. [post_titles_links postid=”477959″] Coinbase and Robinhood Are the Future Deaton says Coinbase and Robinhood are no longer just apps for trading. He sees them becoming strong financial companies. More people are using these platforms every day, and he believes they will only get bigger as crypto grows. Recently, Cathie Wood said Bitcoin holders may soon use Coinbase to get mortgages by using their crypto as collateral. John Deaton agrees with Cathie Wood, calling Coinbase a top stock to own, just like big names such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Referring to these changes, he said Coinbase isn’t just a crypto app anymore, as it’s becoming a major player in traditional finance. The COIN stock surged, nearly 100% in two months, which shows that more people are buying into this story. He also says the change is already happening. The world of money is shifting. People who act early could see the biggest rewards.

Gen Z and Millennials are drawn to crypto platforms by the promise of higher returns, access to tokenized stocks, and Web3 tools offering more control and flexibility. They seek faster services and better access to their money, reflecting a desire for a more open and technologically advanced financial system that traditional banks often lack. How can platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood offer car loans or home mortgages using crypto? Platforms like Coinbase are already offering crypto-backed loans, allowing users to borrow USDC using Bitcoin as collateral without selling it. While not yet directly offering car or home mortgages, the move towards tokenized assets and the ability to use crypto as collateral for traditional loans is paving the way for such services in the future. Why are traditional banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America falling behind in attracting younger generations? Traditional banks are falling behind because they often lack the innovation and modern technology that younger generations expect. They struggle to offer faster services, higher returns, and the level of control and transparency that DeFi and crypto platforms provide.

Bitcoin rallied by nearly 3% to retest the $110k mark before retracing to now trade around $108,900. Solana’s SOL was one of the best performers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, surpassing the $150 psychological mark in the process. Backed by strong fundamentals, SOL could be on the verge of a breakout as analysts expect a volatile July. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF hits $33m in trading volume on debut day The major driver behind SOL’s recent rally is the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF. The ETF began trading on Wednesday and recorded one of the best debut days for exchange-traded funds.

The chart is efficient, indicating that the bears have grabbed liquidity to the downside. Despite the bearish trend on the higher timeframe, SOL is showing signs of extending its recovery after adding nearly 4% to its value in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 60 shows that SOL is no longer facing selling pressure, with buyers increasingly taking control of the market. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are also within the positive territory, suggesting a bullish bias. SOL could be targeting the Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $162 over the next few hours or so. If the rally continues, SOL could retest the next major resistance level at $174, its highest price since May 29. SOL is currently hovering around the $150 zone, with the support line suggesting that the current levels could be a base. If SOL could embark on a strong rally, key resistance levels to watch out for in the medium term include $220 and $300. However, if the bearish trend returns, SOL could retest the weekend low of $137 once again. An extended bearish run would see SOL dip further to the $125 support level, with the next key support around $99.

Key Takeaways: The first US Solana staking ETF launched with $12 million in inflows and $33 million in volume. Opening day trading volumes topped earlier Solana and XRP futures ETFs. REX-Osprey’s creative fund structure overcame SEC hurdles, avoiding the standard spot ETF approval process. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, trading under the ticker SSK, launched Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The fund offers investors exposure to Solana (SOL) while providing staking yields, positioning it as the first ETF in the U.S. to combine spot Solana exposure with staking rewards. Solana Staking ETF Outpaces Futures Funds According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the ETF’s opening day volumes surpassed those seen by earlier Solana and XRP futures ETFs. However, they fell short of the explosive debuts of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, which together recorded $4.6 billion in shares traded on their first day in January 2024. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart noted the ETF saw $8 million in trading volume within its first 20 minutes, describing it as a “healthy start to trading.” $SSK ended day with $33m in volume.

The ETF’s launch was not without hurdles. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially raised objections in late May, questioning whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under federal securities laws. REX-Osprey navigated these challenges by structuring the fund to invest at least 40% of its assets in other exchange-traded products, many of which are listed outside the United States. The regulatory workaround allowed the fund to avoid the traditional 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot crypto ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, previously described the strategy as a “regulatory end-around,” a view shared by analysts who have debated whether the fund should be classified as a conventional spot Solana ETF. yes, altho to be fair this is some 400-level ETF technical nerd-ery — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 1, 2025 Strong Start Sparks Hopes for Spot Solana ETF Approval The promising debut has fueled speculation about the potential approval of true spot Solana ETFs. Both Seyffart and Balchunas recently estimated a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot Solana ETFs before the year ends. Seyffart added that a wave of new ETFs, including products tied to XRP and Litecoin, could arrive in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Solana’s price saw muted movement, gaining 3.6% over the past 24 hours and trading around $153 at press time. Despite the ETF launch, SOL remains down nearly 48% from its highs earlier this year. However, Solana CME futures showed rising institutional appetite, with open interest reaching $167 million after the ETF’s debut, according to data from SolanaFloor. As reported, digital asset investment funds pulled in $2.7 billion last week, capping an 11-week streak of inflows that now totals $16.9 billion. The bulk of the inflows came from the United States, accounting for $2.65 billion. Switzerland and Germany recorded modest additions of $23 million and $19.8 million, respectively, while Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil posted small outflows. Bitcoin remained the primary magnet for capital, drawing $2.2 billion last week, a commanding 83% of total inflows, while short-Bitcoin products extended their year-to-date outflows to $12 million.

As of the time of writing, the asset is priced at $108,071 after recording a modest 2% gain in the past 24 hours. Despite nearing its all-time high in recent weeks, Bitcoin appears to be caught in a holding pattern as institutional rebalancing and on-chain dynamics take center stage. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi has drawn attention to unusual on-chain activity during the final days of June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Institutional Rebalancing and Local Exhaustion Signals In a post titled “Whale Profit-Taking and Loss Realizations: Was Late June a Local Pivot Point?” the analyst noted conflicting behaviors among Bitcoin whales. A notable $641 million in realized profits was recorded alongside more than $1.24 billion in realized losses, a combination that suggests a potential inflection point in market sentiment. Mevsimi emphasized that this mixed realization trend came at the close of the second quarter, a period often associated with institutional portfolio adjustments. “Structurally, late June is also the end of H1, when ETFs and institutional funds often rebalance portfolios,” he wrote. Mevsimi added: “That timing adds weight: this wasn’t just noise — it may have been a deliberate repositioning.” Notably, these large movements in realized profit and loss did not extend into early July, which may imply either a temporary stabilization or the beginning of a new market phase. The report also detailed divergent whale behavior. Newer whales, likely short-term participants entering in Q2, showed signs of capitulation, realizing both profits and significant losses. In contrast, older whales locked in $91 million in profits with negligible losses. This division may indicate a shift in control, with experienced holders offloading risk while short-term players exited amid market uncertainty. According to Mevsimi, the convergence of these trends hints at a local exhaustion phase rather than a continued rally. Bitcoin LTH Unrealized Profits and Historical Context In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant’s Darkfost explored the unrealized profit profile of Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs), revealing a downward trend despite BTC’s proximity to record highs. Citing the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, Darkfost noted that average unrealized profits have fallen to around 220%. This is well below the peaks recorded during market tops in March and December 2024, which reached 300% and 350%, respectively. “Although these profits may seem substantial, we’re still far from the levels observed during the tops of this cycle,” Darkfost stated. The realized price for LTHs now stands at approximately $39,000, suggesting a strong cushion but also reinforcing that speculative excess has yet to return in full force. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon The analyst added that a return to top-cycle unrealized profit levels would require BTC to rise to around $140,000, a target echoed by several bullish forecasts.

2025-07-03T06:00:33,"Ripple Follows Circle’s Lead and Applies for US Banking License","Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. These applications aim to bring Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin under dual state and federal oversight to align with new legislation like the GENIUS Act. This follows a similar move by Circle, the issuer of USDC, which also applied for OCC approval. Meanwhile, billionaire Peter Thiel is backing a new startup- and crypto-focused bank called Erebor, which will fill the gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. In Europe, Belgium’s KBC Bank is set to offer crypto investments via its Bolero platform. Ripple Makes Power Play in US Banking Ripple Labs is seeking a US banking license to deepen its ties with traditional finance and comply with emerging stablecoin regulations. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that Ripple formally applied for a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, it would bring Ripple under both federal and state regulatory oversight. The New York Department of Financial Services already supervises Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, and Garlinghouse said that this added federal oversight will set a new standard of trust in the stablecoin industry. This development happened after a similar application by Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Just days earlier, Circle applied to the OCC to form a national trust bank responsible for managing its stablecoin reserves. Both moves come on the heels of the US Senate passing the GENIUS Act, which is legislation that outlines regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers and designates the OCC as the key federal watchdog for larger players in the space. Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the company is aligning itself with the changing regulatory landscape around dollar-pegged payment stablecoins. In addition to its OCC application, Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. This would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed. Garlinghouse described this feature as a critical safeguard to reinforce long-term trust in the stablecoin. The application was made via Standard Custody, a crypto custody firm that Ripple acquired in early 2024. Garlinghouse explained that the tide is turning in Washington, with Congress advancing clearer crypto regulations and traditional banks showing renewed interest in engaging with digital asset firms. This is in stark contrast to the restrictive environment of previous years, which was often referred to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” XRP’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Market reaction to Ripple’s banking ambitions has been positive. XRP climbed 2.87% to $2.24. The rally began shortly after Garlinghouse’s announcement and peaked at $2.27 before slightly retreating. Peter Thiel Backs New Bank for Startups and Crypto Meanwhile, a group of billionaires, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, is reportedly working on launching a new financial institution named Erebor to fill the void left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March of 2023. According to the Financial Times , Erebor will focus on serving startups and cryptocurrency companies, and has already applied for a US bank charter to operate as a fully licensed bank . Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, is said to be among the early investors in the new bank. Other backers reportedly include Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense contractor Anduril, and Joe Lonsdale, founder of investment firm 8VC. Thiel is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem, and he is also known for backing Bullish, a crypto exchange that recently filed for an initial public offering in the United States. Erebor’s strategy seems to be centered on providing banking services and loans to early-stage startups and other high-risk ventures that have found it difficult to access capital in the wake of tighter financial regulations. The initiative is also seen as an attempt to reestablish a specialized financial services institution that mirrors the role Silicon Valley Bank once played in the innovation economy. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 sent shockwaves through the banking and crypto industries. It was shut down by California’s financial regulator after rapidly rising interest rates devalued its bond holdings. The bank failed when a flood of clients tried to withdraw funds, triggering a liquidity crisis. At the time, the bank served around half of all venture capital-backed tech and life sciences firms in the country. Bank failures in the year 2023 (Source: FDIC ) The demise of Silicon Valley Bank also contributed to a wider crisis that saw the downfall of other institutions like Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The crypto sector was particularly hard-hit, with investment funds losing roughly 10% of their assets under management in a single week. According to Harvard Business Review, the bank's failure tightened credit access for venture-backed startups, which created an urgent need for a replacement institution. Although Silicon Valley Bank still operates as a division of First Citizens Bank after its acquisition in March of 2023, its collapse shed some light on the vulnerabilities in the venture capital and digital asset banking landscape. Erebor now plans to fill that gap. KBC Bank to Offer Crypto Investments KBC Bank, one of Belgium’s largest financial institutions, is preparing to allow its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies through its online investment platform Bolero. The bank confirmed that Bolero will provide access to Bitcoin and Ethereum investments later this year. A spokesperson for KBC stated that the bank is currently undergoing an analysis to become recognized as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP), with the aim of launching the service by autumn. The initiative is expected to give private investors the opportunity to invest directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum in a secure and regulated environment, with an emphasis on education and compliance. If the rollout proceeds as planned, KBC will become the first major Belgian bank to offer crypto investment services to retail clients. Currently, most Belgian investors rely on international exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, or on fintech platforms like Revolut and N26 to access crypto markets. KBC’s move forms part of the trend among European banks that are increasingly exploring crypto investment and custody solutions. In Germany, both Deutsche Bank and Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe are reportedly preparing to introduce crypto offerings in the near future. Meanwhile, Spain’s BBVA has been advising its high-net-worth clients to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This wave of crypto adoption by banks was anticipated by industry leaders. In April, executives from major crypto firms Messari and Sygnum predicted that banks would start entering the space more aggressively in the second half of 2025, encouraged by a more favorable global regulatory landscape. Supporting this trend, Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the payments giant has been in discussions with several banks interested in experimenting with stablecoins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9786/ripple-follows-circle-s-lead-and-applies-for-us-banking-license,"FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T05:48:10,"Bitcoin Price Surges to $109K as Pension Interest and Real-World Adoption Climb","Bitcoin (BTC) rally toward $109,147 comes on the heels of renewed institutional attention, particularly from UK pension funds. Cartwright Pension Trusts revealed that a client who allocated just 3% of their fund to Bitcoin in November 2024 posted a 60% return in under a year. This performance has sparked conversations with other funds and prompted Cartwright to launch an “Annual Bitcoin Review” for institutional clients. UK Pension Firm Sees Growing Interest in Bitcoin Exposure ► https://t.co/FX5NGbc68q https://t.co/FX5NGbc68q — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) July 2, 2025 The firm emphasized education and measured exposure, despite market volatility. According to Cartwright, pensions, charities, and businesses are increasingly exploring Bitcoin both as a reserve asset and for transactional use. This narrative supports long-term bullish sentiment and legitimizes Bitcoin within traditional finance circles. Legal Clarity Emerges with Celsius vs. Tether Case A U.S. bankruptcy judge has allowed Celsius to move forward with a $4 billion lawsuit against Tether. The case centres on the alleged liquidation of 39,500 BTC, now valued at $4 billion, outside a contractually agreed 10-hour window. While some charges were dismissed, the core claim remains.

Per local reports, the government is still engaged with international institutions to refine the plan. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan, during a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power. According to a report by Profit , the IMF has warned that the plan could add strain to the power sector. Dr Irfan told the committee that the agency is concerned about market distortions over Pakistan’s subsidised energy rates proposal. IMF Flags Several Concerns Against Pakistan’s Power Proposal for Bitcoin Mining Last month, the IMF questioned Pakistan’s power push for Bitcoin mining, raising concerns over legal issues and power strain. The international financial body laid out several concerns, including the legality of crypto mining in Pakistan and the additional strain on the already burdened power grid. The @IMFNews is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. #IMF #Bitcoin https://t.co/X9YHqz9qTO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 1, 2025 Further, the fund warned about resource distribution and knock-on effects on power tariffs. The IMF noted that Pakistan did not consult the fund ahead of the announcement. In May, Pakistan announced that it will allocate 2,000MW to power crypto mining and data centres, in a move to attract foreign investment. The initiative is driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance. Pakistan in Talks With International Institutions Dr Irfan confirmed that the government is still in talks to redefine its power subsidiary plan after the IMF has rejected the proposal. The committee further discussed technological solutions aimed at combating electricity theft. They also discussed the government’s recent agreement with scheduled banks to reduce the circular debt stock. Senator Shibli Faraz criticised that banks were “forced at gunpoint” to offer the loans. The committee has directed the Power Division to submit comprehensive answers to various issues at the next meeting.

According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund ended its first trading day with around $33 million in volume. Another Bloomberg analyst, James Seyffart, reported that the ETF had about $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes of its launch. While the trading volume of the ETF was impressive, it still fell short of the levels seen during the debut of Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Balchunas commented : SSK ended the day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch), but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Eric Balchunas The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF reached about $1 million in AUM on Wednesday The Solana staking ETF also wrapped up its debut day with about $1 million worth of assets under management. Balchunas believes the ETF could soon manage $10 million in assets on its second trading day, given its current trading volume. The ETF differs quite from others, which are still awaiting the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval. The commission registered the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940—an investor-focused framework with stricter regulations. That means the fund must hold its assets with a qualified and trusted custodian. The ETF’s founders selected Anchorage Digital for the role, seeing that it’s the sole federally regulated crypto bank authorized to handle both custody and staking of digital assets. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley commented on the ETF’s launch, describing staking as the next evolution in the crypto ETF space and calling the fund’s debut a significant step toward offering institutions secure and regulated crypto access. The SEC announced that Grayscale’s ETF conversion plans are still under review On Tuesday, Grayscale also earned the SEC’s approval to change its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF. The fund includes the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap: Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, and Cardano’s ADA. Arbitrage traders once profited by exploiting gaps in market prices and NAV in Grayscale’s crypto trusts, mostly fueled by restricted redemptions and mandatory lock-up periods. However, with the firm moving to convert its private trusts into ETFs, those opportunities have significantly narrowed. Grayscale even explained that moving forward, it wants the values of the shares to reflect the value of the digital assets held by the fund. The SEC, however, is still reviewing the firm’s ETF conversion plans. On Wednesday, in a letter to the New York Stock Exchange, the agency’s deputy secretary announced that the commission would reexamine the approval for Grayscale’s ETF conversion, signaling continued hesitation to loosen its approach to crypto ETFs. In June 2022, the firm also faced trouble when it tried to convert the BTC Trust into an ETF. It filed a petition in court after the agency rejected its application. The legal battle stretched over a year until August 2023, when a US judge ruled that the SEC’s rejection of the conversion was “arbitrary and capricious,” ultimately granting Grayscale’s petition. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust operates as an ETF with a 1.5% expense ratio—the highest among Bitcoin ETFs—and remains the top-earning BTC investment product.

The crypto fund generates an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees from its $75 billion in assets with a 0.25% expense ratio. In contrast, the BlackRock iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) makes $187.1 million from $624 billion in assets and a 0.03% expense ratio, reported Bloomberg on July 2. IBIT is nearly nine times smaller but charges over eight times more in fees. Simply a Machine Nate Geraci, president at NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly ETF Store), told the outlet that “IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure.” “Although spot Bitcoin ETFs are priced very competitively, IBIT is proof that investors are willing to pay up for exposures they view as truly additive to their portfolios.” The nearly $75bil iShares Bitcoin ETF has only one month of outflows since Jan 2024 launch… Now generates more fee revenue for BlackRock than its largest ETF, the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

The fund has also seen inflows in 17 of its first 18 months. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, told the outlet that it was an indication of how much “pent-up demand” there was for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin as part of their overall portfolio. “It also illustrates the leadership of Bitcoin in the crypto space where its perceived utility as a store of value has essentially left the others in its dust,” he added. The BlackRock fund has not seen an outflow day since June 6 and has had $1.47 billion in inflows over the past fortnight. It is “simply a machine,” said Geraci. Busy Week For Crypto ETFs The REX-Osprey Solana staking ETF launched on Wednesday and saw $33 million in trading volume on its first day.

2025-07-03T05:10:56,"SEC Freezes Grayscale Digital Fund ETF Conversion One Day After Approval — What Changed?","The US SEC has abruptly frozen the approval of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund’s conversion into an exchange-traded fund, halting its launch just a day after the green light was given. On July 1, the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approved the NYSE Arca’s proposal to list and trade shares of the Grayscale fund under an amended rule. The approval came with accelerated status, signaling initial confidence in the product’s readiness for market. But within 24 hours, the Commission exercised its right to review the decision, automatically staying the approval under Rule 431 of the SEC’s Rules of Practice. The reversal adds an unexpected twist to what had been hailed as a landmark moment for multi-asset crypto ETFs in the US. Fund’s Heavy Bitcoin-Ethereum Mix Offset by Riskier Altcoin Holdings Launched in 2018, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund holds a basket of top cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum accounting for more than 91% of its portfolio. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana and Cardano make up the rest, each carrying differing degrees of regulatory uncertainty. The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling $GDLC it can't launch until otherwise notified. Not sure why, no other info than this letter. My guess tho: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any '33 act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins. So likely… https://t.co/Za7rYk1o0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 By intervening directly, the SEC’s commissioners have signaled that the conversion merits closer inspection beyond what staff-level approval typically requires. Historically, this kind of review is rare and often suggests internal debate over regulatory implications, investor protection or market readiness. Unlike single-asset ETFs such as those tied to Bitcoin, multi-asset products like Grayscale’s bring new complexity. The inclusion of tokens with unsettled legal status, like XRP and Solana, may have prompted concerns over clarity in investor disclosures or the legal treatment of underlying assets. No Timetable Given as SEC Weighs Path Forward for Multi-Asset Crypto Funds Some analysts believe the Commission’s caution could reflect a broader effort to establish a unified approach before opening the gates to more diversified crypto products. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas has suggested the SEC is holding off on GDLC’s ETF conversion until a more consistent regulatory framework for crypto ETPs is in place. Grayscale’s ETF bid comes at a time of renewed momentum for digital asset firms under a more crypto-friendly political backdrop. However, the Commission’s move illustrates that regardless of shifting sentiment, regulatory rigor still holds sway over timing. For Grayscale and NYSE Arca, the stay means an indefinite delay. The SEC has not offered a timeline for its review or any additional guidance on next steps.

2025-07-03T05:03:22,"Will Trump Fire Jerome Powell? Fed Chair Faces Rising Pressure","The post Will Trump Fire Jerome Powell? Fed Chair Faces Rising Pressure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump is once again targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, demanding his immediate resignation as tensions over interest rate policy boil over. Trump is furious that Powell has not slashed rates, blaming the Fed for rising debt-servicing costs that he claims are burdening the U.S. economy. His frustration intensified after Powell suggested that Trump’s tariffs are contributing to inflation, making it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Trump quickly fired back, accusing Powell of standing in the way of economic recovery. Trump Amplifies Resignation Demands The situation escalated when Bill Pulte , head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of lying during Senate testimony and acting with political bias. Trump reposted Pulte’s remarks on social media and doubled down on his demand that Powell step down immediately. This leads to the big question: Will Trump fire Jerome Powell? Can Trump Fire Powell? Legal Obstacles Remain While Trump has previously threatened to remove Powell , experts say the legal route is not that simple. The Supreme Court has reinforced that the Federal Reserve’s independence is protected, and forcibly removing the Fed Chair before the end of his term could face major legal challenges. When Does Jerome Powell’s Term End? Jerome Powell is currently serving a four-year term as Chair of the Federal Reserve, which began in May 2022. His term is set to end in May 2026. Unless he resigns voluntarily, Powell is legally protected from being removed without cause, making Trump’s threats more political than practical. [post_titles_links postid=”477927″] Powell Blames Tariffs, Trump Blames Powell Powell has repeatedly pointed out that the ongoing tariff policies introduced by Trump are driving inflationary pressure. This gives the Fed reason to remain cautious with rate cuts, regardless of political demands. Some analysts are watching a possible tariff expiration around July 9, which may create room for the Fed to ease its stance — but that’s far from guaranteed. Analysts and Crypto Experts Join the Criticism The pressure isn’t limited to politics. Crypto analyst Matt criticized Powell’s refusal to cut rates, noting that inflation is already near the Fed’s 2% target. He compared it to past election years when rate cuts were more aggressive and suggested Powell’s current stance may be politically influenced. Bitcoin Price Reacts Bitcoin jumped 2.62% to over $108,000 in the wake of the political drama, signaling the market’s sensitivity to Fed policy uncertainty. While Powell’s resignation is still unlikely, the growing war of words between Trump and the Fed is keeping both traditional and crypto markets on edge. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs Why is President Donald Trump demanding Jerome Powell’s resignation? President Trump is demanding Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s resignation because he believes Powell has not cut interest rates aggressively enough. Trump blames the Fed’s high rates for increasing U.S. debt-servicing costs and hindering economic recovery, especially after Powell linked Trump’s tariffs to inflation. How do Jerome Powell and Donald Trump differ on the cause of current inflation? Jerome Powell attributes current inflationary pressures partly to President Trump’s ongoing tariff policies, which he states make it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Donald Trump, however, blames Powell and the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, arguing that rising debt costs are hindering the economy. How is the financial market, including Bitcoin, reacting to the Trump-Powell conflict?

2025-07-03T05:00:59,"Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade within striking distance of its all-time high (ATH), a noticeable shift is underway in the cryptocurrency’s Realized Dominance metric, reflecting changes in behavior between short-term holders (STH) and long-term holders (LTH). Bitcoin Realized Dominance Shows Shift In Market Sentiment According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, the latest trend in BTC’s Realized Dominance metric highlights a significant shift in overall market structure and sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Realized Dominance metric tracks how much of the realized cap is held by STH vs LTH. A rising LTH cohort share signals strong conviction and maturing supply, while a falling STH share suggests reduced speculation or loss-taking. The latest on-chain data shows that STH Realized Cap has dropped to around 45%, signalling reduced activity from recent buyers. This implies that new BTC entering the market is either being sold at a loss or maturing into long-term holdings – easing short-term speculative pressure. Conversely, the LTH Realized Cap has risen, suggesting long-held coins are being moved at a profit – typically seen during late-stage bull markets. This increase also indicates aging supply, as coins held by short-term investors transition into the LTH category, reflecting strong holder conviction. The analyst added: The divergence between falling STH Realized Cap and rising LTH Realized Cap highlights a supply transfer dynamic: recent entrants struggle with profitability amid lackluster price action, while long-term participants maintain control of an increasing share of network value. Such transitions often precede bullish reversals. As short-term realized cap shrinks, selling pressure typically declines, paving the way for more sustainable upside, provided fresh demand returns. In conclusion, Crazzyblockk noted that the Bitcoin market is currently in a consolidation phase, with weaker hands exiting and stronger holders gaining dominance. If this trend continues, it could establish a more resilient price base for BTC and potentially pave the way for a new ATH. BTC Apparent Demand Has Declined Despite the rise in LTH Realized Dominance, some on-chain signals point to weakening demand. This has raised concerns of a potential short-term drawdown, which could be as severe as the April 2025 pullback to almost $75,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K–$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest Notably, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand – a metric that assesses whether new buyer demand is sufficient to offset selling from miners and LTHs – has dropped to -37,000 BTC. This sharp decline suggests fading buying interest. That said, one positive indicator remains.

2025-07-03T05:00:27,"Tron Wallet Tied to Darknet and Ransomware Gets Hit With US Sanctions","The US Department of the Treasury has announced sanctions against a Tron cryptocurrency wallet address associated with the Aeza Group, a Russian internet infrastructure firm allegedly providing a bulletproof hosting (BPH) services to cybercriminal groups. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said the targeted address operated on the Tron blockchain and facilitated transactions linked to ransomware attacks, illicit drug markets, and the compromise of sensitive US information. OFAC explained in a statement: BPH service providers sell access to specialized servers and other computer infrastructure designed to help cybercriminals like ransomware actors, personal information stealers, and drug vendors evade detection and resist law enforcement attempts to disrupt their malicious activities According to the Treasury’s statement, Aeza provided backend infrastructure to groups including Meduza and Lumma, both known for targeting US defense and technology networks. Aeza Group’s Infrastructure and Its Blockchain Footprint The sanctions extend beyond the crypto wallet itself. OFAC added four individuals identified as key Aeza members to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, along with four affiliated entities. The Tron-based wallet associated with Aeza reportedly received over $350,000 in digital assets, which were subsequently converted to fiat using various exchanges. These findings were supported by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis , which noted the wallet’s role in facilitating cybercriminal cashouts. Chainalysis said in a statement: By sanctioning bulletproof hosting providers, the US government is attacking the supply chain that makes large-scale cybercrime possible, rather than just pursuing individual threat actors after attacks have occurred. The move marks a shift in strategy toward targeting the broader technical ecosystem that enables ransomware groups to operate globally. In addition to its involvement with ransomware infrastructure, Aeza was also reported to have hosted BlackSprut, a Russian darknet marketplace tied to the trafficking of illegal drugs including fentanyl. US officials have previously linked synthetic opioid imports from Russia and China to rising overdose rates domestically, adding urgency to Treasury actions against facilitators of such networks. Broader Context for Crypto and National Security The sanctioned Tron address shows the relevance of less expensive and high-throughput blockchains for illicit activity , especially when combined with mixing services or intermediaries that operate with insufficiently strict or no KYC protocols at all. Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith emphasized the urgency of addressing these channels: Cybercriminals continue to rely heavily on BPH service providers like Aeza Group to facilitate disruptive ransomware attacks, steal U.S. technology, and sell black-market drugs. The OFAC action signals that crypto wallets connected to criminal infrastructure, even without directly executing attacks or sales, will face regulatory consequences . Smith added: Treasury, in close coordination with the UK and our other international partners, remains resolved to expose the critical nodes, infrastructure, and individuals that underpin this criminal ecosystem.

2025-07-03T04:55:34,"Ripple Shares Are Safe Despite Linqto Bankruptcy, Says John Deaton","The post Ripple Shares Are Safe Despite Linqto Bankruptcy, Says John Deaton appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Linqto collapse has sent shockwaves through crypto’s private equity investment world, especially among retail investors with holdings in Ripple, Circle, and SpaceX via SPVs on the platform. Amid finger-pointing and fear, attorney John Deaton is now stepping into the chaos, not just with commentary, but a promise to fight for those affected. MY RESPONSE TO ALL THE EXPERTS REGARDING LINQTO As I said during the spaces, anyone who claims they know exactly what will happen in bankruptcy is either ignorant, lying, or intentionally spreading fear, causing innocent people to stress more than necessary. Some people have… https://t.co/IjzyGruqXX — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 3, 2025 With many holding their life savings in private equity deals through the platform, confusion and fear are running high. But Deaton says there’s more hope here than people realize. Investors Still Come First in Court Deaton pointed out something important that needs attention. He explained that in this bankruptcy, Linqto has no major creditors standing in front of its customers. That means the 11,500 people who bought into Ripple and other private companies through Linqto’s SPV units are first in line. Regular shareholders of Linqto, on the other hand, are last in the queue. This legal structure gives investors a real shot at getting their money back, and maybe even more. All the Big Shares Are Still There Despite all the chaos, Deaton confirmed that the investments are still accounted for. Ripple, Circle, Kraken, SpaceX, and other holdings are still on the books. Ripple alone makes up 4.7 million shares, and the value of those has increased since Linqto made the purchases. Circle shares have gone up even more. According to Deaton, Circle holdings have grown by more than six times the original purchase value. Ripple also bought back shares in June 2025 at 175 each. If that price is used to value what investors hold, their portion of Ripple could be worth over 800 million dollars. Ripple Confirms the Shares Are Real In response to the controversy, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that Linqto owns 4.7 million shares of Ripple. These were bought from secondary market sellers, not from Ripple itself. He made it clear that Ripple has no business ties with Linqto and didn’t participate in their resale schemes. He also stressed that XRP, the cryptocurrency, has nothing to do with these shares. This matters because many investors were confused or misled into thinking they were dealing directly with Ripple. [post_titles_links postid=”477688″] No More Guessing Games Some former employees and the Wall Street Journal claimed that Linqto’s founder is the real culprit, potentially implicated in fraudulent practices and severe securities violations. Meanwhile, others allege that the current CEO is leveraging the bankruptcy as a strategic power tool by turning a small issue into a big power play. Deaton said people should stop guessing because the truth will come out. Internal emails and financial records will all be revealed in court. If all sides work together, a plan could be approved in under a year. But if it turns into a long legal fight, it could drag on for years and eat away at the value. For now, Deaton is focused on protecting the investors and helping them recover.

The Linqto collapse refers to the ongoing crisis of the private equity platform. It involves federal investigations (SEC, DOJ), frozen investor accounts, a looming bankruptcy, and allegations of securities violations, including selling shares at inflated prices and targeting non-accredited investors, leaving 13,000 users in limbo. Why did Linqto collapse, leading to federal investigations? Linqto collapsed due to alleged widespread securities violations and potentially fraudulent practices. Key reasons include former CEO William Sarris allegedly inflating Ripple share prices by over 60% and selling client stock without consent. Linqto also violated regulations by allowing up to 5,000 non-accredited investors into high-risk private equity deals.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-shares-are-safe-despite-linqto-bankruptcy-says-john-deaton/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T04:26:36,"A Major Currency Outpaces Bitcoin With More Possible Momentum Ahead: Macro Markets","Welcome to CoinDesk's weekly macro column, where analyst Omkar Godbole writes about his macro observations and analysis in the broader markets. The views expressed in this column aren't investment advice. A major currency pair, which is barely considered volatile, is now rivaling notoriously explosive bitcoin's price performance—unimaginable, right? Not anymore. In June, EUR/USD, the most liquid FX pair in the world, rose nearly 4% to 1.1786, outperforming bitcoin's (BTC) 2.4% gain. Remarkably, both assets are nearly neck and neck in year-to-date performance, each up over 13%. Some observers believe EUR/USD still has room to run higher, a positive sign for EUR-pegged stablecoins, which have already benefited from the single currency's surge. ""EUR/USD could face resistance probably in the 1.22/1.23 area,"" Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said, explaining that the focus is on Germany loosening its debt brake, which is seen as ""growth positive by most people."" German exceptionalism and U.S. fiscal scare The term U.S. exceptionalism —the relative attractiveness of dollar assets, underpinned by the fiscal spending of the Biden era—has historically helped the greenback. However, that story is now showing signs of reversal under President Donald Trump’s second term. Concerns over widening budget deficits and soaring debt-servicing costs have sparked what some now describe as a budding "" fiscal scare ."" Now, the exceptionalism narrative might be shifting to Germany. That's because early this year, Germany announced a landmark fiscal plan comprising an exemption of defence spending (over 1% of GDP) from the debt brake, a 500 billion euro infrastructure fund to be deployed over 12 years, and 100 billion of which will be immediately routed to the Climate Transition Fund. The remaining amount is for additional infrastructure investments, with 300 billion euros for the federal government and 100 billion euros for state governments. Lastly, the plan will allow state governments to run annual deficits of up to 0.35% of GDP. The fiscal package's direct impact on German GDP is expected to be felt from next year, and it's expected to be sticky beyond 2027, with positive spillover effects for other Eurozone nations. This is now changing the conversation to European assets, rather than U.S. ""The initial condition was a huge overweight in USD and assets, but now it looks like portfolio allocation toward European equities, with Germany stepping up defence and infrastructure spending,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Capital Markets, said in an email. Policy uncertainty The focus on growth potential explains why the U.S.-German yield (rate) differential, as an indicator of exchange rate, has fallen to the back burner. The chart below shows that the historical positive correlation between EUR/USD and the two-year German-U.S. bond yield differential has broken down since late March. Moreover, higher yields in the U.S. no longer represent a positive economic outlook but are a necessity to fund deficits. ""The dollar can seem to be decoupled from rates, but I think that another way to frame it is that the U.S. needs to offer a higher premium to compensate for the policy uncertainty and seeming desire for a weaker dollar,"" Chandler noted. Rate outlook favors EUR A potential shift in the yield differential narrative is putting the euro back in the spotlight. Market participants are bracing for a return to fundamentals—particularly rate spreads—yet the outlook may not bode well for the greenback. ""To some extent the rate differential outlook for EUR/USD is not favourable for the USD, if one assumes that the ECB is largely done with rate cuts (perhaps one more), while the Fed could well cut rates up to 125 bps over the next 12-18 months, if U.S. growth continues to be sluggish,"" ADM's Ostwald said. The European Central Bank (ECB) has delivered eight quarter-point cuts in a year, yet the euro has rallied against the U.S. dollar. From here on, the focus will be on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. So far, Powell has held rates steady at 4.25% despite President Trump's repeated calls for ultra-low borrowing costs. In other words, the rate differential is likely to widen in favor of the EUR. Need for higher FX hedge ratios Historically, the USD has offered a natural hedge to foreign investors in U.S. stocks. So naturally, as the positive correlation between U.S. stocks and the dollar has broken , European pension funds—which account for nearly half of foreign holdings in U.S. equities—and other investors are forced to increase their FX hedging to protect portfolio returns against dollar weakness. According to market observers, this FX hedging strategy could continue to propel the euro higher in the near term. Let's put the hedging strategy in context. Imagine a European fund with $10,000 worth of investments in the U.S. If the US dollar (USD) gets weaker compared to the euro (EUR), the fund's investment loses value when converted back to euros. To hedge against this currency risk, the fund might consider hedging part of that investment by taking short bets on the dollar via forwards, futures or options, adding to the dollar's bearish momentum. ""Using the monthly Danish pension flow data as a European proxy, April saw a spike higher in the FX hedging ratio from 61% in January to 74% in April. We’ve seen 80% levels before, so there is room for higher and also more consistent FX hedging for all European investors, that will naturally see EUR selloffs on newsflow faded on a day-to-day basis until that flow peaks. We’re not there yet, but we’re a lot closer,"" Jordan Rochester , head of FICC strategy at Mizhou, recently explained in a LinkedIn post. According to Financial Analyst Enric A., fewer than 20% of European institutions currently hedge their USD exposure, and they will have to do more to stabilize portfolios, which might lead to further USD bearish momentum. ""Higher hedge ratios = more EUR buying, more USD selling,"" Enric said on LinkedIn. And to top it off, hedging by other regions' funds may have had the same effect. Chandler cited BIS data while highlighting hedging by Asian funds. Bottom line: As macro narratives shift toward potential U.S. Fed easing and hedging dynamics exert pressure on the greenback, EUR/USD may remain buoyant despite eurozone growth headwinds.

2025-07-03T03:36:48,"Why Tom Lee Believes Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000","The post Why Tom Lee Believes Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Popular market strategist Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, has explained why he believes Ethereum (ETH) has the potential to climb to $10,000 . Ethereum’s price has been stuck around $2,400 for some time, without much movement. While some experts like Bitwise think it might not hit new all-time highs this year, Tom Lee remains positive about its future. In an interview with Coinage , said that even though Ethereum slowed down in innovation for a while, it’s now regaining momentum. One reason is the growing trend of tokenizing real-world assets. This means turning things like dollars, company shares, and other financial products into digital tokens. Big companies like Robinhood and Coinbase’s Base network are already working on Ethereum, which helps strengthen its position in the market. Lee also explained that Ethereum is mostly U.S.-based or operates under U.S. regulation , making it a safer and more reliable option for handling tokenized financial products. [post_titles_links postid=”477837″] Another factor, according to Lee, is that many investors have given up on Ethereum, assuming its best days are over. This could actually set the stage for a surprise rally. He said that if the world embraces tokenized assets and starts trading them actively, the value of blockchains like Ethereum will rise sharply. Tom Lee said, “Ethereum could probably go to $10,000 if the world realizes tokenizing assets is the future.” As this trend grows, demand for Ethereum’s network could increase, pulling its price up with it. Ethereum Price Prediction (Short-Term) Ethereum’s price is still moving sideways within a broad range between $2,200 and $2,600. It hasn’t decided whether to move higher or drop towards the support zone again. The price briefly dipped below $2,383 but bounced back, showing bulls are still active at this level. Right now, Ethereum is stuck between the upper and lower boundaries of this range, with no clear breakout yet. If it breaks above the top of the range and holds, the price could target higher levels like $2,530 and $2,780. .

Besides, there is a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $2,560 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,615 level. It is near the 1.618 Fib extension level of the downward move from the $2,523 swing high to the $2,372 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,665 level. A clear move above the $2,665 resistance might send the price toward the $2,720 resistance. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,750 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,615 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,560 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550 zone. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward the $2,520 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,450 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

2025-07-03T03:04:44,"MST: Good For Trading, Not For Income","Summary MST is a leveraged ETF aiming for 150%-200% of MSTR's daily returns, using derivatives and leverage for active trading. Despite weekly distributions, the fund's total returns are negative, reflecting both payouts and recent declines in underlying holdings. Long-term investors face high risks due to leverage, daily rebalancing, and the questionable long-term outlook for MSTR and BTC exposure. I rate MST a Hold, as its structure favors traders over investors and lacks a compelling case for long-term capital appreciation. Defiance Leveraged Long + Income MSTR ETF ( MST ) is a new ETF, launched in May. About two months old, I wanted to take a look at it and see how it related to Strategy ( MSTR ), being a fund based on that stock. Moreover, what should the investor make of ""Leveraged Long + Income"" part of its name as they stumble upon it? I found that it's much long-term or income-focused about it, and I rate it a Hold, thinking it too risky over time to be a good Buy. Performance So Far The first thing to note is the frequency of distributions. MST has paid weekly since its first dividend on May 20th. MST Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) Altogether, a single share has received $1.9178 in dividends since the launch. Price vs. Total Returns (Seeking Alpha) Thus, some of the price decline since launch is a consequence of these distributions, but the fact that total returns are negative also indicates that the holdings themselves have been down recently. What we are seeing, however, is that the fund prioritizes liquidity and monetization for its shareholders, so let's look at the strategy and portfolio behind this dividend policy. Concept and Holdings According to their prospectus , MST is an actively managed ETF that engages in derivative trades, in order to achieve daily returns of 150% to 200% of MSTR. While not a given, the fund may also use leverage in addition to their derivative position to achieve this goal. The choice of derivatives and timing of leverage are all subject to management's situational judgment. In short, it's a fund that actively trades on the swings of MSTR. It also means that the holdings are highly dynamic. Thankfully, the manager's website gives an up-to-date display of their holdings. Partial Holdings as of July 2, 2025 (Defiance Website) The screenshot (above) from that page shows parts of the holdings, but more or less captures what happens inside this ETF. The derivatives vary between swap agreements and call options. The calls are staggered across several strike prices, in order to provide flexibility to the manager based on market movements. This includes creating call credit spreads, in order to generate income in the portfolio. The Treasury positions (either directly or through funds), meanwhile, serve as collateral for the derivative positions they take. The image I've displayed is truly a snapshot, as per the prospectus: At the end of each trading day, the Fund’s swaps and options are marked to market (valued based on current market prices), and the Fund’s investment adviser rebalances the portfolio to maintain leveraged exposure of approximately 150% to 200% of the Underlying Security’s share price. Given this much activity, it's not surprising that distributions are regularly passed to shareholders. Nevertheless, management states that MST's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, with income being secondary. Future Outlook The investment objective seems to suggest that MST is a fund that could be bought with long-term intentions, perhaps buying a large position and reinvesting the weekly dividends. While this would provide many opportunities of compounding, there are plenty of ways this can pan out badly for long-term investors. Let's talk about the underlying security first: MSTR. I've covered it twice, and last time I rated it a Hold. While that was in February, I am not of a mind to update that rating. One can easily surmise that I won't think MST is a Buy if I don't think that about MSTR. I'll just quote my own closing remarks from there: I take issue with the idea that selling shares at a premium to the portfolio to buy more creates ""BTC yield,"" any more than Berkshire doing the same would create ""KO yield"" with more shares of Coca-Cola. Without a source of earnings (something Berkshire has) to support this BTC accumulation, it's not clear why those who believe in BTC would aim for MSTR instead of buying the BTC directly. It just doesn't make sense to me. For a long-term investor to see appeal in an ETF that has the long term as part of its investment objective, we need to be able to see the long-term potential in the underlying security, and I already find that dubious. MST holding options and its leverage are both especially risky to long-term investors. The potential for magnified losses on even a 5% drop in BTC that gets locked in by daily rebalancing isn't something to ignore. The 1.31% expense ratio doesn't make recovery of principal much easier over time. A similar income fund that I've covered before is YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). It employs synthetic covered calls and has the effect of regularly passing through gains to shareholders. While it isn't without risks, the potential for losses aren't enhanced in their portfolio, and I didn't even find that to be a Buy. In my view, MST is more a trader's security. MSTR effectively operates as a derivative of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), making MST a derivative of a derivative, potentially very volatile and risky. Conclusion I am initiating a Hold rating largely because I see no compelling case to think BTC will move up or down considerably in the near-term, which would trickle into more volatile reactions from the likes of MSTR and MST. In addition, a Buy rating on this security doesn't make sense for long-term investors. While the fund may declare long-term intentions, it seems to me the approach just doesn't allow for it.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798990-mst-good-for-trading-not-for-income?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","MST",cryptocompare
