2025-07-03T08:59:08,"Solana and a First in US History! Extraordinary Data Arrived for SOL!","Another first was achieved in the USA yesterday, and the first staking ETF in the USA was approved and opened for trading. The US’s first Solana (SOL) Staking ETF (SSK), launched by REX-Osprey, attracted a lot of attention on its first day. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, the first approved spot staking crypto ETF in the U.S., saw $33 million in first-day trading volume, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also noted the success of the Solana ETF and said, “The first Solana Staking ETF in the US has been launched. SSK recorded approximately $8 million in trading volume in just 20 minutes after its launch.” The ETF also achieved $1 million in assets under management. The Solana ETF's performance has outpaced the Solana and XRP futures ETFs and the average ETF outflow. However, it still fell short of spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Admitted under stricter oversight and regulations under the Securities Act of 1940, the ETF chose Anchorage as its custodian. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/t6LkQwDXLc — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-03T08:38:21,"Bitcoin ETFs Pull $408M—Fidelity & ARK Spark the Next BTC Wave As ETH Struggles","Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) dominated institutional flows, with a massive $407.78 million in daily net inflows on July 2, bringing cumulative inflows to $49.04 billion . In contrast, Ethereum ETFs faced modest $1.8 million outflows, according to data from SosoValue . The stark difference resulted from Bitcoin’s continued institutional appeal as BTC reached weekly highs of $109,000 on July 2, positioning it for potential breakouts toward $112,000 targets. Source: Cryptonews Fidelity’s FBTC led Bitcoin ETF inflows with $183.96 million , followed by ARK21Shares’ ARKB at $83 million and Bitwise’s BITB contributing $64.94 million . BlackRock’s IBIT, despite recording zero inflows on the day, maintains its dominant position with $76.31 billion in net assets and $52.42 billion in cumulative inflows since launch. Source: SosoValue The performance disparity between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs followed the broader market trend, as Bitcoin maintains psychological support above the $100,000 level defended since early May. Total Bitcoin ETF assets under management reached $136.68 billion , representing 6.30% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. This indicates a significant level of institutional adoption. Trading volumes also surged to $5.22 billion across Bitcoin ETFs, with IBIT alone generating $4.08 billion in daily trading activity. Institutional Momentum Drives Record Bitcoin ETF Adoption Bitcoin ETF inflows demonstrate sustained institutional conviction, despite broader market volatility, with the latest inflows representing the continuation of aggressive accumulation patterns seen so far in 2025. Particularly, Fidelity’s FBTC leadership, with $183.96 million in inflows, resulted from the growing competition among major asset managers for Bitcoin market share, following BlackRock’s early dominance. The growing competition has led to a broad-based institutional adoption, rather than concentrated buying from a single entity. Interestingly, corporate treasury strategies are increasingly embracing ETF structures over direct ownership of Bitcoin. Design giant, Figma, recently revealed in its IPO filing that it has $69.5 million in Bitcoin ETF holdings , plus $30 million earmarked for future cryptocurrency investments. Design giant @figma goes public revealing $70M Bitcoin ETF holdings and $30M ready to buy more as corporate Bitcoin adoption explodes to 141 public companies holding $91 billion. #Figma #IPO #Bitcoin https://t.co/Q9CtjTalum — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 2, 2025 This pattern is becoming increasingly adopted, and public companies that can’t hold directly prefer regulated exposure through established financial products. Regionally, European expansion is also accelerating through structured products, such as the recent UniCredit’s Bitcoin ETF certificate , designed for Italian professional clients. The five-year instrument offers capital protection with 85% upside participation. Moreover, the regulatory landscape continues to evolve favorably with the SEC’s July 1 guidance streamlining token-based ETF approvals and enabling a 75-day review process. The new guidance establishes clearer pathways for crypto ETF approvals by implementing standardized disclosure frameworks that encompass custody practices, conflicts of interest, and creation and redemption mechanisms. Ethereum ETFs Face Headwinds Despite Previous Momentum Ethereum ETFs experienced modest $1.8 million outflows on July 2, contrasting sharply with their previous dominance, as they had recorded $240.29 million in daily inflows during June , surpassing Bitcoin ETFs’ performance at that time. The June surge represented the strongest performance of Ethereum ETFs in four months, coinciding with ETH climbing above $2,800 for the first time since February. Source: Cryptonews BlackRock’s ETHA led that momentum with $163.6 million in single-day inflows, maintaining a 23-day streak without outflows while managing over 1.55 million ETH valued at $4.23 billion. Current outflows may result from profit-taking following Ethereum’s technical breakout above multi-year descending trendlines. The asset completed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern with projected targets around $3,300, but recent rejection from $2,834 highs suggests consolidation phases before continued advances. Ethereum staking also reached an all-time high of 34.65 million ETH locked on the Beacon Chain, representing nearly 29% of the circulating supply. Long-term holders are holding on through staking despite short-term ETF flow volatility. They’re prioritizing yield generation over immediate liquidity. Regulatory developments further support the growth of multi-asset crypto ETFs, as seen in Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund conversion , which holds Bitcoin (79.9%), Ethereum (11.3%), and also XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Similarly, the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF was launched on Wednesday as the first US-listed fund to incorporate crypto staking. This regulatory development could enable similar Ethereum staking products that combine institutional access with yield generation.

2025-07-03T08:33:08,"Arthur Hayes Warns Bitcoin Could Dip to $90K Before Next Bull Run","The post Arthur Hayes Warns Bitcoin Could Dip to $90K Before Next Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In his latest blog post titled “ Quid Pro Stablecoin ,” Arthur Hayes delivers a sharp analysis of the current macroeconomic landscape and how it may affect the crypto market. He warns that crypto prices could move sideways—or slightly lower—between now and the Jackson Hole economic symposium in August. Why Hayes Expects a Bitcoin Price Dip Hayes believes a market correction is likely in the near term. With Bitcoin’s recent price surge , traders may take profits while waiting for clearer signals from the Federal Reserve. He highlights one key factor: if the U.S. Treasury begins replenishing its General Account (TGA), it could withdraw liquidity from the system, placing pressure on risk assets like crypto. Drawing from past market cycles and sentiment shifts, Hayes projects a temporary dip in Bitcoin’s price to around $90,000, potentially flushing out weak hands before the next leg up. He also warns that this liquidity squeeze could create a “summer lull”—a period of sideways or downward movement—until at least the Jackson Hole event in late August. If macro conditions worsen, Hayes may reduce Maelstrom’s Bitcoin exposure, though the fund has already exited its illiquid altcoin positions. Traditional Banks and Stablecoins Could Drive the Next Bull Run What makes this cycle different, according to Hayes, is the growing role of traditional banks in crypto. With the U.S. government signaling support for stablecoins—especially after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act —banks like JPMorgan may soon launch their own USD-backed tokens. Unlike existing stablecoins like USDC or Tether, these bank-issued tokens would come with full regulatory backing and access to the Federal Reserve system. Hayes emphasizes that the stablecoin push is not just about consumer safety—it’s also a strategy for the U.S. government to exert greater control over crypto’s monetary flows. This shift could change how liquidity moves within the crypto market and force issuers to meet stricter reserve requirements or obtain special licenses. [post_titles_links postid=”477986″] A Game-Changer for Crypto Liquidity Hayes calls these developments a “game-changer.” He explains that regulated bank-issued stablecoins would allow banks to channel retail deposits into short-term U.S. Treasuries without violating capital rules. This could act like a new form of quantitative easing, injecting fresh liquidity into markets—without any official intervention from the Federal Reserve. Could $6.8 Trillion Flow Into Crypto? Hayes estimates that if even a portion of the $17 trillion currently sitting in U.S. bank deposits flows into these new stablecoins, it could result in $6.8 trillion in demand for Treasury securities. This massive wave of liquidity wouldn’t just stay confined to bonds—it could spill over into crypto and tech stocks, potentially igniting the next major bull market. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs How is the crypto market performing today? As of July 3, 2025, the crypto market is showing mixed movements. Bitcoin is holding steady around $107,000, recovering from recent dips below $100,000. Ethereum has seen a notable surge, reaching $2,600 USDT, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, and TRON are showing relative strength. This suggests some market resilience, despite Hayes’ prediction of a “summer lull.” Are Arthur Hayes’ Bitcoin predictions realistic? Arthur Hayes’ predictions are considered bold and often contrarian, yet he openly acknowledges when he’s wrong. While his short-term calls can be volatile, his longer-term forecasts, such as Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2028, are based on his macroeconomic analysis of global liquidity, U.S. debt, and the potential for a new form of quantitative easing through regulated stablecoins. Many analysts consider his macro view influential, even if his exact price targets are ambitious. What is the “GENIUS Act,” and how does it relate to stablecoins? The “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,” or GENIUS Act, is U.S. legislation passed by the Senate (June 17, 2025) to create a comprehensive federal framework for regulating payment stablecoins. It signals government support while setting stricter reserve and licensing requirements, potentially favoring bank-issued stablecoins.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-warns-bitcoin-could-dip-to-90k-before-next-bull-run/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T08:22:07,"Chinese Analyst Reveals: “If Ethereum Surpasses This Price Level, the Bull Run Will Begin”","Jack Yi, the founder of LD Capital, stated on social media that the volatility in the crypto market is nearing an end. Yi argued that when the market starts to rise, sudden drops can sometimes disrupt the process, but these fluctuations will not change the general trend. JackYi, who claimed that the expected interest rate cuts and developments in the Ethereum ecosystem in the near future will surprise patient investors, said that especially if the Ethereum (ETH) price exceeds the $ 3,000 level, this will be a harbinger of a real bull market not only for investors but for the entire sector. Yi said, “In a bull trend, we only buy on declines.” Related News: One of Belgium's Largest Banks Takes Important Step with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) So why is ETH lagging behind Bitcoin? According to Yi, the main reason for this situation is that institutional investors have embraced Bitcoin’s narrative. While Bitcoin is seen as a “store of value” with a simple and clear value proposition, ETH’s function is much broader and more versatile. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency, it is the programmable infrastructure of the entire tokenized economy. Therefore, the narrative of Ethereum is more comprehensive, which leads to a delay in institutional adoption. However, Yi believes that Ethereum’s broader potential will become more widely understood over time, and price action will reflect that. *This is not investment advice.

But this isn’t just any price rally. According to top crypto trader Michael van de Poppe, Bitcoin is showing strong momentum that could soon push it past its previous all-time high of $111,970. If this rally holds, a new record could be just a week or two away. BTC Price Breakout In Weeks In a recent bitcoin price analysis, Michael shared a key 4-hour chart showing that Bitcoin has cleared a big hurdle, the $106,500 level. Breaking this barrier pushed BTC up past $108,000, where it’s now holding firm near $109,000. This shows that buyers are back and momentum is building. He notes that when Bitcoin passed $106,500 earlier, it took liquidity from lower levels, which pushed out short traders and gave BTC more energy to rise. Michael believes the next target is around $110,500. If Bitcoin stays above this mark, it could break its old all-time high of $111,970, or even go higher in the next couple of weeks. Key Levels to Watch Next Even with strong momentum, Michael believes that Bitcoin could see small dips along the way. If there’s a pullback, traders are watching the $105,500 area and the $100,000 zone as good spots to add more positions. These levels should act as strong support if the price cools down before the next leg up. Big Predictions From Big Banks Being more bullish, Standard Chartered, one of the world’s top banks, just shared a bold Bitcoin forecast . They believe Bitcoin could hit $135,000 by the end of the third quarter of 2025 and might even touch $200,000 by the end of this year. This big target adds even more hope for traders who believe Bitcoin’s rally is far from over.

2025-07-03T08:00:50,"Ethereum Eyes Key Resistance As Price Reclaims $2,550 –  Here Are The Levels To Watch","Ethereum (ETH) has surged 7.5% in the daily timeframe to break above a key resistance level for the first time in weeks. Following its breakout, some analysts forecasted that a retest of the range highs could be around the corner. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Level Amid $108,000 Rejection, But Analysts Suggest Caution This Quarter Ethereum Reclaims Crucial Area On Wednesday, Ethereum jumped over 7% from its local low to the $2,550 mark, setting the stage to reclaim another crucial resistance. The King of Altcoins climbed from the $2,380 support to the $2,585 area, hitting a two-week high. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $2,400-$2,800 price range since the early May breakout, but briefly lost this area after failing to hold the $2,550 support two weeks ago. After recovering its local range, ETH struggled to break past the $2,500 barrier, trading between the range low and this resistance for a week. Nonetheless, today’s market recovery, which also saw Bitcoin jump to the $109,600 mark, has sparked bullish sentiment among investors. Amid today’s performance, Daan Crypto Trades called ETH’s price action a “nice move out of the local range.” However, he suggested that bulls must hold the $2,520 area to confirm it isn’t another deviation or liquidity grab in a “bigger chop.” To the trader, failing to hold this area would send the cryptocurrency to the range lows again. As a result, the major levels to watch remain the $2,310 support and $2,735 resistance. Market watcher Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum has “respected support every single time,” forming “one of the cleanest breakouts we’ve ever seen.” He highlighted a three-month ascending triangle in ETH’s chart, pointing out that the King of Altcoins bounced from the rising support line during the recent price deviation and now targets the next key resistance around the $2,700 mark. Ethereum is charging up. Higher lows, strong base, bullish MACD crossover. A clean break of $2,700… and ETH will fly. $3,000 is just the beginning. The real move comes after that. ETH To Repeat ATH Set Up? Merlijn also affirmed that ETH’s two-year setup is repeating, which could signal that a massive breakout is coming. According to the chart, the Ethereum price has moved in stages that last about two years since 2018. During the first stage, the cryptocurrency’s price forms a base, which later leads to the second stage, where the price rejects and retests the base lows. Lastly, Ethereum experiences the liftoff phase, where the price breaks out to new highs. The last liftoff phase, between 2020 and 2022, saw ETH surge from the $100 mark to its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). To the trader, “This time we start from $1,500. Not a dip. A launchpad.” Similarly, analyst Kaleo pointed out the structural resemblance between ETH’s performance this cycle and last cycle. He noted that, while BTC hit a new ATH in December 2020, Ethereum was 60% down from its previous cycle highs, leading many investors to suggest it was “dead.” Related Reading: Solana Summer Loading? SOL Eyes $180 Following Staked ETF-Fueled Breakout Nonetheless, ETH climbed over 800% from there, outperforming Bitcoin’s 250% increase in the following months. This time, the cryptocurrency has also seen up to a 68% retrace from its previous ATH, while BTC soared to new highs. If history repeats, “The bottom for ETH is in. Up only from here,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,568, a 6.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Secretary Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan informed the Senate Standing Committee on Power that although surplus electricity is available during winter, the IMF strictly stands against it. Pakistan’s 2,000 MW Crypto Mining Plan Gets Rejected In a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Mohsin Aziz, the ongoing discussions with the IMF on crypto mining were outlined. IMF cited concerns about market distortions before rejecting the proposal to offer subsidized rates to energy-intensive industries such as crypto mining, data centres, and metal industries. Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts for crypto mining , aiming at interest foreign investments, has now been rejected by the IMF. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary Irfan. However, ongoing discussions suggest that Pakistan is committed to refining its energy plan to align with global standards and recommendations. [post_titles_links postid=”478042″] Pakistan in Talks With International Institutions Dr. Irfan confirmed that the government is still in talks with international institutions to redefine its power subsidiary plan after the IMF rejected the proposal. The committee also discussed the technological solutions aimed at combating electricity theft. Pakistan government’s recent agreement with scheduled banks to reduce the circular debt stock of Rs. 1.275 trillion was also discussed during the meeting. Senator Shibli Faraz criticized the deal, accusing the banks of being “forced at gunpoint” to offer loans. Power Theft in Pakistan The Secretary Power added that 58% of users pay a subsidized rate of Rs. 10 per unit, which is a lot less than the government standard price. The government is planning to allocate Rs. 250 billion in subsidies this year and expand anti-theft technology in he country. The committee has directed the power division to submit a comprehensive answer to various issues at the next meeting. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What was Pakistan’s 2,000 MW crypto mining plan, and what was its goal? Pakistan’s 2,000 MW crypto mining plan aimed to allocate surplus electricity, especially during winter, to energy-intensive industries like crypto mining, data centers, and metal industries. Its goal was to attract foreign investment, monetize underutilized power, and create high-tech jobs, turning surplus energy into a revenue-generating asset. What are the implications of the IMF’s rejection for Pakistan’s crypto ambitions? The IMF’s rejection creates significant hurdles for Pakistan’s crypto ambitions, particularly regarding large-scale, subsidized crypto mining operations. It means Pakistan must refine its energy plan to align with global standards and avoid market distortions, potentially slowing down its aim to become a regional crypto and AI hub. How does electricity theft in Pakistan impact the feasibility of large-scale crypto mining? Widespread electricity theft in Pakistan poses a significant challenge to the feasibility of large-scale crypto mining. It contributes to financial losses for utilities, potentially leading to higher tariffs for honest consumers and instability in the power grid. Such issues make it difficult to guarantee a stable and cost-effective power supply for energy-intensive operations like crypto mining.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/imf-rejects-pakistans-2000-mw-crypto-mining-proposal/,"MINING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN|BTC","News|Mining",cryptocompare

The malicious apps spoof the most widely used wallets, stealing private phrases and leaving users vulnerable to being drained. An ongoing campaign is spreading malicious extensions, spoofing some of the most common crypto wallets on Firefox. Koi security discovered some of the apps were removed, while others were still active, posing as legitimate wallets. The SlowMist attack team also warned users to be vigilant, as the attack is still active. The fake apps are spreading through the official Firefox app store, making them potentially more misleading and dangerous. 🚨SlowMist TI Alert🚨 A massive malicious campaign involving dozens of fake #Firefox extensions designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet credentials is underway. Over 40 fake extensions impersonating trusted #wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, Phantom, OKX,… pic.twitter.com/IIfE5ifxJi — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) July 3, 2025 The attack is relatively simple, but targets the easiest type of user, who seek casual access to crypto. Using a compromised app, or inputting private phrases into one may lead to significant losses. Users are already reporting losses from the fake apps. Hacks and exploits accelerated in the first half of 2025, as crypto increased in value. Threats also came from DPRK hackers infiltrating projects, with hundreds potentially affected by malicious code. Firefox fake extensions target the most widely used wallets Koi intercepted fake apps for some of the most widely used wallet extensions, including Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. The researchers discovered over 40 apps posing as wallets, with new ones appearing. Some of the fake wallets are still active on unofficial links. According to researchers, the fake apps started spreading around April 2025. The extensions extract and send out wallet extensions, reaching a server controlled by the attacker. The apps also transmit the user’s IP address for tracking and further targeting. Attackers cloned the open-source code of legitimate wallets The attack was relatively simple, often using the legitimate wallet code for open-source projects like MetaMask. The fake apps then injected the malicious code to allow the wallet to steal data and credentials. The fake wallet apps were active on app stores, using the same logos and style as the original wallet. Previously, faked wallets have targeted specific niche projects, but this time, the attacker spoofed multi-asset wallets, widely used for DeFi, trading, NFT and other on-chain tasks. Code analysis concluded the attack most likely originated from Russia, as Russian-language code comments were discovered in some of the apps. Metadata from a file on one of the command-and-control servers also points to a Russian attacker. Koi advices users to install an allow list filter and avoid downloading apps without vetting. Some of the apps may not show problems, but later update and change their behavior. Security researchers also advice against searching apps directly, as the results may point to fake wallets with deliberately inflated five-star reviews. The best approach is to use the wallet’s official web page or social media. Users were also advised to be skeptical when seeing an app with too many five-star reviews, that were artificially placed to make the app seem established and legitimate.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $107,138.45 and $109,763.65 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s performance in Q1 2025 was notably lackluster due to tariff-related concerns alongside the rise in tension between Russia and Ukraine. Yet, it made a remarkable comeback in Q2, particularly during April and May. Driven by easing tensions, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000 by the third week of May. But, In early June, BTC attempted to hold support near the previous swing low from May after pulling back from its $112K peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and renewed U.S.-China trade talks sparked a brief bounce from the dynamic support of the 50-day EMA. Yet, by June 10th, the momentum began to wane, with increased selling pressure linked to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly between Israel and Iran. The situation escalated on June 17th when President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Following a defiant response from Iran, the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June, further worsening the geopolitical landscape. Consequently, Bitcoin briefly dipped to around $98,000 but rebounded after a ceasefire announcement on June 23rd. As of the fourth week of June, Bitcoin’s price has advanced significantly, yet it struggles near a multi-month supply block. The price action throughout June had resembled a continuation pattern known as “flag pattern”, with the upper border aligning with this supply block. In the first week of July, daily active addresses, whale transactions count (>1m USD), and addresses holding coins (10,000 – 100,000) have seen increases, as a result, the border of the flag is breached on the upside. Now, if Bitcoin can break through June’s swing high of $110K then this time the chances of surpassing $112,000 become more likely. A successful breakout could propel BTC towards a new high of $120,000 by the end of July. Conversely, if bearish pressure mounts and the price reverses, then the consolidation under the flag would continue and could return to the critical May swing low support zone. Should this level also fail, then Bitcoin could fall to the flag’s lower border, dragging the price down to the $100,000 to $95,000 range in the near term. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-03T07:39:07,"Market Prophet Tom Lee Reveals His Prediction About Ethereum (ETH) – “Banks…”","Famous investor and Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee predicts that banks will buy Ethereum (ETH) not only for speculative gains but also to secure their infrastructure. Lee states that this strategy will initiate institutional-level Ethereum accumulation, similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investments. According to Lee, the financial sector and the cryptocurrency world will become increasingly intertwined by 2025. The basis of this convergence is stablecoins, which are rapidly being adopted and used by both consumers and large institutions. The majority of these stablecoins are built on the Ethereum infrastructure. Lee, who says, “ETH is the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem,” argues that banks will aim to ensure the security of the network by investing in Ethereum. Lee predicts that stablecoins will be one of the key components of the future banking infrastructure. Stating that especially large banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan will start issuing their own stablecoins using the ETH network, Lee stated that these institutions will contribute to network security by staking Ethereum. Related News: How Much U.S. President Donald Trump Has Earned from Cryptocurrency Ventures Revealed - Here Are the Hard-to-Believe Number In the Ethereum network, which operates with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, institutions that stake ETH on the network become transaction validators, which both ensures network security and provides income to the staking institutions. According to Lee, this will play a critical role, especially in ensuring the security of stablecoins. Lee also said that Ethereum currently hosts 51% of stablecoins and 30% of network fees come from stablecoin transactions. He stated that this situation will further increase the dominance of the US dollar in global finance. “If the stablecoin market reaches $2 trillion from $250 billion, transaction fees and therefore returns on the ETH network will also increase exponentially,” he said. Bitmine Immersion, a company led by Lee, has launched a $250 million private investment round in line with this strategy. All funds raised will be used to purchase ETH. Investors include leading institutions in both traditional finance and crypto, such as Founders Fund, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Pantera. The company’s strategy will be evaluated based on the amount of Ethereum earned per share. It is also expected that the company’s value will increase over time through methods such as generating returns by staking Ethereum, financing transactions with ETH in hand, and increasing the price of Ethereum. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of pushing toward potential new highs in July as ETF inflows return and investor sentiment strengthens.

This uptrend is supported by technical data: BTC itself re-took its 50-day moving average, which is around $106,000, and has not fallen beneath good support, which shows BTC to have a solid base.

Moreover, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model lets the lenders and borrowers be as engaged as possible in resolving terms of a trade and do not require a third party. The model is more prevalent among the users of less stable assets. Leaderboard and 100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance is grateful to its early investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway where 10 lucky participants will be rewarded with $10,000 MUTM.

2025-07-03T07:24:25,"Bitcoin and JPMorgan Will Soar on the Back of Big Bank Stablecoins: Hayes","The premise is driven by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s agenda to engineer a liquidity injection that resembles past Federal Reserve interventions, said Hayes in a lengthy blog post on July 3. However, this will be done via financial innovation and regulatory tweaks, not overt money printing, he added. Bessent is “done getting fluffed,” and it’s time for him to “soak the world with his liquidity juices,” he exclaimed. Trillions in T-Bill Buying Power Hayes stated that this stealth liquidity injection strategy has two massive beneficiaries: Bitcoin and JPMorgan. JPMorgan’s stablecoin ( JPMD ) allows it to digitize deposits, eliminate compliance costs, and earn a risk-free spread by buying US Treasury bills. “Quid Pro Stablecoin” is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC’s shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Additionally, regulatory changes such as the GENIUS Act could effectively hand “too big to fail” banks a monopoly on stablecoins, which could lock out fintech firms such as Circle. “The adoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power.” Moreover, if JPMorgan converts even a fraction of its deposits into stablecoins, it unlocks hundreds of billions in low-risk, high-margin earnings, potentially doubling or tripling its market cap. Bitcoin would also benefit because stablecoin issuance creates massive Treasury bill demand without quantitative easing, which suppresses yields and reflates risk assets. The primary cryptocurrency thrives when liquidity expands and rates drop. “The real stablecoin play isn’t betting on crusty FinTechs like Circle—it’s understanding that the US government just handed TBTF banks the launch keys to a multi-trillion-dollar liquidity bazooka disguised as ‘innovation’.” Ethereum to Benefit The JPMD stablecoin will ride on Base, a layer-2 operated by Coinbase built on top of Ethereum, confirming that the asset will use Ethereum infrastructure. This positions the protocol as the settlement layer for the new banking liquidity engine. “This is debt monetization dressed in Ethereum drag,” said Hayes. If big banks settle stablecoins on Ethereum, the current industry standard for real-world asset tokenization, demand for the network’s blockspace, layer-2s, and validators increases. The Ethereum infrastructure is quietly powering the entire play, so it is also likely to benefit, though Hayes didn’t directly address it. It could also become the next corporate treasury gold rush due to its staking yields, which are not available with Bitcoin, according to analysts.

2025-07-03T07:14:48,"Crypto Tycoon Tim Heath Foils Kidnapping Attempt by Biting Off Attacker’s Finger","Australian crypto billionaire Tim Heath narrowly escaped a violent kidnapping attempt in Tallinn, Estonia, last July by biting off part of an attacker’s finger, an Estonian court heard this week. Key Takeaways: Tim Heath escaped a kidnapping attempt in Estonia by biting an attacker’s finger. The suspects stalked Heath for weeks, using disguises and a GPS tracker. Seven men are accused of plotting to abduct Heath and steal his crypto assets. The chilling incident highlights the growing wave of targeted abductions against wealthy crypto figures in 2025, which has forced many executives to bolster their security measures. Heath, a prominent investor and founder of the Estonian-based Yolo Group, was ambushed by two men disguised as painters in the stairwell of his apartment building. Ex-Boxer Tries to Muzzle Crypto Tycoon in Failed Kidnapping According to testimony cited by Estonian outlet Eesti Ekspress and the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the attackers, Azerbaijani national Allahverdi Allahverdiyev, a former boxer and wrestler, tried to silence Heath by covering his mouth. In a desperate act of self-defense, Heath bit through Allahverdiyev’s index finger, managing to break free and retreat into his apartment. The struggle, which lasted about 30 seconds, cost Heath a tooth but forced the kidnappers to flee. The attackers abandoned a rented van nearby, and police later discovered part of Allahverdiyev’s severed finger about 100 meters from the scene. Court documents revealed the attackers had been stalking Heath in the weeks before the assault, both physically and with a GPS tracker placed on his vehicle. The group allegedly planned to force Heath into the van, transport him to a rented sauna house, and coerce him into transferring his crypto holdings. This is David Balland. He co-founded Ledger, one of the biggest companies in crypto This week, he was kidnapped and tortured Here’s the full story of what happened: (and why it’s a wake-up call for everyone in crypto) pic.twitter.com/0NpLlN8aZm — Pix (@PixOnChain) January 24, 2025 Prosecutors say a hacker was also involved to expedite the digital theft. The group of seven suspects reportedly entered Estonia using fake Georgian passports. In the days before the attack, they bought painters’ uniforms and equipment to pose as workmen. Two men have been arrested so far: Allahverdiyev and Georgian citizen Ilgar Mamedov, who prosecutors claim was the getaway driver. Mamedov has denied involvement, insisting he ended up in Estonia by accident. Three other suspects remain unidentified, and two, including the alleged ringleader Najaf Najafli, are wanted by authorities. Kidnappers Demanded 30 Bitcoin After Failed Abduction After the failed abduction, Heath allegedly received a Telegram message containing photos of his apartment along with a demand for 30 Bitcoin, worth about $3.3 million at the time. When Heath didn’t respond, there were no further attempts to contact him, but prosecutors argue the threat could still be active. Heath has since spent over $3.1 million on private security and relocated to a new home. His legal team is pursuing reimbursement of these costs from the accused kidnappers as the court case continues in Estonia. The recent attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. In another incident, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

2025-07-03T07:04:40,"Billionaire Ray Dalio Says US Government Will Be Forced To Deal With Incoming ‘Debt Bomb’ – Here’s How","Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio says that America is going to be forced to deal with its soaring debt problem. The billionaire tells his 1.7 million followers on the social media platform X that the US will likely lower interest rates and print money to address the nation’s ballooning debt obligations. However, he warns that such measures are not very effective. “When countries have too much debt, lowering interest rates and devaluing the currency that the debt is denominated in is the preferred path government policy makers are most likely to take, so it pays to bet on it happening. At the moment of my writing, we know that the projections are for big deficits and big increases in government debt and debt service expenses ahead… I also shared last week why I believe the political system in the US won’t be able to get its debt problems under control. We know how debt service costs (paying back interest and principal) will grow rapidly to squeeze out spending, and we also know that, at best, it is highly doubtful that there will be an increase in demand for the debt commensurate with the supply that needs to be sold. I laid out in detail what I think the implications of all this are in ‘How Countries Go Broke,’ where I offer a description of the mechanics behind my thinking. Others have stress tested it, and thus far there has been almost total agreement that the picture I am painting is accurate.” Dalio believes the US will eventually have to both cut spending and raise taxes to save itself from the looming fiscal crisis. “There is no way that the deficit/debt bomb problem can be sustainably dealt with unless there is a mix of tax revenue increases and spending decreases that are determined in a bipartisan way. Our representatives in Washington, D.C., both Republicans and Democrats, know this is true. They understand the need to reduce the deficit by having those from both sides chip in a bit (e.g., a 4% increase in tax revenue and a 4% spending cut) which would lead to a supply/demand balance improvement for US debt which in turn would lower interest rates.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-03T07:04:21,"Donald Trump Crypto Holdings Now Make Up 8% of His Net Worth","The post Donald Trump Crypto Holdings Now Make Up 8% of His Net Worth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio is making headlines. A recent Bloomberg report reveals that Donald Trump holds at least 8% of his net worth in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This revelation comes amid growing speculation that Trump’s pro-crypto stance may not be just political, but personal. Donald Trump Net Worth: Real Estate, Truth Social, and Crypto As of now, Trump’s total net worth is estimated at $6.4 billion, largely made up of: Real estate assets, including 19+ properties valued over $50 million each His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (Truth Social) And now, a rapidly growing share of crypto holdings While Trump’s real estate empire remains the backbone of his business, the report suggests that cryptocurrencies are becoming a larger slice of Trump’s financial pie. World Liberty Financial: The Core of Trump’s Crypto Holdings The centerpiece of Donald Trump’s crypto wealth is a project called World Liberty Financial (WLFI). WLFI has raised over $550 million from token sales $390 million of that amount reportedly went directly to the Trump family Trump and his family also own 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, valued at approximately $2 billion (though currently non-transferable, hence not included in his official net worth) USD1 Stablecoin and TRUMP Memecoin Fuel Trump’s Crypto Empire Trump’s crypto holdings don’t stop with WLFI. The report highlights two other major assets in his portfolio: 1. USD1 Stablecoin Market Cap: $2.2 billion+ 24H Trading Volume: $1.5 billion+ Annual Earnings from Reserves: $100 million [post_titles_links postid=”477986″] 2. TRUMP Memecoin Market Cap: $1.79 billion 24H Trading Volume: $269 million Total Supply: 1 billion TRUMP tokens Circulating Supply: ~200 million CIC Digital, the firm controlling 80% of TRUMP tokens, is reportedly linked to the Trump Organization Trump Steps Into the Crypto Mining Business Donald Trump has a 20% stake in American Bitcoin, a U.S.-based crypto mining firm. The company recently merged with Gryphon Digital Mining and is now valued at over $3 billion. This move places Trump directly in the mining sector, further diversifying his crypto interests. Final Thoughts While Trump’s public support for cryptocurrencies has often made headlines, this new report suggests something more: Donald Trump’s crypto holdings are now a central piece of his fortune. With over $500 million directly tied to crypto and even more in token valuations, Trump may be one of the most crypto-exposed political figures in the world. As the next election cycle heats up, Trump’s net worth and growing crypto empire are likely to remain in the spotlight.

Donald Trump’s significant crypto wealth rapidly grew, especially after October 2024. It stems from the launch of his own meme coins ($TRUMP, $MELANIA) and a substantial stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with his family. He has also directly engaged with the crypto mining sector. What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI), and how does it generate value for the Trump family? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a crypto venture co-established by Donald Trump, with his sons Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron listed as Web3 ambassadors. It generates value through token sales (raising over $550 million), with a Trump family entity receiving 75% of net revenues from these sales and holding 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. How does Trump’s crypto wealth compare to other political figures or billionaires? Donald Trump is likely one of the most crypto-exposed political figures globally, with over 8% of his estimated $6.4 billion net worth tied to crypto. While exact comparisons with other politicians are hard, his direct involvement in crypto projects and substantial holdings make him an outlier among major political figures.

We are not affiliated with Robinhood, were not involved in this process, and do not endorse this product,” OpenAI said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). The company also stated that the transfer of its own shares is only possible with its own approval, and warned, “Any share transfer requires our approval, we have not approved any transfer. Please be careful.” Robinhood, meanwhile, introduced its new crypto and blockchain-focused products in Cannes, France. The company attracted attention with its tokenized shares, staking services, and a new blockchain infrastructure move.

2025-07-03T07:00:44,"Bitcoin Short-Term Upper Bound Is $117,000, Glassnode Says","The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed Bitcoin has recently been trading within a short-term band that has its upper level currently located at $117,000. Bitcoin Is Trading Between These Two Short-Term Holder Price Bands In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about the short-term price band that Bitcoin has been trading inside lately. The band in question is based on two levels relevant to the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Related Reading: This Altcoin Looks Like PEPE Before It Exploded, Analyst Says The indicator related to the STHs that’s of interest here is the Realized Price, which keeps track of the average cost basis or acquisition level of the BTC addresses belonging to the group. When the value of this metric is greater than the asset’s spot price, it means the STHs as a whole can be considered to be in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the coin’s value suggests the dominance of loss among this cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode, which shows the trend in the STH Realized Price and a few lines corresponding to different standard deviations (SDs) from it: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin price has interestingly traded in a range defined by two of these lines over the last six months. The lower bound of the range has been the -1 SD and the upper one the +1 SD. The STHs are made up of the new entrants into the sector and fickle-minded traders, so the group tends to easily react to happenings in the market. As such, the cryptocurrency’s price can have some interactions with the STH Realized Price, due to the cohort’s panic buying/selling. From the chart, it’s apparent that the same has been true in this period of consolidation as well. While the indicator has certainly not acted as an absolute support or resistance, the asset has still seen such effects around it in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum In Demand: ETF Inflow Streak Extends To 7 Weeks Currently, Bitcoin is trading above the metric after finding a rebound at it last month. The level ahead of the asset now is the +1 SD. In this period of sideways movement, it has so far only been able to test this line once. “This level can be seen as the upper band of the short-term price action,” notes the analytics firm. The +1 SD is located at around $117,000 right now. It only remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will test this level in the near future or not.

2025-07-03T07:00:00,"Bitcoin Flashes Rare Signal That Could Trigger Drop Below $40,000, Analyst Warns","Bitcoin (BTC) recently closed its June monthly candle above $100,000, raising hopes among bulls for continued upside throughout the summer. However, the digital asset has now flashed a rare signal that warns of a significant price pullback in the coming months. Bitcoin Flashes Rare Bearish Signal According to a recent X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin has triggered a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential sell-signal on the quarterly chart. Martinez noted that this is a rare and historically reliable warning that has often preceded major drawdowns for the cryptocurrency. For the uninitiated, a quarterly TD Sequential sell-signal is a rare technical indicator that appears after multiple consecutive bullish quarterly candles, signaling long-term trend exhaustion. It suggests that Bitcoin may face a significant correction after a prolonged uptrend. In 2015, its appearance was followed by a 75% decline in BTC, while in 2018, a similar signal preceded an 85% crash. Martinez cautioned that if the current signal plays out similarly, Bitcoin could fall as low as $40,000 – a potential 64% drop from current levels. However, not all analysts share this bearish outlook. Fellow crypto analyst CryptoGoos interpreted Bitcoin’s quarterly close as bullish. He disputed comparisons with the 2021 double-top pattern and suggested that market structure remains strong. BTC Looking Ready For New High? Despite the bearish TD Sequential sell-signal, several analysts remain confident that a new all-time high (ATH) is on the horizon. Analyst Jelle pointed out that BTC has broken out and successfully re-tested a 3-day bullish pennant, making it look “ripe for liftoff.” In another post, Jelle noted that if BTC decisively breaks above $110,000, its next target could be $130,000. For reference, BTC’s current ATH is $111,814, recorded on May 22. Meanwhile, Merlijn The Trader highlighted a bullish technical setup on BTC’s daily chart. He pointed to a breakout from a falling wedge, followed by the formation of a bull flag – two strong continuation patterns. He stated: Two of the strongest continuation patterns back to back. $140K is not hopium. It’s the projection. Strong hands are positioning now. Bitcoin doesn’t wait. The breakout is inevitable. Additionally, Bitcoin’s weekly RSI continues to move toward the upper trendline – a pattern that has historically coincided with BTC reaching new highs.

2025-07-03T07:00:00,"88% of Bitcoin’s Bull Run Is Over: Here’s What Comes Next","Bitcoin is still in a bull market but moving more slowly now. This cycle had the longest post-halving reaccumulation phase yet. Upside to $130K–$150K is possible, but risk of correction grows. Bitcoin’s bull run is still alive, but it’s taking a slower and more deliberate path this time around, according to a market update from analyst Rekt Capital, where it was explained how Bitcoin moves in clear cycles, with periods of strong rallies, quiet consolidations, and occasional pullbacks before it finally reaches a peak. Interestingly, this current cycle saw one of the longest re-accumulation periods ever after the halving event, lasting nearly eight months. The longer than expected consolidation gave the Bitcoin market time to cool off after a period of rapid gains, bringing prices back in line with long-term trends. While Bitcoin did eventually climb to new highs, the move was much slower compared to past cycles. Looking at the bigger picture, the analyst said that the risk of a market drop from current Bitcoin prices is starting to outweigh the remaining upside.

While many are unsure what it means, popular crypto trader CryptoBusy thinks this bill could help Bitcoin and the whole crypto market in ways most people don’t expect. Here’s how this bill will be bullish for bitcoin & the entire crypto market. More Money, More Bitcoin In a recent tweet post , CryptoBusy points out that the bill’s massive $4.5 trillion tax cuts would leave people and companies with more money in their pockets. When there’s extra cash floating around, some of it usually ends up in hard assets like Bitcoin, especially when people worry about inflation or a weaker dollar. CryptoBusy further highlights that the bill doesn’t just cut taxes, it also makes it easier for companies to spend and invest by giving them 100% bonus depreciation and bigger write-offs for research. Some companies might decide to put part of that cash into Bitcoin, just like MicroStrategy did when it made headlines by holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Big Debt Makes Bitcoin Look Safer Meanwhile, one thing CryptoBusy warns about is that this bill would add about $3.3 trillion to America’s debt over the next decade. More debt often means more people looking for safer, non-government money, and that’s where Bitcoin steps in. For many, Bitcoin will act as a safer haven against a weaker dollar. Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Approach On top of all this, Trump has shown a friendlier tone toward crypto than many expected. Less regulation and clearer rules could make big companies feel safer adding Bitcoin to their books. Has the Bill Passed Yet? Right now, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is still just a proposal; it hasn’t passed yet. His team is trying hard to get it through Congress, but it’s hitting roadblocks. After one round of voting on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson met with a few Republicans to save the bill. So far, four Republicans have voted against it, including Andrew Clyde, Victoria Sparta, and Keith Self, which is a big problem. To pass the bill, Republicans need a simple majority. If the bill passes, it could give Bitcoin an even bigger boost. Right now, Bitcoin has already jumped 3% and is trading close to its all-time high.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-could-push-bitcoin-even-higher-if-passed/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T06:49:11,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Pullback to $90K Before Fed-Backed Stablecoins Trigger Next Rally","Bitcoin could dip to $90,000 before climbing to new highs, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who sees a brief correction ahead of a fresh rally powered by US bank-issued stablecoins. In a Thursday blog post , Hayes outlined a scenario where central bank policy and Wall Street incentives converge to push trillions of dollars into digital assets. Arthur Hayes argues that the market has not yet priced in the transformative impact of fully regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins issued by too-big-to-fail banks like JPMorgan. These coins, he suggests, will not just rival existing players such as Tether or Circle’s USDC, but will become critical tools for absorbing bank reserves and retail deposits now stranded in low-yield accounts. ""Quid Pro Stablecoin"" is a discussion on how US banks adopting stablecoins can provide $6.8 trillion of buying power for The BBC's shitty treasuries. https://t.co/QHqgZAPv0J pic.twitter.com/pcejYZ8Urx — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 3, 2025 Stablecoins Could Fuel Next Rally, But Hayes Warns of Short-Term Dip Hayes argues that the launch of such stablecoins would effectively function as a new form of liquidity injection, similar in impact to quantitative easing, without requiring formal Fed action. By enabling banks to funnel retail money into short-term Treasury bills without triggering capital rule penalties, these tokens would unlock a new wave of liquidity for risk assets like Bitcoin and tech stocks. But before that happens, Hayes sees a period of volatility. Citing historical cycles and market sentiment, he predicts that Bitcoin may fall to $90,000 as speculators take profits and traders wait for clearer signals from the Federal Reserve. Still, he remains bullish over the longer term, noting that once Wall Street moves in with tokenized dollars, capital flows will accelerate. With GENIUS Act Passed, Hayes Sees Stablecoins Giving Banks a Market Edge The forecast comes as stablecoins return to the spotlight, with US lawmakers advancing bipartisan proposals that could give federal approval to banks issuing tokenized dollars. Last month, the US Senate passed the long-anticipated GENIUS Act with broad bipartisan backing, marking the most comprehensive crypto legislation to date. Approved by a 68–30 vote, it represents the Senate’s first move toward a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing segments in the digital asset space. Hayes believes that this regulatory direction hands legacy banks a strategic edge. Not only do they already have massive retail networks and regulatory compliance structures, they also have direct access to the Federal Reserve. This makes it easier for them to profit from turning deposits into short-term Treasuries through stablecoin issuance. He estimates that if banks shift even part of their $17t in deposits into stablecoin products, it could create $6.8t in new demand for US government debt. Combined with changes in how the Fed pays interest on reserves, that shift could flood markets with fresh liquidity, fuelling asset inflation across crypto and equities alike. Until then, Hayes sees the coming dip as a buying opportunity. He believes that once USD-backed stablecoins from major banks enter the market, they will unlock a wave of liquidity that could send Bitcoin and other risk assets sharply higher. In his view, the arrival of these tokens will mark the start of a new phase in the market cycle.

He believes people will be able to get car loans, home loans, and even borrow money from each other using these platforms. He sees them becoming full financial centers soon. Ripple and Uphold Deal Could Financial Game Deaton also pointed out the speculation that Ripple might buy Uphold. If that happens, he believes Uphold will also become a major player in this new financial system. Ripple, already a leader in digital payments, could get a major boost with this deal, allowing it to serve more users and offer more financial tools. Why Traditional Banks Are Falling Behind According to Deaton, banks that don’t innovate or adopt modern technology will not survive. With the rise of DeFi ( Decentralized Finance ), people now expect faster services and better access to their money. They also want the chance to earn higher returns and gain more control over their finances. Deaton says this is why many younger people are already turning away from big banks in favor of crypto platforms. [post_titles_links postid=”477959″] Coinbase and Robinhood Are the Future Deaton says Coinbase and Robinhood are no longer just apps for trading. He sees them becoming strong financial companies. More people are using these platforms every day, and he believes they will only get bigger as crypto grows. Recently, Cathie Wood said Bitcoin holders may soon use Coinbase to get mortgages by using their crypto as collateral. John Deaton agrees with Cathie Wood, calling Coinbase a top stock to own, just like big names such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Referring to these changes, he said Coinbase isn’t just a crypto app anymore, as it’s becoming a major player in traditional finance. The COIN stock surged, nearly 100% in two months, which shows that more people are buying into this story. He also says the change is already happening. The world of money is shifting. People who act early could see the biggest rewards.

Gen Z and Millennials are drawn to crypto platforms by the promise of higher returns, access to tokenized stocks, and Web3 tools offering more control and flexibility. They seek faster services and better access to their money, reflecting a desire for a more open and technologically advanced financial system that traditional banks often lack. How can platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood offer car loans or home mortgages using crypto? Platforms like Coinbase are already offering crypto-backed loans, allowing users to borrow USDC using Bitcoin as collateral without selling it. While not yet directly offering car or home mortgages, the move towards tokenized assets and the ability to use crypto as collateral for traditional loans is paving the way for such services in the future. Why are traditional banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America falling behind in attracting younger generations? Traditional banks are falling behind because they often lack the innovation and modern technology that younger generations expect. They struggle to offer faster services, higher returns, and the level of control and transparency that DeFi and crypto platforms provide. Their outdated systems and slower adoption of new tech deter digitally native users.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-deaton-says-ripple-coinbase-will-replace-big-banks/,"EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BTC|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Solana’s SOL was one of the best performers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, surpassing the $150 psychological mark in the process. Backed by strong fundamentals, SOL could be on the verge of a breakout as analysts expect a volatile July. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF hits $33m in trading volume on debut day The major driver behind SOL’s recent rally is the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF. The ETF began trading on Wednesday and recorded one of the best debut days for exchange-traded funds.

The chart is efficient, indicating that the bears have grabbed liquidity to the downside. Despite the bearish trend on the higher timeframe, SOL is showing signs of extending its recovery after adding nearly 4% to its value in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 60 shows that SOL is no longer facing selling pressure, with buyers increasingly taking control of the market. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) lines are also within the positive territory, suggesting a bullish bias. SOL could be targeting the Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $162 over the next few hours or so. If the rally continues, SOL could retest the next major resistance level at $174, its highest price since May 29. SOL is currently hovering around the $150 zone, with the support line suggesting that the current levels could be a base. If SOL could embark on a strong rally, key resistance levels to watch out for in the medium term include $220 and $300. However, if the bearish trend returns, SOL could retest the weekend low of $137 once again. An extended bearish run would see SOL dip further to the $125 support level, with the next key support around $99.

Key Takeaways: The first US Solana staking ETF launched with $12 million in inflows and $33 million in volume. Opening day trading volumes topped earlier Solana and XRP futures ETFs. REX-Osprey’s creative fund structure overcame SEC hurdles, avoiding the standard spot ETF approval process. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, trading under the ticker SSK, launched Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The fund offers investors exposure to Solana (SOL) while providing staking yields, positioning it as the first ETF in the U.S. to combine spot Solana exposure with staking rewards. Solana Staking ETF Outpaces Futures Funds According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the ETF’s opening day volumes surpassed those seen by earlier Solana and XRP futures ETFs. However, they fell short of the explosive debuts of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, which together recorded $4.6 billion in shares traded on their first day in January 2024. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart noted the ETF saw $8 million in trading volume within its first 20 minutes, describing it as a “healthy start to trading.” $SSK ended day with $33m in volume.

The ETF’s launch was not without hurdles. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initially raised objections in late May, questioning whether the product qualified as an “investment company” under federal securities laws. REX-Osprey navigated these challenges by structuring the fund to invest at least 40% of its assets in other exchange-traded products, many of which are listed outside the United States. The regulatory workaround allowed the fund to avoid the traditional 19b-4 filing process typically required for spot crypto ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, previously described the strategy as a “regulatory end-around,” a view shared by analysts who have debated whether the fund should be classified as a conventional spot Solana ETF. yes, altho to be fair this is some 400-level ETF technical nerd-ery — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 1, 2025 Strong Start Sparks Hopes for Spot Solana ETF Approval The promising debut has fueled speculation about the potential approval of true spot Solana ETFs. Both Seyffart and Balchunas recently estimated a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot Solana ETFs before the year ends. Seyffart added that a wave of new ETFs, including products tied to XRP and Litecoin, could arrive in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Solana’s price saw muted movement, gaining 3.6% over the past 24 hours and trading around $153 at press time. Despite the ETF launch, SOL remains down nearly 48% from its highs earlier this year. However, Solana CME futures showed rising institutional appetite, with open interest reaching $167 million after the ETF’s debut, according to data from SolanaFloor. As reported, digital asset investment funds pulled in $2.7 billion last week, capping an 11-week streak of inflows that now totals $16.9 billion. The bulk of the inflows came from the United States, accounting for $2.65 billion. Switzerland and Germany recorded modest additions of $23 million and $19.8 million, respectively, while Canada, Hong Kong, and Brazil posted small outflows. Bitcoin remained the primary magnet for capital, drawing $2.2 billion last week, a commanding 83% of total inflows, while short-Bitcoin products extended their year-to-date outflows to $12 million.

2025-07-03T06:00:52,"Whales Are Quietly Repositioning, Here’s What Bitcoin’s $107K Price Isn’t Telling You","Bitcoin continues to show little upward momentum as it trades below the $110,000 mark. As of the time of writing, the asset is priced at $108,071 after recording a modest 2% gain in the past 24 hours. Despite nearing its all-time high in recent weeks, Bitcoin appears to be caught in a holding pattern as institutional rebalancing and on-chain dynamics take center stage. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi has drawn attention to unusual on-chain activity during the final days of June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Institutional Rebalancing and Local Exhaustion Signals In a post titled “Whale Profit-Taking and Loss Realizations: Was Late June a Local Pivot Point?” the analyst noted conflicting behaviors among Bitcoin whales. A notable $641 million in realized profits was recorded alongside more than $1.24 billion in realized losses, a combination that suggests a potential inflection point in market sentiment. Mevsimi emphasized that this mixed realization trend came at the close of the second quarter, a period often associated with institutional portfolio adjustments. “Structurally, late June is also the end of H1, when ETFs and institutional funds often rebalance portfolios,” he wrote. Mevsimi added: “That timing adds weight: this wasn’t just noise — it may have been a deliberate repositioning.” Notably, these large movements in realized profit and loss did not extend into early July, which may imply either a temporary stabilization or the beginning of a new market phase. The report also detailed divergent whale behavior. Newer whales, likely short-term participants entering in Q2, showed signs of capitulation, realizing both profits and significant losses. In contrast, older whales locked in $91 million in profits with negligible losses. This division may indicate a shift in control, with experienced holders offloading risk while short-term players exited amid market uncertainty. According to Mevsimi, the convergence of these trends hints at a local exhaustion phase rather than a continued rally. Bitcoin LTH Unrealized Profits and Historical Context In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant’s Darkfost explored the unrealized profit profile of Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs), revealing a downward trend despite BTC’s proximity to record highs. Citing the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, Darkfost noted that average unrealized profits have fallen to around 220%. This is well below the peaks recorded during market tops in March and December 2024, which reached 300% and 350%, respectively. “Although these profits may seem substantial, we’re still far from the levels observed during the tops of this cycle,” Darkfost stated. The realized price for LTHs now stands at approximately $39,000, suggesting a strong cushion but also reinforcing that speculative excess has yet to return in full force. Related Reading: Bitwise Just Sounded The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Explode Soon The analyst added that a return to top-cycle unrealized profit levels would require BTC to rise to around $140,000, a target echoed by several bullish forecasts.

2025-07-03T06:00:33,"Ripple Follows Circle’s Lead and Applies for US Banking License","Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. These applications aim to bring Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin under dual state and federal oversight to align with new legislation like the GENIUS Act. This follows a similar move by Circle, the issuer of USDC, which also applied for OCC approval. Meanwhile, billionaire Peter Thiel is backing a new startup- and crypto-focused bank called Erebor, which will fill the gap left by Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. In Europe, Belgium’s KBC Bank is set to offer crypto investments via its Bolero platform. Ripple Makes Power Play in US Banking Ripple Labs is seeking a US banking license to deepen its ties with traditional finance and comply with emerging stablecoin regulations. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that Ripple formally applied for a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, it would bring Ripple under both federal and state regulatory oversight. The New York Department of Financial Services already supervises Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin, and Garlinghouse said that this added federal oversight will set a new standard of trust in the stablecoin industry. This development happened after a similar application by Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Just days earlier, Circle applied to the OCC to form a national trust bank responsible for managing its stablecoin reserves. Both moves come on the heels of the US Senate passing the GENIUS Act, which is legislation that outlines regulatory requirements for stablecoin issuers and designates the OCC as the key federal watchdog for larger players in the space. Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said that the company is aligning itself with the changing regulatory landscape around dollar-pegged payment stablecoins. In addition to its OCC application, Ripple also applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. This would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed. Garlinghouse described this feature as a critical safeguard to reinforce long-term trust in the stablecoin. The application was made via Standard Custody, a crypto custody firm that Ripple acquired in early 2024. Garlinghouse explained that the tide is turning in Washington, with Congress advancing clearer crypto regulations and traditional banks showing renewed interest in engaging with digital asset firms. This is in stark contrast to the restrictive environment of previous years, which was often referred to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” XRP’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Market reaction to Ripple’s banking ambitions has been positive. XRP climbed 2.87% to $2.24. The rally began shortly after Garlinghouse’s announcement and peaked at $2.27 before slightly retreating. Peter Thiel Backs New Bank for Startups and Crypto Meanwhile, a group of billionaires, including PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, is reportedly working on launching a new financial institution named Erebor to fill the void left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March of 2023. According to the Financial Times , Erebor will focus on serving startups and cryptocurrency companies, and has already applied for a US bank charter to operate as a fully licensed bank . Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, is said to be among the early investors in the new bank. Other backers reportedly include Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense contractor Anduril, and Joe Lonsdale, founder of investment firm 8VC. Thiel is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem, and he is also known for backing Bullish, a crypto exchange that recently filed for an initial public offering in the United States. Erebor’s strategy seems to be centered on providing banking services and loans to early-stage startups and other high-risk ventures that have found it difficult to access capital in the wake of tighter financial regulations. The initiative is also seen as an attempt to reestablish a specialized financial services institution that mirrors the role Silicon Valley Bank once played in the innovation economy. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 sent shockwaves through the banking and crypto industries. It was shut down by California’s financial regulator after rapidly rising interest rates devalued its bond holdings. The bank failed when a flood of clients tried to withdraw funds, triggering a liquidity crisis. At the time, the bank served around half of all venture capital-backed tech and life sciences firms in the country. Bank failures in the year 2023 (Source: FDIC ) The demise of Silicon Valley Bank also contributed to a wider crisis that saw the downfall of other institutions like Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. The crypto sector was particularly hard-hit, with investment funds losing roughly 10% of their assets under management in a single week. According to Harvard Business Review, the bank's failure tightened credit access for venture-backed startups, which created an urgent need for a replacement institution. Although Silicon Valley Bank still operates as a division of First Citizens Bank after its acquisition in March of 2023, its collapse shed some light on the vulnerabilities in the venture capital and digital asset banking landscape. Erebor now plans to fill that gap. KBC Bank to Offer Crypto Investments KBC Bank, one of Belgium’s largest financial institutions, is preparing to allow its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies through its online investment platform Bolero. The bank confirmed that Bolero will provide access to Bitcoin and Ethereum investments later this year. A spokesperson for KBC stated that the bank is currently undergoing an analysis to become recognized as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP), with the aim of launching the service by autumn. The initiative is expected to give private investors the opportunity to invest directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum in a secure and regulated environment, with an emphasis on education and compliance. If the rollout proceeds as planned, KBC will become the first major Belgian bank to offer crypto investment services to retail clients. Currently, most Belgian investors rely on international exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, or on fintech platforms like Revolut and N26 to access crypto markets. KBC’s move forms part of the trend among European banks that are increasingly exploring crypto investment and custody solutions. In Germany, both Deutsche Bank and Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe are reportedly preparing to introduce crypto offerings in the near future. Meanwhile, Spain’s BBVA has been advising its high-net-worth clients to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This wave of crypto adoption by banks was anticipated by industry leaders. In April, executives from major crypto firms Messari and Sygnum predicted that banks would start entering the space more aggressively in the second half of 2025, encouraged by a more favorable global regulatory landscape. Supporting this trend, Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the payments giant has been in discussions with several banks interested in experimenting with stablecoins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9786/ripple-follows-circle-s-lead-and-applies-for-us-banking-license,"FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T05:42:06,"IMF Rejects Pakistan’s Energy Plan for Bitcoin Mining – What Does This Mean for Its Crypto Ambitions?","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s proposal to offer subsidised electricity tariffs for crypto mining operations. Per local reports, the government is still engaged with international institutions to refine the plan. “As of now, the IMF has not agreed,” said Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan, during a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power. According to a report by Profit , the IMF has warned that the plan could add strain to the power sector. Dr Irfan told the committee that the agency is concerned about market distortions over Pakistan’s subsidised energy rates proposal. IMF Flags Several Concerns Against Pakistan’s Power Proposal for Bitcoin Mining Last month, the IMF questioned Pakistan’s power push for Bitcoin mining, raising concerns over legal issues and power strain. The international financial body laid out several concerns, including the legality of crypto mining in Pakistan and the additional strain on the already burdened power grid. The @IMFNews is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. #IMF #Bitcoin https://t.co/X9YHqz9qTO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 1, 2025 Further, the fund warned about resource distribution and knock-on effects on power tariffs. The IMF noted that Pakistan did not consult the fund ahead of the announcement. In May, Pakistan announced that it will allocate 2,000MW to power crypto mining and data centres, in a move to attract foreign investment. The initiative is driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance. Pakistan in Talks With International Institutions Dr Irfan confirmed that the government is still in talks to redefine its power subsidiary plan after the IMF has rejected the proposal. The committee further discussed technological solutions aimed at combating electricity theft. They also discussed the government’s recent agreement with scheduled banks to reduce the circular debt stock. Senator Shibli Faraz criticised that banks were “forced at gunpoint” to offer the loans. The committee has directed the Power Division to submit comprehensive answers to various issues at the next meeting.

2025-07-03T05:33:14,"Solana’s first spot staking ETF launched with $33 million in trading volume","The first spot Solana staking exchange-traded fund, the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF, which debuted on Wednesday, drew strong investor interest. According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund ended its first trading day with around $33 million in volume. Another Bloomberg analyst, James Seyffart, reported that the ETF had about $8 million in trading volume in the first 20 minutes of its launch. While the trading volume of the ETF was impressive, it still fell short of the levels seen during the debut of Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Balchunas commented : SSK ended the day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch), but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. Eric Balchunas The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF reached about $1 million in AUM on Wednesday The Solana staking ETF also wrapped up its debut day with about $1 million worth of assets under management. Balchunas believes the ETF could soon manage $10 million in assets on its second trading day, given its current trading volume. The ETF differs quite from others, which are still awaiting the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval. The commission registered the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940—an investor-focused framework with stricter regulations. That means the fund must hold its assets with a qualified and trusted custodian. The ETF’s founders selected Anchorage Digital for the role, seeing that it’s the sole federally regulated crypto bank authorized to handle both custody and staking of digital assets. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley commented on the ETF’s launch, describing staking as the next evolution in the crypto ETF space and calling the fund’s debut a significant step toward offering institutions secure and regulated crypto access. The SEC announced that Grayscale’s ETF conversion plans are still under review On Tuesday, Grayscale also earned the SEC’s approval to change its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an ETF. The fund includes the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap: Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, and Cardano’s ADA. Arbitrage traders once profited by exploiting gaps in market prices and NAV in Grayscale’s crypto trusts, mostly fueled by restricted redemptions and mandatory lock-up periods. However, with the firm moving to convert its private trusts into ETFs, those opportunities have significantly narrowed. Grayscale even explained that moving forward, it wants the values of the shares to reflect the value of the digital assets held by the fund. The SEC, however, is still reviewing the firm’s ETF conversion plans. On Wednesday, in a letter to the New York Stock Exchange, the agency’s deputy secretary announced that the commission would reexamine the approval for Grayscale’s ETF conversion, signaling continued hesitation to loosen its approach to crypto ETFs. In June 2022, the firm also faced trouble when it tried to convert the BTC Trust into an ETF. It filed a petition in court after the agency rejected its application. The legal battle stretched over a year until August 2023, when a US judge ruled that the SEC’s rejection of the conversion was “arbitrary and capricious,” ultimately granting Grayscale’s petition. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust operates as an ETF with a 1.5% expense ratio—the highest among Bitcoin ETFs—and remains the top-earning BTC investment product.
