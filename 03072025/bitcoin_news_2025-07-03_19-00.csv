In a new statement, the CMS says that an investigation discovered fraudulent Medicare.gov accounts were opened using personal data from its system, impacting 103,000 people. “On May 2, CMS’ 1-800-MEDICARE call center began receiving inquiries from beneficiaries who received letters confirming the creation of Medicare.gov accounts they did not initiate. CMS promptly launched an investigation and discovered that malicious actors had fraudulently created new accounts between 2023 and 2025 using valid beneficiary information, including Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers (MBI), coverage start date, last name, date of birth and zip code.” The fraudsters may have stolen other personal information as well, including provider information, mailing address, dates of service, diagnosis codes, services received and plan premium details. CMS is sending letters to those whose information was stolen, alerting them that it will send them a new Medicare card with a new Medicare number in the coming weeks. The federal agency says it has also deactivated all fraudulently created Medicare.gov accounts and disabled the ability to create new Medicare.gov accounts from foreign IP addresses. Victims are advised to obtain free annual credit reports through www.annualcreditreport.com and to file reports with local law enforcement and the Federal Trade Commission if any identity theft incidents occur. CMS says it has yet to receive any reports of identity fraud or misuse of the information resulting from the cyberattack.

Senator Cynthia Lummis is leading the charge to fix what she calls “unfair” and “outdated” tax rules that are hurting innovation and everyday users. So, what’s inside this bill? No More Taxes on Small Crypto Payments One of the biggest highlights of Senator Lummis’s bill is a special $300 rule. Under this, small crypto transactions like buying lunch or coffee won’t trigger tax reports. That means people can use digital assets like real money without worrying about tax trouble. There’s a limit, though: the total tax-free gains per year must stay under $5,000. Starting in 2026, the $300 amount will also adjust for inflation. This rule could finally make crypto spending as easy as using a debit card. The tax code shouldn't punish Americans for using new technology. My bill fixes the broken rules around bitcoin and digital assets. MORE https://t.co/1Wo6zjY8wY — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) July 3, 2025 Fairer Rules for Miners and Stakers The bill also wants to help crypto miners and stakers, people who help run blockchains and earn tokens in return. Right now, miners and stakers often have to pay taxes the moment they receive tokens, even if they don’t sell them. Meanwhile, with this new bill, taxes will only be due when the coins are sold or used. This helps avoid double taxes and makes it easier for people and companies to plan without worrying about sudden tax bills. Making Crypto Lending and Giving Easier The bill also supports crypto lending. It extends the same tax rules used for stock lending to digital assets. So, lending your crypto temporarily won’t count as a sale and won’t trigger taxes. And if someone wants to donate crypto to charity, the process becomes easier, too. They won’t need a costly appraisal for commonly traded assets, which could encourage more people to give. Boosting Innovation, Not Burdening It Lummis says this plan could bring in about $600 million in tax revenue over the next ten years. But more importantly, she argues it will protect innovation in America. She wants people and businesses to build the future here, not overseas, because the tax code makes it easy to participate safely. Even though she couldn’t attach the bill to Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Lummis believes this crypto proposal can still pass.

2025-07-03T16:43:25,"BONK Leads Memecoin Amid Crypto Rally While the Token Approaches 1M Holder Milestone","As bitcoin (BTC) hovers near a fresh all-time high, the Solana-based memecoin, BONK (BONK), is leading the major altcoin rally. The surge coincides with renewed optimism in risk assets following bitcoin's recovery above $110,000, which has triggered widespread gains across established cryptocurrencies. BONK's momentum appears sustainable as numerous crypto analysts express bullish sentiment, citing significant upside potential remaining. Adding to BONK's bullish case, the BONK foundation's token launchpad, LetsBONK.fun, recently surpassed competitor Pump.fun in daily volume with a 126% increase. This development benefits BONK holders as 50% of the platform's revenue is allocated to buying and burning BONK tokens, creating additional positive price pressure in a market already anticipating the upcoming 1 trillion token burn when the project reaches 1 million holders. Meanwhile, Tuttle Capital Management confirmed July 16 as the earliest possible launch date for its suite of leveraged crypto ETFs, including a 2× BONK ETF, fueling bullish sentiment. Technical analysis highlights The BONK-USD pair experienced increased buying pressure during the last 24 hours, from July 2, 16:00 UTC, to July 3, 15:00 UTC. It surged from $0.0000147 to a peak of $0.0000175, representing a 10.4% range, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. A significant volume spike to 2.9 trillion at midnight on July 3 established strong support at the $0.0000157 level, while high-volume buying at the $0.0000168 level during the 05:00 UTC hour propelled prices higher despite late session profit-taking, the model showed. However, during the last 60 minutes from July 3 at 14:50 to 15:49 UTC, BONK-USD experienced significant volatility, dropping from $0.00001666 to a low of $0.00001619 before recovering to $0.00001624. A notable volume spike of 86.9 trillion at 15:35 coincided with the price bottoming at $0.00001619, establishing a key support level. The subsequent recovery formed an ascending trendline with increasing volumes, particularly at 15:49, where 22.5 trillion in volume pushed prices up by 2.7% from the session low, according to the model.

2025-07-03T16:40:50,"Bitcoin’s Crucial Edge: Arthur Hayes Unveils Urgent Warnings on U.S. Bonds and Stablecoin Shifts","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Crucial Edge: Arthur Hayes Unveils Urgent Warnings on U.S. Bonds and Stablecoin Shifts In the ever-evolving world of finance, where traditional wisdom often clashes with innovative insights, one voice consistently cuts through the noise: Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the pioneering cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX. Known for his provocative yet prescient analyses, Hayes recently dropped a bombshell that has investors and market watchers buzzing. His core message? It’s time to rethink your portfolio, particularly your exposure to U.S. bonds . This isn’t just another market prediction; it’s a fundamental re-evaluation of where true value and liquidity reside in the global financial system, with significant implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Arthur Hayes’ Bold Stance: Why Shun U.S. Bonds for Bitcoin? For decades, U.S. government bonds have been the bedrock of conservative investment portfolios. They are widely lauded by financial advisors as a safe haven, a low-risk asset offering stability and predictable returns. Yet, Arthur Hayes argues that this conventional wisdom is now fundamentally flawed. In his latest Substack post, Hayes unequivocally states that buying U.S. government bonds today is a mistake, an investment choice that will likely leave you lagging in the long run. Why such a stark warning against what many consider the safest asset class? Hayes’ perspective is rooted in a deep understanding of macroeconomic forces and the changing nature of money. He contends that the perceived safety of bonds is illusory in an environment where inflation can erode purchasing power and where other asset classes offer vastly superior growth potential. Instead, he advocates for a strategic pivot towards more dynamic assets. Opportunity Cost: By tying up capital in low-yield bonds, investors miss out on significant upside potential elsewhere. Inflationary Pressures: While bonds offer fixed returns, the real value of those returns diminishes with persistent inflation, effectively making them a losing proposition over time. Shifting Market Dynamics: The global financial landscape is undergoing a monumental transformation, where traditional risk-reward profiles are being redefined. Hayes points specifically to Bitcoin (BTC) and the Nasdaq as far more attractive alternatives. These assets, he argues, possess the inherent characteristics necessary to not only preserve but significantly grow wealth in the current economic climate. The agility, innovation, and disruptive potential embedded within these markets offer a stark contrast to the static nature of government debt. Decoding Stablecoin Liquidity : A New Financial Weapon? Beyond his warnings on bonds, Arthur Hayes delves into the intriguing, and somewhat unsettling, role of stablecoins in the modern financial ecosystem. While many view stablecoins like USDC or USDT primarily as tools for fast, borderless payments or efficient cryptocurrency trading, Hayes presents a far more strategic and less altruistic narrative. He posits that the U.S. government’s growing support for stablecoins isn’t driven by a desire to foster fintech innovation or empower companies like Circle. Instead, Hayes asserts that stablecoins are being weaponized. Their true purpose, in his view, is to empower large traditional banks , providing them with an unprecedented mechanism to manage and deploy liquidity. This perspective challenges the popular narrative, suggesting a deeper, more calculated agenda at play. His core argument revolves around the concept of a ‘liquidity weapon.’ Stablecoins, backed by U.S. dollars and typically held in bank accounts or short-term U.S. Treasuries, essentially act as a conduit. They allow major financial institutions to purchase massive amounts of government debt without needing the Federal Reserve (Fed) to engage in quantitative easing (QE). In essence, stablecoins provide a bypass, enabling a continuous flow of capital into government coffers, independent of the Fed’s direct market interventions. This mechanism creates a self-sustaining loop where the demand for U.S. debt can be met through alternative channels, maintaining market stability and funding government expenditure even when the Fed is not actively buying bonds. This subtle yet powerful shift in liquidity management is what Hayes believes is the true story behind the institutional embrace of stablecoins. The Role of Traditional Banks in the Stablecoin Narrative If stablecoins are indeed a ‘liquidity weapon,’ then traditional banks are the primary beneficiaries and orchestrators of this new financial strategy. Hayes emphasizes that the narrative around stablecoins is often misdirected, focusing too much on the fintech companies that issue them and not enough on the powerful entities pulling the strings behind the scenes. These large banks, with their deep ties to government and their immense financial infrastructure, are uniquely positioned to leverage stablecoins for their strategic advantage. Consider the implications: when stablecoins are minted, their reserves are typically held in commercial banks. These reserves, in turn, can be invested in short-term U.S. government debt. This creates a direct, efficient, and discreet channel for banks to facilitate the purchase of government obligations. This process effectively allows for a form of ‘shadow QE’ where liquidity is injected into the bond market without the overt, public operations of the Federal Reserve. Hayes’ analysis suggests that the market is already awash in liquidity, even if the Fed hasn’t officially restarted quantitative easing. This liquidity isn’t necessarily flowing from traditional central bank operations but is rather being channeled through the burgeoning stablecoin ecosystem, primarily managed and controlled by major banks. This means that while the public narrative might focus on inflation and interest rate hikes, the underlying plumbing of the financial system is adapting in ways that ensure continued demand for government debt. Therefore, Hayes advises investors to shift their focus. Instead of obsessing over the innovations of Circle or other fintechs in the stablecoin space, he urges a closer look at the U.S. government and the major banks. These are, in his view, the true architects and drivers of the stablecoin narrative, shaping its utility to serve their own financial and geopolitical objectives. Why Bitcoin Remains a Top Investment Choice Amidst Shifting Tides In light of these revelations about U.S. bonds and stablecoin mechanics, Arthur Hayes consistently circles back to Bitcoin as a premier investment. His advocacy for BTC is not merely speculative; it’s deeply rooted in its fundamental properties as a decentralized, scarce, and censorship-resistant asset. In a world where traditional financial instruments are increasingly subject to manipulation or lose their real value due to inflation and strategic government actions, Bitcoin stands out as a robust alternative. Bitcoin’s value proposition is amplified when viewed through the lens of Hayes’ warnings. If U.S. bonds are a trap and stablecoins are a tool for centralizing financial power within traditional institutions, then Bitcoin offers a genuine escape route. It represents a hedge against inflation, a store of value independent of government control, and a potential for significant appreciation driven by its fixed supply and growing adoption. The benefits of investing in Bitcoin, as highlighted by Hayes, include: Superior Upside Potential: Compared to the meager returns of bonds, Bitcoin offers parabolic growth potential driven by network effects and increasing institutional interest. Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies or stablecoins, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single entity, making it resilient to political or economic manipulation. Scarcity: With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity provides a natural defense against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin offers a permissionless financial system accessible to anyone with an internet connection, fostering true financial inclusion. Hayes’ consistent recommendation for Bitcoin alongside the Nasdaq reflects a broader trend of smart money flowing into innovative, high-growth sectors that are poised to outperform traditional, yield-suppressed assets. It’s a call to action for investors to adapt to the new realities of global finance, where digital assets are no longer fringe but central to future wealth creation. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights from Arthur Hayes Arthur Hayes’ recent insights offer a critical roadmap for investors seeking to navigate the complex currents of the global economy. His warnings against U.S. bonds and his unique perspective on stablecoin liquidity are not just academic theories; they are actionable intelligence for anyone looking to protect and grow their wealth. The key takeaways from his analysis are clear: Re-evaluate Traditional Advice: Don’t blindly follow conventional investment wisdom, especially concerning low-yield assets like U.S. bonds. Embrace Disruptive Assets: Allocate capital to high-growth, innovative assets like Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, which offer substantial upside potential. Understand the True Stablecoin Narrative: Look beyond the surface-level benefits of stablecoins and recognize their strategic role in empowering traditional banks and facilitating government debt management. Focus on the Big Players: Pay closer attention to the actions and strategies of governments and major banks, as they are the true architects of financial policy and liquidity. In a financial landscape increasingly shaped by digital innovation and shifting power dynamics, Hayes’ insights serve as a powerful reminder that vigilance and adaptability are paramount. The financial world is not static; it’s a dynamic arena where understanding the underlying mechanics and the true motivations of key players can make all the difference. By heeding these warnings and adjusting investment strategies accordingly, individuals can position themselves to thrive in the emerging financial paradigm. Arthur Hayes’ latest pronouncements serve as a powerful wake-up call, urging investors to challenge long-held beliefs and embrace a more forward-thinking approach to wealth management. His insights into the pitfalls of U.S. bonds and the strategic deployment of stablecoin liquidity by traditional banks underscore a fundamental shift in the global financial architecture. For those brave enough to look beyond conventional wisdom, the path forward is clear: diversify into resilient, high-growth assets like Bitcoin, and remain acutely aware of the hidden currents driving market liquidity. The future of finance is here, and it demands a new kind of investment strategy.

2025-07-03T16:40:31,"Bitcoin’s Ascendant Trend: CryptoQuant Analysis Points to a Powerful BTC Price Outlook","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Ascendant Trend: CryptoQuant Analysis Points to a Powerful BTC Price Outlook The cryptocurrency market is an ever-evolving landscape, often leaving investors searching for clarity amidst the volatility. However, recent insights from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant offer a compelling narrative, suggesting a significant shift in the Bitcoin trend that could redefine expectations for the coming months. If you’ve been wondering about Bitcoin’s next move, the signals are increasingly pointing towards sustained upward momentum. Unpacking the Latest CryptoQuant Analysis: What’s Driving the Bitcoin Trend? According to CryptoQuant’s astute on-chain analyst, Crypto Dan, Bitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing a profound directional shift since April, moving decidedly towards an upward trajectory. This isn’t just speculative sentiment; it’s rooted in meticulous data analysis, particularly concerning the behavior of major market participants. The core of this optimistic assessment lies in the observed actions of U.S. whales and institutions. CryptoQuant, known for its in-depth on-chain data and proprietary metrics, provides a unique lens through which to view market dynamics. Unlike traditional market analysis that relies solely on price charts, on-chain analysis delves into the blockchain itself, tracking the movement of coins, wallet activities, and transaction volumes. This allows for a more fundamental understanding of supply and demand forces at play. The Diminishing Influence of Bitcoin Whales: A Positive Shift One of the most critical observations highlighted by Crypto Dan is the steady decline in selling pressure originating from U.S. Bitcoin whales and large institutional entities. For a long time, the potential for massive sell-offs by these large holders has been a source of anxiety in the market, often leading to significant price corrections. However, the data now indicates a different story. What does this mean for the market? Essentially, it suggests that these influential players, who hold substantial amounts of BTC, are either choosing to hold onto their assets or are no longer liquidating them at previous rates. This reduction in sell-side pressure removes a major hurdle for price appreciation. When fewer large holders are offloading their Bitcoin, the existing demand has a more pronounced effect on price. Consider the implications: Reduced Supply Overhang: Less BTC being sold by large entities means a tighter supply available on exchanges. Maturity of Holdings: It could indicate that many of these whales have matured in their investment strategies, shifting from short-term trading to long-term holding. Increased Market Stability: Fewer large sell-offs contribute to a more stable market environment, reducing sudden, sharp price drops. Strong Buying Activity: Fueling the Upward Momentum While the reduction in selling pressure is significant, it’s only half the story. Crypto Dan’s CryptoQuant analysis also points to robust and sustained buying activity from these very same U.S. whales and institutions. This dual dynamic – less selling combined with strong buying – paints a powerful bullish picture for Bitcoin. Who are these buyers, and why are they accumulating now? While specific identities remain private, the trend suggests a growing conviction among sophisticated investors about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This could be driven by several factors: Spot ETF Inflows: The approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in the U.S. has opened a new, regulated avenue for institutional capital to flow into Bitcoin. These ETFs have seen consistent inflows, indicating strong demand from traditional finance. Macroeconomic Hedging: In an environment of global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value and a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Post-Halving Dynamics: While the full impact of the recent Bitcoin halving is yet to be realized, institutions may be front-running the anticipated supply shock, accumulating before the reduced new supply fully translates into higher prices. This sustained demand, coupled with dwindling selling pressure, creates a fundamental imbalance that typically leads to price appreciation. It suggests that smart money is actively positioning itself for future gains. Understanding Market Consolidation: A Healthy Phase for the BTC Price Outlook Despite the strong underlying signals, Bitcoin has recently entered what Crypto Dan describes as a market consolidation phase. This might sound concerning to some, but it’s a perfectly normal and often necessary part of a healthy market cycle. After significant upward moves, assets tend to consolidate, allowing the market to ‘catch its breath’ and prevent ‘overheating’. What does consolidation entail? Price Stabilization: Prices tend to trade within a relatively narrow range, neither making significant new highs nor experiencing sharp declines. Volume Reduction: Trading volume often decreases during consolidation as conviction wanes temporarily among short-term traders. Building Support: This phase allows new support levels to be established as weaker hands are shaken out and stronger hands accumulate. Think of it as a pit stop during a long journey. The vehicle (Bitcoin) needs to refuel and check its systems before continuing its upward journey. While a short-term pullback remains a possibility during this phase – as profit-takers exit and short-term traders adjust their positions – it’s generally seen as a cleansing mechanism that strengthens the overall trend rather than negating it. What Does This Mean for the BTC Price Outlook in the Second Half of 2025? Crypto Dan’s long-term perspective remains overwhelmingly positive, particularly for the second half of 2025. This forward-looking stance is critical for investors trying to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. The expectation is that the underlying upward momentum, fueled by the aforementioned factors, will continue to drive Bitcoin’s value higher. Why is H2 2025 a significant period? Post-Halving Effects: Historically, the full bullish impact of a Bitcoin halving event is felt 12-18 months after the event. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, placing the peak of its potential impact squarely in late 2025 or early 2026. Macroeconomic Environment: By 2025, global interest rates may have stabilized or even begun to decline, creating a more favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. Further Institutional Adoption: The continued maturation of the crypto ecosystem, including potential new regulatory frameworks and product offerings, could attract even more institutional capital. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem (e.g., Lightning Network, sidechains) could enhance its utility and scalability, further bolstering its appeal. While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, the confluence of on-chain data, institutional behavior, and historical market cycles provides a robust foundation for this optimistic BTC price outlook . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights based on the current market sentiment and analysis: Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable on-chain analysts like those at CryptoQuant. Understanding the underlying fundamentals is key. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re looking to accumulate Bitcoin, a DCA strategy can help mitigate risk by averaging out your purchase price over time, especially during consolidation phases. Focus on the Long-Term: Short-term pullbacks are natural. For those with a bullish long-term conviction, these can be opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Risk Management: Always invest only what you can afford to lose. The crypto market, while promising, remains inherently volatile. Conclusion: A Resilient and Promising Future for Bitcoin The insights from CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan paint a remarkably positive picture for Bitcoin’s trajectory. The diminishing selling pressure from U.S. whales and institutions, coupled with their robust buying activity, signals a fundamental shift towards an upward Bitcoin trend . While the current market consolidation phase is a healthy and necessary cool-down, it is merely a pause before what is anticipated to be a continued ascent, culminating in a strong BTC price outlook for the second half of 2025. For investors, this period offers a valuable opportunity to understand the underlying forces at play and position themselves for potential future growth. Bitcoin’s resilience and growing institutional acceptance underscore its enduring appeal as a digital asset. As the market matures, the insights from on-chain analysis become increasingly vital, offering a deeper understanding of true supply and demand dynamics beyond mere price action. The journey ahead for Bitcoin appears poised for powerful and exciting developments.

The second major interaction occurred in December 2024, where BTC again tested this level and failed to break through, forming a precise rejection wick at the trendline. These repeated interactions affirm the strength and technical relevance of this resistance. Now, in mid to late 2025, Bitcoin is once again grinding toward this region. While this approach hasn’t yet triggered a breakout, the fact that price has maintained a bullish structure while approaching it suggests potential for a high-stakes breakout, or yet another rejection that could reintroduce range-bound trading. You might also like: Whales who made millions on Solana eye this $0.003333 memecoin that could jump 9000% From a long-term trading perspective, this resistance should be seen as a make-or-break inflection point. If BTC is able to decisively break through and close above the $120,000 level on strong volume, it would represent a structural shift in market behavior and likely initiate a new phase of price discovery. However, if history repeats and the trendline holds once more, the probability of a return to the $73,000 support zone increases substantially. It’s also essential to recognize the time scale of this chart. Since this is a high time frame structure, each candle may take days or even weeks to finalize, meaning short-term moves are not sufficient to confirm a breakout or breakdown. Patience is required until full candle closures validate the next major direction. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin fails to break the $120,000 dynamic resistance, expect consolidation or a pullback toward $73,000. A confirmed breakout above $120,000 would shift the structure entirely and require fresh analysis.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-price-outlook-long-term-120k-trendline-test-could-define-q3/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|SOL","Markets|Bitcoin|Price Analysis|Trading",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T16:28:55,"Franklin Templeton Analysts Warn Of Dangers of Corporate Crypto Surge","Analysts at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets have expressed concerns about public companies using bold strategies to hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. While the rewards may seem high, analysts warned that this trend could backfire in dangerous ways. A new report outlines how this fast-growing strategy may create a cycle of profits or losses that could spiral out of control. The Rise of the Corporate Crypto Treasury A growing number of public companies are now adopting a crypto treasury strategy. These firms raise money through equity, convertible notes, preferred shares, and other financial tools and use the funds to buy and hold crypto assets. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, at least 135 public companies now hold Bitcoin as part of their treasury. The strategy gained popularity after the one led by Michael Saylor made headlines by transforming the company’s balance sheet into a Bitcoin vault. Following this trend, companies such as MARA, Metaplanet, Twenty One, and Sol Strategies have also adopted this approach. Other firms are also focusing on other crypto assets, such as Solana , Ethereum, and XRP, for long-term growth. Franklin Templeton Analysts Say This Strategy Works – For Now Analysts say this model can be very profitable, especially during a crypto bull market. Companies can raise capital at prices above the actual value of their crypto holdings. This gives them an edge. Every new share they sell generates more money than their assets are worth, allowing them to grow faster without relinquishing too much ownership. Surprisingly, crypto volatility, though risky, can help boost companies’ values. This comes as big crypto swings do make tools like convertible notes more valuable due to the embedded options they carry. Additionally, rising crypto prices also boost stock prices, attracting more investors. Franklin Templeton Analysts Outline the Dark Side of the Boom However, there is a catch. If the stock price of these companies falls below the value of their crypto holdings, known as the net asset value (NAV), trouble starts. At that point, issuing new shares becomes harmful to current investors because it reduces the value of their shares. Analysts say this is called dilution. Even worse, falling crypto prices can trigger a negative feedback loop. If companies attempt to sell crypto to prevent their stock from falling, they may push prices even lower. Analysts consider this scenario particularly dangerous, as it could deter investors, leading to further selling and a downward spiral of losses. Franklin Templeton is not alone in raising red flags. Last month, analysts at Presto Research stated that these companies face a real risk of collapse if things go south. However, they believe the risks are more complex than those of past crises, such as Terra or 3AC. Meanwhile, David Duong from Coinbase Institutional warned that highly leveraged crypto buying by companies might create broader risks for the financial system over time. Still, Duong believes any immediate threats remain low.

2025-07-03T16:25:59,"Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break $200K Before This Top Crypto Achieves Its $5 Target?","The post Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break $200K Before This Top Crypto Achieves Its $5 Target? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) is charging toward a monumental $200,000 milestone, currently testing a critical $108,724 resistance. Trading at $107,379.95 with a 0.32% daily gain, BTC’s momentum is undeniable, fueled by surging trading volumes up 16.74% to $51.82 billion. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi star, is capturing attention in phase 5 of its presale, priced at $0.03. Having raised $11,500,000 with over 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders, MUTM guarantees a 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch. Can BTC hit $200K before MUTM reaches its projected $5 target? The race is on. Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge BTC is puffing its chest in the cryptocurrency market, and it is in a bull cycle of four years. In the history of Bitcoin, the currency goes high towards the end of the year, like it happened in December 2017 and November 2021. This cycle is slower but it is not about to die down. Heavyweights such as Strategy which has more than 500,000 BTC and MetaPlanet with 12,345 BTC are contributing to the demand. Bitcoin ETFs also saw $500 million in inflows on June 25, signaling robust adoption. This institutional fervor, paired with retail interest, could propel BTC past $108,724 toward $200,000 in 2025. Moreover, growing stability is luring conservative investors, reducing fears of sharp corrections. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing swiftly through phase 5, already over 50% filled. Priced at $0.03, up 200% from its $0.01 opening, MUTM offers a guaranteed 2x return at its $0.06 launch. Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, a 16.7% jump, narrowing the window for early investors. With $11,500,000 raised and 580 million tokens sold to 12,700 holders, demand is soaring. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. Furthermore, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , split among 10 winners, boosts excitement. Join by submitting a wallet address, completing quests, and investing $50 in the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its dual lending model. Its peer-to-contract system uses smart contracts for dynamic interest rates, ensuring stability. The peer-to-peer model enables direct lending, ideal for volatile assets. Users depositing ETH, AVAX, or DAI receive mtTokens, which accrue interest and support trading or staking. The protocol’s buyback mechanism rewards stakers with passive dividends, enhancing long-term value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, minimizing depegging risks. Consequently, this stablecoin will streamline lending and boost liquidity, setting MUTM apart in DeFi. Security and Scalability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. No security incidents have occurred in the past 90 days, reinforcing trust. The team has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. Plans for Layer 2 scaling will reduce gas fees and enhance transaction speed, positioning MUTM for global adoption. Analysts predict a $3.50 post-launch price in 2025, a 116x jump from phase 5. This robust infrastructure makes MUTM a top crypto to watch. The Race to Milestones Bitcoin’s push toward $200,000 hinges on breaking the $108,724 resistance, driven by institutional and retail momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, offers a compelling alternative with its $0.03 presale price and guaranteed 100% ROI at launch. Its innovative lending, stablecoin, and Layer 2 plans position it for a $3.50 target in 2025. While BTC’s market dominance is clear, MUTM’s utility and security make it a standout. Investors eyeing the best crypto to buy now should act fast—phase 5 is filling up.

2025-07-03T16:17:48,"ATOM Consolidates as Bitcoin Takes Driving Seat, Finds Support at $4.20","The altcoin market took a backseat on Thursday as crypto majors bitcoin and ether attempted to rally to new highs. As billions of dollars worth of liquidity flowed into shorting bitcoin on the brink of record highs, altcoins like ATOM consolidated, finding support at the $4.20 level. Typically when bitcoin rallies altcoin price action is muted and the inverse is true when bitcoin consolidates, so ATOM could be primed for a rally once bitcoin begins to cool off. Technical analysis ATOM-USD traded within a range of $4.09 to $4.26 during the 24-hour period from 2 July 16:00 to 3 July 15:00, representing a 4% swing. Key support established at $4.16-$4.17 with high volume buying emerging at the $4.20 level during the 13:00 hour session on July 3rd. Despite reaching a peak of $4.26 during the 07:00 hour, ATOM failed to sustain momentum above the $4.25 resistance level. In the last 60 minutes from 3 July 14:24 to 15:23, ATOM-USD declined from $4.24 to $4.21, representing a 0.73% decrease. Sharp selloff occurred between 15:03-15:07, dropping to a session low of $4.19, before staging a recovery. Final 15 minutes showed stabilization with price consolidation around $4.21, suggesting potential short-term equilibrium. CD20 Index Surges 2% Before Profit-Taking Emerges The CD20 demonstrated significant volatility in the last 24 hours from 2 July 16:00 to 3 July 15:00, reaching a peak of $1,811.11 before retracing to $1,793.55, with an overall range of $37.27 (2%). After establishing support around $1,780 during early hours, the index staged an impressive rally through the morning session of 3 July, gaining momentum particularly between 09:00-14:00 before profit-taking emerged in the final hour.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/03/atom-consolidates-as-bitcoin-takes-driving-seat-finds-support-at-usd4-20,"BTC|ATOM|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN","Markets|AI Market Insights|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T16:04:30,"Crypto Tax Proposal That Didn't Make it to Trump's Budget Bill Pushed on Its Own","Tax proposals meant to reduce burdens among crypto users, including one that would waive capital-gains calculations for small-scale transactions, didn't make it into President Donald Trump's marquee budget bill but are now being pursued as standalone legislation in the U.S. Senate. Senator Cynthia Lummis, who leads the crypto subcommittee within the Senate Banking Committee, introduced the bill on Thursday to address a number of the digital assets sectors' chief taxation complaints. The legislation would set a threshold of $300 on crypto transactions that would need to factor into a users' tax calculations, freeing up people's small, day-to-day transactions from capital-gains headaches — limited to a total of $5,000 a year. The effort would also eliminate double taxation on crypto given in staking, mining, airdrops and forks, tossing out the initial tax hit when the rewards are received and focusing only on taxing gains from the eventual sale. It would also address lending, wash sales, charitable giving and let dealers and traders choose to mark their assets to the current market value in their accounting. ""We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,"" Lummis said in a statement . Lummis has launched this bill into uncertain waters. Getting Senate time devoted to solitary bills is a challenge in an already busy session, but adding to that complication is the fact that a number of other crypto matters are likely to take priority — including the two bills that would establish regulations for the U.S. crypto markets and stablecoin issuers. And another of her legislative campaigns to establish a federal bitcoin (BTC) reserve is also in the mix. The Wyoming Republican has been at the forefront of crypto matters, but the top priority for the industry on Capitol Hill at the moment is the advancement of the bill to set rules of the road for how the government will oversee the digital assets markets. Lummis publicly agreed to hew to a deadline recently set by Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to deliver the market structure bill to Trump's desk by the end of September.

2025-07-03T15:58:37,"Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) Price Surge: Is the Next Big Rally Starting?","Bitcoin (BTC), has just broken out of a bull flag. The next stage of its upward journey awaits. With the king of the cryptocurrencies heading higher, the altcoins will not be far behind. $ETH and $SOL are potentially already beginning their own price surges. Support is firming up for $ETH - $2,800 next? Source: TradingView The daily chart for $ETH shows that the sideways period is still ongoing, at least until now. That said, the $2,400 horizontal support level is firming up, and if the bulls can get the price beyond the current $2,600 resistance, $2,800 would be next. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing the indicator line pointing upwards and it has broken beyond the yellow moving average. All bullish moving forward. $ETH breaks back above mid-level of price range Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $ETH illustrates how the price has been going sideways within a range since breaking beyond the descending trendline. This range stretches from $2,200 up to $2,800, with the midway point being at $2,500. The price is currently back above the mid-level and so it might be expected that another test of the top of the range could be next. This will be crucial for the bulls to get above so that they can concentrate on taking out the all-important previous swing high at $4,110. If they can do this, it is game-on, and the all-time high of $4,860 will not look so daunting. $SOL confirmation of breakout, or another fakeout? Source: TradingView Things were looking up for the $SOL price earlier on Thursday as a breakout appeared to be taking place. However, the price has dipped back down and It now remains to be seen whether this is a confirmation of the breakout, or whether it is another fakeout. Given that there is also some horizontal support at this current level, a retest of the breakout looks to be the favourite outcome. The RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicator line perhaps about to similarly retest the breakout beyond the yellow moving average. A quick candle wick down to the ascending trendline is also a possibility. Time will tell. $SOL still bullish on weekly chart Source: TradingView In spite of $SOL’s recent dip the weekly chart still looks very promising. The price is still beyond the upper trendline of what could be a falling wedge, rather than a descending channel. As long as it is still there by the end of play on Sunday, another candle opening beyond the trendline would be bullish. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are currently crossing back over. This would also be a very bullish signal if this is still the case by the end of this week.

2025-07-03T15:46:39,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Bitcoin Price Rebounds After Jobs Data Dip","Market reactions to US government economic reports have always been powerful catalysts for price movements, particularly within the crypto space. From inflation numbers to jobs data, even the most subtle deviation from expectation can send assets into sharp swings. In many cases, these shifts are not immediate. This is why the latest unemployment report was closely watched. Most assumed a negative outcome would trigger a sharp correction, or at the very least a fresh bout of volatility. And yet, even as the report landed with surprising strength, Bitcoin did the unexpected again and dumped. However, its rebound, swift and clean, has now become the centerpiece of speculation as the next leg of upward momentum begins to take shape. Bitcoin Rebounds Strong Despite Surprising Jobs Data June’s employment data turned out to be a major upside surprise. The US added 147,000 jobs , decisively beating the analyst forecast of just 106,000. The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, in direct contrast to the anticipated rise to 4.3%. For traditional markets, this would typically signal economic strength. For crypto, however, such clarity often brings chaos. JUST IN: The US 🇺🇸 unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in June 2025 from 4.2% in May, against market expectations of 4.3%. The rate has stayed between 4.0% and 4.2% since May 2024, indicating labor market stability. #unemployment #economy pic.twitter.com/OTHIiIZFoS — Crypto Dives (@MakroDives) July 3, 2025 The moment the figures were published, Bitcoin’s price took a sharp dip. It had been hovering around the $110,000 level before swiftly dropping below $108,900 in what many described as a flash dump. That alone caught retail traders off guard, who had expected the report to bring caution but not immediate selling pressure. The irony is that better-than-expected news still triggered a selloff, reinforcing the unpredictable ways in which crypto reacts to macroeconomic indicators. Yet within minutes, the market reversed course. Buyer volume surged just as rapidly as the dump occurred, pushing Bitcoin right back to its earlier levels. This kind of V-shaped move is often interpreted as a sign of underlying confidence. Some see it as a possible instance of strategic accumulation, where institutions or large players take advantage of momentary retail weakness to secure stronger positions. Regardless of the motive, the rebound above $110,000 has now strengthened the view that Bitcoin remains resilient. This also suggests that support zones are tightening, and with labor market indicators showing consistency, the wider market might interpret this as a green light for continued bullishness. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Trend As Investors’ Attention Increases SUBBD With the US unemployment rate dropping unexpectedly, the narrative of job creation and opportunity has taken center stage again. And while most eyes are still on traditional sectors, SUBBD has quietly been building a creator-centric economic layer that may well play a part in the next wave of decentralized employment. SUBBD is not simply a content hosting platform. It is a creator-owned infrastructure designed to ensure that revenue flows back into the hands of those producing the content rather than intermediaries. This changes how influence, information, and income move in digital ecosystems. For creators, this means more than just a place to publish. It offers a financial model where subscriptions, tips, premium content, and micro-communities operate without centralized platforms skimming off the majority. That opens the door to sustainable, independent income at scale. As macroeconomic indicators show a strengthening labor market, projects like SUBBD sit well with this new direction. It turns digital visibility into capital, and it does so on-chain. The user base is evolving from speculative early adopters to real professionals who view blockchain as a tool rather than a trend. It has already been endorsed by top creators like ClayBro and others, adding to its popularity and trust factor. In a market like this, where investor attention is leaning towards tangible utility and user-driven models, SUBBD is positioned at a very strong intersection. If Bitcoin’s rebound is a signal of the next bullish leg, then the creator economy’s expansion may follow suit, and SUBBD could very well be a key player leading that charge. Token 6900 The crypto market has always swung between seriousness and satire. Token 6900 leans hard into the latter, but make no mistake, its timing and structure suggest a deeper understanding of how narratives move this market. With Bitcoin rebounding cleanly from its post-report dip, many believe that the speculative phase may reignite. That creates the perfect backdrop for tokens like 6900, which do not rely on long whitepapers or roadmap jargon, but on raw energy, meme culture, and irony weaponized as community fuel. Token 6900 positions itself as a cultural capsule from the last memecoin cycle. It brings back everything that defined the earlier mania with chaotic graphics, bizarre tone, and absurd web design. And somehow, that chaotic energy is exactly what investors seem to be waiting for. Especially now, as prices begin to climb and fear turns into curiosity again. What makes Token 6900 stand out is its unapologetic approach. It is not trying to please everyone. It is here to cater to the same tribe that made previous degen tokens 100x in weeks. And unlike random meme coins with no storyline, Token 6900 is tapping into a very specific visual and narrative aesthetic that has already proven to work, particularly referencing its loose alignment with SPX 6900 and its deep-cut internet themes. If capital starts rotating back into the higher-risk pockets of crypto, Token 6900 may not just start the degen crypto movement again. It might help shape it. And that makes it worth watching closely. Snorter In the past few months, the demand for accessible trading tools inside messaging apps has quietly exploded. Snorter has emerged as one of the most focused plays on this trend. Built to function directly within Telegram, Snorter combines an AI-powered interface with multi-chain connectivity, allowing users to trade, track, and manage crypto activity without leaving the chat environment. The brilliance of Snorter is in how much it eliminates friction. Users no longer need to toggle between exchanges, wallets, and price trackers. With Snorter, everything happens inside the interface they already use every day. This has huge implications, especially as new investors return to the market following Bitcoin’s resilience. In moments of sharp movement, like the recent flash dip and rebound, fast reaction times become everything and Snorter turns Telegram into a trading terminal that can respond in seconds. More than just speed, it also offers customization. From sniping tools to AI price insights and portfolio monitoring, Snorter is built for users who want more control but less clutter. It bridges casual Telegram users with serious DeFi functions in a way that few projects have done effectively. As crypto gears up for a possible speculative wave, tools like Snorter will likely see more demand. The project does not just benefit from a bullish market — it enhances a trader’s ability to survive one. That positions it as both a product and a utility layer, and it makes Snorter increasingly difficult to ignore. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels and confidence begins returning to the broader market, investor behavior is shifting with it. The rush is no longer just about finding the next 10x token, but also about equipping oneself with the right tools to navigate whatever cycle comes next. Best Wallet Token stands out here because it does not simply ride on speculative hype. It is backed by infrastructure that is already useful, already adopted, and already ahead of what most wallets today offer. Best Wallet is a high-performance Web3 wallet that supports over 60 blockchains. That level of connectivity matters now more than ever. In a market where cross-chain activity is becoming standard, the ability to seamlessly move, manage, and interact with assets across multiple networks is no longer a premium feature. It is essential. Best Wallet delivers this with a UX that feels familiar but operates on far more advanced rails. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 But the token itself is where the utility deepens. Best Wallet Token is not just a governance piece. It is integrated into access, tiered features, staking incentives, and future rollouts of wallet-native applications. This gives it actual use across a growing product suite, not just abstract value. The project has raised upwards of $13 million already, and could soon be ready to launch in the coming weeks. With investor attention returning and market participants setting up for longer plays, wallets become central again. They are the access point. The control layer. And Best Wallet, with its expanding reach and real-world functionality, may be one of the few built to handle what’s coming next. Conclusion The current market sentiment, paved by Bitcoin’s resilience and reinforced by stronger economic indicators, has created a positive backdrop for high-potential crypto assets. Projects that offer a pathway to emerging user behavior, provide real utility, or tap into renewed investor energy are gaining traction fast. From infrastructure plays to cultural tokens and creator-driven ecosystems, the trend is clear; the market is rewarding relevance and readiness. As momentum builds and capital begins flowing with greater conviction, this may be a prime window to consider assets that are not only built for speculation, but also designed to thrive in the next stage of the cycle.

2025-07-03T15:45:23,"Tether signs MoU with Adecoagro to launch a bitcoin mining project","Tether Holdings Ltd., the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with South American agribusiness firm Adecoagro S.A. The agreement was disclosed in a press release on Tether’s website on Thursday. The two companies plan to collaborate on a Bitcoin mining pilot project in Brazil, merging renewable energy capabilities with Tether’s digital asset expertise. Adecoagro is a Nasdaq-listed company with major operations in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay that currently manages over 230 megawatts of electrical generation capacity sourced from renewables. Adecoagro to use Tether mining software According to the statement , the pilot project will be launched using Tether’s proprietary Mining OS, a mining site management software. Tether announced that the software will be open-sourced in the coming months. Adecoagro’s company policies on related-party transactions state that its Independent Committee has reviewed and approved the initiative. The company sees this mining project as more than a means of monetizing surplus electricity. It is seeking to diversify its balance sheet with digital assets like Bitcoin. “ We’re excited to explore innovative ways to maximize the value of our renewable energy assets ,” reckoned Mariano Bosch, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Adecoagro. Bosch explained that the partnership could allow the company to stabilize the pricing of energy it currently sells on the spot market while gaining upside exposure to Bitcoin. Speaking on the new MOU, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked about the synergy between Adecoagro’s agricultural energy infrastructure and Tether’s portfolio of mining operations. “ This project is another step in our growing commitment to renewable-powered bitcoin mining ,” said Ardoino. “ It highlights the potential to align agricultural energy production with cutting-edge digital infrastructure .” Adecoagro is in the sustainable food and energy production business, but has now promised to assess Bitcoin mining as an alternative source of demand for its existing power generation infrastructure. Using 230 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, a Bitcoin mining operation can deploy thousands of ASIC machines such as the Antminer S19 XP, consuming roughly 3,000 watts. At this scale, the operation could reach a hash rate of approximately 6.9 exahashes per second (EH/s), roughly 1.6% of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate, which currently stands near 430 EH/s. Given the current mining difficulty and an average block reward of 3.125 BTC post-halving, a setup could mine a full block approximately once every 2 to 3 days. If efficiently managed and powered by low-cost renewable energy, Adecoagro facilities would rank among the world’s largest industrial-scale mining operations. Ardoino believes the USDT parent company will become the biggest bitcoin miner by the end of 2025. Tether recently disclosed it holds more than 100,000 BTC, worth over $10 billion. Tether takes an extra step into Africa with Zanzibar partnership On July 1, Tether also announced a collaboration with the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, located off the coast of Tanzania. The company signed another MOU, this time with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority, to improve the financial inclusion and blockchain education on the islands. As part of the initiative, Tether plans to work alongside educational institutions in Zanzibar to incorporate blockchain and digital asset knowledge into school and university curricula. This could help citizens add to their knowledge about decentralized technologies and encourage the development of a local digital economy. Tether also intends to integrate its stablecoins, including the US dollar-pegged USDT and gold-backed XAUT, into ZanMalipo, Zanzibar’s government-controlled digital payments platform. Through ZanMalipo, local users can legally engage with digital currencies directly through an official channel. “This MOU with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority reflects our commitment to advancing financial literacy and sustainable blockchain innovation in Africa,” Ardoino said. The Tether CEO added that by investing in educational initiatives and integrating digital assets into formal systems, the company is helping lay the foundation for a compliant and inclusive financial future.

2025-07-03T15:32:00,"Top Analyst Warns Bitcoin Risks Retracement To $40,000 As Highly Reliable Indicator Flashes Sell Signal","Independent crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautioned of a potential downside for Bitcoin after spotting a bearish signal from a reliable technical indicator. In a recent post on the X platform, Martinez told his followers that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which has predicted every major Bitcoin crash, had flashed again. The indicator, according to Martinez, was warning that a 63% reversal could be in the offing. “The Tom DeMark Sequential just gave a quarterly sell signal. This is a rare warning that has historically preceded brutal drawdowns,” the pundit stated. Martinez noted that the TD Sequential sent a sell signal in 2015, and a 75% Bitcoin drop ensued. In 2018, the same setup saw Bitcoin plummet by over 85%. The TD Sequential indicator is an oscillating trend-following chart overlay indicator that is used to identify short-term trend reversals based on changes in intraday highs and lows. In other words, the indicator sparks when an asset sees an overextended rally and is due for a brutal correction. In this case, the indicator predicts that the BTC price could see a frantic drop from the current level, dropping as much as 63%, to trade hands at around $40,000. Such a move would mark a huge drawdown as Bitcoin has been trading above the psychologically important $100K level for the most part in recent months. Today, BTC topped the $110,000 mark for the first time since June 11 after U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew in roughly $408 million on Wednesday — a sign of investors’ unwavering confidence. Since May 1, these BTC products have registered $9.91 billion in inflows, approximately 20% of their total inflows since launching in January 2024, data from Farside shows. The world’s largest and oldest crypto was valued at $110,295 as of publication time, a more than 2.4% gain since Wednesday.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/top-analyst-warns-bitcoin-risks-retracement-to-40000-as-highly-reliable-indicator-flashes-sell-signal/,"BTC|TRADING|SPONSORED|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

While BTC has rebounded strongly to key resistance levels, whale investors are sending a complex message with a rise in their realized profits and losses. A Major Internal Shift Brewing For Bitcoin Amidst recent price spikes, Kripto Mevsimi, an author and market expert, revealed a rare trend among Bitcoin whales or large-scale investors. “The final week of June revealed intense, mixed behavior from large Bitcoin holders,” the expert stated. Data from the expert shows that whales are locking in profits and realizing losses at the same time, at a rapid rate. The development is considered an unusual dual dynamic, indicating that a substantial internal recalibration is taking place. After examining the BTC Whale Realized Profit metric, Mevsimi highlighted that over $641 million in gains and over $1.24 billion in losses were realized by new whales . The on-chain expert has flagged the development as a rare combination that signals a major internal shift. Furthermore, it was observed that some late participants gave up, but others, possibly those who had accumulated earlier in the second quarter of this year, locked in profits. However, old whales made $91 million in profits, with very little loss realized. Mevsimi stated that this confluence of capitulation and profit-taking may have marked a local exhaustion point, which might lay the foundation for new market structures in the upcoming weeks. Timing And Behavior Adding Weight To The Development It is interesting to note that this trend continues till the end of June, a month for rebalancing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs ) and institutional funds portfolios. However, this activity stopped in early July, indicating either a brief equilibrium or a possible turning point. “For now, June’s closing week stands out — not for price action alone, but for what it revealed about underlying flows,” Mevsimi added. According to the expert, such a timing adds weight to the trend, highlighting this wasn’t just noise; instead, it might have been a purposeful shift in position. In the past, local bottoms have frequently coincided with sudden increases in realized losses, particularly from short-term players . Although there is no definite signal, the expert believes it is crucial to pay close attention to how the timing and behavior line up here. Profit-taking might be swelling currently, but Bitcoin continues to eye upside targets, even new all-time highs. Titan of Crypto has outlined a Bull Flag breakout attempt that could result in a significant rally. BTC has also formed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover, indicating upside potential as this move often precedes price spikes .

2025-07-03T15:28:04,"The $100 Ripple’s XRP Price Prophecy: Sports Analyst Reveals What to Watch For","Beyond institutional investors, XRP is increasingly gaining traction in the sports industry as its price edges higher. Notably, the crypto asset has experienced a strong upswing this week, jumping 17% following this year’s positive XRP ETF news. On Thursday, Kelly Stewart, widely known as “Kelly in Vegas,” a popular sports analyst, weighed in on the ongoing debate over XRP’s potential, identifying key indicators that could signal a path to $100. “ If XRP hits $100, there will be signs,” Stewart tweeted in response to a discussion about Kansas State University’s search for new revenue sources. Notably, K-State’s athletic department is looking to generate over $20 million ahead of the 2025-26 academic year, a pivotal period when colleges are expected to begin revenue-sharing with student-athletes. According to a report, the university is exploring multiple strategies to bridge this funding gap, including expanded beer sales, naming rights, and on-field football sponsorships. Stewart’s comment quickly gained traction within both the crypto and sports betting communities, igniting discussions about potential financial opportunities for K-State. “If/when it does, give me a call, and we will make a deal. That goes for anyone out there that might want to showcase their brand at K-State and the 20+ million TV viewers we had this past season,” Shawn Becket, Senior Manager of Business Development for Kansas State Athletics replied. Becket’s statement hinted at the possibility of XRP-powered sponsorships or advertising opportunities at K-State, reinforcing the growing intersection between crypto and sports. If the university were to integrate XRP, it could unlock new revenue streams, particularly given the rapid adoption of digital assets across the sports sector. Kansas State Athletics has already transitioned to an entirely cashless payment system across its venues, including ticket offices, concessions, parking, and merchandise stores. Currently, it accepts credit and debit cards, as well as Apple Pay, but has yet to embrace cryptocurrency payments officially. Meanwhile, across the sports industry, some teams have been integrating cryptocurrency into their business models, with the NBA’s Sacramento Kings and Dallas Mavericks and European soccer powerhouse SL Benfica all embracing BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, and other coins for ticketing and merchandise purchases. Japan’s SBI e-Sports even compensates players in XRP, showcasing the currency’s growing utility. That said, beyond expanding sponsorship partnerships, several factors will further play a crucial role in XRP reaching the $100 milestone. Regulatory clarity in the U.S. remains a key catalyst, as legal battles continue to influence investor sentiment. A favorable outcome could attract institutional investors and bolster market confidence. Additionally, the approval of a spot XRP ETF would significantly increase demand, making the asset more accessible to traditional investors.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/the-100-ripples-xrp-price-prophecy-sports-analyst-reveals-what-to-watch-for/,"XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

Markets remained bullish but volatile throughout the month, while stablecoins became a focal point. On Thursday, July 3, Binance Research published a report outlining key trends from the past month. Most notably, stablecoin volume reached $253.7 billion, as landmark legislation passed the U.S. Senate. The passage of the Genius Act in the Senate was a major catalyst that drove stablecoin adoption. The act brings stablecoins into a regulated framework, prompting more companies to enter the space. Circle’s USDC led the charge, accounting for 79% of net stablecoin issuance in June. At the same time, stablecoin regulation served as a catalyst for growth in other areas. The total crypto market cap rose 2.62% in June, despite volatility caused by the Israel-Iran conflict. Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed altcoins, with its dominance rising to 65%, the highest level since early 2021. Crypto-related firms also saw significant gains, especially those embracing Bitcoin treasury strategies. Several companies saw quadruple-digit returns since adopting Bitcoin, which helped attract new investors. Notably, Japanese firm Metaplanet overtook Strategy as the best-performing Bitcoin play on the stock market.

2025-07-03T15:15:00,"Corporate Crypto Treasuries Could Worsen Price Crashes: Franklin Templeton","The growing wave of corporate crypto treasuries could amplify market downturns if prices fall sharply, analysts at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets warned in a new report . Key Takeaways: Franklin Templeton warns corporate crypto treasuries could deepen price crashes if markets turn bearish. Over 130 public firms have adopted Bitcoin reserves, raising billions through premium-priced equity and debt. A falling market-to-NAV ratio risks triggering forced sales, creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral. While the strategy has drawn praise for fueling institutional adoption and boosting company valuations, the firm cautioned that the model’s inherent risks could trigger a destructive feedback loop in bearish conditions. Publicly traded companies have been aggressively raising capital through equity, convertible notes, and other instruments to load up on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana for their balance sheets. 135 Listed Firms Have Adopted Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows 135 listed firms have deployed this playbook in BTC alone, with leaders including Strategy, Metaplanet, Twenty One, SharpLink, Upexi, and Sol Strategies. Inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, firms have raised billions since early 2024 by issuing shares at premiums to net asset value (NAV) and capitalizing on crypto volatility. Franklin Templeton analysts highlighted how the upsides of this approach include the ability to raise capital above NAV, making share issuance accretive even amid price swings. Additionally, for Proof-of-Stake assets like Ethereum and Solana, staking yields can add revenue streams, enhancing company growth when crypto prices rise. Rising markets can further attract investors, fueling a positive feedback loop. The Strategy Treasury Playbook pic.twitter.com/YXXdZmtlIm — Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTDA_US) July 2, 2025 However, the report flagged a significant downside: if the market-to-NAV ratio slips below 1, equity issuance becomes dilutive, undermining investor confidence and stalling capital inflows. Worse, if crypto prices fall sharply, companies might feel pressured to sell holdings to support their stock price, sending crypto prices even lower and deepening investor fear. Such a negative feedback loop could turn a price dip into a self-reinforcing crash. “The corporate crypto treasury model represents a new phase of institutional crypto adoption, but it is not without its risks,” Franklin Templeton wrote. Maintaining a premium to NAV and managing market volatility will be essential to avoid dangerous spirals. More Analysts Voice Concern Over Bitcoin Treasuries The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). To protect investors, he suggested suspending ATM programs if shares trade below 0.95 times NAV for more than 10 consecutive days. Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy. According to Pomerantz, Strategy overstated the benefits of its Bitcoin treasury strategy and downplayed the volatility and risks inherent to large-scale Bitcoin holdings.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A crypto whale who turned $100m with Solana is now betting big on XYZVerse, a $0.0033 memecoin he believes could surge 9,000% in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse price forecast: Can it really 30x? Bitcoin continues steady growth Solana fluctuates Conclusion A seasoned cryptocurrency investor, known for making a fortune of $100 million with Solana, has set his sights on a tiny memecoin valued at just $0.003333. He predicts it could soar by 9000%. This bold forecast has caught the attention of many, sparking curiosity about this overlooked digital asset. XYZVerse price forecast: Can it really 30x? XYZVerse is stepping into the memecoin arena at a time when community-driven tokens dominate speculative trading. The explosive rise of coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and engaged communities can deliver outsized returns. Market sentiment also plays a crucial role in XYZVerse’s outlook. As altcoin season looms, investor appetite for lower-cap, high-risk tokens is heating up. With XYZVerse still in presale, it stands to benefit significantly if it secures top-tier exchange listings and keeps community excitement high post-launch. Why XYZVerse stands out right now Strong branding and partnerships — Backed by sports tie-ins and influencer deals, XYZVerse has a broad appeal beyond traditional crypto audiences. Deflationary supply mechanics — A 17.13% token burn aims to ease sell pressure and support price growth. Liquidity and stability focus — With 15% of supply allocated to liquidity, it’s designed for smoother trading post-launch. Community incentives — 10% dedicated to rewards and engagement encourages holding and grassroots promotion. XYZ price outlook is as follows Current presale price: $0.003333 Post-presale target: $0.10 (project’s internal projections) Possible ATH in first weeks: $0.15 – $0.25 (assuming strong FOMO and exchange momentum) 6–12 month potential: $0.20 – $0.40 (with key partnerships and sustained hype) Is a 30x move to $0.10 realistic? A 30x surge from the presale price to $0.10 is within reach, but several factors must align: Major exchange listings — Listings on big CEXs like Binance, KuCoin, or OKX could drive explosive price action on day one. Viral community growth — Memecoins thrive on social buzz. If XYZVerse leverages its sports influencer network well, it can build unstoppable momentum. Bullish market conditions — If Bitcoin and altcoins continue their uptrend, speculative assets like XYZVerse often outperform. XYZVerse has the core ingredients to pull off a massive run. With focused marketing, top-tier exchange listings, and true community buy-in, the $0.10+ target, implying around a 3000% gain from the current price, becomes a serious possibility. You might also like: SOL bounces on ETF hopes, XRP eyes $27; XYZVerse targets 25,000% gains Bitcoin continues steady growth Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading between $102,517 and $111,338. Over the past six months, its price increased by 10.73%. In the last month, it went up by 1.33%, and in the past week, it rose by 1.01%. This steady growth shows ongoing interest in the cryptocurrency. Market indicators are mixed. The Relative Strength Index is at 61.72, nearing overbought levels. The Stochastic value is high at 98.92, suggesting it is overbought. The MACD level is -16.594, indicating possible downward momentum. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $106,235 and $107,244, showing a stable trend. Bitcoin’s nearest resistance level is at $114,326. If it breaks above this, it could reach the second resistance at $123,147. If it falls, it may find support at $96,683, and further down at $87,862. Based on recent data, Bitcoin could continue to grow, but overbought signals might lead to a short-term decline. Watching these levels can help predict its next move. Solana fluctuates Source: TradingView Solana ( SOL ) has experienced some notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price increased by 2.22%, settling within the range of $137.88 to $161.77. However, over the past month, the price has declined by 5.42%, and looking back six months, it has dropped by 28.33%. This mixed performance suggests that while there is short-term growth, the longer-term trend has been downward. Technical indicators provide further insights into SOL’s potential direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.50, which is neutral, indicating that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 91.70, suggesting that SOL might be overbought in the short term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.3727, pointing to a bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $148.35, slightly below the 100-day average of $150.35, which can be a bearish signal. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $170.18. If SOL breaks above this, it could aim for the second resistance at $194.07. On the downside, the nearest support is at $122.40, with a further support level at $98.51. A move towards the first support level would be a decrease of about 10%, while reaching the first resistance could mean an increase of over 5%. Based on these factors, SOL’s price may continue to fluctuate within these levels in the near future. Conclusion Amid the 2025 bull run, while BTC and SOL perform well, XYZVerse stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 3,000% growth and community-driven success.

2025-07-03T14:52:51,"Corporations Outpace ETFs in Bitcoin Purchases for Third Straight Quarter","The price of the first cryptocurrency remains resilient thanks to demand from publicly traded companies. In parallel, the SEC is accelerating the approval of exchange-traded funds based on crypto-assets. This was reported by analysts at QCP Capital . Public companies have outpaced ETFs in Bitcoin purchases for the third consecutive quarter. Firms like ProCap BTC LLC, Strategy, and Metaplanet continue to build positions in Bitcoin, viewing it as a strategic asset. This reinforces the narrative of buying on price drawdowns, QCP noted. Regulators Are Accelerating Adoption The Commission has approved the launch of Ethereum- and Solana-based ETFs with staking capabilities and has also given the green light to the Grayscale fund, which includes BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. The SEC is considering common listing standards for token-based funds. According to QCP, this initiative could simplify and expedite their approval process in the future. Corporate Adoption The trend of adding digital assets to corporate balance sheets is growing: Bitmine raised $20 million to accumulate Ethereum and generate staking revenue. DeFi Development received $100 million to acquire Solana and buy back shares. Infrastructure players are also expanding their presence. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle has applied for a banking license in the US. Robinhood has been active in Europe, launching open-ended futures and tokenized shares. Market Analysis Liquidity in the cryptocurrency market continues to grow. Solana futures volume on the CME reached a record 1.75 million contracts, and XRP futures trading volume exceeded $500 million in the first month. Meanwhile, implied volatility remains near historic lows. Traders' positions indicate accumulation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's dominance is holding at a multi-year high of 65–66%. Analysts noted that retail traders have taken a pause, while institutional traders are quietly building up positions. Experts expect a possible change in the volatility regime in the third and fourth quarters. Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. remain favorable for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. President Donald Trump has criticized Fed chief Jerome Powell and signaled that he intends to appoint a successor committed to cutting rates. Markets are already pricing in more rate cuts than the Federal Reserve is predicting. This positive sentiment has spread to digital assets, although the backdrop in the altcoin sector remains subdued. In June, QCP stated that Bitcoin would benefit from global uncertainty. On July 1, U.S. ETFs based on Bitcoin recorded an outflow of $342.2 million. That broke a 15-day streak totaling $4.7 billion.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9798/corporations-outpace-et-fs-in-bitcoin-purchases-for-third-straight-quarter,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T14:47:00,"BlackRock Buys $3.85B in Bitcoin as IBIT Overtakes S&P 500 ETF in Revenue","BlackRock Buys $3.85B in Bitcoin in June BlackRock added a significant sum to its Bitcoin holdings in June, adding around $3.85 billion worth of BTC, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham. The acquisitions included a $1.4 billion buy made in six consecutive days, demonstrating BlackRock’s growing confidence in the future worth of Bitcoin. This momentum occurs as institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains strong, with BlackRock being the clear leader in the space. IBIT Now Tops IVV in Fee Revenue Annually BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which launched last January 2024, has fast become a behemoth in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF space. According to Bloomberg (July 2), IBIT is now topping BlackRock’s own S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in fee revenue per annum. Even with IVV’s $624 billion in AUM overshadowing IBIT’s $52.4 billion, IBIT’s 0.25% fee has raked in the firm $187.2 million a year in fees—higher than the $187.1 million from IVV’s lower 0.03% fee. Quickest ETF to Reach $70 Billion AUM IBIT recently made history, too, as the fastest ETF to hit $70 billion in assets managed. It achieved this in just 341 days—approximately five times faster than the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which took 1,691 days. The fund presently holds over 55% of the overall U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF assets and accounts for 96% of the market’s net inflows. BlackRock’s Total Bitcoin Holdings Top $80B Following its June spree of shopping, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings are now valued at over 696,874 BTC, which is approximately $80.7 billion in today’s market value. The aggressive accumulation represents BlackRock’s wager on Bitcoin as a permanent institutional holding—and a bet that ETF-based access will remain the investors’ entry point of preference.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/blackrock-buys-3-85b-in-bitcoin-as-ibit-overtakes-sp-500-etf-in-revenue/,"BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T14:45:16,"BTC liveliness in 2025 shows a trend of accumulation","The first half of 2025 arrived with several price records. This cycle turned out differently, as whales tended to hold, instead of distribute. Since January 2025, a trend of holding has established itself for BTC. The liveliness metric shows that, compared to previous rallies, the current market has not led to coin distribution. Liveliness is a metric of how many coins are spent versus how many are held, and reflects directly on-chain activity. Large holders preferred to accumulate coins, turning into long-term BTC supporters. The BTC liveliness metric slowed down in 2025 | Source: Chain Exposed Since the start of 2025, the liveliness metric points to a holding trend, rather than distribution. BTC has also not seen panic-selling or capitulation during this year’s bull market, as retail already liquidated its holdings during previous bull markets. The recent trend of holding arrived at a time when BTC fluctuated in a new tight range, mostly above $100,000, with the occasional dip to the $80,000 range. This time, even the market drawdown did not create panic-selling. The recent accumulation continued as BTC traded above $109,000 during the latest market recovery. Later, BTC jumped again to $110,360, on track to new all-time peaks. BTC transactions slow down The 2025 market cycle also continues without a deep correction, as drawdowns rarely exceeded 25% of the market price. The perception of BTC also changed, turning from a speculative asset to a store of value. BTC transaction fees also indicate extremely low on-chain activity. Transaction fees range between $0.15 and $0.30, despite the price hovering within a few thousand dollars of a new all-time high. During previous market rallies, transactions would pick up for BTC, often creating network congestion. This cycle, even near-record prices, rarely spikes on-chain activity. At the same time, BTC accumulates into a new set of wallets, with the most rapid growth among wallets holding 100-1,000 and 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. The trend was especially clear in June, when whales accumulated a record 800,000 BTC in a single month. New wallets also shift to holding Almost all cohorts have shifted to holding, though short-term wallets sometimes distribute coins and tokens. Based on the holder heat map, all wallets aged six months or over have gradually increased their balances. By the end of June 2025, around 62% of BTC had not moved for over 12 months . Briefly, some of the whales distributed their coins, though not as dramatically as in previous market cycles. The biggest redistribution followed the 2018 rally, where only 42% of coins remained unmoved in older wallets. The current holding trend also comes from corporate buyers, who are buying new BTC almost daily, with the goal of holding for the long term. 2025, to date, has also shown much more lively inflows of BTC into accumulation addresses. BTC exchange reserves and OTC desks are getting depleted, while coins accumulate in whale wallets, including custodial services. At the same time, speculative trading mostly relies on perpetual futures, using stablecoin liquidity, with little demand for storing and sending BTC.

2025-07-03T14:42:18,"Tether to Mine Bitcoin With Adecoagro in Brazil Using Surplus Renewable Energy","Tether, the digital asset company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT USDT, is exploring renewable energy-powered bitcoin BTC mining with South American agribusiness firm Adecoagro (AGRO) in Brazil. The firms have signed a strategic partnership for a pilot project to use Adecoagro's surplus energy to operate mining facilities and may also add BTC to Adecoagro's balance sheet in the future, according to a Thursday press release . Adecoagro, in which Tether acquired a 70% stake, has 230 megawatt in power generation capacity across South America. The company is a prominent food producer in the region and owns sugar mills, rice farms and dairy operations. ""This project opens the door to stabilizing a portion of the energy we currently sell on the spot market, locking in pricing, while also gaining exposure to the upside potential of bitcoin,"" said Mariano Bosch, co-founder and CEO of Adecoagro. The move underscores Tether's growing ambition in bitcoin mining following its previous investments in mining facility in the region. The firm said it has developed an operating system software for miners called Tether Mining OS, with plans to make it open source in the next months. CEO Paolo Ardoino said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in May that Tether ""will be the biggest bitcoin miner by the end of this year"" and has invested $2 billion in energy production and mining operations.
