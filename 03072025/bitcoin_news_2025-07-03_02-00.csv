2025-07-02T23:45:33,"Popular Design Company Applies For IPO, Filing Shows $70M in BTC ETF Holdings","Apart from the substantial inventory in the leading cryptocurrency, the document also shows that the company purchased $30M in USDC, which it intends to use for future Bitcoin buys. The market expects this to be yet another highly anticipated IPO for 2025, after a failed acquisition by Adobe a few years ago. Cloud-Based Platform With Plans To Go Public Founded in 2012 by a computer scientist and graphics designer, the San Francisco-based company has filed for a public offering with the ticker “FIG”. The idea behind the project was for anyone to “be creative by making free, simple & imaginative tools in a browser”. It seems that it quickly caught on, as just the following year, they secured $3.8 million in seed funding from Index Ventures and Terrence Rohan. From December 2015 to May 2021, the company raised an additional $129 million through A, B, C, and D-series funding, and its total valuation skyrocketed to $10 billion. A series E funding of $200 million was raised in June 2021. Their revenue over the years has not been any less impressive, with the S-1 form stating $749M by the end of 2024, which was a 48% YoY (year-over-year) increase compared to 2023. Some of the names they work with include ServiceNow, Netflix, Airbnb, Stripe, Mercado Libre, AWS, HP, etc. However, they are not exclusive to big businesses, as the services they offer cater to freelancers, solo founders, creative studios, and other small businesses. A Leap Forward After a Step Back The success of Figma was noticed by a big name in the design space – Adobe. In fact, they were so interested, they proposed a deal in September 2022 to buy them for $20 billion. “Adobe’s greatness has been rooted in our ability to create new categories and deliver cutting-edge technologies through organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions,” said Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen. “The combination of Adobe and Figma is transformational and will accelerate our vision for collaborative creativity.” However, this deal was not widely accepted, as some viewed it as overvalued and potentially anticompetitive, given that the site was in direct competition with Adobe’s product, Adobe XD. In February 2023, it was announced that the European Commission would review the deal under the European Union merger laws. Later that same year, Adobe and Figma announced that the merger would be disbanded , as there was “no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the EU Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority.” A $1 billion reverse breakup fee was paid by Adobe to Figma, which was part of their initial agreement. Fast forward to today, the company is still thriving, as evident in the numbers it has presented over the years, and its intention to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bitcoin Treasury Trend Continues Figma is another in a now lengthy line of establishments that have announced they hold BTC. As CryptoPotato reported , interest from corporations in the asset shows no signs of slowing down. For a third consecutive quarter, companies have outpaced the purchases of Bitcoin from exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 141 public and 42 private companies now collectively hold 5.7% of the total circulating supply, while ETFs and other funds hold approximately 7%, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. This direction has been reinforced by the regulatory changes that have brought ease to the crypto world, as CNBC noted , under the Trump administration.

2025-07-02T23:43:42,"Sberbank's CEO not keen on Russia's digital ruble - 'I don't see its advantages'","German Gref, CEO of Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, is making headlines for expressing skepticism about the digital ruble during a financial forum in St. Petersburg on July 2, 2025. His opinion contrasts with Russia’s push to implement the digital ruble , with the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) mandating that banks offer digital ruble payment options by September 1, 2026. Gref struggles to see how digital currencies benefit Russia On Wednesday, German Gref, CEO of Russia’s dominant lender Sberbank , stated that he was having trouble seeing any potential benefits to Russia developing the digital ruble, except for cross-border settlements. According to the central bank last week, Russian banks will have to offer customers the means to make payments with digital rubles from September 1, 2026, postponing the project’s planned launch by over a year. Russia’s interest in the digital ruble comes at a time when over 130 countries are exploring digital versions of their currencies as the world’s financial authorities grapple with declining cash usage and the very real threat to their money-printing powers from new developments like Bitcoin. Moscow will be banking on the digital ruble to simplify foreign trade payments that have been complicated by Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. However Gref is having trouble getting onboard. “I don’t see its advantages,” he told reporters at the financial forum in St. Petersburg. “As an individual, I don’t understand why digital rubles are needed. As a bank… I don’t yet understand it very well either.” Gref highlighted how Russian banks already have strong digital finance capacities, including cashless settlements, before reiterating that he could see no future in which the digital ruble meaningfully transforms Russia’s economy. No digital currency has become dominant within any country, he pointed out, but there could be a future in cross-border settlements. “Domestically, I don’t see it yet,” he said. Other countries are exploring digital currencies As things stand, over one hundred countries and currency unions are seriously considering CBDCs as an answer to various factors, including declining cash use and diversion to cryptocurrencies. Countries like the Bahamas and Jamaica already have their own CBDCs, while others like China, Brazil, India, and Hong Kong have launched CBDC pilot programs. China leads with the largest CBDC pilot, with 260 million people across multiple cities since 2020. Today, its CBDC is used in over 200 retail scenarios and is being pushed for cross-border payments to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Russia’s digital ruble launched its pilot in August 2023 with 15 banks and 9,000 participants as of October 2024. Even though Gref finds it hard to see why Russia needs a digital ruble, there is no doubt it will come in handy where cross-border payments are concerned, especially under sanctions, to bypass systems like SWIFT. In the US, the Federal Reserve has been researching CBDCs, with a focus on improving the domestic payment system. Unfortunately, the chances of the US creating a retail CBDC is almost nonexistent thanks to a May 2024 House bill which prohibits direct issuance as well as President Trump’s executive order banning CBDCs. Instead, the United States is in different stages of passing stablecoin legislation, including the CLARITY, GENIUS and STABLE Acts. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-02T23:30:08,"Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement","Bitcoin (BTC) is now 195 days into its latest sideways movement, which is part of a broader two-year stretch marked by sluggish price action and short-lived rallies. According to a crypto analyst, just 36 days of meaningful gains have defined this cycle, while the rest have been a relentless grind. Still, despite the clear market fatigue and repeated new lows, the analyst insists that the cycle isn’t over yet. Bitcoin Cycle Sees Only 36 Days Of Real Gains The current Bitcoin market cycle is being closely examined, as a new analysis by expert analyst Crypto Con delves deep into the cryptocurrency’s past movements, revealing two full years of sideways price action with only brief periods of upward momentum. The analyst’s chart, titled “Cycle 4 Ranges and Expansions,” highlights a pattern of prolonged range-bound activity interrupted by short bursts of expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move As of now, Crypto Con notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating for 195 consecutive days since December 18, 2024, without setting a new local high. The chart analysis shows that the total time spent in actual upward expansion in the entire cycle is just 5.76 months. Even more interesting is the fact that when isolating the days in which Bitcoin recorded new local highs, the number shrinks to just 36 days. According to the market expert, these expansion bursts are responsible for all of Bitcoin’s significant price increases during its current cycle. Every expansion phase has also occurred within extremely narrow windows—typically just two to five days long. The rest of the cycle after this has been characterized by a consistent sluggish grind and long stretches of price consolidation, where momentum fades and the market struggles to advance. Flattened Price Action Hides Cycles’ Underlying Strength A closer look at the bottom section of Crypto Con’s chart, which removes the expansion bursts, shows how Bitcoin’s price has essentially remained flat or trended lower throughout the cycle. Major sideways phases in 2023 and 2024 lasted 192 days and 238 days, respectively, offering minimum sustained upside. The current 2025 range has now extended close to 200 days, continuing the trend of market inactivity. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Despite the drawn-out stagnation, Crypto Con maintains that this cycle is not over yet. He implies that Bitcoin’s prolonged accumulation and consolidation could be building pressure for a significant breakout. The chart also shows Bitcoin’s next potential upside target between $165,000 and $180,000. Currently the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $106,990, meaning a jump anywhere between these targets would represent price increase of over 54%. If previous patterns hold, BTC’s next major move may arrive swiftly, as past expansions have delivered their impact in just a few trading sessions. Until that moment arrives, Bitcoin remains locked in what is shaping up to be the slowest and possibly the most patient-testing cycle to date.

2025-07-02T22:58:38,"Ethereum’s Buterin reminds devs of crypto's core principles as corporate money enters blockchain","At the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes, co-founder Vitalik Buterin issued a pointed warning about the crypto industry’s popularity, as the industry is attracting mainstream corporate interest like never before. Buterin warned that the fundamental principle of true decentralization may be at risk of being eroded. He urged developers to base their designs on practical tests that place user needs and security first. Ethereum is now at an inflection point In his speech , Buterin stated that the crypto ecosystem stands at an inflection point. Endorsements by corporations and politicians may attract headlines, but they also tempt the network to trade its decentralized roots for convenience and control. According to Buterin , decentralization must grow from catchphrase to concrete user guarantees or risk becoming another hollow promise. To help the community assess whether a system is genuinely decentralized, Buterin introduced three practical tests. First, the walk-away test, where the question of the possibility of users retaining access to their assets if a project’s developers vanish, its servers go offline, has to be answered. Next, the insider attack test: How much damage could a corrupt insider cause? Lastly, the trusted computing base test: How much code must be trusted for security to hold? Buterin pointed out that some layer 2 networks rely on centralized upgrade keys, DeFi platforms use opaque admin controls, and privacy tools based on zero‑knowledge proofs nonetheless leak transaction histories via centralized login components. These “straw-house” systems may appear decentralized in brochures, but crumble under real-world scrutiny. Privacy should be the default, not a feature Buterin also called for privacy to be embedded by default. He criticized projects where anonymity is optional or protected via third‑party login, practices that erode user privacy by exposing transaction activity through centralized server logs. Earlier in the year, Buterin pushed for Ethereum’s protocol code to be simplified, drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s minimalist philosophy. At EthCC, he reinforced that simplicity reduces risk and helps guard against future centralization. The conference keynote included stern reminders that small misalignments, if unchecked, can amplify into systemic threats. Off‑chain bridges, staking intermediaries, or even small Oracle dependencies that look centralized in practice can erode resilience. Recent studies show that a handful of deployers control a disproportionate share of contract activity, suggesting the ecosystem is less distributed than it pretends. A decade of Ethereum and the road ahead This month marks the 10th anniversary of the Ethereum blockchain going live. Recently, Vitalik Buterin has faced pressure from the community to address important leadership issues related to the core protocol. According to sources, if these issues are not addressed, the blockchain risks losing its competitive edge to other rising chains such as Solana. For Buterin, this next phase in Ethereum’s roadmap involves developing systems that can withstand the tests he mentioned and protecting the platform against insider threats. This approach requires a balance between sophisticated engineering and simple, effective solutions. He said that if Ethereum loses the innovative edge that has powered it so far and deviates from its mission of decentralization, it will inevitably become a fleeting phenomenon, just like many other things that have come and gone before it.

2025-07-02T22:39:20,"ChatGPT Predicts XRP, Pepe and Dogecoin Prices by End of 2025","OpenAI’s powerful AI language model, ChatGPT, predicts a strong conclusion for the crypto market as 2025 draws to a close. Bitcoin’s ($BTC) 1.3% gains in the last 24 hours have industry watchers on the edge of their seats, wondering if the world’s leading $2 trillion crypto is about to challenge its recent all-time high after weeks of relative inertia. See, Bitcoin climbed to an unprecedented $111,814 on May 22, injecting renewed optimism into digital asset traders. Escalating tensions in the Middle Eastern switched investors to a risk-off outlook, which rocked not just crypto but also the stock market too, although talk of ceasefires is now injecting some confidence back into the world of asset trading. If technical indicators are anything to go by, bullish traders now believe the sector is on the verge of a monumental rally, potentially surpassing the explosive bull run witnessed in 2021. By analysing a combination of regulatory developments, project fundamentals, and recent price history, ChatGPT predicts that the following altcoins are positioned for substantial gains in the remainder of the year. Ripple ($XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Major Price Surge for This Cross-Border Payments Leader ChatGPT’s projections suggest that Ripple’s XRP is gearing up for a major rally, potentially reaching prices between $5 and $7 before year-end, potentially almost tripling from its current levels near $2.18. Multiple factors support this outlook: the conclusion of Ripple’s prolonged legal clash with the SEC, growing institutional integration, and speculation regarding approval for an XRP spot ETF within the U.S. Previously, the United Nations Capital Development Fund praised XRP for its fast, economical, and regulatory-compliant transaction capabilities, reinforcing its growing and institutional relevance in cross-border payments. Ripple’s legal battle ended in March when the SEC officially dismissed its lawsuit, following a key 2023 court ruling stating that XRP’s retail transactions did not constitute securities sales. This legal clarity reenergised market sentiment across the sector. Currently trading close to $2, analysts have identified $3 as the next resistance level. Should XRP breach this barrier, ChatGPT anticipates a rise to $5 as a realistic target by the end of 2025, with the potential for $7 under highly favourable conditions. Technical charts show parallel falling support and resistance lines forming between January and April to make a shape known as a bullish flag, a classic precursor to significant price advances. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Giant Set for Explosive Gains by Year-End, Predicts ChatGPT Pepe ($PEPE) , inspired by Matt Furie’s renowned frog character, has cemented its place among the top meme coins since its launch. Since late 2024, it has consistently ranked in the top three meme assets by market cap, outperforming all non-dog-themed rivals. Despite spawning a wave of imitators since debuting in April 2023, PEPE maintains dominance through unmatched community engagement and deep liquidity. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla/SpaceX/X, has hinted multiple times on X that he holds PEPE alongside his well-known Dogecoin holdings. Trading at approximately $0.000009517, ChatGPT’s analysis suggests PEPE could potentially quadruple or quintuple in value for holders by year-end. With a current market cap exceeding $4 billion, PEPE remains around 66% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 recorded in December 2024. However, today Pepe is outperforming Bitcoin after adding 2% in the last 24 hours. Technical indicators show a descending wedge pattern forming from November through March, which traditionally signals a trend reversal. Should bullish momentum accelerate, PEPE could retest its previous peak and potentially climb to $0.00003 by fall, setting itself up to hit the highest bullish targets of $0.00004 to $0.00005 by New Year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Ready to Reclaim the Spotlight Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the pioneering meme token, continues to hold a commanding market valuation of around $24.2 billion. Initially launched in 2013 as a parody, it has evolved into a legitimate cryptocurrency with real-world applications and a fiercely dedicated community. Frequently moving in tandem with Bitcoin, Dogecoin combines meme volatility with surprising long-term stability. Currently priced near $0.1612 and showing minimal movement in the past 24 hours, DOGE’s RSI is at 43 and trending higher, indicating some buying momentum is picking up now that Bitcoin is posting green candles again. Additionally, technical charts reveal a steep falling wedge pattern forming from November through April, suggesting the potential for a sharp breakout. ChatGPT predicts DOGE could soar to $1.50 if the broader market enters a bullish phase, representing a possible 9X return. On the adoption front, Dogecoin enjoys strong corporate and celebrity endorsements. Tesla continues to accept DOGE for select merchandise purchases, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal integrate it into payment ecosystems, enhancing its mainstream utility. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Next-Generation Layer-2 Meme Protocol Gearing Up for Impact Beyond established altcoins, ChatGPT predicts a host of new entrants will be vying for our attention by the next bull run. One such emerging project is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Layer-2 protocol with meme coin branding that is currently in presale, fusing viral appeal with robust blockchain utility. Although it has yet to list on major exchanges like Gemini, HYPER has already raised over $1.8 million in presale investments, driven by expectations of 10X gains once it launches. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER adds smart contract functionality to Bitcoin’s ecosystem through its Layer-2 infrastructure. Its Canonical Bridge enables fast, cost-efficient transactions alongside a diverse suite of dApps ranging from DeFi to NFTs. Security audits by Coinsult found no key vulnerabilities, enhancing investor trust. The $HYPER token powers governance, staking, transaction fees, and access to the platform’s services, offering staking yields of up to 427% APY.

2025-07-02T22:05:48,"US Bankruptcy court allows Celsius to progress with lawsuit against Tether over $4 billion in Bitcoin","A US bankruptcy court has allowed the Celsius Network to proceed with its case against Tether, the issuer of USDT Stablecoin. The lawsuit dates back to the 2022 crypto market crash, which led to Celsius’ bankruptcy. In its lawsuit , Celsius accused Tether of wrongfully selling up to 39,500 Bitcoin worth over $4 billion, which it held as collateral for Celsius. The firm reportedly sold the BTC after the price crash. However, the crypto lender claimed that the sale. The bankrupt firm said that the sale violates its agreement with Tether, which required the stablecoin issuer to give 10 hours’ notice before it sells any collateral. Celsius has claimed significant losses and will likely seek damages. Tether had tried to halt the lawsuit by requesting the court to dismiss it, noting in its submission that the sale followed due process and that the US court lacked jurisdiction over the matter as the transactions were international. However, the trial judge, Martin Glenn, disagreed and dismissed this submission. In his decision, the judge said there were many compelling reasons for the court to entertain the case, especially when the people, system, and accounts used in the transaction by Tether are domiciled in the US. The court added that Celsius can move on with the vital parts of its lawsuit, which include fraudulent transfer, preferential transfer, and breach of contract. However, it dismissed other claims by Celsius, citing jurisdiction and insufficient evidence. Still, the decision to preserve the breach of contract claim means that Celsius could be entitled to damages if the court finds Tether liable. Tether USDT supply reaches $158 billion Meanwhile, Tether USDT supply does not seem affected by the development, as it reached an all-time high of over $158 billion after a 3% gain in the past month. The surge in market cap shows how the stablecoin continues to grow and dominate the sector, even as Circle USDC appears to be the more regulatory-compliant option. Beyond that, Tether has also been busy with other investments, including recent efforts to have a bigger say in decision-making at Juventus Football Club, which has over 10% stake. With $13 billion in profits for 2024, the company appears to have a solid financial footing. However, critics continue to question the company’s status and whether it has sufficient reserves to back the over $158 billion in USDT it has issued. The recent ruling has now added to the concerns around the company. What is next for Tether? Although the full trial has not happened, the ruling is a setback for Tether. The firm tried to get the court to dismiss the case and described it as “shakedown litigation,” noting that Celsius is to blame for its failure. However, the court decision suggests that Celsius might have a case. Still, it is too early to determine what will happen, and even Judge Glen acknowledged this. He noted that several factors, such as the time of the sale and whether it was over 10 hours, will determine whether the sale was legal. Meanwhile, Tether is already facing some regulatory challenges in the US. With the Senate passing the GENIUS Act and the proposed regulation expected to become law, many believe the Tether business could be affected. Experts believe that the proposed law will affect how stablecoin issuers operate and could make it difficult for offshore companies like Tether to continue operating in the US. However, the company had already said it might issue a new stablecoin for the US market. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said this earlier this year and has promoted the GENIUS Act as welcome legislation. This differs from how the company has approached the European Union’s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-02T22:00:24,"Bitcoin 30D Active Supply Drops 17%: Just Like It Did Before The Late 2024 Rally","Bitcoin is up 45% since bottoming out near $75,000 in April and is now trading just under 4% away from its all-time high of $112,000. After weeks of consolidation and multiple failed breakout attempts, the market is entering a critical phase. Price action in the coming days will likely determine the next major move—either a clean push into price discovery or a pullback into key support levels around $103,600 and $100,000. Momentum has been building steadily, with bullish sentiment returning as macro conditions stabilize. However, investors remain cautious, awaiting confirmation from Bitcoin’s price structure before making aggressive moves. Data from CryptoQuant adds another layer to the current setup. The 30-day change in Bitcoin’s active supply percentage is sitting at -17%, a significant drop in activity. This metric tracks whether more or fewer coins are moving compared to a month ago. The current reading suggests declining on-chain activity , often a sign of market hesitation or long-term holders stepping back. Bitcoin On the Edge of Expansion As On-Chain Metrics Flash Opportunity The crypto market is heating up alongside US equities, which recently surged to new all-time highs. As macroeconomic uncertainty fades and risk appetite returns, Bitcoin sits at a pivotal moment. Bulls remain in control after a 45% rally from April’s $75K low, but to confirm the next leg up, BTC must decisively break into price discovery above the $112K resistance level. A key on-chain metric suggests that conditions are aligning for such a move. Axel Adler explains that the “% Supply Active, 30D Change” tracks the percentage growth or decline in Bitcoin’s active supply over the past month. It measures how much of the supply has moved in the last six months and compares it to the same figure 30 days ago. When this value is positive, coin movement is accelerating—typically seen during high-volatility uptrends. When it’s negative, activity is slowing down, signaling accumulation or hesitation. Currently, this value stands at -17%, indicating a marked drop in activity. That may seem bearish on the surface, but it mirrors the conditions seen in September 2024, just before a major rally began. The logic is simple: when fewer coins move and supply becomes more static, a tightening effect builds. Once demand returns, it often leads to sharp upward moves. In short, the low activity hints at a potential breakout window. Bitcoin is consolidating just below its all-time high, supported by favorable macro conditions and low on-chain velocity. If history is any guide, a sudden surge in activity—triggered by a move into new highs—could mark the beginning of the next expansion phase. All eyes are now on BTC’s next move. BTC Weekly Chart Analysis: Bullish Momentum Builds Below All-Time Highs Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows continued strength as price action consolidates just below the $112,000 all-time high. At the time of writing, BTC trades near $107,795, comfortably above the critical support zone at $103,600 and showing consistent higher lows since April. The 50-week moving average is rising sharply and now sits at $85,961, well below the current range, reinforcing the medium-term uptrend. Despite recent rejections near the $109,300 resistance, bulls have defended weekly closes above $100K and maintained momentum within a tight bullish flag structure. Volume has tapered off slightly, suggesting that traders are waiting for confirmation before committing to large positions. However, the lack of aggressive selling pressure indicates that market participants expect a breakout rather than a breakdown. If BTC breaks and closes above $109,300 on the weekly timeframe, the move would likely trigger stop orders and momentum-driven buying, pushing the price into uncharted territory. A failure to break resistance could result in another retest of the $103,600 level, which has acted as a strong floor throughout Q2 2025.

2025-07-02T22:00:07,"Bitcoin Consolidates Below Resistance — Can It Seal A Weekly Close Over $107,720?","Bitcoin is at a pivotal point, and the weekly close could define its next move. To confirm bullish continuation and strengthen market confidence, BTC needs to secure a solid weekly close above $107,720. Bitcoin Weekly Candle Could Set The Stage For A Run Bitcoin is approaching a make-or-break moment, but if BTC can secure a strong weekly close above $107,720, it could trigger a move toward the $130,000 to $135,000 range in Q3. This key level is acting as a resistance zone, and breaking it could unlock a new wave of bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence – Altseason Could Be Near SatheMeme_Expert revealed on X that a similar setup had appeared in Q4 2024, when BTC posted its biggest weekly close of the year. The result was an unstoppable rally that shattered resistance and fueled one of the strongest bullish legs of the cycle. The weekly chart shows Bitcoin is trading within a well-defined historical parallel channel. As mentioned by Pinnacle_Crypto, this channel has previously marked a breakout point in October 2023 and October 2024, which fueled upward moves. If this pattern continues, BTC could be on track to reach the $150,916 target in October 2025. The channel provides a roadmap, with key breakouts that signal the start of rallies. Alongside, price dips will serve as accumulation zones. Crypto analyst Gemxbt also highlighted that Bitcoin’s 1-hour chart is currently in a downward trend, but the price is attempting to bounce off a support zone near $106.500. So far, this area is holding firm, providing a foundation for buyers to step in, and technical indicators support this potential shift. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recovering from oversold levels, hinting that selling momentum is waning, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is nearing a bullish crossover, which could signal the start of upward momentum. However, for a meaningful reversal to hold, BTC must overcome the critical resistance near $108,500. A breakout above with sustained volume will be crucial to confirm the trend and bullish momentum. Consolidation Phase Matures — Breakout May Be Imminent BTC is consolidating inside a descending channel formation on the daily chart, a pattern that typically reflects a phase with a broader trend. Dynamite Trader emphasized that BTC is currently trading above the 50-day moving average (MA 50), a technical level that is now solid for the bulls. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Just Realized $2.6B In Profit, Is the Market About to Crack or Soar? A breakout above the descending channel would mark a shift in sentiment and momentum, potentially triggering a bullish continuation toward the $120,000 region, the next psychosocial target on the macro chart. According to MiraCrypto, Bitcoin has shown a strong breakout from the descending channel on the 1-day chart, signaling a shift in momentum. BTC is now consolidating above the resistance, which has turned into support. This consolidation above the breakout levels is a bullish continuation signal seen before the next leg higher. MiraCrypto noted that as long as BTC holds this zone, the path remains open for a move toward $135,000. featured Image from Istock images, chart from tradingveiw.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-consolidates-below-resistance/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Dynamite trader|Gemxbt|MiraCrypto|Pinnacle_Crypto|SatheMeme_Expert",cryptocompare
2025-07-02T21:54:32,"These Bullish Catalysts Could Spark Bitcoin’s Explosion To $200,000 By Year-End: Standard Chartered Exec","British multinational bank Standard Chartered has forecasted massive gains for Bitcoin, predicting a potential rocket surge to $200,000 in the second half of this year. Historically, Bitcoin has slumped months after the halving, a quadrennial event that slows the growth rate in top crypto’s supply. This time, growing ETF inflows and increased corporate treasury buying are expected to kill that pattern, according to Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. Bitcoin Halving Cycle Is Dead Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick told clients in a Wednesday report that the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle “is dead.” While the two previous halving cycles in 2016 and 2020 resulted in Bitcoin prices sinking in roughly 18 months after the halving, the impact of the latest Bitcoin halving in April 2024 will likely be different. Although he believes the maiden crypto will likely defy historical post-halving patterns, he warned it won’t all be smooth sailing. “We think prices could be choppy in late Q3 and early Q4 amid concerns about this pattern being repeated,” Kendrick said. “However, we expect prices to resume their uptrend, supported by continued strong ETF and Bitcoin treasury buying.” The analyst ultimately expects Bitcoin to reach $135,000 by September 30, and doubled down on his $200,000 target for December 31. Bitcoin Headed For “Best Ever” Second Half Of The Year: Standard Chartered Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and treasury buyers snapped up a total of 245,000 BTC during the second quarter. Kendrick forecasts that figure will be surpassed in the coming months as allocations continue and an increasing list of public companies emulate Strategy’s BTC acquisition playbook. The banker observed that both the BTC treasury company demand and spot ETFs were missing in all the prior halving cycles. As such, he believes Bitcoin is on course to set a record above its previous record high of $111,814, set on May 22. “Bitcoin to print new all-time highs in H2,” Kendrick stated. Michael Saylor’s Strategy popularized the Bitcoin treasury strategy, pivoting from its software development focus in late 2020. The Nasdaq-listed firm, which has been buying BTC almost every week over the last year, now owns 597,325 Bitcoin worth around $65 billion based on current market prices. Kendrick also cited macro tailwinds, including a possible early announcement by President Donald Trump naming a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the passage of the landmark GENIUS stablecoin legislation , as other catalysts that could fuel further upside for Bitcoin, the report added. Bitcoin was trading hands at around $109,420 as of publication time after gaining 3.3% over the last 24 hours. It’s trading 1.9% above where it was a week ago, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/these-bullish-catalysts-could-spark-bitcoins-explosion-to-200000-by-year-end-standard-chartered-exec/,"BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-02T21:50:58,"Trump Family Rakes In $620M+ From Crypto: Meme coin Windfall, Token Sales, and a 20% Bitcoin Stake","U.S. President Donald Trump and his family have reportedly earned over $620 million from recent cryptocurrency ventures. A report published Wednesday by Bloomberg stated that Trump’s crypto holdings now make up around 9% of his estimated $6 billion fortune as of June. This marks the first time digital assets have accounted for a sizable portion of his wealth. Trump’s Crypto Empire Grows as Real Estate Shrinks to 50% of Net Worth The increase is largely tied to his family-backed firm, World Liberty Financial, and the launch of his personal meme coin, TRUMP, which currently trades around $8.89. The family’s push into crypto has accelerated quickly. Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also taken active roles, as their holdings and ventures expand across tokenized assets, mining infrastructure, and stablecoin platforms. According to Bloomberg, the Trump family's earnings from projects such as World Liberty Financial and TRUMP Memecoins have estimated that Trump's wealth has increased by at least $620 million in just a few months. USD1 stablecoins may earn WLFI about $100 million this year.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 2, 2025 In comparison, just three years ago, Trump’s wealth was still heavily concentrated in real estate, which made up 86% of his net worth in 2021. That number has since dropped to around 50%. One of the biggest earners has been World Liberty Financial. The project includes a native token and a stablecoin, USD1. Since its launch, World Liberty has raised $550 million in token sales , with $390 million going to Trump and his three sons. The family also reportedly holds 22.5 billion governance tokens from the project, valued at over $2 billion, though most of those tokens are currently locked. Trump’s stake in the company was also recently reduced from 60% to 40%. In addition, the platform was used in a $2 billion transaction by Abu Dhabi-based MGX, which reportedly used the token to invest in Binance. According to estimates, the Trump-linked firm may have earned up to $100 million from that transaction alone. Trump’s sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also taken direct stakes in crypto mining. The two are listed as 20% owners of American Bitcoin , a subsidiary of Hut 8, a large crypto mining firm. Trump son Eric Trump-backed American Bitcoin intends to use the net proceeds from $220 million raised in a new share issuance to fund for Bitcoin equipment purchase. #EricTrump #AmericanBitcoin #Hut8 https://t.co/23zTABD4tb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 The company disclosed in June that it had secured $220 million in capital to purchase mining equipment and Bitcoin. It also plans to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. While much of Trump’s personal fortune still sits in real estate and his media company, Truth Social, the rapid gains from crypto are shifting the structure of his financial empire. At its peak, Truth Social helped push Trump’s net worth to over $4 billion. The company’s valuation has since declined, but his stake remains worth nearly $2 billion despite posting a $401 million loss last year. With real estate now playing a smaller role and political ambitions still in view, Trump’s crypto involvement appears to be moving from experimental to entrenched. Donald Trump’s memecoin , $TRUMP, which gained attention after a controversial “ Presidential Dinner ” for its top 220 holders and a VIP tour offer, is now facing a steep decline. Once valued at around $150 million, Trump’s reported stake is tied to TRUMP tokens that will gradually unlock over the next three years. The token, driven largely by celebrity backing and political hype, has lost momentum since the late May dinner event. With no new endorsements and fading retail interest, TRUMP has dropped over 46%, showing the volatility of hype-based crypto projects. Trump-Backed Ventures Accelerate Crypto Push With Bitcoin, ETFs & UAE Investment Trump’s crypto ambitions are far from over as he advances with Bitcoin, ETFs, and token strategies. For example, on June 13, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a registration statement from Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) tied to its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement linked to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. #Trump #TruthSocial https://t.co/ybidUAZtqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 14, 2025 The filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million tied to convertible notes. While the approval gives the firm flexibility to raise capital, TMTG stated it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. This followed a May 27 announcement confirming a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin . TMTG CEO Devin Nunes called Bitcoin an “apex instrument of financial freedom,” indicating a strategic shift to make it a core part of the company’s treasury. TMTG also filed plans on June 16 to launch a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF , which would directly hold both assets, with a 75/25 allocation favoring Bitcoin. Meanwhile, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is gearing up to release a third-party audit of its stablecoin and launch a mobile app, co-founder Zak Folkman said on June 26. Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial plans to release a stablecoin audit and debut a new app soon, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed Wednesday. #Trump #WLFI https://t.co/yVPQqslR4F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 That same day, WLFI announced a $100 million token purchase by a UAE-based firm , Aqua1 Foundation, now its largest external stakeholder. Aqua1 seeks to expand WLFI’s footprint in real-world asset tokenization, DeFi infrastructure, and stablecoin development, surpassing previous major backers like Justin Sun, who had committed $30 million . Together, the developments reflect growing momentum behind Trump-affiliated crypto ventures.

2025-07-02T21:42:33,"SkyBridge Capital’s Scaramucci Warns Crypto Treasury Craze Will Fade, Despite Saylor Effect","Key Takeaways: SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci said the wave of companies adopting crypto treasury strategies will decline. He questioned investors’ willingness to pay premiums for firms holding crypto assets. Companies like BitMine and Metaplanet are emulating Strategy’s approach, often with prominent public figures attached. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, said the trend of public companies adopting crypto treasury models will decline, according to a report published by Bloomberg. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” Scaramucci said. “So, you know, it will fade.” He questioned the logic of paying a premium for equity in firms that hold crypto when investors could buy the underlying assets themselves. Scaramucci Warns of Crypto Treasury Trent Several companies have mirrored Strategy’s model of using corporate balance sheets to hold Bitcoin or other tokens. BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced a $250 million placement to support an Ethereum treasury and appointed Fundstrat founder Thomas Lee as board chair. Other firms have added high-profile advisers to boost visibility. Eric Trump sits on the board of Metaplanet, while Joe Lubin chairs SharpLink Gaming, which also shifted its focus to Ethereum holdings. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now,” Scaramucci said. While expressing long-term confidence in Bitcoin, he said investors should evaluate each firm’s structure and cost profile. “I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on Bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies,” he said. Public companies acquired about 131,000 coins in the second quarter, growing their bitcoin balance 18%, according to data provider Bitcoin Treasuries. ETFs showed an 8% increase or about 111,000 BTC in the same period. https://t.co/Nyiquq8Ync — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 1, 2025 According to the report, SkyBridge’s ETF, which includes Strategy among its largest holdings, competes with other funds and crypto treasury firms for investor attention. Despite the broader trend, Strategy has outperformed most crypto ETFs this year. Investor Doubts and Regulatory Questions The funding model for Strategy’s purchases has shifted over time, from stock and debt issuance to preferred share sales. The concept has drawn criticism, including from short-seller Jim Chanos, who called it “financial gibberish.” Scaramucci posed a practical question for investors: “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well?” “Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that’s an issue.” Critics argue that firms structured around token holdings may blur the line between operating businesses and passive investment vehicles, complicating shareholder expectations and disclosures. The trend also intersects with emerging regulatory scrutiny. Oversight bodies may revisit listing rules, disclosure practices, and capital allocation policies. Any shift in enforcement or accounting treatment could reshape how corporate crypto strategies are designed or whether they remain viable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why do investors pay premiums for treasury companies rather than buying crypto directly? Some investors prefer regulated equity exposure for accessibility or tax reasons. Others may rely on company governance or believe in additional business value. However, critics argue the added cost may not justify the indirect exposure. What accounting rules apply to crypto held on corporate balance sheets? Current U.S. GAAP treats crypto as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Companies must record impairment losses if prices fall but cannot mark up assets if values rise, potentially distorting reported financials. Are there tax implications for companies holding crypto? Corporate crypto gains are taxed under capital gains rules, and transaction-based holdings may trigger complex reporting requirements. Jurisdictional rules vary and can influence how strategies are structured.

The bankrupt crypto lender filed suit against Tether last year, alleging that Tether improperly liquidated nearly 40,000 bitcoins — worth over $4.3 billion at today’s prices — that it was holding as loan collateral in June 2022, shortly before Celsius halted withdrawals. In their suit, Celsius’ lawyers argued that Tether didn’t give Celsius enough time to satisfy its collateral demands, which they claimed it had “sufficient Bitcoin on its balance sheet” to do so “given that Celsius had instituted a ‘pause’ on customer withdrawals … resulting in the retention of, and access to, a significant amount of Bitcoin.” “If Celsius had been given the opportunity to meet the collateral demand — which it had a contractual right to do — it could have been able to avoid the disposition of its Bitcoin at near the bottom of the cryptocurrency market,” Celsius’ lawyers wrote. “Instead, that disposition was carried out for the benefit of just one creditor: Tether.” At the time the suit was filed, Tether pledged to fight it , calling the suit “baseless” and a “shameless litigation money grab” in a press statement. Tether claimed that Celsius executives directed the liquidation of its BTC collateral held by Tether in “in order to close out its roughly 815 million USDT position” with the company. Read more: Tether to Fight Celsius’ $3.3 Billion ‘Shakedown’ Litigation “Rather than recognize the clear validity of the agreement entered into years before Celsius’ bankruptcy, this lawsuit seeks to improperly impose the costs of Celsius’ mismanagement and failure on Tether,” the company’s statement said. However, the judge overseeing the case disagreed with Tether, arguing in his Monday order that Celsius’ then-CEO Alex Mashinsky’s — who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for fraud in May — ”alleged oral permission” given to Tether to liquidate Celsius’ bitcoin collateral was “insufficient” and that not giving Celsius the 10-hour window to post collateral allotted by the two firms’ contract could still be a breach of contract, verbal permission or not. In his June 30th order, Chief Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) granted threw out only one count of the amended complaint, Count 4, which alleged that Tether breached the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing” under British Virgin Islands law. For that count, Glenn decided to dismiss it without prejudice, giving Celsius’ lawyers the opportunity to amend it with “facts sufficient to bring themselves within the requirements of BVI law.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/02/ny-bankruptcy-judge-gives-celsius-the-green-light-to-pursue-usd4-3b-lawsuit-against-tether,"USDT|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|Tether|Celsius|Bankruptcy|News",cryptocompare

This move is a first for a major Belgian bank. According to a statement from KBC, the regulatory process required to gain official recognition as a crypto asset service provider is currently under analysis. The bank expects this process to be completed and approval to be received by the fall. Once approved, individual investors will be able to purchase BTC and ETH directly through KBC’s secure platform. The bank states that special attention will be paid to user education, security and legal compliance. The move makes KBC the first major Belgian bank to announce concrete plans to offer cryptocurrency services. Until now, Belgian investors have generally had to turn to foreign platforms such as Binance, Coinbase and OKX, or digital banks such as Revolut and N26 for their crypto investments.

Belfius says it is exploring how to adapt to the crypto market through its investment platform Re=bel. ING Belgium says it is examining the issue “very carefully,” while BNP Paribas Fortis says it has no plans to offer any crypto-related services. Large banks in Europe have long shied away from the sector due to regulatory uncertainty, money laundering risks, and the high volatility of crypto assets. However, the introduction of the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation regulating crypto asset markets has changed the situation as banks no longer need extensive new licenses to enter the digital asset space. A similar development took place in Germany. This week, regional German banks known as Sparkassen announced that individual customers will be able to buy and sell BTC and ETH via mobile apps starting in 2026. Spain’s second-largest bank, BBVA, also announced last March that it was developing a product for crypto investments. According to industry experts, the intense interest in cryptocurrencies is forcing banks to take action in this area.

2025-07-02T21:15:46,"Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Snapped: $350M Outflows End 15-Day Run","On July 1, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant net outflow of approximately $342 million, marking a sharp reversal in investor sentiment. This shift is marked by the first outflow since June 6, and interrupted a period of sustained demand that had pushed cumulative net inflows to about $49 billion and total ETF assets under management (AUM) above $131 billion. Breaking Down the Reversal Data from SoSoValue shows that Fidelity’s FBTC led the outflows with a net withdrawal of $172.73 million, followed closely by Grayscale’s GBTC at $119.51 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) also saw notable outflows of $27.03 million and $22.98 million, respectively. Interestingly, the biggest ETF by AUM, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), recorded zero flows for the day, neither adding nor shedding assets, to halt its own significant accumulation run . VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW also ushered in July with zero flows. In total, SoSoValue put the daily outflow figure at $342.25 million, despite a trading volume of more than $2.7 billion across all spot BTC ETFs. The pullback comes after a two-week run of inflows, exceeding $500 million on at least three different occasions in that period. On June 24, ETFs absorbed $588.55 million, followed by $547.72 million on June 25 and $501.27 million on June 27. All told, the surge propelled total cumulative net inflows across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to a high of $48.97 billion by June 30. But Monday’s outgoings dragged that figure back down to $48.63 billion. The last time the ETFs experienced a drop was on June 6, when the market recorded a net outflow of just under $48 million following a much larger $278.44 million exit on June 5. Institutional Demand Shifting Beyond ETFs This latest slowdown has coincided with reports that public corporations are ramping up their Bitcoin accumulation, buying 131,000 BTC in the second quarter of 2025 to overshadow ETF inflows of 111,000 BTC in the same period. According to BitcoinTreasuries, this is the third consecutive quarter in which public companies have picked up more BTC than exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, at the time of this writing, the OG cryptocurrency had recorded a modest 24-hour gain of 0.1% within a range of $105,402 to $107,139. In the last seven days, it oscillated between $105,430 and $108,706, posting a 0.5% gain. Zooming out, we see a 1.7% increase over 30 days and a substantial 70.6% surge over the past year, which still puts it 4.3% below its all-time high of $111,814 reached on May 22, 2025.

The flagship coin surged 4 percent on Wednesday, July 2, to trade at about $109,420 during the mid-North American trading session. However, BTC price has not fully invalidated the midterm bearish sentiment. As Coinpedia reported , BTC price faced midterm bearish sentiment caused by significant cumulative short leverage trades and consistent negative funding rates. Factors that Will Impact Bitcoin Price Action in July As Coinpedia has pointed out, BTC price has gradually mirrored the exponential growth of the global money supply (M2). The need by the U.S. government to increase its budget deficit implies more money supply in the near term, which is extremely bullish for Bitcoin. The performance of BTC in July will be heavily influenced by the performance of the U.S. spot BTC ETFs. Led by BlackRock’s IBIT, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded a net cash inflow of about $12.8 billion in the last three months. Meanwhile, monitoring the performance of major companies, which have implemented a Bitcoin treasury management plan, in July will help determine BTC price action. Furthermore, the rising demand from institutional investors has caused a sharp decline of disposable coins on centralized exchanges thus exaggerating the supply vs demand shock. Midterm Targets BTC price has rallied above a crucial resistance logarithmic trendline following Wednesday’s pump. The flagship coin is now well-positioned to rally towards a new all-time high if the buyers maintain above $109k in the coming weeks. $BTC it's happening pic.twitter.com/GvtdfkEoa9 — CryptoBoss (@CryptoBoss1984) July 2, 2025 According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan , BTC price could rally beyond its ATH in July fueled by easing geopolitical tension and rising demand from institutional investors. The bullish sentiment in July is also bolstered by the fact that BTC has majorly recorded gains in more Julys in the last ten years. The midterm bullish sentiment will, however, be invalidated if BTC price retraces towards the lower border of the falling channel, around the support range between $92k and $96k.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-bitcoin-price-poised-for-a-historical-rally-in-july-fueled-by-institutional-investors/,"TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The bank plans to offer Bitcoin and Ether investments through its Bolero investment platform later this year. According to a local source, KBC said it is currently undergoing an assessment to obtain recognition as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP). The process is expected to conclude by autumn. KBC Pushes Into Crypto as European Banks Catch Up to Investor Demand A KBC spokesperson said the platform would offer retail investors access to Bitcoin and Ether “within a trusted framework, with a focus on education, security, and regulatory compliance.” Bolero, the bank’s online investment arm, will host the crypto offerings. If approved by regulators, the rollout could begin by the end of 2025. This would place KBC ahead of its domestic rivals in the retail crypto market. According to L'Écho, starting this autumn, users will be able to purchase BTC and ETH through Bolero, the investment platform of KBC, one of Belgium's largest banks, marking a first for a major Belgian bank. KBC expects to receive regulatory approval as a crypto-asset service… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 2, 2025 Belgian customers currently rely on foreign exchanges such as Binance , Coinbase , and OKX to access crypto. Others turn to digital banking apps like Revolut and N26, which have integrated crypto services in recent years. The move by KBC comes amid a broader shift among European banks toward digital asset integration. A recent study by Bitpanda found that while over 40% of business investors in Europe already hold cryptocurrencies, only 19% of financial institutions believe there is strong demand. The report pointed to a gap between investor behavior and the perception among banks. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Bitpanda’s deputy CEO, said , “Financial institutions in Europe know that crypto is here to stay, but most are still not offering services that match investor demand.” The same is true for capital market players too – where European institutions are probably a couple of years ahead. Example: Deutsche Boerse, the main German stock exchange, will provide $btc and $eth custody. Plus, both in the EU and in Switzerland, you can now launch fully… https://t.co/7VGXOYuFaW — Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) March 20, 2025 Despite the hesitation, some banks are beginning to take notice. The same survey found that 18% of institutions plan to expand their crypto-related offerings, particularly in areas like transfers and trading. A separate report from Coincub earlier this year found that over 60 banks in Europe currently offer some form of crypto service . Institutions like BBVA Switzerland, Standard Chartered, and Barclays have all deepened their crypto involvement. While the bank has emphasized a cautious and regulated approach, it appears to be responding to growing interest from retail clients. If the CASP registration is secured, KBC will join a small but growing group of European banks bringing crypto trading into their core platforms. The final decision is expected in the fall, and all eyes will be on how other banks in the region respond. Europe’s Regulatory Shift Sparks Wave of Bank-Backed Bitcoin Services KBC Bank’s entry into retail crypto trading could mark the beginning of a broader trend across Europe, as traditional financial institutions ramp up their digital asset services under the European Union’s newly implemented MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation . MiCA, which came into force in 2024, has set unified standards for crypto operations across the European Economic Area (EEA). In just the first half of 2025, major crypto exchanges like OKX, Coinbase, Bybit, and Crypto.com secured licenses under the framework. The result is a more competitive, regulated European crypto market and increasing pressure on legacy banks to follow suit. Several of Europe’s largest financial players are already responding. Germany’s Deutsche Bank is reportedly preparing to launch a crypto custody service in 2026 , collaborating with Austrian exchange Bitpanda and tech firm Taurus, which Deutsche Bank has backed. @DeutscheBank plans to roll out a digital assets custody service in 2026, partnering with @Bitpanda ’s technology arm to build the platform. #Deutsche #Crypto https://t.co/xdnBFQULqY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Meanwhile, Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, Germany’s largest banking group with 50 million customers, plans to allow direct Bitcoin and Ether trading via its mobile app by summer 2026.

The group describes it as “reliable access to a regulated crypto offering.” In Spain, BBVA has already been advising its affluent clients to allocate a portion of their portfolios—up to 7%—to Bitcoin and other digital assets. As European regulators prepare further guidance , including clarifying rules for cross-border stablecoin use, MiCA appears to be positioning the EU as a global leader in crypto oversight. EU stablecoin interchangeability under MiCA clarified: licensed EU tokens treated as equivalent to non-EU tokens. #Stablecoin #MiCA https://t.co/7I5C1txxr5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 For banks like KBC, the clarity may not just offer regulatory cover but also unlock long-term opportunity in digital finance.

2025-07-02T20:30:15,"Bit Digital Bets Big on Ethereum With $21.4M Public Offering","Bit Digital, a company listed on the Nasdaq, recently announced it has raised an extra $21.4 million to support its new focus on Ethereum (ETH). This money came from underwriters who decided to purchase additional shares following a public offering last week. With this additional funding, Bit Digital plans to expand its Ethereum treasury and shift its focus away from Bitcoin mining. This move positions the firm at the center of a growing trend among public companies that are choosing crypto assets as part of their treasury strategies. Public Offering Brings Total Proceeds to $162.9M Bit Digital’s public offering has now reached a total of 86.25 million shares. This has generated approximately $162.9 million in total proceeds for the company. The new funds will be used to purchase Ethereum and to support Bit Digital’s long-term plan to transition away from Bitcoin mining. In June 2025, Bit Digital officially announced it would stop all Bitcoin mining operations. Instead, it will focus on holding and staking Ethereum. Bit Digital to Sell Bitcoin Holdings and Buy More Ethereum Unlike most public crypto firms, such as MARA, which mainly hold Bitcoin in their treasuries , Bit Digital is taking a different path. As part of this transition, the firm plans to convert its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings into Ethereum over time. Currently, the company holds approximately 417.6 BTC, valued at around $44.9 million. These funds will eventually be used to grow its Ethereum treasury. Meanwhile, Bit Digital already owns a large amount of Ethereum. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, the company held 24,434.2 ETH. At that time, one ETH was worth $2,444, meaning the firm’s ETH holdings were valued at approximately $59.8 million. The company began buying and staking crypto in 2022, indicating that this change has been underway for some time. A Trend Among Crypto Miners Bit Digital is not alone. Other Bitcoin mining firms are starting to follow a similar path. BitMine Immersion Technologies, another mining company, recently shared plans to raise $250 million to build its own Ethereum treasury. Earlier, it raised $18 million from share sales to buy Bitcoin, but it is now shifting its focus toward Ethereum. This move reflects a broader trend among companies to diversify their crypto holdings beyond Bitcoin . Under the current U.S. administration, which supports crypto innovation, this strategy is becoming more popular . Many firms now view cryptocurrencies like ETH, SOL, and XRP as viable long-term assets. Following the news of the extra funding, Bit Digital’s shares jumped nearly 4% in after-hours trading. The company’s market capitalization also increased to $594 million, up from $488 million the week before. This strong market response shows growing investor confidence in the firm’s Ethereum-focused strategy.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says the S&P 500 is in the midst of the “most hated V-shaped” rally after the stock market index recovered from a 2025 low of 4,835 to a new all-time high of 6,215 points. According to Lee, many investors dumped their stock holdings during the market’s early-year decline, only to be left on the sidelines as equities staged a strong rebound. “A lot of folks liquidated at the lows, but we know that whenever the VIX (volatility index) is above 60 and falls below 30, you’ve made a decisive low. And now visibility is better, tariffs aren’t as bad as we expected, and the inflation impact has been very muted, and outside of tariffs, [underlying] inflation is much lower than people expected.” Looking ahead, Lee believes that there’s no reason to be bearish on the S&P 500 after casting off five shocks in half a decade. “I think there’s more upside to 6,600 [points] because the P/E (price to earnings) of the market can go up a lot. We already had five shocks. We had the Covid shock, the supply-chain shock, the inflation shock, the Fed-fastest-hikes-in-history [shock] and then we had the tariff shock. So five shocks in five years, and earnings kept growing. If this was a stock, we’d say, ‘Look if you try to kill it five times and it still grew earnings, we would put a much higher multiple.” As of Monday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,198 points.

2025-07-02T20:00:08,"Market Roundup: How Major Cryptos Moved This Week","This week in crypto brought a blend of resilience and hesitation across major assets. Bitcoin tested resistance, Ethereum showed signs of consolidation, and Solana continued to battle bearish pressure. While gains were mixed, the underlying setups hint at brewing volatility and opportunities ahead. Whether you're tracking momentum or hunting early signals, the latest movements are worth your attention. This roundup is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native agency that aligns high-precision storytelling with real-time market insight. Bitcoin Bears Hold Ground as Bulls Struggle to Gain Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently in a tug-of-war between its bulls and bears, with prices bouncing between around $102,000 and nearly $110,000. The nearest resistance sits at close to $114,000, and it has struggled to break past this level. The bears seem to have a slight edge as Bitcoin’s price recently dipped by over 5% this month. However, there's still hope for bulls, as long-term trends show a growth of 9% over six months. To ignite a stronger rally, Bitcoin would need to surge roughly 15% from its current range to breach $122,000, where a significant resistance level lies. Ethereum Struggles to Break Out, Bulls Await Key Resistance Level Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is hovering between two and a half to three thousand dollars, showing a minor decline in recent weeks. The bulls seem hesitant but remain hopeful as they eye the three thousand sixty-dollar mark as a potential breakout point. The recent downtrend of about five percent over the week suggests caution, but the situation isn’t overly bleak yet. If Ethereum can rally past the top resistance barrier, it might push toward nearly three thousand five hundred, marking a potential climb of around twenty-five percent. However, if it dips below the support level of around two thousand one hundred eighty-five, a further decline might be on the horizon. Currently, market trends indicate a testing time for Ethereum enthusiasts. Solana Struggles as Bears Take the Lead Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, showing signs of bearish momentum. Its price has slipped over 4% this week, nearly 18% this past month, and over 21% in the last six months, reflecting weakness in bullish support. With an RSI around 50, the market isn't oversold or overbought, but bears seem to dominate. Resistance is around $181, with stronger resistance at $208, making these levels crucial for any bullish breakout. Support is found at $126.67 and further down at $99.27, which might see testing if the bearish trend continues. Solana's potential upside from its current range could reach 25% if bulls can reclaim momentum and aim for resistance levels.

2025-07-02T19:58:12,"Ethereum-linked stocks jumped as companies shifted reserves from bitcoin to ETH","Ethereum-linked stocks saw a sharp boost on Wednesday, as companies pivoting toward ETH strategies caught the attention of traders. The rally came while hype around stablecoins and tokenization picked up again across the crypto industry, according to reporting from CNBC. The biggest gainer was BitMine Immersion Technologies, a bitcoin mining firm that decided this week to make Ethereum its primary treasury reserve asset. Shares jumped nearly 20% after the news and have now exploded over 1,000% since that announcement. SharpLink Gaming, a betting firm that also added ETH to its treasury strategy, rose more than 11%. And Bit Digital, which left bitcoin mining behind last week to focus fully on Ethereum treasury holdings and staking, saw its shares increase by more than 6%. Firms adopt Ethereum for reserves and staking Traders responded to growing signs that Ethereum isn’t just surviving its recent slump, it’s being adopted in new ways. One of the strongest signals came from Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens, who said : “We’re finally at the point where real use cases are emerging, and stablecoins have been the first version of that at scale but they’re going to open the door to a much bigger story around tokenizing other assets and using digital assets in new ways.” At the same time, crypto ETF flows showed a clear divergence. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which had seen inflows for 15 straight trading sessions, broke that streak on Tuesday. While that happened, Ethereum ETFs brought in $40 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust pulling in most of it. ETH ETFs had looked dead just a month ago, with traders calling them zombie funds. Now they’re seeing fresh interest again. Ethereum itself rose 5% on the day, based on pricing from Coin Metrics. But it’s still down 24% in 2025. The network has been under pressure since its last major technical upgrade failed to boost revenue. Its long-term value is also being questioned as faster rivals like Solana grab more attention. All of this is happening in a year where geopolitical chaos continues to keep investors on edge. Tokenization and stablecoin news fuel Ether demand Despite that, Ethereum’s role in tokenization is driving new activity. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee called Ethereum “the backbone and architecture” of stablecoins. Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), the two biggest stablecoins, are both issued on the Ethereum network. Lee’s comment points to why ETH is still central when it comes to building stable digital payment rails. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL (short for USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), also started out on Ethereum before expanding to other blockchains. Tokenization is the process of creating digital versions of real-world assets or securities and putting them on-chain. But people who hold those tokenized assets don’t own the actual underlying thing. They hold the crypto equivalent. Robinhood added to the momentum this week when it said it would allow trading of tokenized US stocks and ETFs across Europe. That follows a wave of renewed attention toward stablecoins in June, sparked by Circle’s IPO and a US Senate vote to approve the GENIUS Act , a stablecoin regulation bill. Ethereum will turn ten years old at the end of July. It’s still down roughly 75% from its all-time high. But as ETH-related stocks and funds climb, and more firms ditch bitcoin for Ethereum-focused treasuries, traders are watching closely. Whether it rebounds or not, it’s still in the middle of crypto’s biggest conversation. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

According to the updated version of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Trump's total wealth remains stable at $6.4 billion, while cryptocurrency projects now account for a significant portion of his fortune. Previous reports have indicated that Trump has earned over $600 million from various ventures including golf clubs, licensing deals, and crypto. However, this new report includes the first detailed accounting of the Trump family’s expanding crypto investments, including NFT collections, decentralized finance (DeFi) project World Liberty Financial, and memecoins. Related News: Analysis Company Shares July Expectations for Bitcoin and Altcoins - Will They Continue to Sleep, or Will the Giant Awaken?

Those earnings could increase further as their crypto ventures expand. The Trump family also owns a 20 percent stake in crypto mining company American Bitcoin.

2025-07-02T19:55:44,"SkyBridge Capital Founder Anthony Scaramucci Predicts Bitcoin Treasury Trend ‘Fades Away’: Report","Hedge fund veteran Anthony Scaramucci reportedly says that the recent adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) in corporate treasuries is likely a temporary trend. In an interview with Bloomberg , the SkyBridge Capital founder says he thinks the BTC treasury business model will fade away. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea… So, you know, it will fade.” The investor says that eventually, investors will begin to question why they’re paying a premium for a “middleman” to hold an asset when they could simply hold BTC on their own. Over the last year, there has been a trend among corporations of accumulating Bitcoin, both as a savings mechanism and a strategy to convert their shares into proxies for investing in the flagship cryptocurrency. Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet . Other companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have been employing the same tactics for years. However, Scaramucci says he feels different about Strategy. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now… I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on Bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies… “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that’s an issue.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-02T19:45:48,"Binance Dominates Bitcoin Futures with 87% Taker Volume: CQ","Fresh data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant shows Binance now commands 87% of global taker buy volume in Bitcoin (BTC) futures. This figure dwarfs the combined activity of major competitors like OKX, Deribit, BitMEX, and Bybit, which together account for only about 10%. Taker Volume Signals Market Supremacy Takers are traders who accept existing offers or bids on a platform’s order book rather than placing their own. Since they want their request filled immediately, they tend to “take” a value that’s already listed so that they can react swiftly to a cryptocurrency’s price movements. This is done through the so-called market orders. This metric is crucial: it indicates where positions fill fastest and where capital flows are most concentrated. Experts usually consider the taker volume important for gauging real-time market activity, and according to CryptoQuant, Binance is the overwhelming leader, capturing 87% of such deals. That it holds the lion’s share of this activity indicates that Binance is the go-to platform for traders looking to act quickly on price trends, especially those using leverage-heavy BTC futures contracts. As noted by analyst J.A. Maartun, the exchange’s dominance means traders’ orders will be filled rapidly, while market watchers like him get to “monitor order books, liquidity levels, and capital flows more effectively.” Binance’s grip on the space is not new, but it solidified following the 2022 collapse of FTX, which at one point was one of its main rivals. The gap it left behind saw the then Changpeng Zhao-led firm steadily grow its daily trading volume to cement its place as the largest crypto exchange in the world based on this metric. Beyond Futures However, its dominance isn’t just in the futures space. As recently reported by CryptoPotato , the BTC.com mining pool exclusively directs almost 98% of its identifiable Bitcoin exchange flows to Binance, making it the primary gateway for new BTC entering the market. The crypto exchange also dominates USDT liquidity on Tron, with on-chain data showing it routinely processes more than 65% of the stablecoin’s transfers on the network. This amounts to anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion worth of TRC-20 Tether processed each day. Nonetheless, this extreme centralization is a double-edged sword. While it offers unmatched liquidity and efficiency, it also concentrates systemic risk. Any significant operational, regulatory, or technical issue impacting Binance could send shockwaves across the entire crypto ecosystem, disrupting derivatives pricing, spot liquidity, and even stablecoin flows.

2025-07-02T19:40:12,"What If Bitcoin Hits $200K? AI Projects Dominance Spikes and Altcoin Frenzy","What would happen if Bitcoin reached $200,000? Nearly doubling its previous all-time high, a $200K price would move Bitcoin into a new tier of market capitalization, roughly matching the valuation of global blue-chip equities and sovereign debt holdings. It would likely attract new classes of capital and global media attention. This article uses AI to analyze and explore that possibility through a structured framework. Instead of speculating on a date or treating the figure as inevitable, it investigates what could unfold if Bitcoin does reach this benchmark. Drawing from prior market cycles and behavior patterns, it outlines key indicators investors might observe across dominance, altcoin behavior, sector reactions, macro drivers, and psychological sentiment. Bitcoin Price 2017-Present (Source: CoinMarketCap) Rather than offering predictions, the goal is to map potential outcomes. The AI analysis considers how markets have responded to previous rallies and what those patterns might imply for a future where Bitcoin touches $200K. Research Approach and Analytical Framework To ground the analysis, we analyzed data from two previous bull cycles with ChatGPT’s o3 model—2017 and 2020 to 2021—using CoinMarketCap and TradingView . Both periods saw Bitcoin leading the initial price movements, followed by capital rotation into altcoins. BTC dominance rose early, then declined as other tokens gained traction. This historical lens helps to frame a plausible path forward. AI analysis added structure by projecting how different segments might react under specific conditions. These include shifts in BTC dominance, ETH /BTC ratio trends, and short-term altcoin volatility following a price spike. We assume Bitcoin reaches $200K in an environment that supports a higher risk appetite, such as post-ETF-approval inflows, macroeconomic easing, or a weakening dollar. No single catalyst is implied, but conditions would likely include strong institutional demand and favorable regulation. Initial Shock: Bitcoin Dominance Spikes If Bitcoin breaks through $200K, dominance is likely to climb in the early stages. In past cycles, this has indicated capital concentration in Bitcoin as investors seek security in the most liquid asset. In 2017, dominance fell from 64 percent to under 40 percent as the rally matured. In the 2021 cycle, it peaked around 73 percent before dropping below 50 percent once altcoins gathered momentum. Bitcoin Dominance 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) At the $200K level, Bitcoin would almost certainly attract institutional flows and dominate trading volumes. Search interest and media coverage would spike, even among retail investors who have stayed on the sidelines. Historically, these moments have been associated with a rapid inflow of attention and capital, setting the stage for short-lived overextension. However, the rise in dominance might be temporary. Once BTC appears to stabilize at new highs, capital could begin rotating into ETH and eventually into smaller assets. This transition has occurred before, often within weeks of a Bitcoin top. Altcoin Rotation: ETH Rebounds, Altseason Looms Ethereum has historically underperformed during Bitcoin-led surges but tends to recover strongly once BTC momentum cools. During the late 2020 rally, ETH/BTC declined even as BTC rallied. But by mid-2021, Ethereum regained ground and outperformed Bitcoin in percentage terms for several months. The ETH/BTC ratio climbed steadily, indicating renewed confidence in broader crypto exposure. Ethereum to Bitcoin Ratio 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) Blockchaincenter’s Altcoin Season Index supports this. In both 2017 and 2021, altcoin rallies intensified once Bitcoin had already established a local high. In 2021, large-cap alts rose by over 170 percent compared to a relatively flat BTC. Smaller tokens often lag further, but their moves are sharper once they catch up. If BTC reaches $200K and then stabilizes, the conditions for a classic altcoin season may emerge. Capital typically flows first to ETH, then to mid-cap tokens, and finally to microcaps as risk appetite increases. Altcoin Season Index 2020-Present (Source: Blockchaincenter) These transitions are fast and often unpredictable. Investors watching dominance metrics, ETH/BTC ratios, and liquidity conditions may spot the early signs of such a rotation. Sector Reactions: DeFi, Memecoins, Metaverse Beyond general altcoins, specific token sectors have often been the primary beneficiaries of late-cycle capital. In 2021, DeFi protocols, meme tokens, and metaverse-related assets surged once Bitcoin began to flatten out. These moves were amplified by social sentiment and community engagement rather than core utility. Should Bitcoin reach $200K, speculative capital may again flow into these and other new, trending segments (AI, RWA , etc). Traders who missed the early BTC gains may chase higher beta assets, especially if short-term sentiment supports them. These rallies tend to be brief and steep, with heightened volatility on both the upside and downside. Timing also matters. These sectors often peak just after Bitcoin tops. Watch for rising social engagement and increasing trading volume as early indicators. Macro Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts No major price level exists in a vacuum. A $200K Bitcoin would likely follow a set of favorable macro and regulatory developments. Additional ETF approvals could trigger new flows from wealth managers and pension funds. A weakening dollar or easing Fed stance might drive investors to reevaluate long-term stores of value, and persistent inflation could push more institutional interest into hard digital assets. What drives the price also shapes what follows. An ETF-driven rally would likely keep most capital in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, if broader macro recovery leads the charge—like a tech-stock rebound or real yield compression—then altcoins might benefit as well. The nature of the catalyst would determine the breadth of participation. A narrow rally driven by institutions tends to favor high-liquidity assets. A wider rally, driven by retail and macro optimism, tends to pull in speculative names. The outcome is not just price-based but structural. Understanding this would help investors anticipate where capital may flow next. Mapping Reversal Risks and Volatility Ahead In past cycles, dominance tends to peak around the time Bitcoin hits its top. When BTC hit $20K in December 2017, dominance fell shortly after. In 2021, BTC reached $69K while dominance was already declining, setting the stage for broad market retracements. The scenario might look like this: Bitcoin touches $200K, dominance climbs to 60 percent, then retreats over several days as capital disperses. If this process unfolds too quickly, altcoin prices may rise and fall just as fast. Tokens with low liquidity or inflated valuations may see abrupt corrections. The risk isn’t only that prices fall, but that the correction hits different sectors at different speeds. Bitcoin may remain steady while smaller tokens experience outsized drawdowns. Investors unfamiliar with this dynamic may misread the timing, entering too late or exiting too early. Volatility often follows rapid rotations. Watching dominance trends and ETH/BTC shifts can help assess when momentum begins to fade. Investor Sentiment Shifts—Retail vs Institutional Retail behavior often mirrors price action. In 2017 and 2021, Google Trends data shows search interest for “Bitcoin” peaked near the market top. These periods were marked by media saturation and public curiosity. Bitcoin Google Trend Index (Source: Google) Recent rallies haven’t generated the same level of attention. Even with new highs, search volume remains well below prior peaks. If Bitcoin hits $200K under similar conditions, the move may be driven more by institutions than retail. This could delay broader participation, especially in altcoins. A subdued retail environment might mute initial volatility, but it could also dampen follow-through in later phases. Altcoin seasons tend to rely on retail-driven liquidity. If that component is missing or delayed, smaller tokens may struggle to replicate past performance. Still, attention can return quickly. If media focus intensifies, search trends could reverse rapidly. Retail engagement tends to follow headlines. Preparing for a Potential $200K Bitcoin Market As we’ve explored what might happen if Bitcoin reaches $200K, we’ve drawn from real-world data and historical behavior to outline potential developments across market structure, investor behavior, and asset rotation. Key indicators to monitor include Bitcoin dominance, ETH/BTC ratio trends, and search activity. These offer insight into whether a rally is broadening, narrowing, or beginning to reverse. Rather than make a prediction, this scenario helps map expectations. Understanding previous cycles doesn’t guarantee foresight, but it does offer useful context. If Bitcoin does approach $200K, preparation will matter more than precision. The post What If Bitcoin Hits $200K?
