2025-07-03T12:58:03,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – Billions in Retirement Funds Could Pour Into BTC as Pension Firms Rush to Add Exposure","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $109,600, gaining over 2.% in 24 hours following a notable vote of confidence from the UK pension sector. Cartwright Pension Trusts, a UK-based advisory firm, revealed it helped a client allocate 3% of its portfolio to BTCin late 2024. That investment has since returned 60% in under a year, outperforming most traditional asset classes. Importantly, Cartwright maintains no direct Bitcoin exposure, positioning itself as a neutral, data-driven advisor. Cartwright Pension Trusts is seeing rising interest from its clients after helping a UK pension fund allocate 3% to Bitcoin in 2024, yielding a 60% in November 2024—and according to Nasri, it secured a 60% return on investment in under 12 months pic.twitter.com/dhgIuST0Yi — The Crypto Utility Guy (@UtilityGuy7) July 2, 2025 To support this, Cartwright has launched its first “Annual Bitcoin Review,” a dedicated research report aimed at educating corporate treasurers, defined benefit schemes, and long-term investors about Bitcoin’s utility, volatility, and evolving macro relevance. “We see it as our fiduciary duty to raise awareness of Bitcoin’s impact on individuals, asset owners, and governments,” said Nasri. Cartwright has no direct BTC exposure, so they are a neutral, data-driven advisor. Sector Response: Cautious but Shifting While Cartwright’s move has drawn attention, the broader UK pension sector remains measured. Volatility is still a sticking point, with many funds hesitant to embrace crypto’s notorious price swings. But Nasri says that’s missing the bigger picture: “Portfolio construction should accommodate volatility, not avoid it.” He noted that interest in Bitcoin is expanding beyond pensions. Charities are exploring BTC as a donation vehicle, while corporate clients are assessing its use in 24/7 cross-border payments and as a treasury diversification tool. Nasri clarified that Bitcoin isn’t suitable for all investors—especially those with short time horizons—but called it a viable fit for long-term allocations, particularly within defined benefit and contribution plans. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Breakout Eyes $113,255 Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, supported by both fundamental and technical indicators. The asset has reclaimed the $108,600 level and is holding well above the 50-period EMA at $107,302. A rising trendline from June 23 remains intact, while price recently printed a bullish engulfing candle, signalling renewed upside strength.

As traditional asset managers and pension advisors like Cartwright step in, the case for long-term Bitcoin exposure is becoming harder to ignore. With macro tailwinds and price action aligning, BTC looks ready to test higher levels into mid-July.

2025-07-03T12:50:35,"Bitcoin: South Korean Court’s Crucial Ruling Orders Return of Coinone Glitch Funds","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: South Korean Court’s Crucial Ruling Orders Return of Coinone Glitch Funds Imagine waking up to find extra Bitcoin in your crypto wallet, not through a successful trade, but due to a system glitch. Sounds like a dream, right? For some users of the South Korean crypto exchange Coinone in 2018, this was a reality. However, what started as an unexpected windfall has now culminated in a landmark legal battle, with a South Korean court ordering these users to return the excess funds. This ruling isn’t just about a few misplaced BTC; it’s a pivotal moment for digital asset law, highlighting the evolving responsibilities of both exchanges and their users. Bitcoin: A Landmark Legal Victory for Coinone? The recent civil appeal victory for South Korean crypto exchange Coinone marks a significant milestone in the nascent field of cryptocurrency law. In a ruling issued in May, a Seoul court mandated that users who received duplicate Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawals due to a 2018 system error must return the excess cryptocurrency. This decision comes nearly six years after the incident, underscoring the long and complex legal journey involved in resolving disputes within the digital asset space. At the heart of the matter is the principle of “unjust enrichment,” a legal concept that prevents individuals from benefiting unfairly at the expense of another. While this principle is well-established in traditional finance, its application to volatile, decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin presents unique challenges. Coinone’s persistent pursuit of this case, culminating in a favorable appeal ruling, sets a strong precedent for how similar incidents might be handled in the future, not just in South Korea but potentially worldwide. The court’s decision effectively validates Coinone’s claim that these funds were obtained erroneously and were never rightfully the property of the users. This is a clear signal that even in the decentralized world of crypto, traditional legal frameworks can and will be applied to uphold fairness and prevent illicit gains from system malfunctions. Unpacking the 2018 Coinone Glitch: What Happened? The incident that triggered this legal saga occurred in October 2018. During this period, Bitcoin was trading on Coinone against the Korean won at approximately 7.08 million to 7.87 million won, which translated to roughly $5,200 to $5,800 per BTC. For context, this price range is a stark reminder of Bitcoin ‘s incredible journey, being about one-twentieth of its current market value. This significant price appreciation since 2018 adds another layer of complexity and financial magnitude to the court’s order. The BTC Glitch itself allowed some users to execute duplicate withdrawals of Bitcoin . While the exact technical details of the vulnerability were not extensively publicized, such incidents typically stem from issues like: Race Conditions: Where multiple withdrawal requests are processed simultaneously, leading to an unintended double execution before the system can update balances. Database Synchronization Errors: Discrepancies between different parts of the exchange’s database, allowing a withdrawal to be approved without the balance being correctly debited. Insufficient Transaction Locks: A failure to properly lock user accounts during withdrawal processes, enabling repeated requests to be processed against a single initial balance. Regardless of the precise technical cause, the outcome was clear: certain users received more Bitcoin than they were entitled to. At the time, the immediate reaction from the exchange would have been to identify the anomaly, freeze affected accounts, and attempt to recover the funds. However, the path to recovery often proves challenging, especially when users are reluctant to return what they perceive as found money. The fact that this case dragged on for so many years highlights the difficulty in enforcing such claims, particularly when the asset in question is highly liquid and easily transferable across various platforms and jurisdictions. It also emphasizes the importance of robust internal controls and immediate incident response protocols for all crypto exchange platforms. The South Korean Court’s Verdict: Setting a Precedent? The Seoul court’s May ruling is a critical development for the regulatory landscape of digital assets. By ordering the return of the erroneously withdrawn Bitcoin , the South Korean court has unequivocally affirmed that even in the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, traditional legal principles of ownership and unjust enrichment apply. This ruling sends a strong message: system glitches do not equate to legitimate ownership. Key aspects of the court’s decision likely centered on: Lack of Legal Basis for Possession: The court would have determined that the users had no legal right or basis to possess the duplicate BTC. Their acquisition was purely a result of a technical error, not a legitimate transaction. Unjust Enrichment: This core legal doctrine was undoubtedly central. It asserts that a person should not be allowed to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of another. The users benefited from Coinone’s error, thus enriching themselves without a valid cause. Identifiability of Funds: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, exchanges often have internal records linking user accounts to specific transactions. This internal traceability likely played a role in identifying the affected users and the amounts to be returned. This verdict is not merely a win for Coinone; it’s a significant step towards bringing greater clarity and accountability to the cryptocurrency market. It suggests that courts are increasingly willing and able to apply existing legal frameworks to resolve disputes involving digital assets, rather than viewing them as an entirely new class of property exempt from traditional law. This could serve as a powerful precedent for other jurisdictions grappling with similar issues, reinforcing the idea that digital assets, while innovative, are not beyond the reach of the law. For crypto exchange platforms globally, this ruling provides a legal anchor. It empowers them to pursue legal recourse against users who exploit system vulnerabilities or fail to return funds received in error. It also underscores the importance of having clear terms of service that explicitly address such scenarios and outline user obligations. Implications for Crypto Exchanges and User Responsibility The Coinone ruling carries profound implications for both crypto exchange platforms and their user base. For exchanges, the primary takeaway is the reinforcement of their right to reclaim funds lost due to technical errors. However, this right comes with a parallel emphasis on their responsibility to maintain robust, secure systems. For Crypto Exchanges: Enhanced Security Measures: The incident serves as a stark reminder of the critical need for continuous investment in cybersecurity, rigorous testing, and real-time monitoring to prevent and detect system vulnerabilities. Clear Terms of Service (ToS): Exchanges should ensure their ToS explicitly state user obligations regarding erroneously received funds, outlining the consequences of non-compliance. This provides a legal basis for recovery efforts. Prompt Incident Response: Rapid detection, isolation of the issue, and immediate communication with affected users are crucial to mitigate damage and facilitate recovery. Legal Preparedness: Exchanges must be prepared to pursue legal action to recover funds, demonstrating that they will not tolerate unjust enrichment at their expense. For Crypto Users: No “Finders Keepers”: The ruling firmly rejects the notion that funds received due to an exchange glitch are free money. Users are legally obligated to return such funds. Ethical Responsibility: Beyond legal obligations, there’s an ethical imperative to report and return erroneously received assets. Failure to do so can lead to legal action, as seen in this case, and potentially severe financial penalties. Understanding Terms and Conditions: Users should thoroughly read and understand the terms of service of any crypto exchange they use, particularly clauses related to system errors and fund recovery. The Long Arm of the Law: Even after years, and despite the decentralized nature of crypto, legal systems can and will pursue claims for unjust enrichment. The significant appreciation of Bitcoin since 2018 means that the financial burden on users ordered to return funds now is far greater than if they had returned them immediately. This case highlights the growing maturity of the crypto market. As it integrates more deeply into the traditional financial and legal systems, participants must understand that established laws will apply, regardless of the innovative nature of the underlying technology. Beyond the Glitch: The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation The Coinone case is but one example of the increasing formalization of the cryptocurrency space, particularly in countries like South Korea, which has been at the forefront of crypto adoption and regulation. The consistent application of existing laws to novel digital assets reflects a global trend towards greater regulatory clarity and oversight. South Korea has a complex but evolving regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Initially, there were strict bans on initial coin offerings (ICOs), but the country has since moved towards a more comprehensive approach, including licensing requirements for crypto exchange platforms and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. This commitment to regulating the space is driven by a desire to protect investors, prevent financial crimes, and foster a stable environment for innovation. Globally, regulators are grappling with similar questions: How do we classify digital assets (securities, commodities, property)? How do we protect consumers from scams and operational failures? How do we ensure financial stability in a rapidly evolving market? How do we prevent the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities? The Coinone ruling, specifically concerning the ownership and recovery of Bitcoin obtained through error, contributes to this evolving legal tapestry. It provides a concrete example of how courts are interpreting digital asset ownership within existing legal frameworks, adding to the growing body of case law that will ultimately shape future regulations. As the market matures, we can expect more such rulings, further defining the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the crypto ecosystem. This continuous legal refinement is crucial for fostering trust and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Actionable Insights for Crypto Users and Platforms In light of the Coinone verdict, both individuals and entities operating within the cryptocurrency space should take proactive steps to safeguard their interests and ensure compliance. For Individual Crypto Users: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory changes and significant court rulings in your jurisdiction and those of the exchanges you use. Review Exchange Terms: Always read the terms and conditions of any crypto exchange carefully. Understand their policies on glitches, errors, and fund recovery. Report Errors Immediately: If you ever receive funds in error, report them to the exchange immediately. Document your communication. This not only fulfills your legal and ethical obligation but can also protect you from future legal action. Do Not Assume “Free Money”: The Coinone case clearly demonstrates that funds received due to a glitch are not yours to keep. Attempting to profit from such errors can lead to severe legal and financial repercussions. Practice Self-Custody for Long-Term Holdings: While exchanges offer convenience, consider moving significant long-term Bitcoin holdings to a personal hardware wallet. This reduces reliance on exchange security and minimizes exposure to exchange-specific operational risks. For Crypto Exchange Platforms: Invest Heavily in Security Audits: Regular, independent security audits are paramount to identify and rectify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Implement Robust Monitoring Systems: Real-time anomaly detection systems can flag unusual transactions or balances, allowing for immediate intervention. Develop Clear Recovery Protocols: Have a well-defined plan for how to handle system errors, including communication strategies, fund freezing procedures, and legal recourse options. Educate Your Users: Proactively inform users about their responsibilities regarding erroneously received funds through clear communication channels and user agreements. Collaborate with Regulators: Engage constructively with regulatory bodies to help shape fair and effective legal frameworks for the digital asset industry. This proactive approach can lead to more predictable outcomes in future disputes. The Coinone ruling is a powerful reminder that the crypto world, while innovative, is not immune to the laws that govern traditional finance. Adhering to best practices and understanding legal obligations are essential for sustainable growth and maintaining trust within the ecosystem. The South Korean court ‘s decisive ruling in the Coinone Bitcoin glitch case serves as a critical juncture in the evolution of cryptocurrency law. It firmly establishes that the principles of unjust enrichment apply to digital assets, underscoring the legal responsibilities of users who receive funds in error and the rights of exchanges to reclaim them. As the crypto market continues its journey towards mainstream adoption, such legal precedents are vital for fostering a more secure, predictable, and trustworthy environment for all participants. This case is a stark reminder that while technology moves fast, the wheels of justice, though sometimes slow, will ultimately turn to ensure fairness and accountability in the digital realm.

2025-07-03T12:44:21,"Russian insurance firms launch life policies tied to Bitcoin ETFs","Russian companies are offering investment insurance policies tied to the value of Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The new products expand crypto investment opportunities in Russia that have been growing since its central bank permitted the offering of derivatives based on decentralized digital assets. Russian insurers offer policies linked to American Bitcoin ETFs Two insurance firms, Renaissance Life and BKS Life Insurance, have announced crypto-related investment products on the Russian market, the Bits.media news outlet revealed on Wednesday. Renaissance Life is launching a Bitcoin-linked life insurance policy under its “Cryptocapital” program. It will provide up to 60% return on the growth of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of Bitcoin (BTC). The policy is valid for two years with a minimum down payment of 1.5 million Russian rubles ($19,000), the report detailed. If a client invests that amount and the value of Bitcoin doubles during the period, they will eventually receive 2.4 million rubles (over $30,000) before tax, explained Oleg Kiselev, the company’s chief executive. And if the value of the cryptocurrency falls below the amount of the down payment, the investor will get 1.5 million rubles back, the CEO promised. Investors will have to spend at least 3 million rubles ($38,000) for the three-year policy linked to Bitcoin ETF futures that BKS Life Insurance is offering. Holders will be able to adjust the share of an asset included in the policy’s investment portfolio throughout the entire period, depending on market conditions. The unique crypto products will be available to qualified investors by the end of the year, the Russian companies said. Moscow Exchange to expand crypto futures offerings The yield of the new investment life insurance policies is linked to the growth of the shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) through futures contracts traded on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX). Russia’s largest stock market started trading Bitcoin futures last month, shortly after the Central Bank of Russia authorized the sale of crypto derivatives to “ highly qualified investors ” in late May. Its initial offering is based on IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF by capital under management. The fund holds an estimated $70 billion in BTC, accounting for more than half of the capital of all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. Later in June, the Russian platform announced it would offer a new futures contract on its own recently introduced Moscow Exchange PFI Bitcoin Index (MOEXBTC), calculated using price data from some of the largest global crypto exchanges. This week, the Managing Director of the Moscow Exchange, Maria Patrikeeva, revealed that the exchange is preparing to increase the number of listed crypto investment products. The executive explained that Russia’s current regulations allow the launch of derivative financial instruments using cryptocurrency-linked securities as underlying assets and elaborated: “These instruments are in demand by both professional market participants and qualified investors. Besides the futures contract on the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, we may consider other funds, for example, BlackRock’s ETF on Ether.” Patrikeeva highlighted that the contract on IBIT is already among the top 30 offerings on the Russian futures market. Since its launch on June 4, the product has already reached a daily trading volume of 1 billion rubles ($12.7 million). The MOEX official insisted that the exchange intends to play an active role in the future development of the Russian market for this new class of crypto-related assets within the country’s existing regulatory framework. Financial authorities in Moscow, namely the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, have stubbornly maintained that only qualified investors should have access to cryptocurrencies and their derivatives. However, according to a recent estimate , Russians already hold over $25 billion in crypto.

2025-07-03T12:40:33,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Amazing $407.77M Inflows: A Bullish Signal","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Amazing $407.77M Inflows: A Bullish Signal The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with exciting news! On July 2, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a truly amazing milestone: a staggering $407.77 million in total net inflows. This significant surge isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of burgeoning confidence and growing appetite for digital assets among investors. If you’ve been watching the crypto market, this figure signals a robust and positive shift, highlighting how mainstream financial vehicles are increasingly embracing Bitcoin. Let’s dive deeper into what this means for the future of crypto investment and the broader digital asset landscape. Understanding the Surge in Bitcoin Inflows The recent influx of capital into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. According to insights shared by Trader T on X, July 2 saw a combined net inflow of $407.77 million, showcasing a strong rebound in investor sentiment. This isn’t just about a single fund; it’s a broad-based movement across several prominent players in the ETF space. Leading the charge was Fidelity’s FBTC, which alone pulled in an impressive $183.96 million in net inflows. This demonstrates a clear preference and trust among investors for Fidelity’s offering. Following Fidelity, other significant contributors to these remarkable Bitcoin Inflows included ARK Invest’s ARKB, securing $83 million, and Bitwise’s BITB, which attracted $64.94 million. Even Grayscale, whose GBTC fund initially saw outflows post-conversion, managed to pull in $34.56 million, alongside its mini BTC fund adding another $16.53 million. This suggests a potential shift in sentiment even for Grayscale, as investors might be re-evaluating their positions or new capital is entering the space. Invesco’s BTCO contributed $9.85 million, while Franklin Templeton’s EZBC and VanEck’s HODL also reported positive inflows of $9.51 million and $5.42 million, respectively. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day further underscores the concentrated nature of these positive movements within the top-performing funds. These inflows are crucial because they represent fresh capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem through regulated and accessible financial products. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of self-custody or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. This ease of access is a major driver behind the growing appeal of these funds, particularly for traditional investors and institutions. Why are Digital Asset ETFs Attracting So Much Capital? The substantial capital flowing into Digital Asset ETFs , particularly those tracking Bitcoin, is a testament to several evolving market dynamics. Firstly, regulatory clarity plays a monumental role. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provided a stamp of legitimacy that many institutional and retail investors were waiting for. This regulatory green light has significantly reduced perceived risks, making these products more appealing for traditional investment portfolios. It signals that Bitcoin, once considered a fringe asset, is increasingly being integrated into mainstream finance. Secondly, the inherent simplicity and familiarity of the ETF structure are powerful attractors for Crypto Investment . Investors are accustomed to buying and selling ETFs through their brokerage accounts, integrating them seamlessly into existing investment strategies. This bypasses the need to understand complex blockchain technology, set up digital wallets, or manage private keys – barriers that previously deterred many potential investors. This convenience factor opens the floodgates for a broader range of participants, from large financial institutions to individual retail investors looking for diversified exposure to the digital asset space. Furthermore, the current macroeconomic environment and the narrative around Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge continue to resonate with investors. As traditional markets face uncertainties, many are seeking alternative assets that offer potential for significant returns or act as a store of value. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, fits this narrative perfectly. The ability to access this asset through a regulated ETF provides a safe and familiar conduit for this increasingly popular investment thesis. The competitive fee structures among the various ETF providers also contribute to their attractiveness, as funds vie for investor capital by offering more favorable terms. The Impact of Institutional Adoption on Bitcoin The consistent and significant inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a clear indicator of accelerating Institutional Adoption . When large entities like Fidelity, ARK Invest, and Grayscale see substantial net inflows, it signifies that major financial players, hedge funds, wealth managers, and even corporate treasuries are actively allocating capital to Bitcoin. This level of institutional participation brings several profound implications for the Bitcoin market: Increased Liquidity and Stability: Large institutional orders can absorb market volatility and provide deeper liquidity, potentially leading to more stable price movements over time. Their long-term investment horizons often reduce short-term speculative trading. Validation and Credibility: The involvement of established financial institutions lends immense credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. It moves Bitcoin further away from its early, often speculative, reputation and solidifies its position as a legitimate investment vehicle. Supply-Demand Dynamics: As institutions accumulate Bitcoin through ETFs, it creates a persistent demand pressure on the underlying asset. Given Bitcoin’s finite supply, sustained institutional buying could lead to upward price pressure in the long run, as more Bitcoin is effectively taken off the open market and held within these funds. Broader Market Acceptance: The success of these ETFs encourages other financial institutions to explore similar offerings or integrate digital assets into their services, further normalizing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system. This trend of Institutional Adoption is not merely about price; it’s about the maturation of the entire digital asset ecosystem. It signifies a fundamental shift in how the world views and interacts with cryptocurrencies, moving from niche interest to a recognized component of global finance. As more institutions gain exposure, the infrastructure supporting digital assets will likely continue to evolve and strengthen, paving the way for even greater integration and innovation. Navigating Your Crypto Investment Journey with ETFs For those looking to embark on or expand their Crypto Investment journey, the rise of Digital Asset ETFs presents a compelling, yet nuanced, opportunity. While the recent inflows paint a bullish picture, it’s essential for investors to approach these products with a clear understanding of both their advantages and inherent risks. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Understand the Underlying Asset: Even though you’re investing in an ETF, its performance is directly tied to Bitcoin. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and volatility is crucial. Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, and ETFs will reflect this. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin is a significant player, a balanced investment portfolio typically includes diversification across various asset classes. Consider how a Bitcoin ETF fits into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Research ETF Providers: Not all ETFs are created equal. Research the specific provider (e.g., Fidelity FBTC, ARK Invest ARKB, Bitwise BITB) in terms of their fee structure, liquidity, and how closely their ETF tracks the underlying Bitcoin price. The minor differences in expense ratios can add up over time. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and influenced by a myriad of factors, including regulatory news, technological advancements, and global economic trends. Staying updated on these developments will help you make informed decisions regarding your US Spot Bitcoin ETFs holdings. Follow reputable news sources and analysts. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment in Bitcoin ETFs is for short-term speculation or long-term growth. While the daily inflows are exciting, true wealth creation often comes from a patient, long-term approach to investing. These ETFs offer a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. They democratize access to Bitcoin for millions of investors who might otherwise be hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. However, like any investment, due diligence and a clear strategy are paramount to navigating the opportunities and challenges effectively. In conclusion, the astounding $407.77 million in net inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 2 is more than just a daily statistic; it’s a resounding affirmation of growing confidence in Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market. This surge, led by prominent funds like Fidelity’s FBTC, underscores a significant trend towards Institutional Adoption , driven by increased regulatory clarity and the inherent accessibility of these investment vehicles. As Bitcoin Inflows continue to shape market dynamics, the long-term outlook for Crypto Investment through regulated products appears increasingly robust. This marks an exciting chapter in the journey of digital assets, solidifying their place within the global financial ecosystem and paving the way for further innovation and mainstream integration. The future looks bright for Bitcoin and the innovative ways investors are engaging with it.

2025-07-03T12:30:48,"Buy Bitcoin Before Jackson Hole—Or Regret It Forever, Says Arthur Hayes","Arthur Hayes has published a new essay, “Quid Pro Stablecoin,” arguing that the United States’ sudden political enthusiasm for bank-issued stablecoins is less about “financial freedom” and more about arming the Treasury with a multi-trillion-dollar “liquidity bazooka.” The former BitMEX chief—writing in his personal newsletter—contends that investors who postpone buying Bitcoin until the Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing will serve as “exit liquidity” for those who bought earlier. How The Money Printer Is Already Warming Up At the core of Hayes’ thesis is the claim that eight “too-big-to-fail” banks hold roughly $6.8 trillion in demand and time deposits that can be transformed into on-chain dollars. Once customers migrate from legacy accounts to bank stablecoins—he cites JPMorgan’s forthcoming “JPMD” token as the template—those deposits become collateral that can be recycled into Treasury bills. “Adoption of stablecoins by TBTF banks creates up to $6.8 trillion of T-bill buying power,” he writes, adding that the product simultaneously slashes compliance overhead because “an AI agent trained on the corpus of relevant compliance regulations can perfectly ensure that certain transactions are never approved.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Seasonality: Why Summer 2025 Will Catch Everyone Off Guard Hayes layers a second mechanism on top of the stablecoin flow. If Congress strips the Federal Reserve of its ability to pay interest on reserve balances—a proposal floated by Senator Ted Cruz—banks would have to replace that lost income by buying short-dated Treasuries. He estimates the policy could “liberate another $3.3 trillion of inert reserves,” bringing the prospective fire-power for government debt purchases to $10.1 trillion. “This $10.1 trillion liquidity injection will act upon risky assets in the same way Bad Gurl Yellen’s $2.5 trillion injection did… PUMP UP THE JAM!” Hayes asserts. The essay frames the bipartisan GENIUS Act as the legislative linchpin. By barring non-banks from issuing interest-bearing stablecoins, Washington “hands the stablecoin market to banks,” ensuring that fintech issuers such as Circle cannot compete at scale and that deposit flight is funneled into the institutions most likely to bankroll the Treasury. Hayes calculates that the cost savings and enhanced net-interest margins could increase the combined market capitalisation of the big banks by more than 180 percent, a trade he describes as “non-consensus” but executable “in SIZE.” Buy Bitcoin Before The Fed Blinks Despite his long-term enthusiasm, Hayes cautions that a temporary liquidity drain looms once Congress passes what he labels Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” Refilling the Treasury General Account to its $850 billion target could contract dollar liquidity by nearly half a trillion dollars, an impulse he believes may knock Bitcoin back toward the mid-$90,000s and keep prices range-bound until the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole conference in late August. Related Reading: Public Firms Snag 131,000 BTC, Surpassing ETFs In Bitcoin Purchases “I believe that between now and the August Jackson Hole Fed speech to be given by beta cuck towel bitch boy Jerome Powell, the market will trade sideways to slightly lower. If the TGA refill proves to be dollar liquidity negative, then the downside is $90,000 to $95,000. If the refill proves to be a nothingburger, Bitcoin will chop in the $100,000s without a decisive break above the $112,000 all-time-high,” Hayes writes. The punchline, however, is resolutely bullish. Hayes ridicules advisers steering clients into bonds on the premise that yields will fall: “If you’re still waiting for Powell to whisper ‘QE infinity’ in your ear before you go risk-on, congrats — you’re the exit liquidity. Instead go long Bitcoin. Go long JPMorgan. Forget about Circle.” In his view, the political machinery that props up US deficits has already selected bank stablecoins as the next round of stealth quantitative easing, and Bitcoin—alongside JPMorgan stock—is positioned to absorb the spill-over. Hayes signs off with a stark imperative: “Don’t sit on the sidelines waiting for Powell to bless the bull market.” The liquidity horse, he argues, has already bolted; investors who hesitate to buy Bitcoin risk being trampled beneath it. “You will miss out on Bitcoin pumping 10x to $1 million,” he concludes. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $109,449.

2025-07-03T12:24:49,"Solana News Today – Analysts Predict SOL Price to Hit $300 Soon","The post Solana News Today – Analysts Predict SOL Price to Hit $300 Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana price is making waves in the crypto market, recently climbing 7% intraday from a low of $145 to $155. As of now, it is trading at $154.82, boasting a market cap of $82.75 billion and a 24-hour spot volume of $4.08 billion. While the price reaction may not seem explosive, experts are optimistic with recent market events, believing that SOL could soon surpass the $300 mark . Why Is SOL Up 7%? Bitcoin serves as the primary gateway and confidence booster for the entire crypto market, which has turned green, lifting not just BTC but also altcoins like Solana. As the saying goes, “When it rains, it pours,” and this sentiment is evident as Bitcoin has surged to $109.8K today, igniting a wave of FOMO across social platforms . The increase in social volume reflects a growing belief among retail investors that Bitcoin’s price could soar to between $120K and $160K by early July. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/t6LkQwDXLc — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 Adding to the positive momentum, the recent launch of the Rex-Osprey Solana staking ETF has captured attention. James Seyffart reported that it reached $8 million in trading volume within just 20 minutes, while Eric Balchunas noted that it ended the day with an impressive $33 million. With rising interest in Solana, Seyffart and Balchunas have pegged a 95% chance that spot Solana ETFs will be approved by the end of the year. The optimism in the air has surged, market is full of excitement, and investors are keenly waiting for Solana crypto’s rise. Analyst Predicts- Solana price To Hit $300 Recently, the Solana price surged nearly 7%, yet it remains below the 200-day EMA band, currently sitting at $159.40. This uptick comes on the heels of high trading volume, particularly around the “fixed range volume profile” at $144.65. In the short term, if Solana can flip the 200-day EMA, it could set its sights on $185 in July. Achieving this would signify a Break of Structure (BoS), allowing the cryptocurrency to resume its Q2 uptrend that began in April, as clearly illustrated on the daily chart. [post_titles_links postid=”478103″] Similarly, experts are optimistic, believing that the short-term downtrend from mid-May to June has been reversed, with a target of $300 now appearing likely. However, as its said , “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.” If Solana fails to maintain its upward momentum, it could retreat to the $125 support level. A further decline could even push the price back to the April lows of $95.

With RSI at 48.76 and price trading above the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

However, Pakistan’s Bitcoin moves have hit a snag with the IMF, which has rejected Pakistan’s Bitcoin mining power subsidy plan. IMF Rejects Pakistan's Bitcoin Plans! The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s proposal to offer subsidized electricity tariffs for crypto mining and some industrial sectors. The IMF rejected the proposal, citing concerns about potential strain on the country's power grid, increased load, legal uncertainties, possible blackouts and a lack of prior consultation. Energy Minister Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan said that the talks are ongoing and added, “IMF did not accept our Bitcoin plans. However, the talks are ongoing. This shows that Pakistan is determined to align its energy plan with global standards and recommendations.” The initiative, spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance, aims to allocate 2,000 MW of electricity for crypto mining and data centers in a bid to attract foreign investment. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-03T12:10:58,"Bitcoin’s Bold Ascent: Why the Derivatives Market Signals Caution","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Bold Ascent: Why the Derivatives Market Signals Caution The cryptocurrency world is abuzz! Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured headlines, surging remarkably close to its all-time high. For many, this is a clear sign of renewed strength and a potential bull run. However, a deeper dive into the sophisticated world of the derivatives market reveals a more nuanced story. While the price action is undoubtedly exciting, professional traders are signaling a significant degree of hesitation, raising questions about the conviction behind this impressive crypto rally . Understanding the Derivatives Market’s Hesitation on Bitcoin ‘s Surge When Bitcoin’s price approaches significant milestones, it’s natural for excitement to build. But seasoned investors and analysts often look beyond spot prices to the derivatives market for a clearer picture of professional trader sentiment . This market, which includes futures and options, provides valuable insights into how institutional players and experienced traders are positioning themselves. According to Cointelegraph, despite BTC soaring above $109,000 and coming within 2% of its previous peak, key derivatives metrics are flashing yellow, not green. Here’s what we’re seeing: BTC Futures Premium: This metric, also known as the basis, measures the difference between futures contract prices and the current spot price. A healthy bull market typically sees a futures premium above 5%, indicating traders are willing to pay more for future exposure, expecting higher prices. Currently, the BTC futures premium remains below this neutral 5% level. This suggests a lack of aggressive long positioning and speculative buying from professional traders. They aren’t betting big on sustained price increases. 25% Delta Skew: The delta skew for Bitcoin options assesses the cost of call options versus put options at similar maturities. A positive skew indicates that call options (bets on higher prices) are more expensive than put options (bets on lower prices), reflecting bullish sentiment. A negative skew suggests bearishness. The fact that the 25% delta skew remains at 0% signals a perfectly neutral outlook. Traders aren’t paying a premium for upside protection or downside hedges, indicating no strong directional conviction. They’re essentially saying, “We don’t know which way it’s going, so we’re not committing.” These two indicators, when combined, paint a picture of caution. While retail enthusiasm might be pushing the spot price, the smart money appears to be holding back, suggesting that this rally might lack the broad-based institutional support typically seen in robust bull markets. Why is Trader Sentiment So Cautious Despite Rising BTC Price ? The discrepancy between Bitcoin’s rising price and the cautious derivatives market isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several macroeconomic factors and global uncertainties are likely contributing to this reserved trader sentiment : Global Economic Uncertainty: Persistent concerns over global trade tensions, potential economic slowdowns, and geopolitical instability create an environment of risk aversion. Even assets like Bitcoin, sometimes seen as a safe haven, are not immune to broader market jitters. Investors might be hesitant to commit large capital to riskier assets when the global economic outlook remains cloudy. Eurozone Monetary Expansion: While monetary expansion might theoretically support asset prices by increasing liquidity, its effectiveness and long-term implications are still being debated. Traders might be wary of the potential for inflation or other unintended consequences, leading them to exercise caution. Weaker U.S. Payroll Data: Softer economic data from major economies like the U.S. can signal a weakening global economy. This can lead to reduced consumer spending and investment, which in turn can dampen appetite for speculative assets. These macroeconomic signals create a complex backdrop for Bitcoin. While some might interpret them as reasons for Bitcoin to shine (e.g., as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation), others see them as reasons to remain defensive and cautious, especially given the asset’s historical volatility. Regional Weakness and ETF Outflows: Further Dampening the Crypto Rally Beyond the derivatives market, other indicators suggest underlying weakness in demand, further contributing to the hesitant trader sentiment surrounding the current crypto rally : Weak Crypto Demand in China: China has historically been a significant market for cryptocurrency. However, reports indicate that Tether (USDT), a stablecoin widely used for trading in the region, is currently trading at a 1% discount. This discount suggests an oversupply of USDT relative to demand, often indicating that local traders are selling off their crypto holdings and moving into fiat, or that capital controls are making it harder to acquire USDT. This is a notable shift from periods where USDT traded at a premium, signaling strong demand. BTC ETF Outflows: Tuesday saw a significant $342 million in outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs were once hailed as a major driver for institutional adoption and increased demand. Consistent outflows, especially substantial ones, indicate that institutional investors or large holders are withdrawing capital from these accessible Bitcoin investment vehicles. This directly contradicts the narrative of strong, sustained institutional demand for Bitcoin at its current price levels. These regional and institutional outflows are critical. They show that while Bitcoin’s spot price is climbing, the underlying demand from key segments of the market might not be as robust as the price action suggests. This creates a disconnect that experienced traders are keenly aware of, hence their cautious positioning in the derivatives market. Navigating the Uncertainty: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio and Bitcoin’s Price ? So, what should investors make of this mixed signal? On one hand, Bitcoin is demonstrating remarkable resilience, pushing towards new highs. On the other, the sophisticated players are not yet fully on board, raising concerns about the sustainability of this current upward trend. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Monitor Derivatives Closely: Keep an eye on the BTC futures premium and delta skew. A sustained increase in the premium above 5% and a positive delta skew would signal a shift in professional trader sentiment and stronger conviction behind the rally. Assess Macroeconomic Developments: Pay attention to global economic data, central bank policies, and geopolitical events. These factors significantly influence risk appetite and can either support or hinder further Bitcoin gains. Understand Regional Dynamics: While China’s market might be complex, the USDT discount is a tangible sign of reduced demand. Similarly, ongoing ETF flows provide a pulse on institutional interest. Risk Management is Key: In an environment of uncertainty, robust risk management becomes even more crucial. Consider setting stop-losses, diversifying your portfolio, and not over-allocating to a single asset, even one as compelling as Bitcoin. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: This analysis primarily focuses on short-to-medium term market dynamics. Long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized, scarce asset might view these fluctuations as temporary noise. However, short-term traders need to be acutely aware of these conflicting signals. The current situation highlights the complexity of the crypto market. It’s not just about price, but also about the underlying conviction and demand from all market participants, especially the institutional ones who can move markets significantly. The Road Ahead: Will the Crypto Rally Find Full Support? The question on everyone’s mind is whether this impressive Bitcoin surge will eventually gain the full backing of the derivatives market . For a truly sustainable and robust bull run, we would ideally see futures premiums rise, delta skew turn positive, and strong inflows into institutional products like ETFs. Without this alignment, the current rally could be more vulnerable to corrections or consolidation. The coming weeks will be crucial. Will the positive momentum in the spot market eventually sway the cautious professionals? Or will the hesitancy in the derivatives market act as a ceiling, preventing Bitcoin’s price from breaking out definitively to new all-time highs? The interplay between these forces will define the next chapter for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In short, while Bitcoin’s price is soaring, the derivatives market has yet to show full support for the rally. This creates a fascinating tension, reminding us that market analysis requires looking at all angles, not just the most obvious one. It’s a powerful reminder that even in a surging market, prudence and a comprehensive understanding of all market indicators are paramount.

2025-07-03T12:06:40,"Bitcoin Moves Up, Dogecoin Surges Above Key $0.17 Mark; Token6900 Set to Explode","Bitcoin climbed above $109K, triggering a surge across the markets: Ethereum ($ETH) – up 4.65% XRP ($XRP) – up 3.86% Solana ($SOL) – up 7.85% Tron ($TRX) – up 4.17% But one of the biggest daily surges came from an unexpected corner, as Dogecoin mounted an 8% rally and broke the key $0.17 mark. As meme coins rebound, could the purest meme coin of them all be poised to hit the stratosphere? Time for a closer look. What’s Driving the Rally? A wave of optimism around potential US Federal Reserve rate cuts , prompted by recent dovish statements from key officials, energized risk assets. Overall, markets are bullish and tokens are up for a number of reasons. Approvals of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) signaled increased institutional interest, especially in altcoins. Greater clarity in US crypto regulation is drawing fresh capital into the market. Growing TradFi and DeFi convergence – including banking applications for key crypto institutions – has lowered barriers to entry while increasing a sense of trust. There’s still uncertainty, especially ahead of the Labor Department’s expected employment report on July 3. But for now, positivity reigns, and traders clamor for more gains. Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, noted , ‘Bitcoin is in the passenger seat… Recent crypto ETP approvals may be raising investor confidence that TradFi capital will make its way into altcoins.’ He expects new token highs later in the year, and it’s not just Bitcoin we’re talking about. Wider Market Backdrop Still Positive for Key Crypto Players US equity benchmarks like Nasdaq and the S&P 500 also ticked up, with the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high . However, geopolitical and fiscal uncertainties – such as the delayed U.S. budget , ongoing global trade tensions, and regional conflicts – remain a constant worry for investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows on July 1 , suggesting some caution, though that was the first day in a 15-day streak of inflows. Ripple’s application for a national bank charter with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marked another sign of growing institutional integration. And President Trump’s enthusiastic endorsement of a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal may boost broader risk-on sentiment. All told, it’s no surprise that Dogecoin made a strong push – and could be forming the base for another surge to $0.19 or beyond. A strong performance from the world’s biggest meme coin creates a favorable environment for the purest, simplest, strongest meme coin presale – Token6900 ($T6900). Token6900 ($T6900) – All Meme, All the Time First there was the SPX6900 token, a meme with no utility, just a $1.2B market cap. It’s up 4.3% in the past week, kicking butt and taking names. Now there’s Token6900 ($T6900) , with even less utility but more…tokens? Yes, it has one more token than SPX6900. Talk about pettiness, right? The project is pure meme coin madness, all mood and all vibe. And it’s all potential, too – the potential to ride the growing meme market to unprecedented heights. The truth of $T6900 is that it isn’t just another meme coin – it’s the most literal meme coin possible. The truth is the meme, and the meme is truth. There’s no hiding, no fancy promises of future utility – just a meme, a presale, and slaptastic potential. True meme coin aficionados are already buying in; the presale has raised over $191K in a matter of days, with tokens priced at only $0.006425. Visit the Token6900 presale page to learn more. Memes Ready to Make Bank in Bullish Markets Crypto markets are currently buoyed by encouraging macro signals, institutional momentum, and regulatory progress. While underlying uncertainties persist, the prevailing sentiment leans toward upside – and Token6900 taps into that outlook to unleash pure meme coin momentum.

2025-07-03T12:00:06,"Celsius Secures Judge Approval To Pursue $4 Billion Lawsuit Against Tether","A US bankruptcy judge has granted permission for Celsius Network, the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, to pursue its lawsuit against Tether, the issuer of the market’s largest stablecoin, USDT. Celsius Alleges ‘Fire Sale’ Of BTC According to the filing , Celsius claims that it was in the process of preparing Bitcoin (BTC) to meet a collateral demand from Tether when Tether’s representatives insisted on immediate payment. This demand led to what Celsius describes as a “fire sale” of its collateral, resulting in the sale of 39,542.42 BTC. The company had transferred this amount to Tether as collateral in the 90 days leading up to its bankruptcy, which included various “top-up transfers” and new loan collateral. The details of the case reveal that Celsius is seeking the return of approximately 57,428.64 BTC, valued at around $4 billion, in addition to claiming $100 million in damages for breach of contract. However, there is a notable discrepancy regarding the valuation of these Bitcoin transfers; while Celsius demands the return of the full amount, Tether’s own communications suggest that the value involved is only $2.4 billion. Is Tether Preparing For Its Legal Defense? In its legal arguments, Celsius has asserted that Tether’s actions reflect a broader “scheme to exploit the US cryptocurrency market ,” which they believe could serve as a basis for jurisdiction in this case. Moreover, Celsius contends that the transfers made to Tether were preferential and should be scrutinized under bankruptcy law. They argue that the stablecoin issuer received more than it would have in a Chapter 7 liquidation, thus establishing a preference claim. Tether, for its part, dismissed the lawsuit back in August 2024 as a “shake down,” asserting that Celsius was responsible for providing additional collateral as Bitcoin prices fluctuated. Tether maintains that their demands were justified and that Celsius’s mismanagement should not impose undue costs on them. On Wednesday, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino shared a brief video clip on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, depicting a gladiator in a combat arena. This could indicate that the company will defend itself against Celsius’ claims, which could result in a prolonged legal dispute between the two parties. However, Tether’s official statement on the matter is still pending. In addition to the market’s regulatory developments, Bitcoin experienced a significant increase, nearing its record high of $111,800 reached in mid-May of this year. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $108,689, representing a 3% price increase in the 24-hour time frame. However, BTC reached a three-week high of $109,800 earlier on Wednesday, but was unable to surpass its nearest resistance at the $110,000 mark.

2025-07-03T11:50:51,"Altcoin Season Index at 24: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Dominant Reign","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 24: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Dominant Reign Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market? The Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric from CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered 24 at 00:30 UTC on July 3. This uptick from the previous day’s figure signals a clear message: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . But what does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these dynamic market conditions? Let’s dive deep into understanding this pivotal indicator and its implications for your cryptocurrency investing journey. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index (ASI): Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital compass for investors, helping to determine whether the broader market is favoring Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric that offers insights into prevailing crypto market trends . Here’s how this fascinating index works: Scope: The index tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a pure measure of market sentiment and capital flow. Timeframe: Its assessment is based on the performance of these coins over the past 90 days, providing a robust, medium-term view rather than short-term fluctuations. Defining Seasons: The index operates on a simple yet effective rule: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The Score: The index scores range from 1 to 100. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin Season. The current reading of 24, up four points, firmly places us in Bitcoin Season territory, meaning Bitcoin is currently the dominant performer against most major altcoins. To put it simply, the ASI tells us where the smart money is flowing. Is it into the established, less volatile Bitcoin, or are investors seeking higher, albeit riskier, returns in the myriad of altcoins? What Does ‘Bitcoin Season’ Truly Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season, it signals a period where Bitcoin’s price appreciation outpaces the vast majority of altcoins. This isn’t just about Bitcoin going up; it’s about Bitcoin going up more significantly than most other cryptocurrencies, or holding its value better during market downturns. During a Bitcoin Season, you’ll typically observe: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance, its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, tends to increase. This indicates that capital is consolidating in BTC, often seen as the ‘safe haven’ asset within the crypto space. Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, may struggle to gain significant traction. Some might even bleed value against Bitcoin, meaning their USD value might rise, but their BTC value (e.g., ETH/BTC, ADA/BTC) decreases. Reduced Volatility in BTC (Relatively): While Bitcoin is inherently volatile, during its season, it might offer comparatively more stability than the highly speculative altcoin market. Why does Bitcoin Season happen? Several factors contribute to this phenomenon: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or uncertainty, investors often flock to assets perceived as more stable. Within crypto, Bitcoin often plays this role due to its larger market cap, institutional adoption, and established network. Pre-Halving Rallies: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede significant price surges, drawing capital away from altcoins. Institutional Inflow: When large institutions enter the crypto space, their initial investments often flow into Bitcoin due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity. Market Cycle Behavior: Bitcoin often leads market rallies, with altcoins typically following once Bitcoin’s rally cools off and profits are rotated. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective cryptocurrency investing . It means re-evaluating risk exposure and potentially adjusting your portfolio allocation. The Elusive ‘Altcoin Season’: What Triggers the Shift? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is cyclical, and an Altcoin Season is always a possibility. This highly anticipated period is characterized by explosive growth in altcoin prices, often dwarfing Bitcoin’s gains. It’s when many investors see their smaller altcoin holdings multiply rapidly. What typically triggers a shift from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Peak: Often, Bitcoin’s dominance reaches a peak, and capital that flowed into BTC during its run begins to seek higher returns elsewhere. This ‘profit-taking’ from Bitcoin is then rotated into altcoins. Innovation and Narratives: New technological breakthroughs, significant upgrades to existing altcoin networks (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades), or emerging narratives (like DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens, GameFi) can ignite interest and capital flow into specific altcoin sectors. Reduced Risk Aversion: As the overall market gains confidence and stability, investors become more willing to take on higher risks associated with altcoins, which have lower market caps and greater upside potential. Liquidity Spreading: Once Bitcoin establishes a new price floor or consolidates, the increased liquidity in the market starts to spread out to smaller cap assets, leading to their exponential growth. Recognizing the signs of an impending Altcoin Season is key for maximizing returns. It requires constant monitoring of market sentiment, Bitcoin dominance charts, and news from promising altcoin projects. Navigating the Seasons: Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing Knowing whether it’s Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season isn’t just academic; it has direct implications for your cryptocurrency investing strategy. Adapting your approach based on the Altcoin Season Index can significantly impact your portfolio’s performance. Strategies During Bitcoin Season: With the Altcoin Season Index at 24, here’s how to navigate the current environment: Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: This is an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value, dollar-cost averaging into BTC can be a sound strategy. Selective Altcoin Accumulation: While most altcoins underperform, this period can be excellent for accumulating strong, fundamentally sound altcoin projects at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Research projects with solid technology, active development, and clear use cases. Risk Management: Reduce exposure to highly speculative or unproven altcoins. Their volatility can be amplified during Bitcoin Season, leading to significant losses. Education and Research: Use this period to research potential altcoin gems for the next Altcoin Season. Identify sectors or projects that could lead the next bull run. Strategies for the Next Altcoin Season: When the Altcoin Season Index starts climbing towards 75 and beyond, your strategy should shift: Profit Taking: Be prepared to take profits from your altcoin holdings. Altcoin seasons are known for parabolic pumps, but they can also reverse quickly. Having a profit-taking strategy (e.g., selling in tranches) is vital. Diversification within Alts: While Bitcoin Season often means consolidating into BTC, Altcoin Season might call for diversifying across promising altcoin sectors, spreading risk and capturing different narratives. Beware of FOMO: Not every altcoin will pump. Avoid blindly investing in every coin that is rising. Stick to your research and investment thesis. Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing your portfolio by moving some profits back into Bitcoin or stablecoins to secure gains and prepare for potential market corrections. Index Value Range Market Condition Key Characteristic Investor Action 75-100 Altcoin Season 75%+ of top 100 alts outperform BTC Focus on altcoin opportunities, profit-taking 25-74 Neither (Transition) Mixed performance, market indecision Cautious approach, research, observe 1-24 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer alts outperform BTC Focus on Bitcoin, strategic alt accumulation Table: Altcoin Season Index Interpretation and Investor Strategies Historical Context and Future Outlook for Crypto Market Trends History often rhymes in the crypto world. Past bull cycles have consistently shown phases of Bitcoin Season followed by an explosive Altcoin Season . For instance, in late 2017 and early 2021, Bitcoin led the initial charge, breaking new all-time highs. Once Bitcoin’s momentum cooled, capital flowed into altcoins, leading to massive pumps across the board. Understanding these historical patterns can provide valuable context for current crypto market trends . While past performance is not indicative of future results, it offers a framework for anticipating potential shifts. What could trigger the next shift from Bitcoin Season? Keep an eye on: Bitcoin Dominance Chart: A significant reversal or consolidation in BTC dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season. Major Altcoin Developments: Breakthroughs in scalability, new DeFi protocols, or significant institutional adoption of specific altcoins could act as catalysts. Global Economic Climate: A more risk-on environment in traditional markets might encourage greater speculation in altcoins. The market is a living, breathing entity, constantly evolving. Staying informed about these broader trends is paramount for successful cryptocurrency investing . Challenges and Considerations in Following the Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations and challenges: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on 90-day performance, meaning it reflects what has already happened. It’s not a predictive tool but rather a confirmation of current market conditions. Not All Altcoins are Equal: Even during an Altcoin Season, not every altcoin will pump. Many projects may fail, and some will simply not gain traction. Individual research and due diligence remain critical. Market Volatility: The crypto market is notoriously volatile. Conditions can change rapidly, and what is Bitcoin Season today might transition faster than anticipated. External Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory news, and major hacks or security breaches can override typical market cycle behavior. Therefore, use the Altcoin Season Index as one piece of your analytical puzzle, not the sole determinant of your investment decisions. Conclusion: Mastering the Seasons of Cryptocurrency Investing The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 24 unequivocally signals that we are in a period dominated by Bitcoin. This understanding is not merely academic; it provides a crucial framework for informed cryptocurrency investing . Whether it’s consolidating your position in Bitcoin, strategically accumulating promising altcoins, or preparing for the eventual shift to Altcoin Season , adapting your strategy to prevailing crypto market trends is paramount. The crypto market is a dynamic landscape, constantly shifting between periods of Bitcoin leadership and altcoin exuberance. By staying informed about metrics like the Altcoin Season Index and understanding the underlying drivers of these market seasons, you empower yourself to make more strategic decisions, navigate volatility with greater confidence, and ultimately, enhance your potential for long-term success in this exciting asset class.

The allegations are tied to the $4.5 billion embezzlement conspiracy carried out against the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, known as the 1MDB scandal, which began back in 2009. Standard Chartered “emphatically rejected” the claims made in the new Singapore lawsuit, according to a new Reuters report . Liquidators from the financial services giant Kroll filed the suit, claiming that the British bank enabled the 1MDB fraud. Standard Chartered allegedly ignored red flags and processed more than 100 intrabank transfers between 2009 and 2013, which contributed to hiding the 1MDB funds, according to three companies in liquidation associated with the scandal. Explain the liquidators, “According to this lawsuit, the transfers demonstrate serious breaches and control failings which ultimately enabled the theft of public funds by people operating at the highest levels of the Malaysian government during that period.” Standard Chartered told Reuters any claims made by the companies were “without merit.” Earlier this year, former Goldman Sachs employee Tim Leissner was sentenced to two years behind bars for playing a part in the multibillion-dollar heist. Prosecutors say that Leissner and others who worked for the banking giant aided Malaysia in raising $6.5 billion for the nation’s investment fund through bond sales.

I Sold All Altcoins, I Can Sell BTC Too!""","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, one of the outspoken names in the cryptocurrency industry, shared his new predictions about Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) and the market could move sideways or slightly more bearish between now and the Jackson Hole conference in August, Arthur Hayes wrote in a new blog post. Hayes stressed that US bonds should be bought instead and claimed that buying US government bonds was a mistake. Bitcoin (BTC) May Drop to These Levels! The famous name said that the US government's recent support for stablecoins is not to benefit fintech companies like Circle, but to strengthen large traditional banks and fill the treasury. At this point, Hayes said the U.S. Treasury Department needs new ways to sell trillions of dollars in bonds and replenish the U.S. Treasury (TGA) without causing interest rates to rise. This has led Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look for alternative buyers and stablecoins. However, according to Hayes, the US government's support for stablecoins is a huge liquidity game, which could negatively affect the Bitcoin price. Because the market is not interested in bonds at high prices, and this is pushing the US government towards stablecoins. At this point, according to Hayes, the issuance of stablecoins by US banks could provide a purchasing capacity of $6.8 trillion, and banks could convert their existing deposits into bond purchases. This could provide new liquidity to the market for the future and trigger an increase. However, Hayes said that by then, in the short term, Bitcoin could fall to the $90,000 to $95,000 range if the effort to refill the US Treasury and sell bonds negatively impacts USD liquidity. Arthur Hayes lastly stated that there is a risk that the US government's liquidity and stablecoin game could pull Bitcoin to the $90,000-$95,000 range, and that altcoins could also be negatively affected by this. At this point, Hayes stated that his company Maelstrom has sold all of its illiquid altcoin positions and is considering reducing its Bitcoin positions depending on market performance. *This is not investment advice.

Upbit also noted that if there is not enough liquidity at the launch, then the trading start time could be delayed. What Does MooDeng Mean?

Over time, MooDeng has become an affectionate symbol in Thai Pop culture, blending food humor with animal charm, which is perfect for a memecoin. Why is MOODENG Price Up Today?

2025-07-03T11:40:47,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 73: Unpacking the Market’s Bullish Confidence","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 73: Unpacking the Market’s Bullish Confidence The pulse of the digital asset world often beats to the rhythm of investor sentiment, and right now, that pulse is strong. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has soared to a notable 73, firmly entrenching itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This significant jump, a 10-point increase from the previous day, signals a palpable shift in the broader crypto market trends . But what does this elevated level of optimism truly signify for your investments and the future direction of digital assets? What Drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? For anyone navigating the often-volatile waters of cryptocurrencies, understanding the prevailing market sentiment is crucial. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, serves as a powerful barometer for this very purpose. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ the index distills complex market dynamics into a single, digestible number. But how exactly does it arrive at this figure? It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several key factors, each weighted differently to provide a holistic view: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes in a strong uptrend often indicate greedy behavior. Social Media (15%): The index sifts through various social media platforms, analyzing the number of posts and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies. A high volume of positive mentions can contribute to a ‘Greed’ reading. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component previously involved weekly polls to gauge the general sentiment of crypto investors. When active, it offered a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates a flight to safety (fear) or a belief in Bitcoin’s continued leadership (greed, if it’s leading an uptrend). Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies, particularly those indicative of fear or greed, this factor captures the public’s general interest and emotional state. The index’s rise to 73, therefore, isn’t arbitrary; it’s a calculated reflection of these combined forces pushing the market into a state of heightened optimism. Why the Sudden Surge in Market Sentiment? The recent 10-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73 isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal of shifting market sentiment . This significant uptick suggests a growing wave of confidence sweeping across the digital asset landscape. But what factors might be fueling this renewed optimism? While the index itself aggregates various data points, the underlying reasons often stem from a combination of on-chain activity, macroeconomic developments, and significant news events. For instance, positive developments around regulatory clarity, increasing institutional adoption, or even a sustained period of price stability can contribute to a more bullish outlook. When investors see consistent upward movement or resilience in the face of minor pullbacks, their apprehension often gives way to a desire to participate, pushing the needle further into the ‘Greed’ zone. This collective shift in perception is a powerful force, capable of creating self-fulfilling prophecies in the short term. Navigating the Greed Zone: Insights into Investor Psychology When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Greed’ zone, particularly at levels like 73, it offers fascinating insights into collective investor psychology . On one hand, high greed can be a sign of a strong bull market, where prices are rising, and confidence is high. Investors might feel a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), leading to increased buying pressure and further price appreciation. This can be a lucrative period for those already holding assets. However, it’s also a double-edged sword. Extreme greed often precedes market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, and prices are consistently hitting new highs, the market can become overextended and susceptible to sudden downturns. The prevailing sentiment might overshadow fundamental analysis, leading to speculative bubbles. For the discerning investor, understanding this psychological dynamic is paramount. It’s a time to review risk management strategies, consider taking some profits, or at least exercise caution against impulsive decisions driven by euphoria. The goal isn’t to predict the top, but to be prepared for potential shifts when sentiment is running hot. The Crucial Influence of Bitcoin Price and Dominance It’s impossible to discuss the overall crypto market trends without acknowledging the pivotal role of Bitcoin price . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the direction of the broader market. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects this influence, with Bitcoin’s volatility and market momentum being significant factors in its calculation. When Bitcoin experiences a strong upward trend, it naturally boosts overall market sentiment, pulling the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value can quickly plunge the index into ‘Fear.’ Furthermore, Bitcoin dominance , which accounts for 10% of the index’s calculation, provides another layer of insight. A rising Bitcoin dominance during a market rally can indicate that investors are prioritizing Bitcoin as the primary asset for gains, potentially at the expense of altcoins. Conversely, if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, leading to a drop in its dominance, it might signal a broader speculative phase. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin’s price action and its market share is essential for interpreting the index’s signals accurately and understanding the underlying forces shaping the market. Actionable Insights: How to Leverage the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s crucial to remember that it’s an indicator, not a crystal ball. Here are some actionable insights on how to use it effectively: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ A high ‘Greed’ reading (like 73) might suggest it’s a good time to be cautious, perhaps even to trim positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. Conversely, extreme ‘Fear’ can present buying opportunities. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the index. Integrate it with fundamental analysis (project utility, team, roadmap), technical analysis (chart patterns, support/resistance levels), and macroeconomic factors (interest rates, inflation) to form a comprehensive view. Risk Management: High greed periods are prime times to reassess your portfolio’s risk exposure. Ensure you’re not overleveraged or investing more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or profit targets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: The index is most useful for gauging short to medium-term market sentiment. Long-term investors might use it to identify opportune times for dollar-cost averaging, buying more during periods of extreme fear. Emotional Discipline: The index is a stark reminder of the emotional biases that drive markets. Use it to check your own emotions. Are you buying purely out of excitement (greed) or selling out of panic (fear)? Objectivity is key. Conclusion The ascent of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73, placing the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a compelling indicator of robust market sentiment and growing confidence among participants. While this elevated optimism reflects positive crypto market trends and the enduring influence of Bitcoin price , it also serves as a critical reminder for investors. Understanding the nuances of investor psychology is paramount; extreme greed, while exhilarating, often warrants a cautious approach. By leveraging the insights from this index in conjunction with sound financial principles and a disciplined strategy, market participants can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable landscape of digital assets, making informed decisions rather than succumbing to emotional impulses. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always prioritize prudent risk management.

2025-07-03T11:18:13,"Watch These 3 Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions in July","TL;DR Analysts see potential for further gains for XRP, with targets ranging from $2.80 to over $3.50 – while some even speculate on a parabolic rally similar to 2017. Despite the bullish outlook, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears 70, signaling potential overbought conditions and raising the chance of a short-term correction before any continued breakout. What’s Next for XRP? XRP has followed the overall resurgence of the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours, soaring to almost $2.30. Another factor that may have positively impacted its recent price performance is Ripple’s application for a license with the US national bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). According to multiple analysts, its ascent has yet to reach new dimensions. The X user CRYPTOWZRD noted that XRP closed the day “bullish,” setting $2.80 as the next resistance target. “The intraday chart was highly volatile and bullish. It is now testing the $2.2550 resistance target. A successful breakout and a close above this level will offer the next long opportunity,” the trader added. World of Charts believes an XRP breakout and retest has already been confirmed . The analyst expects a move towards $3 in the coming days, followed by a pump beyond $3.50 sometime this month. The X user Maxi is even more optimistic. The crypto enthusiast believes XRP could replicate its performance in 2017 when it experienced a staggering 1,200% surge in a matter of days. Nowadays, a spike of that magnitude would drive the token’s valuation to a new all-time high of $30. At the moment, such a rally seems quite unrealistic, considering that XRP’s market cap needs to skyrocket above $1.6 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is the only cryptocurrency whose capitalization exceeds that mark, while Ethereum (ETH) is far below with $313 billion. Observing Some Indicators Despite the bullish predictions, there are some red flags popping up suggesting the asset could head in the opposite direction in the short term. The Relative Strength Index, which measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes, has climbed to almost 70. Such readings generally mean that the valuation has increased too rapidly over a short period of time , signaling that it might be time for a correction.

2025-07-03T11:15:58,"IMF pushes back on Pakistan’s subsidized electricity proposal for crypto mining","The IMF has declined Pakistan’s bid for subsidised electricity for crypto mining, despite earlier plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus power to the sector. In a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Mohsin Aziz, Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan outlined the government’s recent efforts to negotiate subsidised electricity tariffs with the International Monetary Fund, as reported by Pakistan outlet Profit. Dr. Irfan explained that the proposal aimed to offer reduced electricity rates to energy-intensive sectors, particularly crypto mining and certain industrial operations, in hopes of spurring economic activity and utilising surplus power. However, the IMF rejected the idea, arguing that such subsidies could disrupt the energy market and add further strain to the power sector’s already fragile finances. This follows Pakistan’s earlier announcement of plans to dedicate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity specifically for Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and AI data centers under a national digital infrastructure initiative. The project aimed to attract foreign investment, create jobs in emerging technologies, and put idle generation capacity to productive use. You might also like: Pakistan confirms plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve Before this latest proposal, the government had floated other measures that also failed to gain the IMF’s approval. In September last year, officials suggested a six-month electricity tariff at marginal cost, pegged at Rs 23 per kilowatt-hour, to support crypto mining and other high-consumption industries. The IMF, however, agreed only to a shorter, three-month plan, citing worries over the potential disruption such incentives might create in the market’s equilibrium. Later in November, the government tried again with a targeted subsidy specifically crafted to encourage surplus electricity consumption, but the IMF dismissed that as well, likening it to sector-specific tax holidays that risk economic imbalance. Despite these setbacks, Dr. Irfan assured the committee that discussions with the IMF and other international bodies remain ongoing in search of a workable solution.

Wishing our U.S. readers a happy Independence Day. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC hit $110,000 for the first time since June 11 and is now within striking distance of its $112,000 all-time high, which was recorded on May 22. Bitcoin dominance has slipped from its June 22 high of just over 66% and now stands a bit above 65%. This figure reflects bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the entire crypto market. Currently, bitcoin boasts a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Today's major economic event is the release of the U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 110,000 last month, the smallest gain in four months and a slowdown from May’s increase of 139,000. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.3%, up from 4.2%. If this figure materializes, it would be the highest unemployment rate since October 2021. Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate has held within a tight range between 4% and 4.2%. The report comes a day early because of the July 4 holiday weekend, which is likely to see reduced trading volumes. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close at 1 p.m. today and bond markets at 2 p.m. Markets will remain closed on Friday, July 4. Ahead of the release, markets were pricing in a 75% chance that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.50% during its meeting scheduled for July 30. “On-chain flows remain stable, suggesting that major players are awaiting further signals from this week’s Non-Farm Payrolls and Initial Jobless Claims data,"" HTX Research wrote. ""Structurally, the market is navigating between two potential scenarios."" If labor data weakens, a confirmed September rate cut could ignite a renewed rally in BTC, HTX said. On the other hand, if NFP surprises to the upside, a break below $104,000 could trigger a technical correction. ""Overall, bitcoin now finds itself at a crucial inflection point, shaped by renewed capital inflows, rising speculative interest, and diverging macroeconomic expectations. The coming days could prove pivotal for confirming the next major trend in the market"". Stay alert!

The rally accelerated Wednesday following an announcement from fund manager Bitwise, which is rolling out a NEAR exchange-traded product (ETP) for institutional investors in Europe. Daily trading volume doubled over the past 24 hours, hitting $213 million as traders attempt to ride the coattails of NEAR's recent positive shift in sentiment. “The NEAR Staking ETP on Xetra opens a new bridge to NEAR for institutions by providing a regulated, exchange-traded way to earn staking rewards,"" Near Protocol CEO Illia Polosukhin told CoinDesk. NEAR's move also reflects broader altcoin market strength, with the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index rising by 7.74% in the past 24 hours and CoinDesk's memecoin index is up by 13.2% in the same period. Memecoins BONK and WIF are leading the pack, up 21% and 15% respectively on Thursday. Derivatives Positioning DOGE, LTC, XMR have seen the biggest increases in open interest in perpetuals listed on offshore exchanges. BTC, XRP perpetual futures open interest has jumped over 5% in 24 hours, validating the spot price rise. TRX and BCH continue to see a bias for shorts, as evidenced by the negative funding rates. Meanwhile, funding rates for XMR have surged to an annualized 40%, signifying potential overcrowding of long positions. Block option flows on Deribit featured bull put spreads in BTC — a net credit strategy that profits from price rise or consolidation.

In other words, the bar of negative expectations has been set low and the market may react violently if the data does show job losses. Weaker labor market data will likely strengthen the chance of Fed rate cuts, breeding bullish bitcoin volatility.

2025-07-03T11:10:12,"NASDAQ listed DeFi company expands in the Middle East, UAE","DeFi Technologies, a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance, has expanded its operation into the GCC and MENA region. The registration of DEFI DMCC includes offices in Jumeirah Lake Towers, Dubai, as the company seeks to offer digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) through its subsidiary, Valour, which has also opened a trading desk at the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) in the UAE. As per the press release, the DeFi Technologies team and its subsidiary Valour, aim to support the increased institutional interest in digital assets in the GCC region and specifically in the UAE. As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy. This includes Valour , which offers access to more than 65 of the world’s most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs with plans to offer 100 by the end of 2025. Growth of digital assets ETP products Globally, and regionally institutional investors and their capital are entering into the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The UAE is no exception as recently UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announced it expanded its position in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF showcasing the latest example of institutions increasingly turning to non-traditional exposures wrapped in an ETF. Investors who are interested in crypto but want to utilize traditional financial tools, are gravitating towards Bitcoin ETPs. This month in July 2024, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed strong inflows totaling 18,476 BTC, while Ethereum ETFs recorded 93,427 ETH inflows in the same week, this shows the increased appetite from institutional investors towards crypto wrapped in regulated financial instruments. Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour, stated, “We believe the demand for digital asset ETPs will increase not only globally but in the GCC and Middle East. Investors whether sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, family offices and even retail investors are interested in crypto but require familiar and efficient vehicles to get exposure.” He added that when wrapping digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated financial instruments, it increases the number of crypto investors. He believes this will allow countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia to access international foreign investment through locally listed digital asset ETPs, ETFs on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, the Dubai Financial Markets and others. DeFi Technologies expanded into Turkey and Africa DeFi Technologies has already expanded into Turkey through a collaboration with Misyon Bank, and Misyon Kripto to introduce ETPs . In Turkey currently over 50% of investor population are holding digital assets. In 2024, DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour partnered with GulfCap Investment Bank (“GCIB”), a licensed investment bank as its key Transaction Advisor for the proposed cross-listing of Valour’s ETPs on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) in Kenya. In Europe DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour currently offers 65+ fully hedged digital asset ETPs on leading European exchanges including Xetra, Spotlight, and Euronext.

2025-07-03T11:00:05,"Capo Of Crypto Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000, Doom Call For Altcoins","Crypto analyst Capo of Crypto, who is currently one of the most recognizeable names in crypto spaces on social media, has sounded a warning for the market. The analyst has completely dismissed the current trajectory of the Bitcoin price and, by extension, the altcoin market, calling for only a short-lived rally. His analysis points to a Bitcoin price crash, but the most impact is expected to be felt by the altcoin market as they tumble further. Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 In the post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Capo of Crypto shares a rather bearish thesis that suggests that the current strength in Bitcoin won’t last. He points out that the Bitcoin price hasn’t bottomed yet and that the capitulation event is yet to happen. Related Reading: XRP Roadmap To $8.5: Why The Next Impulse Could Start Soon A capitulation event is a time in the market when prices are falling, triggering panic among investors. This panic leads to further selling as investors become scared that prices will keep crashing, and this leads to deeper losses in the market. An example of a capitulation event is the FTX market crash, when the Bitcoin price fell by more than 60% in a matter of months. The crypto analyst predicts that the Bitcoin price will actually fall further, first below $100,000. Once this psychological level is broken, he sees the price heading for the $92,000 to $93,000 territory. However, he doesn’t expect the crash to end there as capitulation events often lead to deeper losses. He explains that if Bitcoin does fall below the $92,000-$93,000 support, then the market should expect to see prices as low as $60,000-$70,000. Altcoins To Get Decimated With the Bitcoin price expected to crash so hard, the effect on the altcoin market will be even more profound. Over the last few months, 10% dips in the Bitcoin price have translated to around 20-30% dips in altcoin prices. Therefore, a nearly 50% crash in the Bitcoin price would be disastrous for altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance Capo of Crypto actually expects altcoins to crash harder, predicting that they will fall another 50-80% if his idea of the market does play out. This could put the altcoin market on a path to new lows not seen in the last five years, and could be the worst bear market in recent history. This is not the first time that Capo has warned the community of an impending crash. Back in May, when the Bitcoin price was hitting new all-time highs, the analyst had warned that the market could reverse its gains. On May 15, he posted a picture of a Black Swan, suggesting that prices could crash. Since then, most altcoins have reversed their gains, with only Bitcoin managing to maintain most of its gains from that time period.

A full payload was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is no other military in the world that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” Bitwise CEO Believes US Treasuries Are Bitcoin’s Primary Rival Bitcoin has taken a key yet controversial role in global finance, competing with traditional and newer stores of value. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his views about the flagship cryptocurrency, stating that he believes that rather than gold, Bitcoin’s main competition is US Treasuries and other government bonds. Horsley called them the ultimate store of value, stating, “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition will end up being gold. Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being US Treasuries and other government bonds, the ultimate political stores of value.” Horsley explained that while gold and Bitcoin offer different levels of volatility, both attract investors looking for alternatives to traditional monetary assets. Horsley also outlined differences between institutional and individual investors. He noted that for individual investors, real estate was the primary store of value, questioning if residential real estate could be the true total addressable market for Bitcoin, moving the comparison from financial instruments to tangible wealth preservation assets. He also highlighted the evolving obstacles for Bitcoin investments, stating, “It used to be that ‘regulatory uncertainty’ was Bitcoin’s biggest obstacle for investors. This is no longer the case in 2025, which is a huge unlock. Its impact still hasn’t fully manifested.” Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term value despite global tensions and uncertainty. Speaking at the keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event, Saylor predicted BTC could reach $21 million in 21 years. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” Saylor made a similar, albeit more conservative prediction at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he said the flagship cryptocurrency would hit $13 million by 2045. Saylor stated that his bullishness on Bitcoin is based on several geopolitical, regulatory, and adoption developments. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this.” He also said he was always bullish on the asset, even when it plunged to $16,000 during the last crypto winter. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $100,979 as market sentiment plunged after the US entered the Israel-Iran conflict, conducting airstrikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. Expectations of a recovery after Friday’s decline were further dampened, as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to regain key levels. Market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, with traders wary of possible US involvement in the escalating situation in the Middle East. BTC’s latest decline was triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran, which led to over $450 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours, compared to $60 million in short positions. According to an analyst from CryptoQuant, the liquidation was a “cleansing of latecomers chasing the rally.” “Historically, BTC has shown bullish tendencies following rate stabilization, especially when paired with signs of liquidation exhaustion and fading open interest.” BTC started trading in positive territory the previous week, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to a low of $108,325 before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. Source: TradingView BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Bearish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Despite facing volatility and selling pressure on Wednesday, BTC registered an increase of 0.35% but fell 0.24% on Thursday to settle at $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level and settling at $103,388. The price plunged below $101,000 on Saturday as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered to reclaim $102,000 and settle at $102,180. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $102,558.

2025-07-03T10:45:12,"Law Firm Sues Michael Saylor’s Strategy Over Misleading Bitcoin Claims","New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy. Key Takeaways: Pomerantz filed a class action accusing Strategy of misleading investors about bitcoin risks. The lawsuit centers on Strategy’s failure to disclose the impact of new fair value accounting rules. Strategy revealed $5.9 billion in unrealized losses, causing an 8% stock drop in Q1 2025. The complaint, lodged in the Eastern District Court of Virginia , represents Strategy shareholders who purchased stock between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025. Investors have until July 15 to join the case. According to Pomerantz, Strategy overstated the benefits of its Bitcoin treasury strategy and downplayed the volatility and risks inherent to large-scale Bitcoin holdings. Lawsuit Alleges Strategy Misled Investors With Rosy Bitcoin Claims The lawsuit claims the company’s public statements were “materially false and misleading,” creating a distorted picture of financial performance that failed to prepare investors for potential losses. A key issue centers on Strategy’s adoption of new accounting rules under ASU 2023-08, which require fair value accounting for crypto assets. Unlike the previous cost-less-impairment method, where Bitcoin was only written down when prices fell and gains were recognized only upon sale, the new standard forces companies to mark assets to market prices each quarter. Pomerantz alleges Strategy did not properly explain how these changes could impact its financial results, leaving investors in the dark about the potential for substantial unrealized losses. ""Strategy is a ponzi scheme!!"" Saylor’s savage reply: pic.twitter.com/401E56m5iY — Alex (@AlexesNakamoto) June 11, 2025 The complaint highlights Strategy’s first-quarter 2025 earnings, in which the firm disclosed $5.9 billion in unrealized losses due to adopting the fair value accounting model. That revelation triggered an 8% drop in Strategy’s stock price, underscoring the volatility risks the lawsuit says were previously glossed over. Since shifting its corporate focus to bitcoin accumulation in 2020, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has become the largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies, amassing 597,325 BTC. The strategy has fueled explosive gains in its share price, which has climbed more than 3,300% over the past five years. That meteoric rise inspired several other firms, including Metaplanet, to emulate its Bitcoin-centric approach . Legendary Short-Seller Slams Bitcoin Treasuries as ‘Financial Gibberish’ Last month, legendary short-seller Jim Chanos criticized the business model popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, calling its approach “financial gibberish.” Chanos noted that Strategy’s market capitalization now tops $100 billion, nearly double the roughly $60 billion worth of Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. Saylor has defended Strategy’s valuation, arguing that the company’s ability to raise capital at a premium effectively renders its strategy “risk-free.” Chanos, however, rejected that logic outright. “There’s a wonderful sales job that’s being done about the fact that this is an economic engine in and of itself,” he said. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, has also voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms, warning that aggressive BTC accumulation could ultimately hurt shareholders.

2025-07-03T10:32:25,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 3, 2025","The crypto market is up today, after several days of trending mildly downwards. Nearly all of the top 100 coins per market cap have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has remained unchanged at $3.47 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $120 billion, the highest it’s been in days. TLDR: The crypto has shifted upwards, with dog-themed memecoins performing the best in both the top 10 and the top 100 categories; BTC surpassed the $109,500 level, moving closer to the ATH; ETH is the day’s second-best performer among the top 10; BTC supply in profit jumped from 87% to 98% in the last week of June; With elevated levels of profit comes elevated market volatility; US spot BTC ETFs continued positive flow streak, spot ETH ETFs saw outflows; “Any pull‑backs are more likely to be healthy consolidations than the start of a deeper reversal.” Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices appreciate today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 2.3%, surpassing the $108,000 territory and now standing at $109,515. Ethereum (ETH) has recorded the second-highest increase in the category of 6.1%, currently changing hands at $2,600. The best performer is Dogecoin (DOGE) , with an increase of 7.8% to the price of $0.1742. At the same time, the smallest increase is Binance Coin (BNB)’s 0.8% to $661. Eight of the top 100 coins saw double-digit increases. The highest among these is Bonk (BONK)’s 20.8%, trading at $0.00001738. Yesterday’s best performer, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , fell the most: 2.2% to $0.01533. Recently, BONK announced that it’s nearing 1 million onchain holders, a milestone that will trigger the burn of 1 trillion BONK.

(@bonk_inu) July 2, 2025 Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes opined that BTC could fall to the $90,000 level before hitting new highs. Arthur Hayes @CryptoHayes predicts Bitcoin will dip to $90K before rebounding on a flood of liquidity from US bank-issued stablecoins. #ArthurHayes #BitcoinPrediction https://t.co/9tk8DoJgCZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 The market uptick follows another increase in investor interest in the space. Notably, when it comes to UK pension funds, Cartwright Pension Trusts launched an “Annual Bitcoin Review” for its institutional clients . This came after a significant discussion prompted by the company’s revelation a client had allocated 3% of their fund to BTC in November 2024 and had posted a 60% return since. ‘With Elevated Profit Levels Comes Increased Market Volatility’ Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , noted that “Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics continue to showcase the strength of its current market position.” Per Glassnode data, BTC supply in profit jumped from 87% to 98% between 22 June and 29 June. “This is significant and reinforces just how bullish recent momentum has been,” Chait says. He continues: “With these elevated levels of profit, there often also comes a familiar pattern with digital assets: increased market volatility. Historically, when such a high percentage of supply sits in profit, the chances of profit-taking rise. That, in turn, introduces short-term market movements even when there is a broadly optimistic outlook.” Glassnode notes that distribution remains muted, and “investors are holding through.” As $BTC rebounds to $107k, most holders are back into profit. But distribution remains muted – investors are holding through. Realized profits decline, LTH supply hits ATH, and ETF inflows stay strong. Learn what to make of it in the latest Week On-Chain: https://t.co/Rc00Ql7P5x pic.twitter.com/g5OIvhk8lD — glassnode (@glassnode) July 2, 2025 US Federal Reserve funds futures put roughly a two‑in‑three chance on a first 25 bp rate cut by September after the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) held rates steady in June, Chait says. “Taken together, these factors suggest any pull‑backs are more likely to be healthy consolidations than the start of a deeper reversal. Regardless, this behavior is more a marker of a healthy, maturing market and shows Bitcoin’s growing alignment with secure and long-lasting investments that can handle global shocks while also attracting high levels of capital,” Chait concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $109,515. Over the past day, the coin has seen a steady increase from the daily low of $106,925. Resistance levels now stand at $109,764 and $110,809. Should it surpass both, BTC could break its ATH. At the same time, the current support level stands at $108,600. Bitcoin Price Chart.

Notably, the crypto market sentiment jumped today. Even though it’s still moving within neutral territory, the Fear and Greed Index surged from 46 yesterday to 54 today . The sentiment dipped briefly towards the fear territory, but the overall optimism seems to be renewed today. That said, investors are awaiting further signals. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) resumed positive flows after breaking a 15-day streak on 1 July. On 2 July, they recorded inflows of $407.78 million in outflows. Most ETFs saw positive flows today, led by Fidelity’s $183.96 million. The day’s amount has brought the cumulative total net inflow to $49.04 billion. However, US ETH ETFs recorded outflows today of $1.82 million . While Grayscale , Fidelity , Bitwise , and VanEck saw positive flow, BlackRock lost $46.89 million. Notably, the first Solana staking ETF in the United States, the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF , launched Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange . It ended the day strong , with $12 million in inflows and $33 million in volume. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume. Again, blows away the Solana futures ETF and XRP futures ETFs (or the avg ETF launch) but it is much lower than the Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/t6LkQwDXLc — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 On the other hand, the US Securities and Exchange Commission suddenly froze the approval of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund’s conversion into an ETF, stopping its launch just a day after it had received approval. The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling $GDLC it can't launch until otherwise notified. Not sure why, no other info than this letter. My guess tho: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any '33 act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins. So likely… https://t.co/Za7rYk1o0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has increased over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market saw another day of mixed performance on Wednesday. For example, the S&P 500 increased by 0.47%, the Nasdaq-100 went up by 0.73%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.024%. This comes ahead of the US jobs report investors are waiting to see released on Thursday. They’re also keeping an eye on trade and US budget bill discussions. Is this rally sustainable? This current uptick may not be long-lasting and may be interrupted by short-term drops, depending on the outside factors pushing down on the market. However, analysts expect the prices to climb mid-term despite potential dips.

2025-07-03T10:32:16,"Chrome And Firefox Users Targeted in Coordinated Crypto Credential Attacks","The post Chrome And Firefox Users Targeted in Coordinated Crypto Credential Attacks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Popular web browsers Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are facing serious security threats. While Chrome is being targeted through a dangerous zero-day vulnerability, Firefox users are under attack from a slew of harmful browser extensions . On July 1, cybersecurity experts uncovered a malicious campaign involving 45 fake Firefox extensions designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet details from unsuspecting users. Malicious Firefox Extensions Mimicking Crypto Wallets The 45 malicious Firefox extensions impersonate legitimate crypto wallet tools from widely used platforms such as Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. A security researcher at Koi Security, Yuval Ronen, reported on Wednesday that these extensions steal users’ wallet secrets and credentials. The linkage to discover the fake extensions was made through a meticulous effort to discover shared TTPs and infrastructure. This campaign has been active since April 2025 and is still evolving to discover further harmful activities in the browser. How Was This done The first step in the destructive move was to gain trust through ratings, reviews, branding, and functionality, which makes the extension appear widely adopted and well reviewed. After gaining trust, they used identical names and logos to impersonate the real services with visual similarities to deceive the users. In cases of open source, extensions cloned the real codebase and inserted their own malicious logic, creating extensions that behaved as expected by secretly stealing personal data. “The extensions extract wallet credentials directly from the targeted websites and exfiltrate them to a remote server controlled by the attacker. During initialization, they also transmit the victim’s external IP address, likely for tracking or targeting purposes,” said Koi Security. [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] Surge of Crypto Hacks in 2025 In May 2025, Coinbase Global announced that hackers obtained personal information, putting more than 70,000 customers at risk of attacks and extortion. Many global agencies, such as OFAC and FATF, have addressed various issues related to crypto hacks; however, despite the growing awareness, millions of individuals still fall victim to these crypto kidnappings. Risk Mitigation Steps Recommendations by Koi Security Install extensions only from verified publishers Treat browser extensions as full software assets Use an extension that allows and restricts installation to validated extensions only Timely monitoring to detect ownership transfers and other signs of compromise over time. To defend against the employees who unknowingly downloaded the malicious extensions for Firefox, these steps are to be followed, as recommended by Koi Security researcher, Ronen.
