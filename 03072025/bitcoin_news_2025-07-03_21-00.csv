2025-07-03T18:45:42,"U.S. Treasury Sanctions Russian Crypto Wallet Linked to Ransomware Operations","The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has just added the bulletproof hosting (BPH) services provider Aeza Group to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, a roster of individuals and organizations that pose threats to U.S. national security. BPH service providers sell access to internet infrastructures that enable cybercriminals, including ransomware actors, personal information stealers and illegal drug vendors, to evade detection and disruption of their malicious activities. In a statement, the OFAC says that the US is sanctioning the Russia-based web hosting company for its role in supporting cybercrimes that target victims in the US and around the world. The agency says the Aeza Group provided BPH services to ransomware and malware groups such as the Meduza and Lumma infostealer operators that targeted U.S. defense industrial base and technology companies. The Aeza Group also hosted the BianLian ransomware, RedLine infostealer panels and BlackSprut, a Russian darknet marketplace for drugs. Says Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, “Cybercriminals continue to rely heavily on BPH service providers like Aeza Group to facilitate disruptive ransomware attacks, steal US technology, and sell black-market drugs.” The OFAC also sanctions affiliated companies, including the UK front Aeza International, along with CEO Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev, general director Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan, technical director Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Gast and co-owner Igor Anatolyevich Knyazev. The designation prohibits US transactions involving the properties and interests of the sanctioned groups and individuals.

2025-07-03T18:43:02,"Senator Cynthia Lummis introduces crypto tax bill","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a cryptocurrency tax legislation proposal aimed at enacting a comprehensive digital asset tax framework in the United States. Lummis, who leads the Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee, unveiled the crypto tax proposal on July 3, 2025, a day after it failed to make into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as an amendment. The Senate recently passed OBBB, President Donald Trump’s mega tax and policy bill that’s now in the f inal stages of House approval before it heads to the president’s desk. You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill A digital asset tax legislation The lawmaker has now introduced the proposal as standalone legislation. It seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform how the U.S. tax code treats digital assets. Key highlights include a threshold, or de minimis rule, of $300 on crypto transactions, elimination of double taxation for crypto miners and stakers and tax parity – treating of crypto like other financial assets. The bill also proposes expanding securities lending rules to include digital assets, clarifying that digital asset lending is generally not a taxable event. “In order to maintain our competitive edge, we must change our tax code to embrace our digital economy, not burden digital asset users,” said Lummis. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid-for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world.” According to Lummis, it’s time America does not allow its “archaic tax policies” to stifle innovation. “My legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” she added. In a statemen, Lummis said she welcomes public comments on the bill. Lummis’ crypto tax bill joins other notable digital asset regulation bills in the U.S., including crypto market structure and stablecoin regulation. Both the CLARITY and GENIUS Act bills are matters currently on Congress’ calendar.

2025-07-03T18:41:13,"Bitcoin has surged nearly 12% since mid-January while the DXY index dropped 12%","Bitcoin is outpacing the US dollar’s top benchmark this year by a wide margin. The DXY index, which tracks the greenback against a group of other major currencies, has dropped 12% since mid-January. That drop has erased nearly five years’ worth of gains, while Bitcoin has climbed almost the same percentage over the exact same stretch. The DXY’s decline comes with plenty of caveats. The index leans hard on Europe, with over half of its weight tied to the euro. Another 20% or so is unevenly distributed between the British pound, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. Only one currency from Asia, the Japanese yen, makes it into the basket, holding around 14% of the index. The Chinese renminbi doesn’t appear at all. Even so, the US dollar has still slipped roughly 2.5% against the yuan since January. Bitcoin’s performance, when laid over DXY’s slide, shows clear divergence. The orange line, representing BTC/USD, has moved up nearly 12% in six months. Source: Blockworks The DXY , in blue, has dropped by nearly that exact percentage. A purple line in the chart showed BTC/USD after adjusting for DXY’s volatility starting from last year, further revealing how disconnected Bitcoin has become from dollar weakness. Looking at performance across different timeframes, BTC/USD has beaten crude oil, gold, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 across one-year, three-year, and five-year spans. Nvidia is the only major asset to outperform Bitcoin over three and five years, but it’s not displayed in the latest comparative chart. Bitcoin touches new highs across different metrics Rather than compare Bitcoin in dollar terms alone, analysts are now watching its price relative to major financial indices and commodities. The BTC/S&P 500, BTC/Nasdaq 100, and BTC/crude oil ratios all peaked in late May, with current levels still hovering just under those highs. In raw dollar value, Bitcoin remains just 2% below its all-time high. The gold/Bitcoin ratio hasn’t followed suit. It’s now 20% below its record from just before Christmas 2024, making it the only major cross to fall that far off its peak. Still, one milestone was hit early this morning on Coinbase, when Bitcoin reached $110,500. That price wasn’t just a dollar benchmark — it represented a new all-time high when adjusted for the DXY, coming in at 1139.58. That number is 2% above the previous DXY-adjusted high set in late May. While DXY’s structure has been questioned, the new record remains factual. The current price levels have major implications for short sellers. If BTC crosses $115,000 , more than $6 billion worth of short positions stand to be liquidated. And right now, with prices just shy of record highs, 99% of Bitcoin holders are sitting in profit, based on public blockchain data tracked since January.

2025-07-03T18:31:01,"Bitcoin: Unwavering Confidence as Long-Term Holders Command 74% of Circulating Supply","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Unwavering Confidence as Long-Term Holders Command 74% of Circulating Supply Are you ready to dive deep into the fascinating world of Bitcoin holdings? A significant shift is underway in the Bitcoin landscape, one that speaks volumes about investor sentiment and the future trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Recent data from on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode reveals a compelling story: Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) now possess an astonishing 14.7 million BTC. This figure represents a staggering 74% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, a record high that sends a powerful message to the entire crypto market. This monumental accumulation by seasoned investors suggests an unshakeable belief in Bitcoin’s future value. As Glassnode pointed out in a recent update on X, “Most coins bought near the $100k breakout remain dormant.” While Bitcoin hasn’t yet reached the $100,000 mark, this statement highlights the conviction that even coins acquired during significant price surges or anticipating major milestones are being held, not sold. This behavior is a strong indicator of enduring confidence in the Bitcoin price outlook , hinting at a potential supply squeeze in the months and years to come. Who Are These Unwavering Bitcoin Long-Term Holders? The term ‘long-term holder’ might sound exclusive, but it simply refers to Bitcoin addresses that have held their BTC for more than 155 days. These aren’t your day traders or short-term speculators. Instead, LTHs are often characterized by their strategic, patient approach to the market. They typically accumulate Bitcoin during periods of price consolidation or dips, and then hold onto their assets through market volatility, resisting the urge to sell during minor rallies or corrections. Why are they so important? LTHs represent the ‘strong hands’ of the market. Their accumulation and refusal to sell reduce the available supply on exchanges, creating a supply-side constraint. This reduced liquidity, when combined with consistent demand, can exert significant upward pressure on prices. Their actions often reflect a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and its long-term potential as a digital store of value and a hedge against inflation. Why Does 74% of BTC Circulating Supply Matter So Much? The fact that 14.7 million BTC, or 74% of the total BTC circulating supply , is now in the hands of long-term holders is a critical metric for several reasons. It’s not just a number; it’s a profound statement about market dynamics and future scarcity. Supply Shock Potential: When a vast majority of an asset’s supply is locked away by holders with no immediate intention to sell, it creates an environment ripe for a supply shock. Any significant increase in demand, whether from retail investors, institutions, or even nations, will meet a very limited available supply on exchanges, leading to rapid price appreciation. Reduced Market Volatility: With fewer coins actively trading, the market becomes less susceptible to large sell-offs from short-term speculators. This can contribute to a more stable and mature price action over time, albeit with inherent crypto volatility. Confirmation of Maturation: This trend indicates a growing maturity in the Bitcoin market. It suggests that a significant portion of investors view Bitcoin not as a speculative gamble, but as a foundational asset for long-term wealth preservation and growth. Consider this simplified comparison of Bitcoin supply distribution: Holder Category Approximate BTC Held Market Impact Long-Term Holders (LTHs) 14.7 Million BTC (74%) Reduces available supply, indicates strong confidence, potential for supply squeeze. Short-Term Holders (STHs) ~5 Million BTC (26%) Provides market liquidity, often reactive to price swings, contributes to short-term volatility. This distribution highlights the dominant position of LTHs, painting a bullish picture for future price action. What Drives This Robust Bitcoin Price Outlook? The confidence exhibited by Bitcoin long-term holders isn’t unfounded. Several factors contribute to their conviction in the positive Bitcoin price outlook : Halving Cycles: The quadrennial Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically precedes significant bull runs. LTHs understand this cyclical scarcity. Growing Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional capital, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for large investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This influx of capital creates sustained demand. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an era of increasing global debt, inflation concerns, and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a robust alternative asset, a ‘digital gold’ that can preserve purchasing power. Network Effects and Security: Bitcoin’s robust network, unparalleled security, and decentralized nature continue to strengthen its position as the premier cryptocurrency. The fact that LTHs are not capitulating, even after significant price movements, reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a serious asset class. Their ‘hodling’ behavior is a testament to their belief in its fundamental value, far beyond mere speculation. How Does This Reflect Overall Crypto Market Confidence? Bitcoin’s performance and investor sentiment often act as a bellwether for the broader cryptocurrency market. The strong conviction among Bitcoin long-term holders directly translates to robust crypto market confidence . When Bitcoin, the market leader, demonstrates such resilience and long-term holding behavior, it instills a sense of stability and optimism across altcoins and other digital assets. It signals that the underlying foundation of the crypto ecosystem is strengthening, attracting more capital and innovation. Historically, periods of strong LTH accumulation have often preceded significant market rallies. This current trend suggests that the market is building a solid base for future growth, moving past the more volatile, speculative phases seen in earlier cycles. It’s a sign that the ‘diamond hands’ are prevailing, setting a positive tone for the entire digital asset space. Crafting Your Bitcoin Investment Strategy in This Landscape Understanding the behavior of Bitcoin long-term holders provides valuable insights for anyone looking to refine their Bitcoin investment strategy . While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current data suggests a few key takeaways: Embrace a Long-Term Horizon: The success of LTHs underscores the power of patience. Instead of trying to time the market, consider a strategy focused on accumulating and holding Bitcoin for several years. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin, regardless of its price, can help mitigate volatility and build a substantial position over time. This strategy aligns well with the LTH mindset. Understand Scarcity: Recognize that as more Bitcoin is held by LTHs and the supply of new Bitcoin diminishes, its scarcity will likely increase its value over the long run. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While LTH data is encouraging, always conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. Diversification is also a wise approach. This record accumulation by long-term holders is not just a statistic; it’s a powerful narrative of belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance. It encourages a disciplined, forward-looking approach to investment, moving beyond short-term fluctuations to focus on the bigger picture. Conclusion: A New Era of Bitcoin Confidence The record 14.7 million BTC now held by long-term holders, representing 74% of the total BTC circulating supply , marks a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey. This unwavering commitment from seasoned investors paints an exceptionally bullish picture for the future Bitcoin price outlook and solidifies overall crypto market confidence . It signifies a maturation of the asset, where fundamental strength and long-term conviction outweigh short-term speculative urges. For those considering their own Bitcoin investment strategy , the message is clear: patience, conviction, and a long-term perspective are key in navigating the exciting landscape of digital assets.

Key Takeaways: Tether and Adecoagro signed an MoU to explore Bitcoin mining powered by renewable energy in Brazil. The project uses Adecoagro’s 230 MW energy capacity and Tether’s operational tools. South America is emerging as a new base for renewable-powered crypto infrastructure. The announcement said that the plan would use Adecoagro’s 230 megawatts of renewable power capacity across South America to run Bitcoin mining operations. Tether and Adecoagro To Power Bitcoin Mining With Renewable Energy In Brazil Learn more: https://t.co/Q8NhdgG79q — Tether (@Tether_to) July 3, 2025 Tether to Deploy Mining OS in South America Tether will provide infrastructure and operational oversight through its in-house Mining OS, which the company plans to release as open source in the coming months. “We’re excited to explore innovative ways to maximize the value of our renewable energy assets,” said Adecoagro co-founder and CEO Mariano Bosch. “This project opens the door to stabilizing a portion of the energy we currently sell on the spot market, locking in pricing, while also gaining exposure to the upside potential of Bitcoin,” said Bosch. The pilot project has been approved by Adecoagro’s Independent Committee under its related-party transaction policy. The companies plan to evaluate how Bitcoin mining could serve both as an alternative electricity off-take and a strategic treasury component. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the initiative stresses the firm’s goal to back decentralized networks with physical infrastructure. “We believe this model can drive financial inclusion, promote energy efficiency, and serve as a blueprint for responsible innovation at the intersection of technology and sustainability,” he said. Renewable-Powered Bitcoin Mining Gains Ground Adecoagro Board Chair Juan Sartori, who also leads Tether’s business initiatives, described the plan as a convergence of agriculture, energy, and technology. “[The partnership] allows us to explore a new intersection between agriculture, energy, and technology,” he said. The companies said the project will assess the viability of adding Bitcoin to Adecoagro’s balance sheet, similar to how it treats farmland assets. The collaboration could also inform longer-term diversification of Adecoagro’s energy strategy. Bitcoin mining tied to renewable energy is drawing increased attention from energy producers looking to balance load and monetize excess supply. South America’s emerging role in sustainable mining is also shaping how institutions assess digital asset exposure. While past mining growth concentrated in North America and Central Asia, companies in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina are starting to frame crypto infrastructure as part of their broader energy and industrial strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What distinguishes Brazil’s energy profile for crypto mining? Brazil has a high share of renewable electricity—mainly hydro and biomass—which makes it an appealing base for energy-intensive activities that seek low-carbon operations, including Bitcoin mining. How could this affect Bitcoin’s environmental reputation? If scaled, projects like this may shift the narrative around Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by anchoring mining operations in clean energy regions, particularly in the Global South. Are there risks in linking corporate energy strategies to crypto markets? Yes. Bitcoin price volatility and regulatory uncertainty could impact financial planning, especially if mining becomes a sizable part of a company’s energy demand or treasury model.

2025-07-03T18:25:38,"Nano Labs doubles down on BNB with $50m OTC purchase","Weeks after outlining a bold plan to acquire up to $1B in BNB, Nano Labs has made its opening move. The $50 million transaction was executed off-exchange, signaling careful accumulation and a long game with potential macro implications for BNB liquidity. In a press release on July 3, Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs confirmed it had purchased 74,315 BNB ( BNB ) tokens in an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, paying an average price of $672.45 per token. The transaction, totaling roughly $50 million, boosts the company’s combined crypto reserves, which include Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB, to approximately $160 million. The move marks the first major step in Nano Labs’ previously announced strategy to aggressively accumulate BNB, with an ultimate target of holding 5% to 10% of the token’s circulating supply. You might also like: Bitget Wallet cuts on-chain TRON USDT transver costs by 50% Nano Labs’ crypto pivot: a high-stakes bet beyond chipmaking Nano Labs seems to be rewriting its business model. The company’s $50 million BNB purchase, executed off-exchange, is more than a treasury play; it’s a calculated shift away from the volatile hardware sector that once defined it. According to Nano Labs’ recent financial report , its iPollo mining chips plummeted 39% in the second half of 2024, while losses narrowed primarily due to cost-cutting, not growth. The company posted just $2.2 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, a 39% decline year-over-year. Its losses, while narrowed, still clocked in at $8.4 million. But the optics change when viewed through the lens of balance sheet strategy. With R&D slashed by 62% and gross margins propped up by inventory adjustments, the Nano Labs’ pivot to crypto reserves looks less like an experiment and more like a survival strategy. Nano Labs’ previously unannounced 400 BTC reserve, acquired at a total cost of $40 million, was the first public pivot in that direction. This latest BNB buy expands that playbook and sets the stage for a far more aggressive accumulation push, with the company eyeing up to $1 billion in future purchases through zero-interest convertible notes. This playbook echoes the one written by Strategy. But where Strategy bet on Bitcoin’s scarcity, Nano Labs is targeting BNB’s utility. The token underpins one of crypto’s most active blockchains, yet trades at a 20% discount to its peak, weighed down by Binance’s regulatory baggage. If Nano Labs can amass 5-10% of BNB’s supply, it wouldn’t just corner the market—it could force a reevaluation of the token’s institutional viability. The Institutional BNB playbook Nano Labs isn’t alone in this wager. Former Coral Capital executives are raising $100 million through a Nasdaq shell company to hoard BNB, aiming to rebrand it as a corporate reserve asset. Their pitch mirrors Nano Labs’ logic: BNB’s value lies in the BNB Smart Chain’s ecosystem, not Binance’s legal woes. But the risks are stark. Unlike Bitcoin, BNB’s supply remains partly controlled by Binance, with 80 million tokens initially allocated to insiders. The token’s 18% year-to-date gain pales next to Cardano’s ( ADA ) 45% and Tron’s ( TRX ) 121%, a gap that reflects lingering skepticism.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Bluntz, tells his 322,200 followers on social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance ( BTC .D) metric is flashing a bearish divergence, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset. A bearish divergence occurs when the price is recording higher highs and higher lows while an indicator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recording lower highs.

Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), Mantle (MNT), Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM) are some of the best options, as they may offer returns of 50x to 100x or more. These currencies are poised to outperform others in the next several quarters due to new technology, low market capitalization, and considerable community enthusiasm. Here’s why you should buy them now, with new information and ideas to support it. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): the meme coin rocket Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is an ERC-20 token that drives a Layer 2 blockchain for memecoins. It cuts Ethereum’s gas expenses.

This may make Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) a meme celebrity like OG Pepe never thought possible. Tokenomics have been made clear. The distribution is designed to reward individuals who trust the project and hold onto their tokens for an extended period. There is no tax, a 10% liquidity fee, and 13.5% for staking and community awards. Over a quarter of the supply (26.5%) is set aside for presale, which gives early adopters a genuine interest in the kingdom’s future. This makes it a top pick for the fourth quarter. Mantle (MNT): the layer 2 efficiency star Mantle is a new on-chain ecosystem that aims to revolutionize the future of finance and blockchain scalability by integrating traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi).

2025-07-03T18:00:47,"MicroStrategy Faces Urgent Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Bitcoin Strategy Misleading Claims","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Faces Urgent Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Bitcoin Strategy Misleading Claims In a significant development shaking the cryptocurrency investment world, MicroStrategy, a prominent corporate holder of Bitcoin, finds itself embroiled in an urgent investor lawsuit . The renowned New York-based law firm, Pomerantz LLP, has initiated a class-action suit, alleging that the company misled investors regarding the profitability and inherent risks of its aggressive Bitcoin strategy . This legal challenge could have profound implications for MicroStrategy and serve as a crucial reminder for all investors in the volatile digital asset space. What’s Behind the MicroStrategy Investor Lawsuit ? The lawsuit, filed in Virginia by Pomerantz LLP, casts a spotlight on MicroStrategy’s public statements and disclosures concerning its substantial Bitcoin holdings. The core of the complaint revolves around accusations that MicroStrategy provided investors with a skewed perception of its Bitcoin strategy’s profitability while simultaneously downplaying the significant risks associated with such a concentrated bet on a highly volatile asset. This isn’t just about market fluctuations; it’s about the transparency and accuracy of information provided to those who entrusted their capital to the company. The legal action specifically targets investors who acquired MicroStrategy securities between April 2024 and April 2025. This timeframe is critical as it covers a period where Bitcoin experienced notable price swings, and new accounting rules began to shed more light on the financial impact of crypto holdings on corporate balance sheets. Understanding the Allegations: Misleading Bitcoin Strategy ? The plaintiffs allege that MicroStrategy’s communications regarding its Bitcoin strategy were deceptive. While MicroStrategy has long championed Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, the lawsuit suggests that the company failed to adequately convey the full extent of the risks involved. A key piece of evidence cited in the complaint is the staggering $5.9 billion in Q1 unrealized losses under new accounting rules. This figure, while not representing actual cash losses until assets are sold, highlights the significant paper losses incurred during a period of market downturns. For many, MicroStrategy became synonymous with institutional Bitcoin adoption. Its CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, often portraying it as a superior asset to traditional currencies. However, the lawsuit questions whether this enthusiasm translated into a sufficiently cautious and transparent representation of the strategy’s potential downsides to investors. The Role of Pomerantz LLP in Investor Protection Pomerantz LLP is a well-established name in the realm of class-action litigation, particularly known for representing investors in securities fraud cases. Their involvement signals a serious legal challenge for MicroStrategy. Law firms like Pomerantz play a vital role in holding companies accountable for their representations to the public, ensuring that investors have access to accurate and complete information when making investment decisions. The firm’s decision to pursue this class-action lawsuit indicates that they believe there is a strong basis to argue that MicroStrategy’s actions caused financial harm to its investors. This legal avenue allows a large group of individuals who may have suffered similar losses due to alleged misconduct to collectively seek redress. Navigating Unrealized Losses : A Deeper Dive The mention of $5.9 billion in Q1 unrealized losses is a critical component of the lawsuit. It’s important to understand what this means: Unrealized vs. Realized Losses: An unrealized loss occurs when an asset’s market value drops below its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. A realized loss occurs only after the asset is sold at a loss. New Accounting Rules: Recent accounting rule changes (like FASB’s ASC 825) require companies to report crypto assets at fair value, leading to more transparent, albeit volatile, reporting of gains and losses on their balance sheets. This means fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price are now more directly reflected in a company’s financial statements, even if the assets haven’t been sold. Impact on Investors: While unrealized losses don’t immediately affect cash flow, they can significantly impact a company’s reported earnings and net worth, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock price. The lawsuit argues that investors were not adequately prepared for or informed about the potential scale of such fluctuations. What This Class-Action Lawsuit Means for Investors and the Market This class-action lawsuit is more than just a legal battle; it’s a test case for how publicly traded companies manage and communicate their exposure to volatile digital assets. For MicroStrategy, a negative outcome could lead to substantial financial penalties and reputational damage. For the broader cryptocurrency market, it underscores the need for clear disclosure and responsible corporate governance when integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. For Affected Investors: If you invested in MicroStrategy securities between April 2024 and April 2025 and believe you were harmed by misleading information, Pomerantz LLP has set a deadline of July 15 for investors to join the case. This offers an opportunity for individuals to potentially recover losses through collective legal action. This lawsuit highlights the inherent risks in the crypto space and the importance of due diligence for investors. While the allure of high returns is strong, understanding the full spectrum of potential downsides and relying on transparent corporate communications is paramount. A Compelling Summary The class-action lawsuit filed by Pomerantz LLP against MicroStrategy represents a significant challenge to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Allegations of misleading investors and downplaying risks, particularly in light of substantial unrealized losses, underscore the complexities and potential pitfalls of corporate exposure to volatile digital assets. As the legal proceedings unfold, the outcome will not only impact MicroStrategy but also set a precedent for transparency and accountability in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Investors are urged to stay informed and understand their rights in this developing situation.

2025-07-03T17:59:51,"Top 8 Crypto Sportsbooks to Bet Any Sports Worldwide","If you want to bet any sports — no matter where you live or what you follow — you need a sportsbook that actually gives you full access. Some sites cut off markets based on location, licensing, or payment method. Others quietly block things like esports, smaller leagues, or prop bets without any notice. You may be able to deposit, but once you’re in, the limits start to show. That’s where crypto-based sportsbooks change the game. These platforms are built to give players global access, flexible betting markets, and full control over how — and where — they play. Whether you’re into UFC undercards, regional football leagues, or niche simulations, being able to bet any sports means choosing a site that won’t restrict you once the bet slip opens. How to Spot a Sportsbook That Lets You Bet Any Sports Not every site that looks big on the surface actually gives you full access under the hood. Some sportsbooks quietly limit what events you can see, which leagues you’re allowed to bet on, or even what your deposit method allows you to do. Here’s how to know a sportsbook truly lets you bet any sports — without restrictions or fine print that gets in the way. They List Every Sport — Not Just the Popular Ones Real full-access sportsbooks go beyond football, basketball, and tennis. You’ll see markets for esports, fight nights, amateur leagues, and even simulations. If the sports menu is slim, your betting options will be too. The Cashier Supports Crypto A crypto-supported cashier is usually a strong sign of fewer restrictions. Coins like BTC, ETH, and USDT don’t rely on banks or regional payment rails, which means the site is probably built to serve a global player base — without filtering based on location. No Geoblocking or IP Filters in the Sportsbook Some platforms allow registration but limit what you can bet on once your IP is detected. A sportsbook that truly lets you bet any sports won’t change your access based on where you log in from. Props and Live Bets Are Available If a book disables live odds, player props, or alternate spreads, it’s a sign that the platform might be restricted by regulation or internal limits. Full-access sites keep these markets active at all times, for all users. Bonuses Don’t Exclude Sports Check the terms on any promotion. If it says “only valid on football” or excludes esports and live bets, that’s a sign the sportsbook is shaping what you’re allowed to bet on. Real full-access platforms don’t force you into narrow promo rules. Why Crypto Makes It Easier to Bet Any Sports One of the biggest reasons offshore sportsbooks can offer full access is simple: crypto. Using digital currencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum, and USDT removes the barriers that traditional payment systems often create. No banks, no card networks, and no national blocks on who can deposit or where funds can be sent. With crypto, sportsbooks don’t have to filter users by country or restrict betting menus to comply with banking policies. That opens the door to more sports, more leagues, and more flexibility. You’re not limited by what your payment method allows or what your region restricts — you just deposit, play, and cash out. Most crypto-first platforms are also built to be globally accessible. They accept VPNs, don’t require local IDs, and rarely limit your sportsbook view based on IP. That means you can bet any sports, from anywhere, without worrying about being quietly filtered out of certain matches or markets. If you’re looking for true market access — esports, niche leagues, in-play props, and everything in between — crypto isn’t just an option, it’s the key.

Tips for Finding Sportsbooks That Don’t Block Markets It’s easy for a sportsbook to look global on the surface but quietly restrict what you can actually bet on. Whether it’s limited league access, country-specific blocks, or payout rules tied to your deposit method, some platforms aren’t as open as they claim. Here’s how to spot the difference before you sign up. Watch for Missing Markets If a sportsbook only shows major leagues — like the Premier League, NFL, or NBA — and skips esports, smaller tournaments, or live props, that’s usually a bad sign. A truly open platform will show you full coverage without filters based on location or popularity. Check the Fine Print Terms and conditions usually reveal more than the homepage. Look for anything that says “not available in your country” or “restricted markets.” Bonus rules can also expose limits — if a promotion is only valid on select sports, that may reflect wider platform restrictions. Use a VPN to Test Visibility Before you create an account, open the site using a VPN and browse the sportsbook. If the menu changes depending on where you’re logging in from, odds are it’s geo-restricted. A platform that lets you bet any sports won’t adjust based on your IP. Use Crypto to Skip Regional Filters Many restrictions are tied to fiat payment systems. Signing up and depositing with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another coin can often give you access that wouldn’t be available with traditional banking. Crypto sportsbooks are typically more open by design. Avoid Platforms That Hide Market Details If a sportsbook forces you to create an account just to see available markets — or doesn’t show full sports lists up front — it might be masking limited access. Reputable platforms are transparent about what’s available to all users. Conclusion If your goal is to bet any sports — across leagues, formats, and borders — you need more than a standard sportsbook. You need one that stays open: open to all users, all markets, and all types of bets. That means no geo-blocking, no filtered menus, and no fine print that gets in the way. The platforms in this list offer exactly that. They support crypto, give access to global events, and keep the full sportsbook available — regardless of where you’re logging in from. Whether you’re placing a live bet on a UFC undercard or backing an underdog in a regional league, they give you the access you need. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What does it mean to “bet any sports”? It means having access to all types of sports betting — major leagues, niche events, esports, simulations, props, and live markets — without regional or account-based restrictions. 2. Can I bet any sports using Bitcoin or Ethereum? Yes. Crypto sportsbooks are often the best way to bet any sports because they don’t rely on regional banking systems or block users based on location. 3. What are the best platforms to bet any sports? Offshore sportsbooks that accept crypto and skip geo-blocking give you the most access. Viking Luck, WSM Casino, and RakeBit are strong examples. 4. Do sportsbooks limit which sports I can bet on? Many do — especially those licensed in strict jurisdictions. To bet any sports freely, use offshore platforms that aren’t tied to national restrictions. 5. Are there restrictions on live betting? Some sites limit in-play betting or props based on your region. The best sportsbooks to bet any sports keep live markets open for all players. 6. Can I use a VPN to bet any sports? Most offshore sportsbooks allow VPN use and don’t limit market access based on your IP address. This helps you see and bet any sports without filters. 7. How do I know if a site offers full market access? Check the list of available sports before creating an account. If you see esports, minor leagues, and full prop options, you’re likely able to bet any sports. 8. Do bonus terms limit what I can bet on? Sometimes. If a bonus excludes esports, live bets, or specific leagues, it can restrict how you bet. Always read the terms if you want full freedom to bet any sports. 9. What’s the advantage of using crypto to bet any sports? Crypto avoids banking restrictions, enables faster payouts, and removes regional limits — making it the easiest way to access global sportsbooks. 10. Is it legal to bet any sports on offshore platforms? That depends on your location. The sportsbooks themselves are licensed offshore and legal to operate. Always check your local rules before depositing. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

2025-07-03T17:54:27,"Institutional Inflows Quietly Building in BTC: Metrics Suggest Breakout Risk","In the shadows of subdued retail interest and choppy price action, a silent force is gathering momentum in Bitcoin's corner. Institutional inflows are quietly but steadily building beneath the surface. While traditional on-chain metrics may fail to capture the full extent of this movement, multiple signs suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) may be gearing up for a breakout. This analysis, provided by Outset PR , a crypto-focused communications firm, takes a closer look at the disconnect between on-chain stagnation and off-chain accumulation. Like the firm’s approach to data-led PR strategy, the story unfolding in Bitcoin is one of latent buildup, not headline-making moves—at least, not yet. ETF Inflows Speak Louder Than Charts The most compelling evidence of institutional appetite comes not from blockchain data, but from regulated investment vehicles. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively drawn in nearly $4 billion in June 2025 alone, underscoring growing demand from asset managers, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Among them, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a behemoth, managing over $75 billion in BTC holdings, and frequently ranking in the top 10 most traded ETFs. Source: blackrock This surge in the ETF is a structural shift in how institutions access Bitcoin: through compliant, familiar channels that allow deep-pocketed investors to gain exposure without custody risk. And because ETF flows happen off-chain, they don’t leave a trail in traditional blockchain metrics like exchange balances or whale movements. Corporate Treasuries Quietly Stack Sats Corporations aren’t staying on the sidelines either. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues its relentless BTC accumulation, purchasing 4,980 BTC worth over $531 million in late June. This brings its total to an eye-watering 597,325 BTC, cementing its role as a strategic vault for the digital asset. Across the Atlantic, a quiet trend is unfolding in London: small- to mid-cap companies are turning to Bitcoin to revive investor interest. At least nine UK-listed firms have recently disclosed BTC holdings or plans to acquire the asset, echoing MicroStrategy’s playbook for shareholder value creation. Off-Chain Activity Skews On-Chain Readings While blockchain data shows modest exchange outflows and flat miner sales, the real story lies off-chain. Institutional buyers favor over-the-counter (OTC) desks and ETF vehicles, both of which obscure their footprints. As a result, analysts relying solely on on-chain metrics may miss the quiet accumulation underway. This divergence between visible metrics and institutional activity suggests a structural inefficiency in how crypto markets are currently interpreted. It also hints at latent demand pressure—the kind that doesn’t move prices immediately, but builds a coiled-spring setup. BTC Technical Setup Points to a Breakout Risk Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,700, consolidating in a tight band between $104,000 and $110,000. But beneath this calm lies a setup loaded with breakout potential. Source: tradingview According to technical analysts, clearing the $114,000 resistance level could unleash a rally of up to 25%, pushing BTC into the $140,000+ territory. Key resistance awaits at $114,000, and the next challenge will be surpassing the $123,000 mark. Support is solid just above $95,000. This setup hints at a possible upward movement. The 10-day and 100-day averages are aligned, suggesting steadiness. The RSI at 41 indicates it's not overbought, leaving room to climb. Overall, Bitcoin's path seems cautiously optimistic with room to test higher boundaries.

2025-07-03T17:48:10,"Why Is The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Lagging Peers?","Summary The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF has lagged peers in AUM growth and even has negative year-to-date BTC supply held through the fund. iShares dominates US Bitcoin ETF flows, capturing the vast majority of new investment and leaving little market share for smaller funds like BTCO. BTCO's 0.25% expense ratio is less competitive versus some peers, and its higher post-waiver fee at launch likely deterred long-term investors. Despite its small size, BTCO functions effectively as a Bitcoin ETF proxy, but cheaper and more established alternatives remain more attractive for most investors. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) getting increasingly gobbled up by the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) and Bitcoin Treasury companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) ( STRF ), not every US-listed Bitcoin ETF has benefited from the same types of inflows as the market leader. In this article, we'll look at the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) relative to peers. 12-Month Holdings Trend, BTCO (TheBlock) The fund's BTC holdings have fallen year-to-date, while the broader US-based Bitcoin ETF segment has seen year-to-date inflows of over 21% measured in BTC. Is there a reason why the fund has lagged the rest of the market in AUM growth over the last 6 months? I think yes. Bitcoin Capital Flows and Provider AUM As of June 27th, the capital flow story for Bitcoin continues to be incredibly impressive in 2025. As of article submission, the digital asset sector is working on 11 consecutive weeks of positive net flows into investment products. Bitcoin's month to date investment product net flow as of June 27th was $4.6 billion. Year-to-date net flow came in at nearly $15 million through the first half of 2025: Asset (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $4,604 $14,925 $159,399 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $1,432 $2,859 $14,614 Multi-asset -$17.3 $58 $6,814 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $8.3 $91 $1,328 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $21.2 $219 $1,184 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 BTC Dominance 76.0% 84.0% 86.4% Bitcoin is clearly benefiting from demand through capital flows, with 76% of digital asset net flow month to date and 84% share year-to-date. These are impressive numbers. It isn't just a Bitcoin story though, this is very much a BlackRock ( BLK ) story as well. When we break down the capital flows by provider, it's quite clear there is a dominant product provider in the market. The iShares funds account for 77% of the month to date flows and a staggering 96% of digital asset investment demand year-to-date. Provider (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $4,651 $17,053 $78,605 Grayscale $74 -$1,652 $29,892 Fidelity $355 $249 $21,516 ARK 21 Shrs $97 $75 $5,018 Bitwise $227 -$59 $4,511 ProShares $90 $526 $4,101 21Shares AG $18 -$200 $3,750 CoinShares XBT -$57 -$269 $3,446 Other $605 $2,055 $33,575 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of June 27th, 2025 Invesco's share of the digital asset investment space is so small that CoinShares doesn't even break it out in the company's digital asset fund flow reports. When we assess BTC AUM as a percent of total issuer AUM, Invesco's Bitcoin holdings are a rounding error while iShares has 1% of total AUM in Bitcoin: Billions (as of Q1-25) Total AUM Bitcoin ETF BTC % Invesco $1,845 $0.44 0.02% iShares $4,303 $46.60 1.08% Sources: Invesco, YCharts This kind of dominance is hard to overcome if you're a competitor like Invesco, and it begs the obvious question; why? BTCO Fund Details Like the other spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States, BTCO launched in mid-January 2024. For the sake of comparison, the table below shows fund details for the following Bitcoin ETFs: WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ). Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ). CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ). Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ). VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ). What each of these funds have in common is that they are the bottom 6 US-listed Bitcoin ETFs in the market in terms of assets under management: Fund Details BTCO BTCW EZBC BRRR BITB HODL Issuer Invesco WisdomTree Franklin Templeton Investments Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC Bitwise Investments VanEck Expense Ratio 0.25% 0.25% 0.19% 0.00% 0.20% 0.00% AUM $569.35M $169.44M $564.43M $641.00M $4.30B $1.72B Source: Seeking Alpha For me, the biggest standout difference between these funds is the expense ratios. At 0.25%, BTCO is on the expensive side relative to the selected funds above. But by itself, that doesn't necessarily explain the lack of interest in BTCO. For instance, BITB appears to be a significant outlier in this table. At a 0.20% expense ratio, that fund is closer to BTCO than a fund like BRRR yet has the largest AUM in our sample by far. In my view, there are two key reasons for this. First, Bitwise Investments is a crypto-native asset manager. This is not an issuer that touches traditional index ETFs and even has a digital asset fund that offers exposure to tokens like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Thus, I think Bitwise has benefited from crypto trustworthiness to a larger degree than each of the other issuers shows. Also, BITB uses part of its management fee to fund Bitcoin development. The other issuer that has committed to such an action is VanEck - so it's likely not surprising to see each of these two funds with the two largest AUMs of the bottom 6 funds. Still, this doesn't explain why BTCO has performed so badly against a fund like IBIT. I suspect the original roll-out of these funds has been a factor. Consider this screenshot from my Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) from January 2024 : Original expense ratios (Seeking Alpha/IntoTheBlock) Back in January 2024, when these funds originally launched, BTCO would have had one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market at 0.39%. Even though there was a 0.00% waiver on the first $1 billion in AUM or for 6 months, investors looking for long-term solutions likely balked at BTCO due to the fee after waiver. BRRR also had a high post-waiver fee and has a very similar AUM to that of BTCO today. Fund Performance Ultimately, what likely matters most for potential BTCO investors is how the fund actually performs compared to the products in the market. So far, there is virtually no difference between these funds based on total return over the last year: Data by YCharts We can see the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) is the obvious laggard of the bunch above. That is entirely due to the fund's egregious 1.5% expense ratio. But short of choosing to minimize third-party custodian risk to Coinbase ( COIN ) through FBTC, there is very little difference between these products. Closing Thoughts For investors looking for a simple way to get Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper, BTCO will work perfectly fine. Is it the cheapest fund? No. Is it the biggest by AUM? No. In fact, it's one of the smallest by AUM, and that is likely due to some combination of the fund's current 0.25% expense ratio relative to slightly cheaper alternatives today and the fact that the product launched with one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market. The lack of early adoption is perhaps haunting AUM growth today. But, again, purely as a Bitcoin proxy, it'll likely work just as well as the other funds that rely on Coinbase for custody.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799171-why-invesco-galaxy-bitcoin-etf-lagging-peers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL","BTCO",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T17:46:51,"Top Cryptocurrencies for Decentralized Gambling (BTC, Stablecoins, and More)","The rise of decentralized gambling has redefined how players engage with online sportsbooks and casinos. No more lengthy KYC procedures, delayed withdrawals, or centralized control. Thanks to blockchain technology, bettors now have the freedom to wager anonymously, instantly, and across multiple chains. But with so many cryptocurrencies available, which ones are best suited for the world of decentralized gambling? From the battle-tested Bitcoin to lightning-fast altcoins, here are the top crypto picks fueling the next generation of trustless betting. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): The OG That Still Dominates Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto betting. Despite its relatively slower transaction times and higher fees compared to newer chains, BTC is universally accepted across virtually every decentralized and centralized gambling platform. Its primary appeal is security and liquidity. For high-stakes players and whales, Bitcoin offers unmatched trust, deep market depth, and ease of conversion. It also continues to expand in Web3-native casinos that support fast deposits and withdrawals via Layer 2 integrations or wrapped BTC tokens. 2. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) For Predictable Play Stablecoins are rapidly becoming the preferred choice for everyday bettors. USDT (Tether) leads the pack thanks to its wide availability and robust liquidity, followed closely by USDC. With their value pegged to the US dollar rate, these tokens offer price stability which makes them ideal for players who don’t want market swings affecting their betting capital. Most decentralized casinos and sportsbooks including Dexsport now accept stablecoins across multiple chains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Tron, Polygon, etc.), enabling frictionless betting with near-zero volatility. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Powering Smart Bets Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized applications—including many of today’s most innovative gambling platforms. From on-chain sportsbooks to provably fair dice games, ETH is the fuel that powers trustless betting. With smart contracts at its core, Ethereum enables features like automated payouts, fair game logic, and transparent results. Though it can suffer from network congestion and gas fees, Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base) are rapidly improving transaction speed and affordability. 4. Tron (TRX): Fast, Cheap, and Gaining Ground Tron has quietly become a powerhouse in the crypto gambling space. Known for its ultra-low fees and high throughput, TRX is widely used in decentralized casino games and lottery-style applications. Its ecosystem supports a wide array of dApps and betting platforms, particularly in markets where low-cost transactions are essential. Tron’s native support for stablecoins like USDT also makes it a strong contender for cost-effective play. 5. BNB (Binance Coin): A Utility Giant with Casino Reach Binance’s BNB token has moved far beyond its exchange origins. Today, BNB powers one of the most active smart contract networks (BNB Chain), and countless decentralized casinos and betting platforms are built on it. BNB is often used for fast, low-fee wagers and in-house rewards on Web3 gambling platforms. Its compatibility with BEP-20 stablecoins also adds to its versatility, making it a favorite among cost-conscious bettors. Bonus: Dexsport – A True Home for Multi-Chain Bettors Looking to use these coins on a platform built for decentralized betting? Dexsport offers one of the best Web3 sportsbooks and casinos in 2025.

2025-07-03T17:45:00,"Dow Jones gains 344 points while S&P 500, Nasdaq hit new highs on strong jobs data","A strong labor market means that Fed rate cuts are less likely, but economic optimism still swept Wall Street. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts might come later than expected, but Wall Street is still optimistic. On Thursday, June 3, the Dow Jones closed higher by 344 points, or 0.77%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83% in a a shortened session ahead of Friday’s market close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.02%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reached record levels, as investor optimism boosted the market. NVIDIA was one of the stronger performers, rising 1.3% and reaching its all-time high. The rally put NVIDIA close to replacing Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The stock achieved a significant rally after a strong Q1 earnings report, showing that the chipmaker was not as affected by U.S. sanctions on China as many traders expected. You might also like: Retail traders dumped $258m in Nvidia stock: Will they buy Bitcoin instead? Strong labor market boosts the economy Traders were focusing on the June jobs report, which showed that the labor market remained more resilient than expected. The data revealed a 147,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, beating the forecast of 106,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, even as economists expected it to rise to 4.3%. A strong labor market has shown that the anticipated tariff-related damage to the economy has not materialized. Despite the potential disruptive effects of U.S. punitive tariffs on its trading partners, employers mostly stayed the course. Notably, businesses managed to avoid layoffs, hoping that the tariffs would be temporary. High employment likely means that the Federal Reserve won’t be under as much pressure to lower interest rates, even if inflation decreases. This is usually bad news for growth stocks, which tend to thrive in a low-interest rate environment. Still, the prospect of a robust economy and stronger-than-expected economic growth was enough to boost sentiment.

2025-07-03T17:43:52,"Are Stablecoins Taking Crypto Mainstream?","For years, cryptocurrencies have been circling the fringes of global finance. Yes, they’re fast and decentralised, but their inherent volatility has kept them just outside the mainstream. These days, though, something is changing. You’ve probably noticed it yourself. Crypto is no longer a niche financial sector populated by traders and maximalists; it’s cropping up in day-to-day payments, entertainment, business infrastructure and more. So why is this change occurring? One word: stablecoins. Far from being flashy tokens that ride the bear and bull markets, these coins do exactly what they say they do. Namely, their value doesn’t budge. Stablecoins Explained (And Why They Matter) So, what are stablecoins? Put simply, they’re digital currencies pegged to a “stable” real-world asset, usually fiat currencies like the US dollar. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI) are among the most widely used . While Bitcoin and Ethereum can rise or fall by 10% in an afternoon, stablecoins are engineered to hold their value steady. This stability comes from collateralization. A stablecoin is either backed by cash, short-term government debt, or crypto overcollateralization. You can think of them as the monetary equivalent of a ballast, used to anchor a ship that might otherwise capsize on rough seas. Why has this had such a transformative effect? Because stability is exactly what’s required to push crypto from speculative asset to everyday utility. Supporting Digital Entertainment In the UK, digital payments are already second nature. Contactless cards, Apple Pay, bank-to-bank transfers via Faster Payments — most consumers expect speed and ease. But crypto? It’s still a bit clunky. Convert to fiat, send to your bank, pay the fees, wait. This is where stablecoins are slotting in. They behave like cash in your crypto wallet, without the volatility or the need to off-ramp into sterling before spending. This shift is already visible in several digital-first sectors, with online casino gaming serving as a prime example. Traditionally, digital casinos were playable only with bankwire or bank card options, which meant gamers would have to wait up to five working days before seeing their winnings hit their accounts. Then, forward-thinking brands expanded their accepted payments to include digital wallets and pre-payment cards. Wildz Casino , for instance, offers fiat options like VISA, Skrill Neteller and several location-specific methods to properly cater to its users. In the years since, crypto casinos and gambling platforms have emerged, but until stablecoins came along, they lacked a degree of legitimacy — irrespective of the gaming authority awarding their operational licenses. Stablecoins provide a happy medium: allowing players to deposit in digital currency without being exposed to price swings. A user can deposit £100 worth of USDC and tomorrow it will still be worth £100. That’s the kind of dependability that operators and regulators alike can get behind. It simplifies accounting, aids legislative checks and removes the ambiguity that surrounds crypto price volatility. Revolutionising Payroll and Cross-Border Payments Stablecoins aren’t just turning up in gaming wallets. They’re quietly transforming another cornerstone of financial life: wages. Freelancers, remote workers and gig economy contractors in the UK and beyond are increasingly being paid in stablecoins. Why? Because it’s quicker, cheaper and often more reliable than conventional banking, especially for cross-border jobs. Companies like Bitwage, Noah and Circle allow businesses to pay staff in USDC or other stablecoins, bypassing the delays and fees associated with international bank transfers. Circle has already bridged transactions worth over $850 billion (around £627 billion) between fiat currencies and supported blockchains since 2018. For British freelancers dealing with clients abroad, these innovations can be transformative. No waiting three to five working days. No intermediary banks taking a slice. Just digital, dollar-pegged money, directly in your wallet — and ready to convert to pounds when needed. What This Means for Crypto Enthusiasts If you’ve been in the crypto space for a while, you’ll be familiar with the discourse: are stablecoins just fiat currencies dressed up in a digital asset costume? The truth is, stablecoins aren’t presenting as a replacement for fully decentralised assets like BTC or ETH. Rather, they offer a workable compromise, a way for crypto to function in the real world, without need to sacrifice its core mechanics. For UK investors and enthusiasts , there’s real opportunity here — you can swap, save, send or spend digital assets with stability.

2025-07-03T17:36:10,"Ripple price analysis: XRP eyes $2.42 if volume confirms breakout","Ripple continues to show technical strength, holding above key moving averages and support levels. A move above $2.42 could complete a market rotation, if volume confirms the upside push. Ripple ( XRP ) has maintained notable strength in recent price action, even as broader market conditions remain uncertain. The coin is currently trading above major support and has been respecting the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of trend continuation. The presence of confluence with high-value support zones suggests the asset may be poised for another leg upward, provided volume confirms the move. Key technical points Major Support at $2.09: I n confluence with the 200-day moving average and the value area low. Next Resistance at $2.42: Point of Control level acting as resistance within the current volume range. Low Volume Environment: Suggests accumulation phase; breakout requires increased volume for confirmation. XRPUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP has recently respected the $2.09 support level, a region of significance due to its alignment with both the value area low and the 200-day moving average. Holding above this level signals continued bullish structure, especially as price trends upward. Historically, the 200 MA serves as reliable dynamic support, and as long as XRP stays above it, the probability of further upside remains strong. The next logical price target lies at the $2.42 region, which marks the Point of Control within the current high time frame volume profile. A successful move toward this level would represent a full volume profile rotation, consistent with market auction theory. This theory suggests that once price bounces from the value area low and gains strength, a move toward the value area high and POC is likely, provided there’s volume expansion to support it. You might also like: Stablecoins supply crossed $250b on investor optimism: Binance report One key factor to monitor is the current lack of trading volume. While this may seem bearish at first glance, it more likely signals a phase of quiet accumulation at support. A strong rally will need to be supported by a notable influx of volume to confirm bullish conviction and signal the transition from accumulation to expansion. Until the 200-day MA or the $2.09 support is breached, the bullish structure remains intact. Traders should continue to monitor the strength of the trend and be alert for any surge in volume that could initiate the next move higher. What to expect in the coming price action If XRP holds above $2.09 and volume begins to increase, a rotation toward the $2.42 resistance becomes highly probable. Breaching this resistance would mark the beginning of a potential trend acceleration.

The mining company relies on its growing hashrate to boost its reserves. Mara Holdings (MARA) announced the milestone of building up its treasury to 50,000 BTC. Unlike other treasury companies, Mara Holdings combines a growing mining operation with occasional purchases. The company announced it plans to double down on expanding its mining operations, reaching 75 EH/s by the year end. 50,000 BTC now in MARA’s treasury. Fueled by 57+ EH/s of computational power, reinforcing new foundations for our nation’s digital economy and energy infrastructure. This is MARA for America in action. Next target: 75 EH/s by year-end. pic.twitter.com/CxJZs08tLW — MARA (@MARA) July 3, 2025 Mara Holdings started out at 27,000 BTC in the last quarter of 2024, taking up a series of deliberate purchases. After that, the company continued to accrue coins more slowly through its native mining operations. Currently, Mara Holdings has an unknown BTC acquisition price, but its costs may be lower compared to the newer wave of treasury companies. The company has also announced a $2B plan to buy more BTC, though the shares would be sold at intervals on the discretion of Mara Holdings. So far, the mining company has not shown any significant moves to acquire BTC more rapidly, instead focusing on mining operations. Mara Holdings grew its treasury in the past 12 months In the past 12 months, Mara Holdings nearly tripled its treasury, though it did not have a clear plan for copying Strategy (MSTR). The Mara.com pool currently produces around 7% of all blocks, with around 45 EH/s in active mining power. Mara Holdings expanded its treasury after a mining record in May, followed by a strong performance in June. | Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Based on its known wallets, Mara Holdings also mines as part of the Foundry pool, further putting its hashrate to work. Mara Holdings added 761 BTC to its wallets in June, following an inflow of 950 BTC in May, with none of the new coins sold. May was an absolute monthly record, followed by a slowdown in June, mostly due to weather conditions, stated Mara Holdings in its recent half-year report . The Bitcoin mining rate remains high, at over 1,000 EH/s for the entire network, despite the recent slowdown due to a heatwave. Mara Holdings has outpaced all other miners in its readiness to hold onto the newly produced BTC. Miner reserves remain at 1.89M coins, though not all are dedicated to treasuries. Other mining companies like Riot Platforms and CleanSpark have retained significant reserves, though they do not explicitly mention a treasury plan. Even before the announcement, MARA shares expanded by over 15% in the past week, trading at $16.78. MARA is at a one-month peak following a record month for BTC treasury companies. The past month marked another high tide for treasury companies. Over 68K BTC was taken off the market, ranging from large-scale purchases by Strategy to deals for under 10 BTC from virtually unknown businesses. In total, corporate buyers made 250 announcements, coming from companies in healthcare or even coffee sales. A total of 21 new treasuries were announced, buying around 6,745 BTC.

The company's shares more than doubled on Thursday topping $140, now rallying over 3,000% in less than a week since the firm announced the raising of $250 million by selling shares to acquire ETH. The private placement offering, priced at $4.50 per share and due to close today, attracted institutional investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG. At its core, Bitmine is positioning itself as a publicly traded proxy for ether exposure, similar to how Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) became a leveraged bitcoin bet. The approach has gained traction recently as investors look for new ways to access crypto through public equities. The firm originally focused on crypto mining using immersion cooling and held $16 million in bitcoin prior to the fundraising. Sharplink déjà vu But a similar crypto treasury stock's rapid rise and fall may offer a cautionary tale. The parabolic rise in BMNR mirrors the trading behavior of Sharplink Gaming (SBET), another public company that repositioned itself as an ETH treasury firm last month under the leadership of Consensys co-founder Joseph Lubin. Sharplink soared as much as 4,000% in days following its $450 million fundraising announcement. Shares since plunged over 90% from peak as the firm closed its ETH acquisition and early investors in the private placement sold stock locking in their profits. Bitmine’s valuation, with a market capitalization over $800 million at current prices, already prices in aggressive assumptions about the firm's future ETH gains. Retail investors chasing the momentum should tread carefully.

2025-07-03T17:03:03,"IMF blocks Pakistan’s plans to subsidise power for Bitcoin mining","Pakistan is facing backlash from the International Monetary Fund regarding its plan to channel surplus electricity into its cryptocurrency mining operations. Local media reports claim that Pakistan’s Secretary of Power, Fakhre Alam Irfan, has informed the Senate Standing Committee on Energy that the IMF has rejected the country’s proposal to offer subsidised electricity to energy-intensive industries, including Bitcoin mining. The Power Division’s plan, first floated in November 2024, proposed a marginal-cost tariff of 22–23 Pakistani rupees per kilowatt-hour for industries such as copper smelting, data centres, and crypto mining. Officials argued that this would help absorb surplus capacity, generate revenue, and ultimately draw in private investment across high-demand sectors. However, according to Irfan, the IMF opposed the measure on the grounds that it could destabilise the power market. IMF officials are concerned that such targeted incentives could worsen structural inefficiencies in the country’s fragile energy sector. While the plan has not been formally withdrawn, Irfan confirmed that it remains under review by the World Bank and other international partners. According to Irfan, any major changes in the energy policy would require clearance from the IMF, in line with Pakistan’s current financing programme. As part of a national push toward digital transformation, Pakistan designated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in May for Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure. Officials viewed this as a way to monetise stranded generation capacity during off-peak seasons while positioning the country as a competitive player in the digital economy. This wasn’t the country’s first attempt to restructure its electricity pricing to support crypto-related industries. In September 2024, officials proposed offering a six-month marginal-cost tariff for high-consumption sectors, like mining and data centres. However, the IMF only allowed a three-month arrangement, citing similar objections. The IMF’s concerns centre around potential market stabilisation, especially if subsidies are used to artificially stimulate demand in selective sectors. The Fund maintains that such policies could undercut broader structural reforms and compromise energy pricing discipline. Pakistan’s ambitions to become a crypto hub Pakistan has doubled down on its long-term crypto ambitions as it plans to position digital assets at the centre of its economic modernisation strategy. Officials believe that integrating blockchain technologies can help drive job creation, attract global capital, and improve financial transparency across public systems. Key initiatives the country is currently exploring include plans to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and build regulatory infrastructure to support the growth of decentralised finance and tokenisation platforms. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, State Minister on Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib announced the creation of a national Bitcoin wallet to hold sovereign reserves, which would be expanded through yield-generating strategies using decentralised finance protocols. To guide its national crypto strategy, Pakistan has tapped leading global figures for support and insight. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao has taken on an advisory role focused on blockchain infrastructure, while Strategy’s Michael Saylor has been consulted on the design and long-term structure of Pakistan’s sovereign Bitcoin reserve.

2025-07-03T17:01:26,"Solaxy Price Explodes 150% Following LBANK, MEXC Listing - Best New Meme Coin To Buy?","Solana meme coins are starting to print big green candles once again, perhaps front-running the imminent approval and launch of spot SOL ETFs. Besides large-caps like Bonk, Fartcoin and SPX6900, newer meme coins are also in the spotlight. For instance, the viral new token, Solaxy (SOLX) , has surged by nearly 150% since the start of this week. SOLX rose to fame as the first prominent Solana Layer-2 coin, raising nearly $60 million in its presale. Now, multiple CEX listings and the rollout of the Solaxy ecosystem have sent its price soaring. With the broader market outlook improving rapidly, SOLX now looks poised to fulfil analysts' projections of it being the next 10x crypto. Solaxy Price Is Soaring - How High Can It Go? Solaxy is among the Solana meme coins that are benefiting from the broader crypto market rally. The Bitcoin price has surged past $110k, while Ethereum and Solana have cleared key resistance levels as well. As the bull market euphoria returns, new low-cap meme coins will be in the spotlight once again. So far in this bull cycle, small-cap gems have delivered outsized returns when the market outlook improves, turning several small-scale retailers into millionaires. Solaxy also appears to be on the cusp of an explosive rally. On June 30th, the SOLX price market hit its macro bottom after claims went live for staked tokens. Since then, it has surged by more than 150%, currently trading at $0.00137. Elliot Wave analysis reveals that the corrective A-B-C move is over, and a new 5-wave upside move is now underway, which could result in a new all-time high. Notably, the SOLX price has flipped the key $0.00112 S/R level and has continued to hold above it despite several retests. Besides the broader crypto market rally, Solaxy is also benefiting from its new CEX listings. It debuted on MEXC on Wednesday and went live on LBANK today. Solaxy’s Layer-2 ecosystem rollout is adding to the bullish momentum. The mainnet is already live, and its highly anticipated meme coin launchpad is scheduled to go live on July 21, followed closely by the debut of its native DEX, Neptoon. Notably, many experts had previously called SOLX the next 10x crypto. It now appears possible that the meme coin reaches $0.0044 in the coming weeks, which would be a 10x rally from its June 30th low. Best New Meme Coin To Buy Besides SOLX With a new crypto market rally underway, new meme coins are back in the spotlight. Particularly, the new Bitcoin-themed meme coin, BTC Bull (BTCBULL) , couldn’t have picked a better launch date. BTCBULL is set to go live on exchanges on July 7th, right in the middle of a bull market. Its presale has already raised nearly $8 million, a sign of high upside potential and strong community support. $BTCBULL claim goes live 7th July, 2PM UTC. 🐂💥Don’t miss the charge. ⚔️ https://t.co/N1kqrY0bow pic.twitter.com/2mxOI6Qwsw — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 30, 2025 Bitcoin-themed meme coins are rare, which is one of the key reasons behind BTC Bull’s early success. The other is the strong demand for free Bitcoin. BTCBULL holders will receive free BTC airdrops, benefits from token burn events and a massive BTCBULL airdrop when the Bitcoin price hits certain set milestones. BTC Bull has tied itself to Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory, establishing itself as a way to bet that BTC will continue its forward march. Unsurprisingly, smart money investors are taking the bet. BTCBULL has already established itself as the best new meme coin to invest in.

2025-07-03T17:00:41,"Dogecoin’s Quiet Setup Could Detonate Shorty, Says Analyst—Here’s The Target","Dogecoin was changing hands near $0.174 in European trading on Thursday, extending a two-day rebound that began when buyers twice defended the mid-June floor around $0.16. The 11% recovery since the Tuesday low has put the largest memecoin back on traders’ radars, but technical analyst More Crypto Online cautions that what looks like an impulsive burst is in fact “all corrective in nature,” with the market still trapped inside a complex diagonal wave pattern that could just as easily fail. Dogecoin Is Quietly Coiling For A Potential Breakout In a video update recorded on 2 June, the analyst dissected the one-hour chart and concluded that the advance from the 22 June low is best counted as a three-wave move. “Because wave 1 … was only a three-wave move, the third wave should unfold as an ABC structure,” he said, underscoring that the rally lacks the five-wave DNA of a trend reversal. Even so, as long as Dogecoin defends what he called a “micro-support area between $0.16 and $0.166,” the diagonal remains valid and a measured target at $0.196—the 138 percent Fibonacci extension of wave 1—“remains plausible.” The roadmap is conditional. First, the current A-wave has to finish; then a corrective B-wave should follow, “and in the C-wave we could then rally to round about $0.196.” A probe toward $0.182 before that pullback cannot be ruled out, but the analyst warned viewers not to assume a straight shot higher. “Please be aware that we could be dealing with very choppy and messy structures,” he said. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under $0.20 ‘Is Free,’ Says Analyst—Predicts 2,000% Upside If bulls do force a full five-wave climb from the July swing low, that sequence would mark the first leg of a larger five-wave advance—a textbook signal that the broader down-trend from Dogecoin’s March peak may finally be exhausted. Failure to hold $0.16, however, would invalidate the diagonal count and expose the June lows near $0.151, where on-chain data show a thin layer of spot bids and little derivative support. Market context is mixed. CoinGecko data show Dogecoin’s 24-hour turnover has topped $1.5 billion, roughly in line with last week’s average, while the memecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin has weakened to 0.62, its lowest reading since early May. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit In the short term, though, all eyes are on the $0.16 band. As More Crypto Online summed up, “The diagonal pattern basically remains plausible as long as we’re holding that $0.16 level.” Should that floor survive the inevitable B-wave turbulence, Dogecoin’s “quiet setup” might indeed detonate shortly—propelling the token toward $0.196 and potentially signalling a more durable trend change. Notably, the upper boundary of Dogecoin’s long-running descending channel in the daily chart, now situated near $0.20, lines up almost exactly with More Crypto Online’s bullish target. A decisive breakout through this confluence would not only pierce the ceiling that has capped prices since the December 8 high at $0.4843 but could also validate the analyst’s call for a trend reversal. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.174.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s proposal to provide subsidized electricity tariffs for cryptocurrency mining operations, citing concerns that such a move would create economic imbalances and distort the nation’s fragile energy market.

In a new statement, the CMS says that an investigation discovered fraudulent Medicare.gov accounts were opened using personal data from its system, impacting 103,000 people. “On May 2, CMS’ 1-800-MEDICARE call center began receiving inquiries from beneficiaries who received letters confirming the creation of Medicare.gov accounts they did not initiate. CMS promptly launched an investigation and discovered that malicious actors had fraudulently created new accounts between 2023 and 2025 using valid beneficiary information, including Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers (MBI), coverage start date, last name, date of birth and zip code.” The fraudsters may have stolen other personal information as well, including provider information, mailing address, dates of service, diagnosis codes, services received and plan premium details. CMS is sending letters to those whose information was stolen, alerting them that it will send them a new Medicare card with a new Medicare number in the coming weeks. The federal agency says it has also deactivated all fraudulently created Medicare.gov accounts and disabled the ability to create new Medicare.gov accounts from foreign IP addresses. Victims are advised to obtain free annual credit reports through www.annualcreditreport.com and to file reports with local law enforcement and the Federal Trade Commission if any identity theft incidents occur.

2025-07-03T16:47:35,"Senator Lummis Introduces New Crypto Tax Bill for Bitcoin Users and Miners","The post Senator Lummis Introduces New Crypto Tax Bill for Bitcoin Users and Miners appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A powerful new crypto tax bill just landed in the U.S. Senate, and it could make a big difference for anyone using or holding digital assets like Bitcoin. Senator Cynthia Lummis is leading the charge to fix what she calls “unfair” and “outdated” tax rules that are hurting innovation and everyday users. So, what’s inside this bill? No More Taxes on Small Crypto Payments One of the biggest highlights of Senator Lummis’s bill is a special $300 rule. Under this, small crypto transactions like buying lunch or coffee won’t trigger tax reports. That means people can use digital assets like real money without worrying about tax trouble. There’s a limit, though: the total tax-free gains per year must stay under $5,000. Starting in 2026, the $300 amount will also adjust for inflation. This rule could finally make crypto spending as easy as using a debit card. The tax code shouldn't punish Americans for using new technology. My bill fixes the broken rules around bitcoin and digital assets. MORE https://t.co/1Wo6zjY8wY — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) July 3, 2025 Fairer Rules for Miners and Stakers The bill also wants to help crypto miners and stakers, people who help run blockchains and earn tokens in return. Right now, miners and stakers often have to pay taxes the moment they receive tokens, even if they don’t sell them. Meanwhile, with this new bill, taxes will only be due when the coins are sold or used. This helps avoid double taxes and makes it easier for people and companies to plan without worrying about sudden tax bills. Making Crypto Lending and Giving Easier The bill also supports crypto lending. It extends the same tax rules used for stock lending to digital assets. So, lending your crypto temporarily won’t count as a sale and won’t trigger taxes. And if someone wants to donate crypto to charity, the process becomes easier, too. They won’t need a costly appraisal for commonly traded assets, which could encourage more people to give. Boosting Innovation, Not Burdening It Lummis says this plan could bring in about $600 million in tax revenue over the next ten years. But more importantly, she argues it will protect innovation in America. She wants people and businesses to build the future here, not overseas, because the tax code makes it easy to participate safely. Even though she couldn’t attach the bill to Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Lummis believes this crypto proposal can still pass. With public comments now open, Senator Lummis is inviting everyone to have their say.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/senator-lummis-introduces-new-crypto-tax-bill-for-bitcoin-users-and-miners/,"REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T16:46:58,"Tether explores Bitcoin mining project in Brazil: check details","Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Brazilian energy and agriculture firm Adecoagro to explore the potential for Bitcoin mining using renewable power. As per the MoU, Tether, in partnership with Adecoagro, plans to mine Bitcoin using the Brazil-based renewable power provider’s surplus energy. Tether @Tether_to · Follow Tether and Adecoagro To Power Bitcoin Mining With Renewable Energy In BrazilLearn more: tether.io/news/tether-an… 6:35 pm · 3 Jul 2025 97 Reply Copy link Read 8 replies “In addition to monetizing surplus energy, Adecoagro recognizes that Bitcoin may become a new source of long-term value, like its farmland assets, and plans to use this mining project to initiate certain strategic exposure to Bitcoin in its balance sheet,” Adecoagro said Thursday in a statement. Tether’s plans with Adecoagro In May, Tether acquired a 70% stake in Adecoagro, marking the stablecoin issuer’s latest push into real-world assets and infrastructure. Adecoagro, which operates across South America, produces over 230 megawatts of power from renewable sources. “This project opens the door to stabilizing a portion of the energy we currently sell on the spot market, locking in pricing, while also gaining exposure to the upside potential of bitcoin,” said CEO Mariano Bosch. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has in recent months stepped up deployment of its profits across a broad set of industries, including artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and bitcoin mining. The move follows the appointment of Paolo Ardoino as CEO in 2023, under whom the company has pursued more aggressive investment in infrastructure tied to the broader crypto ecosystem. “The design and operation of the project benefits from significant synergies between Adecoagro’s energy and industrial expertise and Tether’s capabilities in the digital asset space,” the company added in the press release. Tether’s Bitcoin mining plans The collaboration is part of Tether’s broader push to expand its portfolio of sustainable, infrastructure-backed investments. “We’re proud to collaborate with Adecoagro. This project is another step in our growing commitment to renewable-powered bitcoin mining,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. He added that Tether is focused on building robust energy infrastructure and supporting decentralised networks, both of which align with Adecoagro’s existing capabilities in renewable energy. The new facility will run on Tether Mining OS, the company’s operating system for managing mining operations. Tether plans to open-source the software in the coming months. “The project will be operated using Tether’s Mining OS for site management, which will be open-sourced in the coming months,” as per the press release. Tether’s experience in the digital asset sector and growing mining footprint are expected to play a key role in making the partnership operationally efficient and aligned with long-term sustainability goals.

2025-07-03T16:43:25,"BONK Leads Memecoin Amid Crypto Rally While the Token Approaches 1M Holder Milestone","As bitcoin (BTC) hovers near a fresh all-time high, the Solana-based memecoin, BONK (BONK), is leading the major altcoin rally. The surge coincides with renewed optimism in risk assets following bitcoin's recovery above $110,000, which has triggered widespread gains across established cryptocurrencies. BONK's momentum appears sustainable as numerous crypto analysts express bullish sentiment, citing significant upside potential remaining. Adding to BONK's bullish case, the BONK foundation's token launchpad, LetsBONK.fun, recently surpassed competitor Pump.fun in daily volume with a 126% increase. This development benefits BONK holders as 50% of the platform's revenue is allocated to buying and burning BONK tokens, creating additional positive price pressure in a market already anticipating the upcoming 1 trillion token burn when the project reaches 1 million holders. Meanwhile, Tuttle Capital Management confirmed July 16 as the earliest possible launch date for its suite of leveraged crypto ETFs, including a 2× BONK ETF, fueling bullish sentiment. Technical analysis highlights The BONK-USD pair experienced increased buying pressure during the last 24 hours, from July 2, 16:00 UTC, to July 3, 15:00 UTC. It surged from $0.0000147 to a peak of $0.0000175, representing a 10.4% range, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. A significant volume spike to 2.9 trillion at midnight on July 3 established strong support at the $0.0000157 level, while high-volume buying at the $0.0000168 level during the 05:00 UTC hour propelled prices higher despite late session profit-taking, the model showed. However, during the last 60 minutes from July 3 at 14:50 to 15:49 UTC, BONK-USD experienced significant volatility, dropping from $0.00001666 to a low of $0.00001619 before recovering to $0.00001624. A notable volume spike of 86.9 trillion at 15:35 coincided with the price bottoming at $0.00001619, establishing a key support level. The subsequent recovery formed an ascending trendline with increasing volumes, particularly at 15:49, where 22.5 trillion in volume pushed prices up by 2.7% from the session low, according to the model.
