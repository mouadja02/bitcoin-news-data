2025-07-03T20:00:40,"TD9 Setup On Bitcoin Price Chart Suggests It Could Take 4 Years To Reach $149,000 — Details","According to a new analysis shared by crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, Bitcoin has just closed the quarterly chart with a perfected TD9 sell setup. This is actually interesting, because it adds a possibly long timeline before Bitcoin can reach any further significant price target. Most of Bitcoin’s daily candles in the past seven days have shown mild upward pressure supported by positive sentiment from various technical analyses. However, according to the TD9 setup, Bitcoin could take up to four years to reach $149,000. TD9 Setup Hints At Slow Climb To $149,000 The TD9 is a component of the TD Sequential indicator, which is often used to identify trend exhaustion, potential reversals, and possible trend changes. Interestingly, what makes this particular signal notable at this point is that it is now projecting a TD Risk level of $149,490, which is essentially a price target for Bitcoin. But if past patterns on the TD9 indicator are anything to go by, getting there might take much longer than bulls expect. Related Reading: Analyst Says Cycle Is Not Finished Amid 2 Years Of Bitcoin Sideways Movement In 2017, a similar perfected TD9 appeared during Bitcoin’s first rally to $20,000. At the time, the TD Risk was projected at $35,000. It wasn’t until late 2020, roughly four years later, that Bitcoin finally reached and broke above that level. A prior occurrence in 2014 offered the same story. Back then in 2014, the TD9 setup projected a TD Risk of $2,400, but it took approximately 3.5 years to cross that threshold. Now, despite the bullish sentiment today, this historical precedent suggests it could take similar years before the $149,490 target being currently projected by the TD Risk is finally tested or breached. The 3-month candlestick price chart shown above provides a visual analysis of this projection. From the 2014 cycle low, it took 915 days across 10 quarterly candles for Bitcoin to reach its next high. After the 2017 signal, it took 1,096 days (or 12 quarterly candlesticks) for BTC to finally surpass the projected TD Risk level. Bitcoin Price Action On Gradual Climb Bitcoin has spent the past seven days in a steady but modest uptrend, rising approximately 1.5% from a weekly low around $105,430 to the current range between $109,240 and $109,600. During this move, Bitcoin’s price action tested and retested resistance in the $108,200 to $108,800 zone several times in the past 24 hours. However, it ultimately pushed higher, showing a slow but stable bullish undertone. Related Reading: Analyst Calls For Bitcoin Crash As Price Pulls Above $108,000 — Details At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,330, up by 2% in the past 24 hours. It is currently about a 36% move away from reaching the $149,490 price target. However, if Tony Severino’s timeline on the TD9 Risk setup does play out, it wouldn’t be until sometime around July 2029 before Bitcoin reaches the $149,490 price target.

2025-07-03T20:00:06,"Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Two Factors Preventing Bitcoin From Going to the ‘Moon’ Despite Heavy Demand From ETFs","Fundstrat co-founder and chief investment officer Tom Lee is highlighting two possible reasons why Bitcoin ( BTC ) has failed to go to the “moon” despite the crypto king’s spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enjoying the “most successful product launch in history.” In a new CNBC interview, Lee says one of the reasons could be the strategy the spot Bitcoin ETFs have employed to accumulate the flagship digital asset. “I think what happened is a couple of things. One is a lot of these ETFs may have been receiving in-kind exchange. So people have their crypto keys, give it to the ETF provider and then they just stepped up their basis. So that’s not going to push up the price of Bitcoin.” The Fundstrat CIO further says profit-taking among early Bitcoin investors could be playing a role in suppressing the price of the largest crypto asset by market cap. “The second is that the ones who aren’t involved in ETFs, but maybe they have $10-Bitcoin… we have clients that have bought Bitcoin at $100 and now it’s $100,000. They don’t care if Bitcoin goes to $1 million. They are probably sellers at around $100,000. So we’re churning the base now because 95% of the institutional world doesn’t own Bitcoin. But a very significant portion of Bitcoin holders are sitting on huge gains. So I think this is the churn that’s happening in Bitcoin now.” The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $48.608 billion in net inflows since their launch in January of 2024. Bitcoin is trading at $107,290 at time of writing, around the same price it was at in December of 2024.

2025-07-03T19:58:25,"Bitcoin Demand Wanes: Fakeout or Parabolic Rally Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Demand Wanes: Fakeout or Parabolic Rally Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced reduced demand, especially from institutional investors despite the apparent net cash inflows in the last few weeks. According to on-chain data analysis provided by CryptoQuant, the net demand for Bitcoin has been falling in the recent past. Precisely, the overall demand for Bitcoin has contracted significantly, such that people purchasing Bitcoin reduced their demand by 895k coins in the past 30 days. The reduced Bitcoin demand amid significant cumulative short leverage trades has played a major role in its midterm bearish sentiment in recent weeks. Bitcoin Price Gains Bullish Momentum After closing above a crucial resistance level around $108,360 on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied towards the next milestone of around $110,570 on Thursday, July 3. Consequently, the flagship coin has regained the 50-day SMA as a support level and is now aiming to retest its all-time high of nearly $112k. Furthermore, BTC price has invalidated the previously formed falling trend after closing above the upper border of the logarithmic trend. According to market data analysis from CryptoQuant , the selling pressure from U.S. whales and institutional investors, has gradually declined. What the Charts Say BTC price is approaching to retest the all-time high around $111,814, which signals a potential double top if a rejection occurs. With the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) signaling a possible bearish divergence, it is prudent to wait for the BTC price to consistently close above $112k in the subsequent days to avoid being caught in a fakeout. The daily MACD indicator also shows that the bullish sentiment has been gaining momentum, whereby the histograms have been increasing above the zero line. The bullish momentum is also bolstered by the fact that BTC price has registered more positive monthly returns in Julys in the past ten years.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-demand-wanes-fakeout-or-parabolic-rally-ahead/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi tells his 868,400 followers on the social media platform X that ETH could eclipse the $3,000 price tag this quarter as it’s undergoing a “structural shift.” “I think we see $3,000+ this quarter for what it’s worth. Really can’t hate this chart. We’ve been in this new range for quite some time. I’d guess it resolves in the near future. It’s all about waiting. I do think there’s a structural shift occurring. Upside is 3.2x or so. Downside is in my opinion $2,100.” Source: Pentoshi/X Pentoshi goes on to note that he believes Ethereum will eventually “melt up,” not just against USD, but against other assets as well. “Ethereum probably melts up, and not just against the USD.” Source: Pentoshi/X The trader’s chart indicates that ETH will peak over $4,000 sometime during the start of 2025 before eventually settling around $2,500 in July of next year. Ethereum is trading for $2,577 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day. Moving on to BTC, Pentoshi says the top crypto asset by market cap’s movements since July 2023 don’t appear to be bearish. “This is not a bearish chart. It’s just not. I think the people who are bearish got chopped because of low time frames, which lead to both mental and financial chop.” Source: Pentoshi/X He concludes by noting that the crypto king should hit a new all-time high soon, but doesn’t give a specific date range.

The purchase brings the company’s total digital asset reserves, encompassing Bitcoin and BNB holdings, to approximately $160 million, representing a major milestone in Nano Labs’ strategic BNB accumulation plan. According to a July 3 press release , the Hong Kong-listed company plans to acquire up to $1 billion worth of BNB through convertible notes and private placements during the initial phase.

At that time, Nano Labs indicated it would perform comprehensive evaluations of BNB’s utility, network security, and long-term investment potential. @NanoLabsLtd has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate BNB worth up to $1 billion. #NanoLabs #BNB https://t.co/mPyfq9HiSQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 Today’s acquisition shows that Nano Labs has completed its assessment and is committed to establishing BNB as a strategic reserve asset. In the early hours of July 3, Nano Labs released a promotional video showcasing Binance’s nearly eight-year operational history. The advertisement, which states, “ Nano Labs is cheering you on as the big day approaches. Let’s keep building the future together ,” has led many observers to believe the company is genuinely convinced of BNB’s utility and value as a reserve asset, potentially making it the first public company to stockpile the ERC-20 token at this scale. While the company’s crypto treasury includes BNB, it also holds Bitcoin , which has become a standard reserve asset among public companies. Nano Labs currently ranks 31st among public companies by Bitcoin holdings , maintaining over 1,000 BTC in its treasury.

In January, Bhutan’s Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC) announced its decision to include BNB in its strategic reserves alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, since the announcement, the country, known for its pro-crypto initiatives similar to El Salvador, has not disclosed any actual BNB purchases. By holding BNB, Bhutan could directly participate in the Binance ecosystem, including its suite of DeFi tools, staking opportunities, and blockchain infrastructure.

Similarly, on May 28, Upexi, a Solana-focused treasury company, added 56,000 SOL to its holdings , bringing total reserves to 735,692 SOL worth over $110 million at current market valuations.

With $28.5 million fresh funding, TOP is betting big on blockchain’s mass-market moment. On July 3, The Open Platform announced a $28.5 million Series A raise led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from Pantera Capital, valuing the company at $1 billion and making it the first unicorn in the TON ecosystem. TOP said the funds will fuel its expansion into Western markets, including regulatory licensing and compliance efforts, while accelerating development of Telegram-native blockchain apps, from wallets to AI tools. Unlike many crypto ventures, the round was strictly equity-based, with no token component, signaling a deliberate pivot toward traditional venture backing. For Telegram, which has long tiptoed around the regulatory edge of blockchain adoption, the rise of The Open Platform as a billion-dollar player shows how its network has evolved from being just a distribution channel to a robust on-chain operating system. You might also like: Bitget Wallet cuts on-chain TRON USDT transver costs by 50% The TON ecosystem’s silent growth engine The Open Platform’s $28.5 million raise can be seen as a strategic move to scale an ecosystem that has quietly become one of crypto’s most effective onboarding tools. Unlike most popular blockchains that rely on speculative trades and DeFi yields to retain users, TON’s growth has been driven by something simpler: Telegram’s chat interface. TOP’s flagship product, the Telegram Wallet, eliminated the friction of seed phrases and external apps, allowing users to send Toncoin ( TON ) as easily as a message. Since going live in 2021, The Open Network has seen over 15 million wallets created through Telegram, with viral hits like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat bringing in millions of first-time crypto users. With a unicorn status and fresh capital injection, The Open Platform wants to double down on embedding blockchain more deeply within everyday mobile experiences. The developer said a significant portion of the funding will support expansion into markets where crypto integration often hits a wall, not due to lack of users, but because of outdated rules, fragmented enforcement, and tech stacks not built for mobile-native crypto engagement. TOP now finds itself in a rare position: already embedded within a messaging app that reaches nearly a billion users, and now capitalized to build the compliance stack to match. Whether that’s enough to deliver on its stated goal of “onboarding a billion users into crypto” remains to be seen.

Its value against other fiat currencies drops as the world’s confidence in the U.S. policies declines. What challenges does the American dollar face these days, and what influences its performance? Table of Contents Poor performance The reasons behind the dollar’s poor performance Do cryptocurrencies debase the American dollar? Poor performance The index used to estimate the USD value against six other currencies (the British pound, Japanese yen, Euro, Canadian dollar, Swedish króna, and Swiss franc) dropped by 10.8% during the first six months of 2025, even more than in the COVID-19 crisis. In 1973, this index fell by 15%. Also, the first half of 2025 was the worst six-month performance since 2009. While the expectations of the interest rate cuts by the American central bank are weakening the USD further, the Euro showed 13% growth instead of the predicted decline. Pension funds and big investors expand their exposure to European assets, reducing dependence on USD. While the dollar gets weaker, it doesn’t necessarily mean it loses its reserve currency function. The reasons behind the dollar’s poor performance The performance in the first half of 1973 was understandably bad, as it was the time of the collapse of the Bretton Woods System, which cemented the American dollar’s role as a central reserve currency in the 1940s. In 1973, the dollar lost its fixed value while the economy was under the burden of military expenses. In 2025, America is not involved in a high-scale military conflict; however, the American dollar faces challenges that may end up being as influential as the crash of the Bretton Woods System. There are two reasons that are often named as the reasons for the dollar’s decline: the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump and the constantly growing national debt of the U.S. The latter issue may worsen once the Big, Beautiful Bill becomes the law. The U.S. Senate has passed the Trump-backed “One Big Beautiful Bill” which now heads back to the House for consideration and a final vote. This bill extends tax cuts for the wealthy, overhauls programs like Medicaid and SNAP, increases border and military spending, along with a… pic.twitter.com/Esu6OhxBXM — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 1, 2025 Not only the harsh tariff policy itself, but its unpredictable back-and-forth nature, where Trump announces tariffs one day and then puts them on hold the next day, is to blame for the fading confidence of foreign investors in the United States of America. Trump’s erratic demeanor in the trade war is destroying the image of the U.S. as a trustworthy country with predictable behavior. Trump himself warns about the “pain” for Americans on the way to a better future. Lately, the POTUS has been busy pushing Jerome Powell to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This step, if made, could decrease the USD price further. It is exactly what happened when the Fed cut the rates in 1973. The Fed officials claim they are not cutting the rates as they try to bring inflation rates back to the pre-COVID-19 levels, which they have yet to accomplish. Read more: Inflation is up but below expectations. Will the Fed cut rates, and what does this mean for the crypto market? So, it comes that it is Trump who is advocating for the dollar debasement. What’s his goal in doing so? High demand for the U.S. dollar increases its value but makes goods produced in the U.S. too expensive. It makes goods produced elsewhere (let’s say China, Germany, or Japan) more attractive. It’s not hard to grasp that this situation is in direct opposition to Trump’s protectionist efforts and plan to bring manufacturers back to America. A strong dollar stimulates American manufacturers to leave the country. However, economist Kenneth Rogoff suggests that the dollar’s reserve role is not the only factor leading to trade deficit, and that trade war is not the most efficient way to fix things, while he admits that it works in terms of making leaders of other countries negotiate with Trump. Trump’s plans to boost spending while cutting taxes via a Big, Beautiful Bill make the future of the U.S. and its currency even more unpredictable. According to non-partisan experts, the bill may increase the national debt of America by $2.4 trillion. Others name an even bigger number. Currently, the debt stands at the $36.2 trillion mark. Do cryptocurrencies debase the American dollar? Cryptocurrency enthusiasts often speak about the USD as a currency that is already debased and unreliable. They see Bitcoin as a safe haven that has shown its ability to increase its value against the USD dramatically every five years. SENATOR LUMMIS: The dollar is designed to debase. #Bitcoin 's goal is to far exceed inflation. Bitcoin will continue to grow, whereas the dollar will continue to decline. pic.twitter.com/CrDJhxG9HT — Swan (@Swan) December 19, 2024 The strong value accumulation power of Bitcoin has promoted it to be a reserve currency for various corporations, governments, financial institutions, and many retail investors. Bitcoin and stablecoins (USD-denominated and others) became a staple for unbanked populations and sanctioned economies. Russian companies are trading with their foreign partners via cryptocurrencies to dodge sanctions. However, some of the participants claim that paying in crypto turned out to be so easy that they will continue to use cryptocurrencies even when the sanctions are lifted. It might seem that this transition to cryptocurrencies harms USD, previously preferred international currency; however, the volume of trades made in crypto is not critical yet, and it’s too early to speak about a serious influence. America is a leading country in terms of Bitcoin holdings, both corporate and governmental. More than that, its crypto-friendly regulations of 2025 will cement its leadership in the crypto space. If Bitcoin gets popular across the world’s governments, America becomes the top holder of two reserve currencies: the American dollar and Bitcoin. The leading role of the USD-pegged stablecoins around the world demonstrates and strengthens people’s trust in the American dollar and boosts demand for it (although in an indirect way). More than that, the issuers of USD-pegged stablecoins are prime buyers of the U.S. Treasury bills, dollars, and other American assets. The growth of these companies increases the demand for American currency. That said, cryptocurrency works ambiguously, and it would be incorrect to claim that crypto somewhat worsens the American dollar’s performance or threatens it.

2025-07-03T19:03:51,"Tether Ups The Ante In Bitcoin Mining Push With Adecoagro: Details","Tether Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency company, has partnered with Adecoagro to explore the use of clean energy for Bitcoin mining. As announced in a blog post, the two companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to start the pilot project in Brazil. The goal is to integrate clean energy with blockchain technology innovatively and efficiently. This project is part of a larger global trend in which countries and large mining firms are transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources to generate power. Turning Extra Renewable Energy into Digital Value Adecoagro generates over 230 megawatts of electricity using renewable sources. This includes biomass and biogas from its agricultural operations across South America. Some of this energy is sold on the open market when it is not needed for internal use. However, selling electricity this way can result in unpredictable prices and unstable returns. With this new project, Adecoagro aims to explore whether utilizing some of its excess electricity for cryptocurrency mining can generate additional value. Bitcoin mining typically requires a steady power supply to run powerful computers that secure the crypto network. This process could provide Adecoagro with a new way to generate a steady income from energy that might otherwise go to waste. This would also help balance energy use and reduce strain on local grids. Tether and Adecoagro To Combine Expertise in Mining Venture Tether, which holds a major stake in Adecoagro , has a strong background in digital assets and has launched several Bitcoin mining projects powered by renewable energy. The South American company, on the other hand, possesses strong skills in managing energy and sustainable farming practices. Together, they will utilize their combined knowledge to develop and manage this project. The mining site will use special software called Mining OS, created by Tether, to manage the operations. This software will also be made publicly available in the coming months to support transparency and collaboration within the industry. Adecoagro Sees Bitcoin as a Long-Term Asset This pilot project is not only about using energy more efficiently. It is also part of Adecoagro’s plan to begin gaining exposure to Bitcoin as a possible long-term store of value. The company already views farmland as a strong long-term investment. It now wants to see if the flagship crypto can offer similar value over time. By mining Bitcoin directly, Adecoagro can begin adding digital assets to its balance sheet in a controlled and strategic way. Furthermore, Adecoagro has rules for working with related companies. The project has been reviewed and approved by the company’s independent team. This is to ensure that the process is clear and fair. While the project is still in its early stages, both Tether and Adecoagro plan to continue working together to develop the mining site and gather data, they promised to share more updates with the public as the project moves forward.

BPH service providers sell access to internet infrastructures that enable cybercriminals, including ransomware actors, personal information stealers and illegal drug vendors, to evade detection and disruption of their malicious activities. In a statement, the OFAC says that the US is sanctioning the Russia-based web hosting company for its role in supporting cybercrimes that target victims in the US and around the world. The agency says the Aeza Group provided BPH services to ransomware and malware groups such as the Meduza and Lumma infostealer operators that targeted U.S. defense industrial base and technology companies. The Aeza Group also hosted the BianLian ransomware, RedLine infostealer panels and BlackSprut, a Russian darknet marketplace for drugs. Says Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, “Cybercriminals continue to rely heavily on BPH service providers like Aeza Group to facilitate disruptive ransomware attacks, steal US technology, and sell black-market drugs.” The OFAC also sanctions affiliated companies, including the UK front Aeza International, along with CEO Arsenii Aleksandrovich Penzev, general director Yurii Meruzhanovich Bozoyan, technical director Vladimir Vyacheslavovich Gast and co-owner Igor Anatolyevich Knyazev. The designation prohibits US transactions involving the properties and interests of the sanctioned groups and individuals.

Lummis, who leads the Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee, unveiled the crypto tax proposal on July 3, 2025, a day after it failed to make into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as an amendment. The Senate recently passed OBBB, President Donald Trump’s mega tax and policy bill that’s now in the f inal stages of House approval before it heads to the president’s desk. You might also like: Senator Lummis pushes for crypto-friendly amendments in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill A digital asset tax legislation The lawmaker has now introduced the proposal as standalone legislation. It seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform how the U.S. tax code treats digital assets. Key highlights include a threshold, or de minimis rule, of $300 on crypto transactions, elimination of double taxation for crypto miners and stakers and tax parity – treating of crypto like other financial assets. The bill also proposes expanding securities lending rules to include digital assets, clarifying that digital asset lending is generally not a taxable event. “In order to maintain our competitive edge, we must change our tax code to embrace our digital economy, not burden digital asset users,” said Lummis. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid-for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world.” According to Lummis, it’s time America does not allow its “archaic tax policies” to stifle innovation. “My legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” she added. In a statemen, Lummis said she welcomes public comments on the bill. Lummis’ crypto tax bill joins other notable digital asset regulation bills in the U.S., including crypto market structure and stablecoin regulation.

2025-07-03T18:41:13,"Bitcoin has surged nearly 12% since mid-January while the DXY index dropped 12%","Bitcoin is outpacing the US dollar’s top benchmark this year by a wide margin. The DXY index, which tracks the greenback against a group of other major currencies, has dropped 12% since mid-January. That drop has erased nearly five years’ worth of gains, while Bitcoin has climbed almost the same percentage over the exact same stretch. The DXY’s decline comes with plenty of caveats. The index leans hard on Europe, with over half of its weight tied to the euro. Another 20% or so is unevenly distributed between the British pound, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc. Only one currency from Asia, the Japanese yen, makes it into the basket, holding around 14% of the index. The Chinese renminbi doesn’t appear at all. Even so, the US dollar has still slipped roughly 2.5% against the yuan since January. Bitcoin’s performance, when laid over DXY’s slide, shows clear divergence. The orange line, representing BTC/USD, has moved up nearly 12% in six months. Source: Blockworks The DXY , in blue, has dropped by nearly that exact percentage. A purple line in the chart showed BTC/USD after adjusting for DXY’s volatility starting from last year, further revealing how disconnected Bitcoin has become from dollar weakness. Looking at performance across different timeframes, BTC/USD has beaten crude oil, gold, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100 across one-year, three-year, and five-year spans. Nvidia is the only major asset to outperform Bitcoin over three and five years, but it’s not displayed in the latest comparative chart. Bitcoin touches new highs across different metrics Rather than compare Bitcoin in dollar terms alone, analysts are now watching its price relative to major financial indices and commodities. The BTC/S&P 500, BTC/Nasdaq 100, and BTC/crude oil ratios all peaked in late May, with current levels still hovering just under those highs. In raw dollar value, Bitcoin remains just 2% below its all-time high. The gold/Bitcoin ratio hasn’t followed suit. It’s now 20% below its record from just before Christmas 2024, making it the only major cross to fall that far off its peak. Still, one milestone was hit early this morning on Coinbase, when Bitcoin reached $110,500. That price wasn’t just a dollar benchmark — it represented a new all-time high when adjusted for the DXY, coming in at 1139.58. That number is 2% above the previous DXY-adjusted high set in late May. While DXY’s structure has been questioned, the new record remains factual. The current price levels have major implications for short sellers. If BTC crosses $115,000 , more than $6 billion worth of short positions stand to be liquidated. And right now, with prices just shy of record highs, 99% of Bitcoin holders are sitting in profit, based on public blockchain data tracked since January.

2025-07-03T18:31:01,"Bitcoin: Unwavering Confidence as Long-Term Holders Command 74% of Circulating Supply","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Unwavering Confidence as Long-Term Holders Command 74% of Circulating Supply Are you ready to dive deep into the fascinating world of Bitcoin holdings? A significant shift is underway in the Bitcoin landscape, one that speaks volumes about investor sentiment and the future trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Recent data from on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode reveals a compelling story: Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) now possess an astonishing 14.7 million BTC. This figure represents a staggering 74% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, a record high that sends a powerful message to the entire crypto market. This monumental accumulation by seasoned investors suggests an unshakeable belief in Bitcoin’s future value. As Glassnode pointed out in a recent update on X, “Most coins bought near the $100k breakout remain dormant.” While Bitcoin hasn’t yet reached the $100,000 mark, this statement highlights the conviction that even coins acquired during significant price surges or anticipating major milestones are being held, not sold. This behavior is a strong indicator of enduring confidence in the Bitcoin price outlook , hinting at a potential supply squeeze in the months and years to come. Who Are These Unwavering Bitcoin Long-Term Holders? The term ‘long-term holder’ might sound exclusive, but it simply refers to Bitcoin addresses that have held their BTC for more than 155 days. These aren’t your day traders or short-term speculators. Instead, LTHs are often characterized by their strategic, patient approach to the market. They typically accumulate Bitcoin during periods of price consolidation or dips, and then hold onto their assets through market volatility, resisting the urge to sell during minor rallies or corrections. Why are they so important? LTHs represent the ‘strong hands’ of the market. Their accumulation and refusal to sell reduce the available supply on exchanges, creating a supply-side constraint. This reduced liquidity, when combined with consistent demand, can exert significant upward pressure on prices. Their actions often reflect a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and its long-term potential as a digital store of value and a hedge against inflation. Why Does 74% of BTC Circulating Supply Matter So Much? The fact that 14.7 million BTC, or 74% of the total BTC circulating supply , is now in the hands of long-term holders is a critical metric for several reasons. It’s not just a number; it’s a profound statement about market dynamics and future scarcity. Supply Shock Potential: When a vast majority of an asset’s supply is locked away by holders with no immediate intention to sell, it creates an environment ripe for a supply shock. Any significant increase in demand, whether from retail investors, institutions, or even nations, will meet a very limited available supply on exchanges, leading to rapid price appreciation. Reduced Market Volatility: With fewer coins actively trading, the market becomes less susceptible to large sell-offs from short-term speculators. This can contribute to a more stable and mature price action over time, albeit with inherent crypto volatility. Confirmation of Maturation: This trend indicates a growing maturity in the Bitcoin market. It suggests that a significant portion of investors view Bitcoin not as a speculative gamble, but as a foundational asset for long-term wealth preservation and growth. Consider this simplified comparison of Bitcoin supply distribution: Holder Category Approximate BTC Held Market Impact Long-Term Holders (LTHs) 14.7 Million BTC (74%) Reduces available supply, indicates strong confidence, potential for supply squeeze. Short-Term Holders (STHs) ~5 Million BTC (26%) Provides market liquidity, often reactive to price swings, contributes to short-term volatility. This distribution highlights the dominant position of LTHs, painting a bullish picture for future price action. What Drives This Robust Bitcoin Price Outlook? The confidence exhibited by Bitcoin long-term holders isn’t unfounded. Several factors contribute to their conviction in the positive Bitcoin price outlook : Halving Cycles: The quadrennial Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically precedes significant bull runs. LTHs understand this cyclical scarcity. Growing Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional capital, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for large investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This influx of capital creates sustained demand. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an era of increasing global debt, inflation concerns, and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a robust alternative asset, a ‘digital gold’ that can preserve purchasing power. Network Effects and Security: Bitcoin’s robust network, unparalleled security, and decentralized nature continue to strengthen its position as the premier cryptocurrency. The fact that LTHs are not capitulating, even after significant price movements, reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a serious asset class. Their ‘hodling’ behavior is a testament to their belief in its fundamental value, far beyond mere speculation. How Does This Reflect Overall Crypto Market Confidence? Bitcoin’s performance and investor sentiment often act as a bellwether for the broader cryptocurrency market. The strong conviction among Bitcoin long-term holders directly translates to robust crypto market confidence . When Bitcoin, the market leader, demonstrates such resilience and long-term holding behavior, it instills a sense of stability and optimism across altcoins and other digital assets. It signals that the underlying foundation of the crypto ecosystem is strengthening, attracting more capital and innovation. Historically, periods of strong LTH accumulation have often preceded significant market rallies. This current trend suggests that the market is building a solid base for future growth, moving past the more volatile, speculative phases seen in earlier cycles. It’s a sign that the ‘diamond hands’ are prevailing, setting a positive tone for the entire digital asset space. Crafting Your Bitcoin Investment Strategy in This Landscape Understanding the behavior of Bitcoin long-term holders provides valuable insights for anyone looking to refine their Bitcoin investment strategy . While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current data suggests a few key takeaways: Embrace a Long-Term Horizon: The success of LTHs underscores the power of patience. Instead of trying to time the market, consider a strategy focused on accumulating and holding Bitcoin for several years. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin, regardless of its price, can help mitigate volatility and build a substantial position over time. This strategy aligns well with the LTH mindset. Understand Scarcity: Recognize that as more Bitcoin is held by LTHs and the supply of new Bitcoin diminishes, its scarcity will likely increase its value over the long run. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While LTH data is encouraging, always conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. Diversification is also a wise approach. This record accumulation by long-term holders is not just a statistic; it’s a powerful narrative of belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance. It encourages a disciplined, forward-looking approach to investment, moving beyond short-term fluctuations to focus on the bigger picture. Conclusion: A New Era of Bitcoin Confidence The record 14.7 million BTC now held by long-term holders, representing 74% of the total BTC circulating supply , marks a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey. This unwavering commitment from seasoned investors paints an exceptionally bullish picture for the future Bitcoin price outlook and solidifies overall crypto market confidence . It signifies a maturation of the asset, where fundamental strength and long-term conviction outweigh short-term speculative urges. For those considering their own Bitcoin investment strategy , the message is clear: patience, conviction, and a long-term perspective are key in navigating the exciting landscape of digital assets.

The pilot project has been approved by Adecoagro’s Independent Committee under its related-party transaction policy. The companies plan to evaluate how Bitcoin mining could serve both as an alternative electricity off-take and a strategic treasury component. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the initiative stresses the firm’s goal to back decentralized networks with physical infrastructure. “We believe this model can drive financial inclusion, promote energy efficiency, and serve as a blueprint for responsible innovation at the intersection of technology and sustainability,” he said. Renewable-Powered Bitcoin Mining Gains Ground Adecoagro Board Chair Juan Sartori, who also leads Tether’s business initiatives, described the plan as a convergence of agriculture, energy, and technology. “[The partnership] allows us to explore a new intersection between agriculture, energy, and technology,” he said. The companies said the project will assess the viability of adding Bitcoin to Adecoagro’s balance sheet, similar to how it treats farmland assets. The collaboration could also inform longer-term diversification of Adecoagro’s energy strategy. Bitcoin mining tied to renewable energy is drawing increased attention from energy producers looking to balance load and monetize excess supply. South America’s emerging role in sustainable mining is also shaping how institutions assess digital asset exposure. While past mining growth concentrated in North America and Central Asia, companies in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina are starting to frame crypto infrastructure as part of their broader energy and industrial strategies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What distinguishes Brazil’s energy profile for crypto mining? Brazil has a high share of renewable electricity—mainly hydro and biomass—which makes it an appealing base for energy-intensive activities that seek low-carbon operations, including Bitcoin mining. How could this affect Bitcoin’s environmental reputation? If scaled, projects like this may shift the narrative around Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by anchoring mining operations in clean energy regions, particularly in the Global South. Are there risks in linking corporate energy strategies to crypto markets? Yes. Bitcoin price volatility and regulatory uncertainty could impact financial planning, especially if mining becomes a sizable part of a company’s energy demand or treasury model.

According to Nano Labs’ recent financial report , its iPollo mining chips plummeted 39% in the second half of 2024, while losses narrowed primarily due to cost-cutting, not growth. The company posted just $2.2 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, a 39% decline year-over-year. Its losses, while narrowed, still clocked in at $8.4 million. But the optics change when viewed through the lens of balance sheet strategy. With R&D slashed by 62% and gross margins propped up by inventory adjustments, the Nano Labs’ pivot to crypto reserves looks less like an experiment and more like a survival strategy. Nano Labs’ previously unannounced 400 BTC reserve, acquired at a total cost of $40 million, was the first public pivot in that direction. This latest BNB buy expands that playbook and sets the stage for a far more aggressive accumulation push, with the company eyeing up to $1 billion in future purchases through zero-interest convertible notes. This playbook echoes the one written by Strategy. But where Strategy bet on Bitcoin’s scarcity, Nano Labs is targeting BNB’s utility. The token underpins one of crypto’s most active blockchains, yet trades at a 20% discount to its peak, weighed down by Binance’s regulatory baggage. If Nano Labs can amass 5-10% of BNB’s supply, it wouldn’t just corner the market—it could force a reevaluation of the token’s institutional viability. The Institutional BNB playbook Nano Labs isn’t alone in this wager. Former Coral Capital executives are raising $100 million through a Nasdaq shell company to hoard BNB, aiming to rebrand it as a corporate reserve asset. Their pitch mirrors Nano Labs’ logic: BNB’s value lies in the BNB Smart Chain’s ecosystem, not Binance’s legal woes. But the risks are stark. Unlike Bitcoin, BNB’s supply remains partly controlled by Binance, with 80 million tokens initially allocated to insiders. The token’s 18% year-to-date gain pales next to Cardano’s ( ADA ) 45% and Tron’s ( TRX ) 121%, a gap that reflects lingering skepticism.

2025-07-03T18:05:38,"Trader Says the Time To Be Bullish on Altcoins Is Here, Updates Outlook on Bonk and One Other Solana-Based Memecoin","A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is suddenly turning bullish on altcoins. The analyst, pseudonymously known as Bluntz, tells his 322,200 followers on social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance ( BTC .D) metric is flashing a bearish divergence, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset. A bearish divergence occurs when the price is recording higher highs and higher lows while an indicator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recording lower highs. The RSI indicator is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions. “The three-day BTC dominance bear divergence ended up rolling into a weekly bear divergence, too. The time to be long alts is here in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X BTC.D is a metric that calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to Bitcoin. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are printing gains faster than BTC. BTC.D is 65.34% at time of writing. Next up, the trader says that the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Bonk ( BONK ) may more than double in price after breaking out of a descending trendline on the five-day chart. “Really not too sure about ATHs, but pretty confident BONK is going at least 100-130% higher.” Source: Bluntz/X He also says that alts similar to BONK are starting to enter uptrends as well. “BONK ecosystem coins going pretty crazy right now to be honest… Can’t be long BONK ecosystem without being long BONK to be honest.” BONK is trading for $0.00001614 at time of writing, up 9.7% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the trader says Useless Coin ( USELESS ), a SOL-based memecoin, could hit the level around $0.50 as it remains in a strong uptrend. “USELESS dips still getting bought up every day constantly despite already being up big. $500 million market cap looks within reach.” Source: Bluntz/X USELESS is trading for $0.248 at time of writing, down 7.6% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $247.5 million, the memecoin is the 256th largest crypto project.

2025-07-03T18:00:47,"MicroStrategy Faces Urgent Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Bitcoin Strategy Misleading Claims","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Faces Urgent Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Bitcoin Strategy Misleading Claims In a significant development shaking the cryptocurrency investment world, MicroStrategy, a prominent corporate holder of Bitcoin, finds itself embroiled in an urgent investor lawsuit . The renowned New York-based law firm, Pomerantz LLP, has initiated a class-action suit, alleging that the company misled investors regarding the profitability and inherent risks of its aggressive Bitcoin strategy . This legal challenge could have profound implications for MicroStrategy and serve as a crucial reminder for all investors in the volatile digital asset space. What’s Behind the MicroStrategy Investor Lawsuit ? The lawsuit, filed in Virginia by Pomerantz LLP, casts a spotlight on MicroStrategy’s public statements and disclosures concerning its substantial Bitcoin holdings. The core of the complaint revolves around accusations that MicroStrategy provided investors with a skewed perception of its Bitcoin strategy’s profitability while simultaneously downplaying the significant risks associated with such a concentrated bet on a highly volatile asset. This isn’t just about market fluctuations; it’s about the transparency and accuracy of information provided to those who entrusted their capital to the company. The legal action specifically targets investors who acquired MicroStrategy securities between April 2024 and April 2025. This timeframe is critical as it covers a period where Bitcoin experienced notable price swings, and new accounting rules began to shed more light on the financial impact of crypto holdings on corporate balance sheets. Understanding the Allegations: Misleading Bitcoin Strategy ? The plaintiffs allege that MicroStrategy’s communications regarding its Bitcoin strategy were deceptive. While MicroStrategy has long championed Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, the lawsuit suggests that the company failed to adequately convey the full extent of the risks involved. A key piece of evidence cited in the complaint is the staggering $5.9 billion in Q1 unrealized losses under new accounting rules. This figure, while not representing actual cash losses until assets are sold, highlights the significant paper losses incurred during a period of market downturns. For many, MicroStrategy became synonymous with institutional Bitcoin adoption. Its CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, often portraying it as a superior asset to traditional currencies. However, the lawsuit questions whether this enthusiasm translated into a sufficiently cautious and transparent representation of the strategy’s potential downsides to investors. The Role of Pomerantz LLP in Investor Protection Pomerantz LLP is a well-established name in the realm of class-action litigation, particularly known for representing investors in securities fraud cases. Their involvement signals a serious legal challenge for MicroStrategy. Law firms like Pomerantz play a vital role in holding companies accountable for their representations to the public, ensuring that investors have access to accurate and complete information when making investment decisions. The firm’s decision to pursue this class-action lawsuit indicates that they believe there is a strong basis to argue that MicroStrategy’s actions caused financial harm to its investors. This legal avenue allows a large group of individuals who may have suffered similar losses due to alleged misconduct to collectively seek redress. Navigating Unrealized Losses : A Deeper Dive The mention of $5.9 billion in Q1 unrealized losses is a critical component of the lawsuit. It’s important to understand what this means: Unrealized vs. Realized Losses: An unrealized loss occurs when an asset’s market value drops below its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. A realized loss occurs only after the asset is sold at a loss. New Accounting Rules: Recent accounting rule changes (like FASB’s ASC 825) require companies to report crypto assets at fair value, leading to more transparent, albeit volatile, reporting of gains and losses on their balance sheets. This means fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price are now more directly reflected in a company’s financial statements, even if the assets haven’t been sold. Impact on Investors: While unrealized losses don’t immediately affect cash flow, they can significantly impact a company’s reported earnings and net worth, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock price. The lawsuit argues that investors were not adequately prepared for or informed about the potential scale of such fluctuations. What This Class-Action Lawsuit Means for Investors and the Market This class-action lawsuit is more than just a legal battle; it’s a test case for how publicly traded companies manage and communicate their exposure to volatile digital assets. For MicroStrategy, a negative outcome could lead to substantial financial penalties and reputational damage. For the broader cryptocurrency market, it underscores the need for clear disclosure and responsible corporate governance when integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. For Affected Investors: If you invested in MicroStrategy securities between April 2024 and April 2025 and believe you were harmed by misleading information, Pomerantz LLP has set a deadline of July 15 for investors to join the case. This offers an opportunity for individuals to potentially recover losses through collective legal action. This lawsuit highlights the inherent risks in the crypto space and the importance of due diligence for investors. While the allure of high returns is strong, understanding the full spectrum of potential downsides and relying on transparent corporate communications is paramount. A Compelling Summary The class-action lawsuit filed by Pomerantz LLP against MicroStrategy represents a significant challenge to the company’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Allegations of misleading investors and downplaying risks, particularly in light of substantial unrealized losses, underscore the complexities and potential pitfalls of corporate exposure to volatile digital assets. As the legal proceedings unfold, the outcome will not only impact MicroStrategy but also set a precedent for transparency and accountability in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments. Investors are urged to stay informed and understand their rights in this developing situation.

2025-07-03T18:00:35,"Is An XRP ETF Next After The Solana ETF Launch? Experts Answer","REX-Osprey’s Solana ETF launched on July 2, with SOL now the third crypto asset to have a spot ETF in the US after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have now suggested that an XRP ETF could be the next to launch. XRP ETF Next As Solana ETF Goes Live In an X post , Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggested that an XRP ETF may be next following the launch of a Solana ETF. This is based on Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas’ prediction that the XRP fund has a 95% chance of approval this year. They had also predicted that a SOL ETF had a 95% chance of approval and that this fund has now launched. Although not through the conventional structure, REX-Osprey launched the first Solana staking ETF on July 2. This is simply a spot SOL ETF, which will also provide staking rewards to investors. Additionally, the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which also had a 95% approval odds, has also been approved by the SEC, which puts the XRP ETF in pole position to be next. Following the approval order for the conversion of Grayscale’s fund into an ETF, market expert Nate Geraci declared that a spot XRP ETF is up next for the SEC’s approval. He predicts that other altcoin ETFs for Cardano and Litecoin will also get the nod from the commission. However, based on Seyffart and Balchunas’ prediction, a Litecoin ETF is the only one that could come before an XRP ETF. The approval odds for a Litecoin ETF also stand at 95%. Furthermore, the final SEC deadline for the LTC ETF is October 2, just days ahead of the XRP ETF’s final deadline, which is October 17. Traders Expect XRP ETF Next Polymarket data shows that traders are expecting an XRP ETF before a Litecoin ETF or any other altcoin ETF. Data from the prediction market shows that there is an 87% chance that the XRP fund gets approved by December 31. On the other hand, there is an 86% chance the SEC will approve an LTC ETF by year-end. Other altcoin ETFs have lower odds of approval by year-end. Seyyfart and Balchunas predicted that there is a 90% chance that Cardano, Dogecoin, Hedera, Avalanche, and Polkadot ETFs get approved this year. Polymarket traders say that there is an 83% and 76% that the Commission approves an ADA and DOGE ETF , respectively. Meanwhile, Ripple’s decision to drop the cross-appeal against the SEC and potentially end the XRP lawsuit is another reason why experts like Geraci are confident that an XRP ETF will come soon. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.26, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-next-after-solana-etf/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|ADA|Altcoin ETFs|avalanche|Cardano|Coinmarketcap|Digital Large Cap Fund|dogecoin|Grayscale|Hedera|James Seyffart|Litecoin ETFs|Nate Geraci|Polkadot|Polymarket|REX-Osprey|ripple|solana|Solana ETFs|US SEC|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T17:59:51,"Top 8 Crypto Sportsbooks to Bet Any Sports Worldwide","If you want to bet any sports — no matter where you live or what you follow — you need a sportsbook that actually gives you full access. Some sites cut off markets based on location, licensing, or payment method. Others quietly block things like esports, smaller leagues, or prop bets without any notice. You may be able to deposit, but once you’re in, the limits start to show. That’s where crypto-based sportsbooks change the game. These platforms are built to give players global access, flexible betting markets, and full control over how — and where — they play. Whether you’re into UFC undercards, regional football leagues, or niche simulations, being able to bet any sports means choosing a site that won’t restrict you once the bet slip opens. How to Spot a Sportsbook That Lets You Bet Any Sports Not every site that looks big on the surface actually gives you full access under the hood. Some sportsbooks quietly limit what events you can see, which leagues you’re allowed to bet on, or even what your deposit method allows you to do. Here’s how to know a sportsbook truly lets you bet any sports — without restrictions or fine print that gets in the way. They List Every Sport — Not Just the Popular Ones Real full-access sportsbooks go beyond football, basketball, and tennis. You’ll see markets for esports, fight nights, amateur leagues, and even simulations. If the sports menu is slim, your betting options will be too. The Cashier Supports Crypto A crypto-supported cashier is usually a strong sign of fewer restrictions. Coins like BTC, ETH, and USDT don’t rely on banks or regional payment rails, which means the site is probably built to serve a global player base — without filtering based on location. No Geoblocking or IP Filters in the Sportsbook Some platforms allow registration but limit what you can bet on once your IP is detected. A sportsbook that truly lets you bet any sports won’t change your access based on where you log in from. Props and Live Bets Are Available If a book disables live odds, player props, or alternate spreads, it’s a sign that the platform might be restricted by regulation or internal limits. Full-access sites keep these markets active at all times, for all users. Bonuses Don’t Exclude Sports Check the terms on any promotion. If it says “only valid on football” or excludes esports and live bets, that’s a sign the sportsbook is shaping what you’re allowed to bet on. Real full-access platforms don’t force you into narrow promo rules. Why Crypto Makes It Easier to Bet Any Sports One of the biggest reasons offshore sportsbooks can offer full access is simple: crypto. Using digital currencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum, and USDT removes the barriers that traditional payment systems often create. No banks, no card networks, and no national blocks on who can deposit or where funds can be sent. With crypto, sportsbooks don’t have to filter users by country or restrict betting menus to comply with banking policies. That opens the door to more sports, more leagues, and more flexibility. You’re not limited by what your payment method allows or what your region restricts — you just deposit, play, and cash out. Most crypto-first platforms are also built to be globally accessible. They accept VPNs, don’t require local IDs, and rarely limit your sportsbook view based on IP. That means you can bet any sports, from anywhere, without worrying about being quietly filtered out of certain matches or markets. If you’re looking for true market access — esports, niche leagues, in-play props, and everything in between — crypto isn’t just an option, it’s the key. Best Sportsbooks to Bet Any Sports Without Limits These sportsbooks were tested for real market access, crypto payouts, and betting flexibility. Each one lets you place wagers on major leagues, lesser-known events, esports, simulations, and more — without blocking bets based on your location or payment method.

Tips for Finding Sportsbooks That Don’t Block Markets It’s easy for a sportsbook to look global on the surface but quietly restrict what you can actually bet on. Whether it’s limited league access, country-specific blocks, or payout rules tied to your deposit method, some platforms aren’t as open as they claim. Here’s how to spot the difference before you sign up. Watch for Missing Markets If a sportsbook only shows major leagues — like the Premier League, NFL, or NBA — and skips esports, smaller tournaments, or live props, that’s usually a bad sign. A truly open platform will show you full coverage without filters based on location or popularity. Check the Fine Print Terms and conditions usually reveal more than the homepage. Look for anything that says “not available in your country” or “restricted markets.” Bonus rules can also expose limits — if a promotion is only valid on select sports, that may reflect wider platform restrictions. Use a VPN to Test Visibility Before you create an account, open the site using a VPN and browse the sportsbook. If the menu changes depending on where you’re logging in from, odds are it’s geo-restricted. A platform that lets you bet any sports won’t adjust based on your IP. Use Crypto to Skip Regional Filters Many restrictions are tied to fiat payment systems. Signing up and depositing with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another coin can often give you access that wouldn’t be available with traditional banking. Crypto sportsbooks are typically more open by design. Avoid Platforms That Hide Market Details If a sportsbook forces you to create an account just to see available markets — or doesn’t show full sports lists up front — it might be masking limited access. Reputable platforms are transparent about what’s available to all users. Conclusion If your goal is to bet any sports — across leagues, formats, and borders — you need more than a standard sportsbook. You need one that stays open: open to all users, all markets, and all types of bets. That means no geo-blocking, no filtered menus, and no fine print that gets in the way. The platforms in this list offer exactly that. They support crypto, give access to global events, and keep the full sportsbook available — regardless of where you’re logging in from. Whether you’re placing a live bet on a UFC undercard or backing an underdog in a regional league, they give you the access you need. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What does it mean to “bet any sports”? It means having access to all types of sports betting — major leagues, niche events, esports, simulations, props, and live markets — without regional or account-based restrictions. 2. Can I bet any sports using Bitcoin or Ethereum? Yes. Crypto sportsbooks are often the best way to bet any sports because they don’t rely on regional banking systems or block users based on location. 3. What are the best platforms to bet any sports? Offshore sportsbooks that accept crypto and skip geo-blocking give you the most access. Viking Luck, WSM Casino, and RakeBit are strong examples. 4. Do sportsbooks limit which sports I can bet on? Many do — especially those licensed in strict jurisdictions. To bet any sports freely, use offshore platforms that aren’t tied to national restrictions. 5. Are there restrictions on live betting? Some sites limit in-play betting or props based on your region. The best sportsbooks to bet any sports keep live markets open for all players. 6. Can I use a VPN to bet any sports? Most offshore sportsbooks allow VPN use and don’t limit market access based on your IP address. This helps you see and bet any sports without filters. 7. How do I know if a site offers full market access? Check the list of available sports before creating an account. If you see esports, minor leagues, and full prop options, you’re likely able to bet any sports. 8. Do bonus terms limit what I can bet on? Sometimes. If a bonus excludes esports, live bets, or specific leagues, it can restrict how you bet. Always read the terms if you want full freedom to bet any sports. 9. What’s the advantage of using crypto to bet any sports? Crypto avoids banking restrictions, enables faster payouts, and removes regional limits — making it the easiest way to access global sportsbooks. 10. Is it legal to bet any sports on offshore platforms? That depends on your location. The sportsbooks themselves are licensed offshore and legal to operate.

2025-07-03T17:54:27,"Institutional Inflows Quietly Building in BTC: Metrics Suggest Breakout Risk","In the shadows of subdued retail interest and choppy price action, a silent force is gathering momentum in Bitcoin's corner. Institutional inflows are quietly but steadily building beneath the surface. While traditional on-chain metrics may fail to capture the full extent of this movement, multiple signs suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) may be gearing up for a breakout. This analysis, provided by Outset PR , a crypto-focused communications firm, takes a closer look at the disconnect between on-chain stagnation and off-chain accumulation. Like the firm’s approach to data-led PR strategy, the story unfolding in Bitcoin is one of latent buildup, not headline-making moves—at least, not yet. ETF Inflows Speak Louder Than Charts The most compelling evidence of institutional appetite comes not from blockchain data, but from regulated investment vehicles. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively drawn in nearly $4 billion in June 2025 alone, underscoring growing demand from asset managers, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Among them, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a behemoth, managing over $75 billion in BTC holdings, and frequently ranking in the top 10 most traded ETFs. Source: blackrock This surge in the ETF is a structural shift in how institutions access Bitcoin: through compliant, familiar channels that allow deep-pocketed investors to gain exposure without custody risk. And because ETF flows happen off-chain, they don’t leave a trail in traditional blockchain metrics like exchange balances or whale movements. Corporate Treasuries Quietly Stack Sats Corporations aren’t staying on the sidelines either. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues its relentless BTC accumulation, purchasing 4,980 BTC worth over $531 million in late June. This brings its total to an eye-watering 597,325 BTC, cementing its role as a strategic vault for the digital asset. Across the Atlantic, a quiet trend is unfolding in London: small- to mid-cap companies are turning to Bitcoin to revive investor interest. At least nine UK-listed firms have recently disclosed BTC holdings or plans to acquire the asset, echoing MicroStrategy’s playbook for shareholder value creation. Off-Chain Activity Skews On-Chain Readings While blockchain data shows modest exchange outflows and flat miner sales, the real story lies off-chain. Institutional buyers favor over-the-counter (OTC) desks and ETF vehicles, both of which obscure their footprints. As a result, analysts relying solely on on-chain metrics may miss the quiet accumulation underway. This divergence between visible metrics and institutional activity suggests a structural inefficiency in how crypto markets are currently interpreted. It also hints at latent demand pressure—the kind that doesn’t move prices immediately, but builds a coiled-spring setup. BTC Technical Setup Points to a Breakout Risk Bitcoin is currently trading around $107,700, consolidating in a tight band between $104,000 and $110,000. But beneath this calm lies a setup loaded with breakout potential. Source: tradingview According to technical analysts, clearing the $114,000 resistance level could unleash a rally of up to 25%, pushing BTC into the $140,000+ territory. Key resistance awaits at $114,000, and the next challenge will be surpassing the $123,000 mark. Support is solid just above $95,000. This setup hints at a possible upward movement. The 10-day and 100-day averages are aligned, suggesting steadiness. The RSI at 41 indicates it's not overbought, leaving room to climb. Overall, Bitcoin's path seems cautiously optimistic with room to test higher boundaries.

For crypto, blockchain, or AI enterprises that need clarity and velocity—this is what PR should feel like. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent price action may appear muted on the surface, but a powerful narrative is quietly unfolding. Institutional capital is flowing in—stealthily, steadily, and structurally. It’s not being broadcast on-chain or hyped in headlines, but it’s there in the numbers: ETF flows, corporate balance sheets, and growing regulatory clarity. With supply thinning and macro conditions tilting in favor of risk-on bets, the stage is set. The breakout may not come with fanfare, but when it does, those watching the metrics behind the curtain won’t be surprised. Outset PR, with its proprietary content analytics and performance media selection, understands how unseen trends become tomorrow’s headlines.

2025-07-03T17:48:10,"Why Is The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF Lagging Peers?","Summary The Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF has lagged peers in AUM growth and even has negative year-to-date BTC supply held through the fund. iShares dominates US Bitcoin ETF flows, capturing the vast majority of new investment and leaving little market share for smaller funds like BTCO. BTCO's 0.25% expense ratio is less competitive versus some peers, and its higher post-waiver fee at launch likely deterred long-term investors. Despite its small size, BTCO functions effectively as a Bitcoin ETF proxy, but cheaper and more established alternatives remain more attractive for most investors. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) getting increasingly gobbled up by the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) and Bitcoin Treasury companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) ( STRF ), not every US-listed Bitcoin ETF has benefited from the same types of inflows as the market leader. In this article, we'll look at the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ) relative to peers. 12-Month Holdings Trend, BTCO (TheBlock) The fund's BTC holdings have fallen year-to-date, while the broader US-based Bitcoin ETF segment has seen year-to-date inflows of over 21% measured in BTC. Is there a reason why the fund has lagged the rest of the market in AUM growth over the last 6 months? I think yes. Bitcoin Capital Flows and Provider AUM As of June 27th, the capital flow story for Bitcoin continues to be incredibly impressive in 2025. As of article submission, the digital asset sector is working on 11 consecutive weeks of positive net flows into investment products. Bitcoin's month to date investment product net flow as of June 27th was $4.6 billion. Year-to-date net flow came in at nearly $15 million through the first half of 2025: Asset (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $4,604 $14,925 $159,399 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) $1,432 $2,859 $14,614 Multi-asset -$17.3 $58 $6,814 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $8.3 $91 $1,328 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $21.2 $219 $1,184 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 BTC Dominance 76.0% 84.0% 86.4% Bitcoin is clearly benefiting from demand through capital flows, with 76% of digital asset net flow month to date and 84% share year-to-date. These are impressive numbers. It isn't just a Bitcoin story though, this is very much a BlackRock ( BLK ) story as well. When we break down the capital flows by provider, it's quite clear there is a dominant product provider in the market. The iShares funds account for 77% of the month to date flows and a staggering 96% of digital asset investment demand year-to-date. Provider (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM iShares $4,651 $17,053 $78,605 Grayscale $74 -$1,652 $29,892 Fidelity $355 $249 $21,516 ARK 21 Shrs $97 $75 $5,018 Bitwise $227 -$59 $4,511 ProShares $90 $526 $4,101 21Shares AG $18 -$200 $3,750 CoinShares XBT -$57 -$269 $3,446 Other $605 $2,055 $33,575 Total $6,059 $17,776 $184,414 Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of June 27th, 2025 Invesco's share of the digital asset investment space is so small that CoinShares doesn't even break it out in the company's digital asset fund flow reports. When we assess BTC AUM as a percent of total issuer AUM, Invesco's Bitcoin holdings are a rounding error while iShares has 1% of total AUM in Bitcoin: Billions (as of Q1-25) Total AUM Bitcoin ETF BTC % Invesco $1,845 $0.44 0.02% iShares $4,303 $46.60 1.08% Sources: Invesco, YCharts This kind of dominance is hard to overcome if you're a competitor like Invesco, and it begs the obvious question; why? BTCO Fund Details Like the other spot Bitcoin ETFs listed in the United States, BTCO launched in mid-January 2024. For the sake of comparison, the table below shows fund details for the following Bitcoin ETFs: WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ). Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ). CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ). Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ). VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ). What each of these funds have in common is that they are the bottom 6 US-listed Bitcoin ETFs in the market in terms of assets under management: Fund Details BTCO BTCW EZBC BRRR BITB HODL Issuer Invesco WisdomTree Franklin Templeton Investments Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC Bitwise Investments VanEck Expense Ratio 0.25% 0.25% 0.19% 0.00% 0.20% 0.00% AUM $569.35M $169.44M $564.43M $641.00M $4.30B $1.72B Source: Seeking Alpha For me, the biggest standout difference between these funds is the expense ratios. At 0.25%, BTCO is on the expensive side relative to the selected funds above. But by itself, that doesn't necessarily explain the lack of interest in BTCO. For instance, BITB appears to be a significant outlier in this table. At a 0.20% expense ratio, that fund is closer to BTCO than a fund like BRRR yet has the largest AUM in our sample by far. In my view, there are two key reasons for this. First, Bitwise Investments is a crypto-native asset manager. This is not an issuer that touches traditional index ETFs and even has a digital asset fund that offers exposure to tokens like Solana ( SOL-USD ) and Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Thus, I think Bitwise has benefited from crypto trustworthiness to a larger degree than each of the other issuers shows. Also, BITB uses part of its management fee to fund Bitcoin development. The other issuer that has committed to such an action is VanEck - so it's likely not surprising to see each of these two funds with the two largest AUMs of the bottom 6 funds. Still, this doesn't explain why BTCO has performed so badly against a fund like IBIT. I suspect the original roll-out of these funds has been a factor. Consider this screenshot from my Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) from January 2024 : Original expense ratios (Seeking Alpha/IntoTheBlock) Back in January 2024, when these funds originally launched, BTCO would have had one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market at 0.39%. Even though there was a 0.00% waiver on the first $1 billion in AUM or for 6 months, investors looking for long-term solutions likely balked at BTCO due to the fee after waiver. BRRR also had a high post-waiver fee and has a very similar AUM to that of BTCO today. Fund Performance Ultimately, what likely matters most for potential BTCO investors is how the fund actually performs compared to the products in the market. So far, there is virtually no difference between these funds based on total return over the last year: Data by YCharts We can see the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) is the obvious laggard of the bunch above. That is entirely due to the fund's egregious 1.5% expense ratio. But short of choosing to minimize third-party custodian risk to Coinbase ( COIN ) through FBTC, there is very little difference between these products. Closing Thoughts For investors looking for a simple way to get Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper, BTCO will work perfectly fine. Is it the cheapest fund? No. Is it the biggest by AUM? No. In fact, it's one of the smallest by AUM, and that is likely due to some combination of the fund's current 0.25% expense ratio relative to slightly cheaper alternatives today and the fact that the product launched with one of the higher post-waiver fees in the market. The lack of early adoption is perhaps haunting AUM growth today. But, again, purely as a Bitcoin proxy, it'll likely work just as well as the other funds that rely on Coinbase for custody.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799171-why-invesco-galaxy-bitcoin-etf-lagging-peers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL","BTCO",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T17:46:51,"Top Cryptocurrencies for Decentralized Gambling (BTC, Stablecoins, and More)","The rise of decentralized gambling has redefined how players engage with online sportsbooks and casinos. No more lengthy KYC procedures, delayed withdrawals, or centralized control. Thanks to blockchain technology, bettors now have the freedom to wager anonymously, instantly, and across multiple chains. But with so many cryptocurrencies available, which ones are best suited for the world of decentralized gambling? From the battle-tested Bitcoin to lightning-fast altcoins, here are the top crypto picks fueling the next generation of trustless betting. 1. Bitcoin (BTC): The OG That Still Dominates Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto betting. Despite its relatively slower transaction times and higher fees compared to newer chains, BTC is universally accepted across virtually every decentralized and centralized gambling platform. Its primary appeal is security and liquidity. For high-stakes players and whales, Bitcoin offers unmatched trust, deep market depth, and ease of conversion. It also continues to expand in Web3-native casinos that support fast deposits and withdrawals via Layer 2 integrations or wrapped BTC tokens. 2. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) For Predictable Play Stablecoins are rapidly becoming the preferred choice for everyday bettors. USDT (Tether) leads the pack thanks to its wide availability and robust liquidity, followed closely by USDC. With their value pegged to the US dollar rate, these tokens offer price stability which makes them ideal for players who don’t want market swings affecting their betting capital. Most decentralized casinos and sportsbooks including Dexsport now accept stablecoins across multiple chains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Tron, Polygon, etc.), enabling frictionless betting with near-zero volatility. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Powering Smart Bets Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized applications—including many of today’s most innovative gambling platforms. From on-chain sportsbooks to provably fair dice games, ETH is the fuel that powers trustless betting. With smart contracts at its core, Ethereum enables features like automated payouts, fair game logic, and transparent results. Though it can suffer from network congestion and gas fees, Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base) are rapidly improving transaction speed and affordability. 4. Tron (TRX): Fast, Cheap, and Gaining Ground Tron has quietly become a powerhouse in the crypto gambling space. Known for its ultra-low fees and high throughput, TRX is widely used in decentralized casino games and lottery-style applications. Its ecosystem supports a wide array of dApps and betting platforms, particularly in markets where low-cost transactions are essential. Tron’s native support for stablecoins like USDT also makes it a strong contender for cost-effective play. 5. BNB (Binance Coin): A Utility Giant with Casino Reach Binance’s BNB token has moved far beyond its exchange origins. Today, BNB powers one of the most active smart contract networks (BNB Chain), and countless decentralized casinos and betting platforms are built on it. BNB is often used for fast, low-fee wagers and in-house rewards on Web3 gambling platforms. Its compatibility with BEP-20 stablecoins also adds to its versatility, making it a favorite among cost-conscious bettors. Bonus: Dexsport – A True Home for Multi-Chain Bettors Looking to use these coins on a platform built for decentralized betting? Dexsport offers one of the best Web3 sportsbooks and casinos in 2025.

Federal Reserve interest rate cuts might come later than expected, but Wall Street is still optimistic. On Thursday, June 3, the Dow Jones closed higher by 344 points, or 0.77%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.83% in a a shortened session ahead of Friday’s market close.

Strong labor market boosts the economy Traders were focusing on the June jobs report, which showed that the labor market remained more resilient than expected. The data revealed a 147,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, beating the forecast of 106,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, even as economists expected it to rise to 4.3%. A strong labor market has shown that the anticipated tariff-related damage to the economy has not materialized. Despite the potential disruptive effects of U.S. punitive tariffs on its trading partners, employers mostly stayed the course. Notably, businesses managed to avoid layoffs, hoping that the tariffs would be temporary. High employment likely means that the Federal Reserve won’t be under as much pressure to lower interest rates, even if inflation decreases. This is usually bad news for growth stocks, which tend to thrive in a low-interest rate environment. Still, the prospect of a robust economy and stronger-than-expected economic growth was enough to boost sentiment.

2025-07-03T17:43:52,"Are Stablecoins Taking Crypto Mainstream?","For years, cryptocurrencies have been circling the fringes of global finance. Yes, they’re fast and decentralised, but their inherent volatility has kept them just outside the mainstream. These days, though, something is changing. You’ve probably noticed it yourself. Crypto is no longer a niche financial sector populated by traders and maximalists; it’s cropping up in day-to-day payments, entertainment, business infrastructure and more. So why is this change occurring? One word: stablecoins. Far from being flashy tokens that ride the bear and bull markets, these coins do exactly what they say they do. Namely, their value doesn’t budge. Stablecoins Explained (And Why They Matter) So, what are stablecoins? Put simply, they’re digital currencies pegged to a “stable” real-world asset, usually fiat currencies like the US dollar. Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI) are among the most widely used . While Bitcoin and Ethereum can rise or fall by 10% in an afternoon, stablecoins are engineered to hold their value steady. This stability comes from collateralization. A stablecoin is either backed by cash, short-term government debt, or crypto overcollateralization. You can think of them as the monetary equivalent of a ballast, used to anchor a ship that might otherwise capsize on rough seas. Why has this had such a transformative effect? Because stability is exactly what’s required to push crypto from speculative asset to everyday utility. Supporting Digital Entertainment In the UK, digital payments are already second nature. Contactless cards, Apple Pay, bank-to-bank transfers via Faster Payments — most consumers expect speed and ease. But crypto? It’s still a bit clunky. Convert to fiat, send to your bank, pay the fees, wait. This is where stablecoins are slotting in. They behave like cash in your crypto wallet, without the volatility or the need to off-ramp into sterling before spending. This shift is already visible in several digital-first sectors, with online casino gaming serving as a prime example. Traditionally, digital casinos were playable only with bankwire or bank card options, which meant gamers would have to wait up to five working days before seeing their winnings hit their accounts. Then, forward-thinking brands expanded their accepted payments to include digital wallets and pre-payment cards. Wildz Casino , for instance, offers fiat options like VISA, Skrill Neteller and several location-specific methods to properly cater to its users. In the years since, crypto casinos and gambling platforms have emerged, but until stablecoins came along, they lacked a degree of legitimacy — irrespective of the gaming authority awarding their operational licenses. Stablecoins provide a happy medium: allowing players to deposit in digital currency without being exposed to price swings. A user can deposit £100 worth of USDC and tomorrow it will still be worth £100. That’s the kind of dependability that operators and regulators alike can get behind. It simplifies accounting, aids legislative checks and removes the ambiguity that surrounds crypto price volatility. Revolutionising Payroll and Cross-Border Payments Stablecoins aren’t just turning up in gaming wallets. They’re quietly transforming another cornerstone of financial life: wages. Freelancers, remote workers and gig economy contractors in the UK and beyond are increasingly being paid in stablecoins. Why? Because it’s quicker, cheaper and often more reliable than conventional banking, especially for cross-border jobs. Companies like Bitwage, Noah and Circle allow businesses to pay staff in USDC or other stablecoins, bypassing the delays and fees associated with international bank transfers. Circle has already bridged transactions worth over $850 billion (around £627 billion) between fiat currencies and supported blockchains since 2018. For British freelancers dealing with clients abroad, these innovations can be transformative. No waiting three to five working days. No intermediary banks taking a slice. Just digital, dollar-pegged money, directly in your wallet — and ready to convert to pounds when needed. What This Means for Crypto Enthusiasts If you’ve been in the crypto space for a while, you’ll be familiar with the discourse: are stablecoins just fiat currencies dressed up in a digital asset costume? The truth is, stablecoins aren’t presenting as a replacement for fully decentralised assets like BTC or ETH. Rather, they offer a workable compromise, a way for crypto to function in the real world, without need to sacrifice its core mechanics. For UK investors and enthusiasts , there’s real opportunity here — you can swap, save, send or spend digital assets with stability.

2025-07-03T17:37:03,"🔥As Bitcoin Consolidates, MAGACOIN FINANCE Enters Chapter 1 Stage 3 — And Buyers Are Lining Up","Bitcoin continues to trade in a narrow band, drawing in both long-term holders and institutional capital. But while BTC flirts with resistance, a new opportunity has emerged: MAGACOIN FINANCE — a high-upside presale that’s already racing through its opening chapter. Chapter 1: Two Stages Gone, Stage 3 Goes Live MAGACOIN FINANCE launched quietly — but it didn’t stay under the radar for long. Chapter 1, Stage 1? Sold out. Stage 2? Gone. And now, with Stage 3 officially live , presale demand is heating up as early investors anticipate the next price shift. The structure is simple but powerful: early chapters, limited supply, and a rising price curve that rewards those who move early — a sharp contrast to Bitcoin’s current phase of high liquidity and slower returns. Bitcoin’s Institutional Inflows vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Retail Upside Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in billions. That’s good for long-term adoption — but the chance to multiply capital in early stages? That window is much tighter. MAGACOIN FINANCE is filling that gap. With its narrative-driven appeal , politically themed positioning, and fast-paced stage progression, it’s attracting Bitcoin holders looking to diversify into high-growth altcoin bets while prices are still under the radar. Retail Momentum Building Around a Political Meme Narrative From Solana to Ethereum to XRP, every bull run has its breakout story. MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself to be the story of 2025 , combining memecoin energy with a sharply themed narrative and a clear roadmap of price progression. Bitcoin’s next breakout may come. But those who act early in Chapter 1 of MAGACOIN FINANCE could be looking at one of the last true low-entry windows of the cycle.

2025-07-03T17:36:10,"Ripple price analysis: XRP eyes $2.42 if volume confirms breakout","Ripple continues to show technical strength, holding above key moving averages and support levels. A move above $2.42 could complete a market rotation, if volume confirms the upside push. Ripple ( XRP ) has maintained notable strength in recent price action, even as broader market conditions remain uncertain. The coin is currently trading above major support and has been respecting the 200-day moving average, a key indicator of trend continuation. The presence of confluence with high-value support zones suggests the asset may be poised for another leg upward, provided volume confirms the move. Key technical points Major Support at $2.09: I n confluence with the 200-day moving average and the value area low. Next Resistance at $2.42: Point of Control level acting as resistance within the current volume range. Low Volume Environment: Suggests accumulation phase; breakout requires increased volume for confirmation. XRPUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP has recently respected the $2.09 support level, a region of significance due to its alignment with both the value area low and the 200-day moving average. Holding above this level signals continued bullish structure, especially as price trends upward. Historically, the 200 MA serves as reliable dynamic support, and as long as XRP stays above it, the probability of further upside remains strong. The next logical price target lies at the $2.42 region, which marks the Point of Control within the current high time frame volume profile. A successful move toward this level would represent a full volume profile rotation, consistent with market auction theory. This theory suggests that once price bounces from the value area low and gains strength, a move toward the value area high and POC is likely, provided there’s volume expansion to support it. You might also like: Stablecoins supply crossed $250b on investor optimism: Binance report One key factor to monitor is the current lack of trading volume. While this may seem bearish at first glance, it more likely signals a phase of quiet accumulation at support. A strong rally will need to be supported by a notable influx of volume to confirm bullish conviction and signal the transition from accumulation to expansion. Until the 200-day MA or the $2.09 support is breached, the bullish structure remains intact. Traders should continue to monitor the strength of the trend and be alert for any surge in volume that could initiate the next move higher. What to expect in the coming price action If XRP holds above $2.09 and volume begins to increase, a rotation toward the $2.42 resistance becomes highly probable. Breaching this resistance would mark the beginning of a potential trend acceleration.
