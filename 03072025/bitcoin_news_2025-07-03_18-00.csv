2025-07-03T15:46:39,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Bitcoin Price Rebounds After Jobs Data Dip","Market reactions to US government economic reports have always been powerful catalysts for price movements, particularly within the crypto space. From inflation numbers to jobs data, even the most subtle deviation from expectation can send assets into sharp swings. In many cases, these shifts are not immediate. This is why the latest unemployment report was closely watched. Most assumed a negative outcome would trigger a sharp correction, or at the very least a fresh bout of volatility. And yet, even as the report landed with surprising strength, Bitcoin did the unexpected again and dumped. However, its rebound, swift and clean, has now become the centerpiece of speculation as the next leg of upward momentum begins to take shape. Bitcoin Rebounds Strong Despite Surprising Jobs Data June’s employment data turned out to be a major upside surprise. The US added 147,000 jobs , decisively beating the analyst forecast of just 106,000. The unemployment rate also dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, in direct contrast to the anticipated rise to 4.3%. For traditional markets, this would typically signal economic strength. For crypto, however, such clarity often brings chaos. JUST IN: The US 🇺🇸 unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in June 2025 from 4.2% in May, against market expectations of 4.3%. The rate has stayed between 4.0% and 4.2% since May 2024, indicating labor market stability. #unemployment #economy pic.twitter.com/OTHIiIZFoS — Crypto Dives (@MakroDives) July 3, 2025 The moment the figures were published, Bitcoin’s price took a sharp dip. It had been hovering around the $110,000 level before swiftly dropping below $108,900 in what many described as a flash dump. That alone caught retail traders off guard, who had expected the report to bring caution but not immediate selling pressure. The irony is that better-than-expected news still triggered a selloff, reinforcing the unpredictable ways in which crypto reacts to macroeconomic indicators. Yet within minutes, the market reversed course. Buyer volume surged just as rapidly as the dump occurred, pushing Bitcoin right back to its earlier levels. This kind of V-shaped move is often interpreted as a sign of underlying confidence. Some see it as a possible instance of strategic accumulation, where institutions or large players take advantage of momentary retail weakness to secure stronger positions. Regardless of the motive, the rebound above $110,000 has now strengthened the view that Bitcoin remains resilient. This also suggests that support zones are tightening, and with labor market indicators showing consistency, the wider market might interpret this as a green light for continued bullishness. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Projects That May Trend As Investors’ Attention Increases SUBBD With the US unemployment rate dropping unexpectedly, the narrative of job creation and opportunity has taken center stage again. And while most eyes are still on traditional sectors, SUBBD has quietly been building a creator-centric economic layer that may well play a part in the next wave of decentralized employment. SUBBD is not simply a content hosting platform. It is a creator-owned infrastructure designed to ensure that revenue flows back into the hands of those producing the content rather than intermediaries. This changes how influence, information, and income move in digital ecosystems. For creators, this means more than just a place to publish. It offers a financial model where subscriptions, tips, premium content, and micro-communities operate without centralized platforms skimming off the majority. That opens the door to sustainable, independent income at scale. As macroeconomic indicators show a strengthening labor market, projects like SUBBD sit well with this new direction. It turns digital visibility into capital, and it does so on-chain. The user base is evolving from speculative early adopters to real professionals who view blockchain as a tool rather than a trend. It has already been endorsed by top creators like ClayBro and others, adding to its popularity and trust factor. In a market like this, where investor attention is leaning towards tangible utility and user-driven models, SUBBD is positioned at a very strong intersection. If Bitcoin’s rebound is a signal of the next bullish leg, then the creator economy’s expansion may follow suit, and SUBBD could very well be a key player leading that charge. Token 6900 The crypto market has always swung between seriousness and satire. Token 6900 leans hard into the latter, but make no mistake, its timing and structure suggest a deeper understanding of how narratives move this market. With Bitcoin rebounding cleanly from its post-report dip, many believe that the speculative phase may reignite. That creates the perfect backdrop for tokens like 6900, which do not rely on long whitepapers or roadmap jargon, but on raw energy, meme culture, and irony weaponized as community fuel. Token 6900 positions itself as a cultural capsule from the last memecoin cycle. It brings back everything that defined the earlier mania with chaotic graphics, bizarre tone, and absurd web design. And somehow, that chaotic energy is exactly what investors seem to be waiting for. Especially now, as prices begin to climb and fear turns into curiosity again. What makes Token 6900 stand out is its unapologetic approach. It is not trying to please everyone. It is here to cater to the same tribe that made previous degen tokens 100x in weeks. And unlike random meme coins with no storyline, Token 6900 is tapping into a very specific visual and narrative aesthetic that has already proven to work, particularly referencing its loose alignment with SPX 6900 and its deep-cut internet themes. If capital starts rotating back into the higher-risk pockets of crypto, Token 6900 may not just start the degen crypto movement again. It might help shape it. And that makes it worth watching closely. Snorter In the past few months, the demand for accessible trading tools inside messaging apps has quietly exploded. Snorter has emerged as one of the most focused plays on this trend. Built to function directly within Telegram, Snorter combines an AI-powered interface with multi-chain connectivity, allowing users to trade, track, and manage crypto activity without leaving the chat environment. The brilliance of Snorter is in how much it eliminates friction. Users no longer need to toggle between exchanges, wallets, and price trackers. With Snorter, everything happens inside the interface they already use every day. This has huge implications, especially as new investors return to the market following Bitcoin’s resilience. In moments of sharp movement, like the recent flash dip and rebound, fast reaction times become everything and Snorter turns Telegram into a trading terminal that can respond in seconds. More than just speed, it also offers customization. From sniping tools to AI price insights and portfolio monitoring, Snorter is built for users who want more control but less clutter. It bridges casual Telegram users with serious DeFi functions in a way that few projects have done effectively. As crypto gears up for a possible speculative wave, tools like Snorter will likely see more demand. The project does not just benefit from a bullish market — it enhances a trader’s ability to survive one. That positions it as both a product and a utility layer, and it makes Snorter increasingly difficult to ignore. Best Wallet Token As Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels and confidence begins returning to the broader market, investor behavior is shifting with it. The rush is no longer just about finding the next 10x token, but also about equipping oneself with the right tools to navigate whatever cycle comes next. Best Wallet Token stands out here because it does not simply ride on speculative hype. It is backed by infrastructure that is already useful, already adopted, and already ahead of what most wallets today offer. Best Wallet is a high-performance Web3 wallet that supports over 60 blockchains. That level of connectivity matters now more than ever. In a market where cross-chain activity is becoming standard, the ability to seamlessly move, manage, and interact with assets across multiple networks is no longer a premium feature. It is essential. Best Wallet delivers this with a UX that feels familiar but operates on far more advanced rails. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 But the token itself is where the utility deepens. Best Wallet Token is not just a governance piece. It is integrated into access, tiered features, staking incentives, and future rollouts of wallet-native applications. This gives it actual use across a growing product suite, not just abstract value. The project has raised upwards of $13 million already, and could soon be ready to launch in the coming weeks. With investor attention returning and market participants setting up for longer plays, wallets become central again. They are the access point. The control layer. And Best Wallet, with its expanding reach and real-world functionality, may be one of the few built to handle what’s coming next. Conclusion The current market sentiment, paved by Bitcoin’s resilience and reinforced by stronger economic indicators, has created a positive backdrop for high-potential crypto assets. Projects that offer a pathway to emerging user behavior, provide real utility, or tap into renewed investor energy are gaining traction fast. From infrastructure plays to cultural tokens and creator-driven ecosystems, the trend is clear; the market is rewarding relevance and readiness. As momentum builds and capital begins flowing with greater conviction, this may be a prime window to consider assets that are not only built for speculation, but also designed to thrive in the next stage of the cycle.

2025-07-03T15:45:23,"Tether signs MoU with Adecoagro to launch a bitcoin mining project","Tether Holdings Ltd., the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with South American agribusiness firm Adecoagro S.A. The agreement was disclosed in a press release on Tether’s website on Thursday. The two companies plan to collaborate on a Bitcoin mining pilot project in Brazil, merging renewable energy capabilities with Tether’s digital asset expertise. Adecoagro is a Nasdaq-listed company with major operations in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay that currently manages over 230 megawatts of electrical generation capacity sourced from renewables. Adecoagro to use Tether mining software According to the statement , the pilot project will be launched using Tether’s proprietary Mining OS, a mining site management software. Tether announced that the software will be open-sourced in the coming months. Adecoagro’s company policies on related-party transactions state that its Independent Committee has reviewed and approved the initiative. The company sees this mining project as more than a means of monetizing surplus electricity. It is seeking to diversify its balance sheet with digital assets like Bitcoin. “ We’re excited to explore innovative ways to maximize the value of our renewable energy assets ,” reckoned Mariano Bosch, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Adecoagro. Bosch explained that the partnership could allow the company to stabilize the pricing of energy it currently sells on the spot market while gaining upside exposure to Bitcoin. Speaking on the new MOU, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino talked about the synergy between Adecoagro’s agricultural energy infrastructure and Tether’s portfolio of mining operations. “ This project is another step in our growing commitment to renewable-powered bitcoin mining ,” said Ardoino. “ It highlights the potential to align agricultural energy production with cutting-edge digital infrastructure .” Adecoagro is in the sustainable food and energy production business, but has now promised to assess Bitcoin mining as an alternative source of demand for its existing power generation infrastructure. Using 230 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, a Bitcoin mining operation can deploy thousands of ASIC machines such as the Antminer S19 XP, consuming roughly 3,000 watts. At this scale, the operation could reach a hash rate of approximately 6.9 exahashes per second (EH/s), roughly 1.6% of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate, which currently stands near 430 EH/s. Given the current mining difficulty and an average block reward of 3.125 BTC post-halving, a setup could mine a full block approximately once every 2 to 3 days. If efficiently managed and powered by low-cost renewable energy, Adecoagro facilities would rank among the world’s largest industrial-scale mining operations. Ardoino believes the USDT parent company will become the biggest bitcoin miner by the end of 2025. Tether recently disclosed it holds more than 100,000 BTC, worth over $10 billion. Tether takes an extra step into Africa with Zanzibar partnership On July 1, Tether also announced a collaboration with the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, located off the coast of Tanzania. The company signed another MOU, this time with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority, to improve the financial inclusion and blockchain education on the islands. As part of the initiative, Tether plans to work alongside educational institutions in Zanzibar to incorporate blockchain and digital asset knowledge into school and university curricula. This could help citizens add to their knowledge about decentralized technologies and encourage the development of a local digital economy. Tether also intends to integrate its stablecoins, including the US dollar-pegged USDT and gold-backed XAUT, into ZanMalipo, Zanzibar’s government-controlled digital payments platform. Through ZanMalipo, local users can legally engage with digital currencies directly through an official channel. “This MOU with the Zanzibar eGovernment Authority reflects our commitment to advancing financial literacy and sustainable blockchain innovation in Africa,” Ardoino said. The Tether CEO added that by investing in educational initiatives and integrating digital assets into formal systems, the company is helping lay the foundation for a compliant and inclusive financial future.

2025-07-03T15:32:00,"Top Analyst Warns Bitcoin Risks Retracement To $40,000 As Highly Reliable Indicator Flashes Sell Signal","Independent crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautioned of a potential downside for Bitcoin after spotting a bearish signal from a reliable technical indicator. In a recent post on the X platform, Martinez told his followers that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator, which has predicted every major Bitcoin crash, had flashed again. The indicator, according to Martinez, was warning that a 63% reversal could be in the offing. “The Tom DeMark Sequential just gave a quarterly sell signal. This is a rare warning that has historically preceded brutal drawdowns,” the pundit stated. Martinez noted that the TD Sequential sent a sell signal in 2015, and a 75% Bitcoin drop ensued. In 2018, the same setup saw Bitcoin plummet by over 85%. The TD Sequential indicator is an oscillating trend-following chart overlay indicator that is used to identify short-term trend reversals based on changes in intraday highs and lows. In other words, the indicator sparks when an asset sees an overextended rally and is due for a brutal correction. In this case, the indicator predicts that the BTC price could see a frantic drop from the current level, dropping as much as 63%, to trade hands at around $40,000. Such a move would mark a huge drawdown as Bitcoin has been trading above the psychologically important $100K level for the most part in recent months. Today, BTC topped the $110,000 mark for the first time since June 11 after U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew in roughly $408 million on Wednesday — a sign of investors’ unwavering confidence. Since May 1, these BTC products have registered $9.91 billion in inflows, approximately 20% of their total inflows since launching in January 2024, data from Farside shows. The world’s largest and oldest crypto was valued at $110,295 as of publication time, a more than 2.4% gain since Wednesday.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/top-analyst-warns-bitcoin-risks-retracement-to-40000-as-highly-reliable-indicator-flashes-sell-signal/,"BTC|TRADING|SPONSORED|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

While BTC has rebounded strongly to key resistance levels, whale investors are sending a complex message with a rise in their realized profits and losses. A Major Internal Shift Brewing For Bitcoin Amidst recent price spikes, Kripto Mevsimi, an author and market expert, revealed a rare trend among Bitcoin whales or large-scale investors. “The final week of June revealed intense, mixed behavior from large Bitcoin holders,” the expert stated. Data from the expert shows that whales are locking in profits and realizing losses at the same time, at a rapid rate. The development is considered an unusual dual dynamic, indicating that a substantial internal recalibration is taking place. After examining the BTC Whale Realized Profit metric, Mevsimi highlighted that over $641 million in gains and over $1.24 billion in losses were realized by new whales . The on-chain expert has flagged the development as a rare combination that signals a major internal shift. Furthermore, it was observed that some late participants gave up, but others, possibly those who had accumulated earlier in the second quarter of this year, locked in profits. However, old whales made $91 million in profits, with very little loss realized. Mevsimi stated that this confluence of capitulation and profit-taking may have marked a local exhaustion point, which might lay the foundation for new market structures in the upcoming weeks. Timing And Behavior Adding Weight To The Development It is interesting to note that this trend continues till the end of June, a month for rebalancing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs ) and institutional funds portfolios. However, this activity stopped in early July, indicating either a brief equilibrium or a possible turning point. “For now, June’s closing week stands out — not for price action alone, but for what it revealed about underlying flows,” Mevsimi added. According to the expert, such a timing adds weight to the trend, highlighting this wasn’t just noise; instead, it might have been a purposeful shift in position. In the past, local bottoms have frequently coincided with sudden increases in realized losses, particularly from short-term players . Although there is no definite signal, the expert believes it is crucial to pay close attention to how the timing and behavior line up here. Profit-taking might be swelling currently, but Bitcoin continues to eye upside targets, even new all-time highs. Titan of Crypto has outlined a Bull Flag breakout attempt that could result in a significant rally. BTC has also formed a bullish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover, indicating upside potential as this move often precedes price spikes .

Notably, the crypto asset has experienced a strong upswing this week, jumping 17% following this year’s positive XRP ETF news. On Thursday, Kelly Stewart, widely known as “Kelly in Vegas,” a popular sports analyst, weighed in on the ongoing debate over XRP’s potential, identifying key indicators that could signal a path to $100. “ If XRP hits $100, there will be signs,” Stewart tweeted in response to a discussion about Kansas State University’s search for new revenue sources. Notably, K-State’s athletic department is looking to generate over $20 million ahead of the 2025-26 academic year, a pivotal period when colleges are expected to begin revenue-sharing with student-athletes. According to a report, the university is exploring multiple strategies to bridge this funding gap, including expanded beer sales, naming rights, and on-field football sponsorships. Stewart’s comment quickly gained traction within both the crypto and sports betting communities, igniting discussions about potential financial opportunities for K-State. “If/when it does, give me a call, and we will make a deal. That goes for anyone out there that might want to showcase their brand at K-State and the 20+ million TV viewers we had this past season,” Shawn Becket, Senior Manager of Business Development for Kansas State Athletics replied. Becket’s statement hinted at the possibility of XRP-powered sponsorships or advertising opportunities at K-State, reinforcing the growing intersection between crypto and sports. If the university were to integrate XRP, it could unlock new revenue streams, particularly given the rapid adoption of digital assets across the sports sector. Kansas State Athletics has already transitioned to an entirely cashless payment system across its venues, including ticket offices, concessions, parking, and merchandise stores. Currently, it accepts credit and debit cards, as well as Apple Pay, but has yet to embrace cryptocurrency payments officially. Meanwhile, across the sports industry, some teams have been integrating cryptocurrency into their business models, with the NBA’s Sacramento Kings and Dallas Mavericks and European soccer powerhouse SL Benfica all embracing BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, and other coins for ticketing and merchandise purchases. Japan’s SBI e-Sports even compensates players in XRP, showcasing the currency’s growing utility. That said, beyond expanding sponsorship partnerships, several factors will further play a crucial role in XRP reaching the $100 milestone. Regulatory clarity in the U.S. remains a key catalyst, as legal battles continue to influence investor sentiment. A favorable outcome could attract institutional investors and bolster market confidence. Additionally, the approval of a spot XRP ETF would significantly increase demand, making the asset more accessible to traditional investors.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/the-100-ripples-xrp-price-prophecy-sports-analyst-reveals-what-to-watch-for/,"XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|BTC","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

Markets remained bullish but volatile throughout the month, while stablecoins became a focal point. On Thursday, July 3, Binance Research published a report outlining key trends from the past month. Most notably, stablecoin volume reached $253.7 billion, as landmark legislation passed the U.S. Senate. The passage of the Genius Act in the Senate was a major catalyst that drove stablecoin adoption. The act brings stablecoins into a regulated framework, prompting more companies to enter the space. Circle’s USDC led the charge, accounting for 79% of net stablecoin issuance in June. At the same time, stablecoin regulation served as a catalyst for growth in other areas. The total crypto market cap rose 2.62% in June, despite volatility caused by the Israel-Iran conflict. Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed altcoins, with its dominance rising to 65%, the highest level since early 2021. Crypto-related firms also saw significant gains, especially those embracing Bitcoin treasury strategies. Several companies saw quadruple-digit returns since adopting Bitcoin, which helped attract new investors.

2025-07-03T15:15:00,"Corporate Crypto Treasuries Could Worsen Price Crashes: Franklin Templeton","The growing wave of corporate crypto treasuries could amplify market downturns if prices fall sharply, analysts at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets warned in a new report . Key Takeaways: Franklin Templeton warns corporate crypto treasuries could deepen price crashes if markets turn bearish. Over 130 public firms have adopted Bitcoin reserves, raising billions through premium-priced equity and debt. A falling market-to-NAV ratio risks triggering forced sales, creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral. While the strategy has drawn praise for fueling institutional adoption and boosting company valuations, the firm cautioned that the model’s inherent risks could trigger a destructive feedback loop in bearish conditions. Publicly traded companies have been aggressively raising capital through equity, convertible notes, and other instruments to load up on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana for their balance sheets. 135 Listed Firms Have Adopted Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows 135 listed firms have deployed this playbook in BTC alone, with leaders including Strategy, Metaplanet, Twenty One, SharpLink, Upexi, and Sol Strategies. Inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, firms have raised billions since early 2024 by issuing shares at premiums to net asset value (NAV) and capitalizing on crypto volatility. Franklin Templeton analysts highlighted how the upsides of this approach include the ability to raise capital above NAV, making share issuance accretive even amid price swings. Additionally, for Proof-of-Stake assets like Ethereum and Solana, staking yields can add revenue streams, enhancing company growth when crypto prices rise. Rising markets can further attract investors, fueling a positive feedback loop. The Strategy Treasury Playbook pic.twitter.com/YXXdZmtlIm — Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTDA_US) July 2, 2025 However, the report flagged a significant downside: if the market-to-NAV ratio slips below 1, equity issuance becomes dilutive, undermining investor confidence and stalling capital inflows. Worse, if crypto prices fall sharply, companies might feel pressured to sell holdings to support their stock price, sending crypto prices even lower and deepening investor fear. Such a negative feedback loop could turn a price dip into a self-reinforcing crash. “The corporate crypto treasury model represents a new phase of institutional crypto adoption, but it is not without its risks,” Franklin Templeton wrote. Maintaining a premium to NAV and managing market volatility will be essential to avoid dangerous spirals. More Analysts Voice Concern Over Bitcoin Treasuries The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). To protect investors, he suggested suspending ATM programs if shares trade below 0.95 times NAV for more than 10 consecutive days. Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy. According to Pomerantz, Strategy overstated the benefits of its Bitcoin treasury strategy and downplayed the volatility and risks inherent to large-scale Bitcoin holdings.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A crypto whale who turned $100m with Solana is now betting big on XYZVerse, a $0.0033 memecoin he believes could surge 9,000% in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse price forecast: Can it really 30x? Bitcoin continues steady growth Solana fluctuates Conclusion A seasoned cryptocurrency investor, known for making a fortune of $100 million with Solana, has set his sights on a tiny memecoin valued at just $0.003333. He predicts it could soar by 9000%. This bold forecast has caught the attention of many, sparking curiosity about this overlooked digital asset. XYZVerse price forecast: Can it really 30x? XYZVerse is stepping into the memecoin arena at a time when community-driven tokens dominate speculative trading. The explosive rise of coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and engaged communities can deliver outsized returns. Market sentiment also plays a crucial role in XYZVerse’s outlook. As altcoin season looms, investor appetite for lower-cap, high-risk tokens is heating up. With XYZVerse still in presale, it stands to benefit significantly if it secures top-tier exchange listings and keeps community excitement high post-launch. Why XYZVerse stands out right now Strong branding and partnerships — Backed by sports tie-ins and influencer deals, XYZVerse has a broad appeal beyond traditional crypto audiences. Deflationary supply mechanics — A 17.13% token burn aims to ease sell pressure and support price growth. Liquidity and stability focus — With 15% of supply allocated to liquidity, it’s designed for smoother trading post-launch. Community incentives — 10% dedicated to rewards and engagement encourages holding and grassroots promotion. XYZ price outlook is as follows Current presale price: $0.003333 Post-presale target: $0.10 (project’s internal projections) Possible ATH in first weeks: $0.15 – $0.25 (assuming strong FOMO and exchange momentum) 6–12 month potential: $0.20 – $0.40 (with key partnerships and sustained hype) Is a 30x move to $0.10 realistic? A 30x surge from the presale price to $0.10 is within reach, but several factors must align: Major exchange listings — Listings on big CEXs like Binance, KuCoin, or OKX could drive explosive price action on day one. Viral community growth — Memecoins thrive on social buzz. If XYZVerse leverages its sports influencer network well, it can build unstoppable momentum. Bullish market conditions — If Bitcoin and altcoins continue their uptrend, speculative assets like XYZVerse often outperform. XYZVerse has the core ingredients to pull off a massive run. With focused marketing, top-tier exchange listings, and true community buy-in, the $0.10+ target, implying around a 3000% gain from the current price, becomes a serious possibility. You might also like: SOL bounces on ETF hopes, XRP eyes $27; XYZVerse targets 25,000% gains Bitcoin continues steady growth Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading between $102,517 and $111,338. Over the past six months, its price increased by 10.73%. In the last month, it went up by 1.33%, and in the past week, it rose by 1.01%. This steady growth shows ongoing interest in the cryptocurrency. Market indicators are mixed. The Relative Strength Index is at 61.72, nearing overbought levels. The Stochastic value is high at 98.92, suggesting it is overbought. The MACD level is -16.594, indicating possible downward momentum. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $106,235 and $107,244, showing a stable trend. Bitcoin’s nearest resistance level is at $114,326. If it breaks above this, it could reach the second resistance at $123,147. If it falls, it may find support at $96,683, and further down at $87,862. Based on recent data, Bitcoin could continue to grow, but overbought signals might lead to a short-term decline. Watching these levels can help predict its next move. Solana fluctuates Source: TradingView Solana ( SOL ) has experienced some notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price increased by 2.22%, settling within the range of $137.88 to $161.77. However, over the past month, the price has declined by 5.42%, and looking back six months, it has dropped by 28.33%. This mixed performance suggests that while there is short-term growth, the longer-term trend has been downward. Technical indicators provide further insights into SOL’s potential direction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.50, which is neutral, indicating that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 91.70, suggesting that SOL might be overbought in the short term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is -0.3727, pointing to a bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $148.35, slightly below the 100-day average of $150.35, which can be a bearish signal. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $170.18. If SOL breaks above this, it could aim for the second resistance at $194.07. On the downside, the nearest support is at $122.40, with a further support level at $98.51. A move towards the first support level would be a decrease of about 10%, while reaching the first resistance could mean an increase of over 5%. Based on these factors, SOL’s price may continue to fluctuate within these levels in the near future. Conclusion Amid the 2025 bull run, while BTC and SOL perform well, XYZVerse stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 3,000% growth and community-driven success.

2025-07-03T14:52:51,"Corporations Outpace ETFs in Bitcoin Purchases for Third Straight Quarter","The price of the first cryptocurrency remains resilient thanks to demand from publicly traded companies. In parallel, the SEC is accelerating the approval of exchange-traded funds based on crypto-assets. This was reported by analysts at QCP Capital . Public companies have outpaced ETFs in Bitcoin purchases for the third consecutive quarter. Firms like ProCap BTC LLC, Strategy, and Metaplanet continue to build positions in Bitcoin, viewing it as a strategic asset. This reinforces the narrative of buying on price drawdowns, QCP noted. Regulators Are Accelerating Adoption The Commission has approved the launch of Ethereum- and Solana-based ETFs with staking capabilities and has also given the green light to the Grayscale fund, which includes BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. The SEC is considering common listing standards for token-based funds. According to QCP, this initiative could simplify and expedite their approval process in the future. Corporate Adoption The trend of adding digital assets to corporate balance sheets is growing: Bitmine raised $20 million to accumulate Ethereum and generate staking revenue. DeFi Development received $100 million to acquire Solana and buy back shares. Infrastructure players are also expanding their presence. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle has applied for a banking license in the US. Robinhood has been active in Europe, launching open-ended futures and tokenized shares. Market Analysis Liquidity in the cryptocurrency market continues to grow. Solana futures volume on the CME reached a record 1.75 million contracts, and XRP futures trading volume exceeded $500 million in the first month. Meanwhile, implied volatility remains near historic lows. Traders' positions indicate accumulation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's dominance is holding at a multi-year high of 65–66%. Analysts noted that retail traders have taken a pause, while institutional traders are quietly building up positions. Experts expect a possible change in the volatility regime in the third and fourth quarters. Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. remain favorable for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. President Donald Trump has criticized Fed chief Jerome Powell and signaled that he intends to appoint a successor committed to cutting rates. Markets are already pricing in more rate cuts than the Federal Reserve is predicting. This positive sentiment has spread to digital assets, although the backdrop in the altcoin sector remains subdued. In June, QCP stated that Bitcoin would benefit from global uncertainty. On July 1, U.S. ETFs based on Bitcoin recorded an outflow of $342.2 million.

The acquisitions included a $1.4 billion buy made in six consecutive days, demonstrating BlackRock’s growing confidence in the future worth of Bitcoin. This momentum occurs as institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains strong, with BlackRock being the clear leader in the space. IBIT Now Tops IVV in Fee Revenue Annually BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which launched last January 2024, has fast become a behemoth in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF space. According to Bloomberg (July 2), IBIT is now topping BlackRock’s own S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in fee revenue per annum. Even with IVV’s $624 billion in AUM overshadowing IBIT’s $52.4 billion, IBIT’s 0.25% fee has raked in the firm $187.2 million a year in fees—higher than the $187.1 million from IVV’s lower 0.03% fee. Quickest ETF to Reach $70 Billion AUM IBIT recently made history, too, as the fastest ETF to hit $70 billion in assets managed. It achieved this in just 341 days—approximately five times faster than the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which took 1,691 days. The fund presently holds over 55% of the overall U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF assets and accounts for 96% of the market’s net inflows. BlackRock’s Total Bitcoin Holdings Top $80B Following its June spree of shopping, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings are now valued at over 696,874 BTC, which is approximately $80.7 billion in today’s market value. The aggressive accumulation represents BlackRock’s wager on Bitcoin as a permanent institutional holding—and a bet that ETF-based access will remain the investors’ entry point of preference.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/blackrock-buys-3-85b-in-bitcoin-as-ibit-overtakes-sp-500-etf-in-revenue/,"BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-07-03T14:45:16,"BTC liveliness in 2025 shows a trend of accumulation","The first half of 2025 arrived with several price records. This cycle turned out differently, as whales tended to hold, instead of distribute. Since January 2025, a trend of holding has established itself for BTC. The liveliness metric shows that, compared to previous rallies, the current market has not led to coin distribution. Liveliness is a metric of how many coins are spent versus how many are held, and reflects directly on-chain activity. Large holders preferred to accumulate coins, turning into long-term BTC supporters. The BTC liveliness metric slowed down in 2025 | Source: Chain Exposed Since the start of 2025, the liveliness metric points to a holding trend, rather than distribution. BTC has also not seen panic-selling or capitulation during this year’s bull market, as retail already liquidated its holdings during previous bull markets. The recent trend of holding arrived at a time when BTC fluctuated in a new tight range, mostly above $100,000, with the occasional dip to the $80,000 range. This time, even the market drawdown did not create panic-selling. The recent accumulation continued as BTC traded above $109,000 during the latest market recovery. Later, BTC jumped again to $110,360, on track to new all-time peaks. BTC transactions slow down The 2025 market cycle also continues without a deep correction, as drawdowns rarely exceeded 25% of the market price. The perception of BTC also changed, turning from a speculative asset to a store of value. BTC transaction fees also indicate extremely low on-chain activity. Transaction fees range between $0.15 and $0.30, despite the price hovering within a few thousand dollars of a new all-time high. During previous market rallies, transactions would pick up for BTC, often creating network congestion. This cycle, even near-record prices, rarely spikes on-chain activity. At the same time, BTC accumulates into a new set of wallets, with the most rapid growth among wallets holding 100-1,000 and 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. The trend was especially clear in June, when whales accumulated a record 800,000 BTC in a single month. New wallets also shift to holding Almost all cohorts have shifted to holding, though short-term wallets sometimes distribute coins and tokens. Based on the holder heat map, all wallets aged six months or over have gradually increased their balances. By the end of June 2025, around 62% of BTC had not moved for over 12 months . Briefly, some of the whales distributed their coins, though not as dramatically as in previous market cycles. The biggest redistribution followed the 2018 rally, where only 42% of coins remained unmoved in older wallets. The current holding trend also comes from corporate buyers, who are buying new BTC almost daily, with the goal of holding for the long term. 2025, to date, has also shown much more lively inflows of BTC into accumulation addresses. BTC exchange reserves and OTC desks are getting depleted, while coins accumulate in whale wallets, including custodial services. At the same time, speculative trading mostly relies on perpetual futures, using stablecoin liquidity, with little demand for storing and sending BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The firms have signed a strategic partnership for a pilot project to use Adecoagro's surplus energy to operate mining facilities and may also add BTC to Adecoagro's balance sheet in the future, according to a Thursday press release . Adecoagro, in which Tether acquired a 70% stake, has 230 megawatt in power generation capacity across South America. The company is a prominent food producer in the region and owns sugar mills, rice farms and dairy operations. ""This project opens the door to stabilizing a portion of the energy we currently sell on the spot market, locking in pricing, while also gaining exposure to the upside potential of bitcoin,"" said Mariano Bosch, co-founder and CEO of Adecoagro. The move underscores Tether's growing ambition in bitcoin mining following its previous investments in mining facility in the region. The firm said it has developed an operating system software for miners called Tether Mining OS, with plans to make it open source in the next months. CEO Paolo Ardoino said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in May that Tether ""will be the biggest bitcoin miner by the end of this year"" and has invested $2 billion in energy production and mining operations.

Data from Coinalyze shows that during bitcoin's move this week from $106,000 to $110,000, the long/short ratio fell from 1.223 in favor of longs to 0.858 in favor of shorts. Open interest also rose from $32 billion to $35 billion during this period, indicating that significant capital is being pumped into shorting bitcoin. Bitcoin has been trapped in a relatively tight range since early May, trading between $100,000 and $110,000 with three tests of each level of support and resistance. Technical indicators like relative strength index (RSI) continue to paint a bearish image with several drives of bearish divergence, with RSI weakening on each test of $110,000.

2025-07-03T14:32:08,"Investment Giant Franklin Templeton Issues Serious Warning About Bitcoin (BTC)!","Institutional Bitcoin (BTC) adoption has been increasing rapidly in recent months, with many companies adopting either a Bitcoin treasury strategy or a warning from the US asset management giant. According to The Block, Franklin Templeton, one of the leading asset management firms in the United States, warned about the risks associated with institutional Bitcoin treasury strategies. Franklin Templeton analysts said the future of institutional BTC and crypto treasury strategies is uncertain and depends on several critical factors. “Inspired by Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) move into Bitcoin, this speculative approach is rapidly gaining momentum. And it's not just limited to Bitcoin. While cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and XRP are the subject of corporate treasury strategy, 135 public companies accumulate only BTC. Strategy, Metaplanet and Twenty One are adopting a BTC strategy, while SharpLink ETH, Upexi and Sol Strategies are implementing a SOL strategy. However, there are risks to this.” At this point, Franklin Templeton analysts said that if the market-NAV ratio falls below 1, it brings with it a series of risks. According to analysts, if this ratio falls below 1, new stock issuances become dilutive and companies may have difficulty raising additional capital without hurting existing shareholders, which could halt capital formation. Worse still, if cryptocurrency prices fall, companies will be forced to sell their holdings to cover crypto losses and maintain stock prices, which will further drive down crypto prices, analysts said. Analysts added that institutional Bitcoin and the crypto treasury model will see greater adoption, but these companies could become quite risky investments in the event of a significant decline or a prolonged bear market. “If Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices fall, companies will sell their assets to protect their stock prices. This can undermine the value of cryptocurrencies and investor confidence, leading to a negative vicious cycle.” *This is not investment advice.

The Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank reported a breach that impacted 1,222 Texans, according to a notification published on the Texas Attorney General’s website. The notification doesn’t include the number of out-of-state residents that were impacted, so the total scope of the breach remains unknown. Stolen information includes names, addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, government-issued ID numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers, debit card numbers and birth dates. Western Alliance Bank reports nearly $83 billion in consolidated assets, according to U.S. Federal Reserve Statistics. In a separate filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General earlier this year, the bank reported that an unauthorized actor exploited a vulnerability in a third-party file transfer software system it uses, stealing information from 21,899 customers. It remains unclear if both filings are related to the same breach or not. The other recent breach involved the Texas-based Peoples Bank, which impacted 668 people in the state. Stolen info from Peoples Bank includes names, addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers, debit card numbers, medical information and birth dates.

2025-07-03T14:25:45,"XLM Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris Presale for Faster Returns","The post XLM Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris Presale for Faster Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Not every day do price prediction experts shift focus from a legacy coin to a rising star. But that’s exactly what’s happening right now. With Stellar’s XLM stuck in a cycle of slow growth, top analysts are quietly pivoting their eyes toward Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) as the next big breakout. And they’re not alone. Thousands of early crypto adopters are already placing their bets on this high-speed contender that’s built for the next generation of wealth creation. Stellar’s Legacy vs the Need for Speed There’s no denying XLM has played an important role in the crypto evolution. It’s helped shape the idea of fast, low-cost transactions for cross-border payments. However, as newer blockchains redefine what fast and scalable truly means, XLM’s progress has started to feel a little sluggish. Its vision remains noble, but its ceiling looks increasingly limited for investors hoping to ride a fresh wave of returns. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Turning Heads Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a fork or clone. It’s a reimagined financial engine, merging the value stability of Bitcoin with the scalability and energy efficiency of modern architectures. It introduces a dual-layer blockchain that uses Proof of Work for security and Delegated Proof of Stake for blazing-fast consensus. The result? A blockchain that clocks in at over 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality. And yes, it’s mobile-first. That means you can mine directly through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, designed to make wealth-building accessible to literally anyone with a smartphone. Even if you’ve never touched a mining rig in your life, you can start earning passively using just your device and the app’s energy-optimized algorithm. Visit the mining rewards tool at this calculator to preview potential income. What Makes BTC-S More Than Just Fast Speed is just the start. Bitcoin Solaris delivers a serious punch when it comes to decentralized functionality and sustainable scalability: Dual-consensus engine balances decentralization with usability. Smart contract support enables real-world DeFi and business apps. Validator rotation and slashing mechanisms improve security. Energy-efficient operation with over 99 percent less power draw than Bitcoin. Bridges under development for seamless asset transfer across chains. These features aren’t promises. They’re already being tested, optimized, and fine-tuned in preparation for the upcoming mainnet. More importantly, development is progressing fast. A recent dev update revealed public access to the testnet is nearing, alongside a complete developer toolkit and wallet upgrades. Influencers and Communities Backing the Move BTC-S isn’t growing in the shadows. Some of crypto’s most active influencers and review outlets are already buzzing about it. The review by Token Galaxy dives deep into why Bitcoin Solaris may be the best shot at early-mover wealth in 2025. Crypto Vlog highlights the app’s ease of use and growing hype among grassroots investors. Crypto Show explains the technical edge behind the Helios consensus system and how it’s beating legacy protocols. These aren’t paid spots. These are passionate crypto voices reacting to a project that feels like the perfect storm of timing, tech, and traction. Stop Chasing Crypto Hype Start Building With BTC-S Presale Momentum Is Heating Up With only around 4 weeks left in one of the shortest presales in crypto history, Bitcoin Solaris is running hot. The price is currently $10 with the next phase bumping it to $11 and a projected launch price of $20. That’s a potential 150 percent gain for anyone who acts now. So far, over 13,650 unique users have joined, and the $6M+ raised signals both community belief and investor urgency. As always, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. This isn’t just a presale. It’s a chance to enter a movement before it becomes mainstream. And if that sounds dramatic, ask the people who bought Bitcoin under $50. A Quick Look at the Token Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a fair and transparent distribution model. You can see the full breakdown here , but in short: 66.66% is reserved for mining over the next 90 years. Only 20% is in the presale, limiting dump risks. 0.33% allocated to the team, keeping the supply community-driven. This structure reflects a long-term vision that puts miners, users, and builders at the center of BTC-S’s future. More Than a Coin, It’s a Roadmap for Impact For those curious about what’s coming after the launch, you’ll be impressed by the BTC-S development arc. According to the official roadmap, upcoming milestones include Solana bridge integration, AI-optimized governance, a Mining Power Marketplace, and even Fortune 500 partnership targets. You can check the full timeline here . In short, this isn’t a quick pump. It’s a build. A bold one. Final Verdict If you’re scanning the crypto landscape wondering where your next big return will come from, Bitcoin Solaris deserves a front-row spot on your radar. It combines proven blockchain mechanics with next-gen design, delivering a system that is scalable, secure, and shockingly user-friendly. While legacy coins like XLM continue to serve their roles, BTC-S is here to build wealth. The window is short, the presale is moving fast, and the potential is massive. You’ve missed a few trains before. Don’t miss this one.

2025-07-03T14:24:41,"Bitcoin Breaks $110,000: What’s Fueling the Crypto Comeback?","On July 3, Bitcoin’s price hit a three-week high, crossing $110,000. The recovery came amid global money supply (M2) growth, which reached a new all-time high (ATH) of over $55 trillion. Bitcoin tested $110,000. Ethereum and altcoins gave positive signals. Market Overview In a commentary for The Block, BTC Markets crypto analyst Rachel Lucas attributed the day’s market growth to macroeconomic liquidity: “While it doesn't always lead to immediate price movements, such funds eventually find their way into risky assets like cryptocurrencies with some delay.” Lucas believes the market needs a ”sustained catalyst” for a true breakout to all-time highs. This could be a clearer understanding of future interest rates by the Federal Reserve or a further influx of investment in ETFs. “It is institutional investment that has quietly sustained this rise, and for a decisive breakthrough it must continue,” she said. ETF Flows and Investor Sentiment On July 1, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for the first time in 15 days, possibly indicating investor doubts. The next day, July 2, the chart of total inflows into exchange-traded funds reached a new all-time high (ATH), which pulled Bitcoin’s price higher. Possible Growth Factors Among the possible growth factors: U.S. President Donald Trump praised a new trade agreement with Vietnam, opening market access for U.S. manufacturers. Ripple confirmed its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a federal banking license. Renewed hopes for a Fed rate cut after a series of mild statements from U.S. central bank officials. Given Bitcoin’s solid breakout from its recent sideways range, analysts are becoming more confident that a new all-time high is imminent. Analyst Insights Market researcher Jackis noted a rare phenomenon: Bitcoin volatility recently reached its lowest levels since 2023. “Every time we reached these values, a massive spike in volatility followed within five weeks (and sometimes sooner),” Jackis observed. Titan of Crypto, a technical analysis specialist, drew attention to the bullish crossover of the MACD indicator on the daily chart. He considers this a strong momentum signal and noted that Bitcoin is trying to break out of a bullish flag pattern. If the breakout is successful, an exit to the $137,000 level is possible. Altcoins Emerge as Ethereum Accelerates Altcoins are coming out of the shadows, while Ethereum is accelerating. Ethereum and other altcoins have shown signs of life following Bitcoin. The price of ETH added more than 8% over the last 24 hours, breaking above the $2,600 mark. Grayscale’s head of research, Zach Pandl, said in a Decrypt commentary that he expects new highs for many tokens in the second half of the year, despite current asset valuations within recent ranges. “Recent crypto-ETP endorsements could boost investor confidence that capital from traditional finance will start flowing into altcoins as well,” Pandl said. He noted that the growing regulatory clarity in the U.S. is likely to attract more users and capital to the crypto ecosystem. “Bitcoin is like a backseat passenger today, with altcoins leading the market,” Pandl added. Ethereum Accumulation and Staking Trends CryptoQuant expert Carmelo Aleman is positive about Ethereum. According to his data, accumulation addresses that meet strict criteria (do not belong to centralized exchanges, have minimal or zero ETH withdrawals) have set a new historical record. As of June 30, they held approximately 22.75 million ETH, up 35.97% for the month. The average purchase price as of July 1 was $2,114.70. At Ethereum’s current price of around $2,600, these addresses are up over 23%. Aleman pointed out a new all-time high in liquid staking volume at 35.56 million ETH. This is because the majority of accumulation addresses belong to institutional investors, ETFs, and large holders who are profiting from liquid staking as they await further price appreciation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9796/bitcoin-breaks-110-000-what-s-fueling-the-crypto-comeback,"BTC|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-03T14:12:21,"Hackers Steal $180M from Brazilian Banking System in Largest-Ever Attack, Cash Out via Bitcoin and USDT","Criminal hackers exploited a critical vulnerability in a Brazilian banking infrastructure on Monday, stealing over R$1 billion (~$180 million) from reserve accounts in what authorities called the largest cyberattack in the country’s financial history. According to Brazil Journal , C&M Software, a Central Bank-authorized service provider that handles API connections for financial institutions in Brazil, became the entry point for attackers who gained access to multiple bank accounts, including those of banking-as-a-service provider BMP. Federal Police sources confirm that the breach is a massive infiltration of Brazil’s national payment system, with stolen funds immediately routed through cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter desks in an attempt to convert the money into Bitcoin and USDT. Central Bank technicians worked through the night to investigate the incident after C&M was immediately disconnected from the financial system, while multiple crypto service providers blocked suspicious transactions and froze accounts linked to the attack. Infrastructure Breach Exposes Crypto Conversion Network C&M Software confirmed in a statement to Valor Econômico that it was “ a direct victim of criminal action, which included the improper use of customer credentials to attempt to fraudulently access its systems and services. “ Hackers teriam desviado milhões de reais após invadir empresa que conecta instituições financeiras ao Pix https://t.co/K7s94En4OH — Valor Econômico (@valoreconomico) July 2, 2025 The attackers exploited C&M’s role as a messaging gateway for Brazil’s Instant Payment System (PIX), gaining unauthorized access to transfer protocols that connect banks, fintechs, and payment processors to the national financial infrastructure. Immediately after the theft, they began moving the stolen funds to cryptocurrency providers integrated with PIX, attempting to purchase USDT and Bitcoin through exchanges, gateways, and OTC desks. SmartPay CEO Rocelo Lopes noted in a statement released that his company “ detected that there was a problem at 00:18 on June 30, due to the atypical movement on both platforms ” and automatically raised validation filters on USDT and Bitcoin purchases. “ Large sums of money were withheld and, at the same time, the process of returning them to the institutions involved was carried out ,” Lopes explained, adding that many crypto OTC desks denied registration and operations by the hackers. Industry sources have revealed that blockchain monitoring tools detected significant transactions to various cryptocurrency companies, although the exact amount successfully converted to digital assets remains under investigation. However, despite the gravity of the attack, BMP emphasized in its official statement that “ no BMP customer was impacted or had their funds accessed ,” clarifying that the attack “ exclusively involved funds deposited in its reserve account at the Central Bank ” and that the institution “ has sufficient collateral to fully cover the impacted amount. “ Crypto Rails Become Highway for Traditional Financial Crime This attack adds to the growing concern of crypto’s expanding role as an exit ramp for traditional financial crimes, with digital assets providing liquidity and pseudo-anonymity that cash cannot match at scale. Stablecoins have become particularly attractive to illicit networks, with the Financial Action Task Force recently warning that their use by criminal organizations poses growing risks without coordinated global regulation. The FATF has urged governments to tighten crypto AML rules, warning that regulatory gaps still pose risks to global financial security. #FATF #AntiMoneyLaundering https://t.co/s6De83vskd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 27, 2025 The Brazilian heist follows a pattern of major crypto-related thefts this year, including North Korea’s record $1.46 billion ByBit exchange hack and Chinese police uncovering a $136 million laundering network that used digital currencies for cross-border transfers. Global regulators are struggling to keep pace with these hybrid attacks, where traditional banking systems are breached but digital assets provide the escape route. Recent enforcement actions, such as OKX’s $505 million settlement for anti-money laundering violations , have particularly focused on the role of crypto platforms in facilitating illicit fund flows. Looking forward, the Brazilian authorities are taking steps to trace the stolen funds across multiple blockchain networks while coordinating with international partners to freeze assets and identify the perpetrators behind the country’s most significant financial cyberattack.

2025-07-03T14:10:41,"Bitcoin’s Rebound Pushed Most Investors Back into Profit","Bitcoin has rallied above $107,000, taking the vast majority of investors back into profit, says blockchain data platform Glassnode , with total unrealized gains hitting a whopping $1.2 trillion. The coin currently stands at $109,716, having appreciated 2% over the last 24 hours. The market overall is experiencing an uptick, with nearly all coins in green at the time of writing. Also, looking at both the Market Capitalization and Realized Cap measures, Glassnode found “substantial growth” this cycle. The former surged from $304 billion to $2.13 trillion, and the latter jumped from $400 billion to $955 billion. “Together, they highlight not only the substantial capital inflows into Bitcoin, but also its maturation toward becoming a multi-trillion-dollar asset,” it argues. As $BTC rebounds to $107k, most holders are back into profit. But distribution remains muted – investors are holding through. Realized profits decline, LTH supply hits ATH, and ETF inflows stay strong. Learn what to make of it in the latest Week On-Chain: https://t.co/Rc00Ql7P5x pic.twitter.com/g5OIvhk8lD — glassnode (@glassnode) July 2, 2025 Moreover, the total unrealized profit is currently at $1.2 trillion. This indicates “the substantial value appreciation” which BTC investors have seen, as well as “the incentive for potential sell-side pressure that may emerge if sentiment shifts.” Source: Glassnode Meanwhile, the average paper gains (losses held by the average market participant) stand at +125%. The report claims this suggests that BTC investors are “sitting on significant profits.” This number is still lower than the +180% profitability seen in March 2024 when the price hit the ATH of $73,000 and December 2024 when it hit $00,000. That said, some $872 million worth is locked in profit daily at this point. This is lower than the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in realized profit seen during the ATHs of $73,000 and $107,000, respectively. Notably, the report highlights, recent drops didn’t “significantly impact investor profitability.” Moreover, valuation frameworks show a positive profitability across holders of all coin ages. Source: Glassnode The market jump comes after several days of consecutive, albeit relatively minor, decreases that followed Israel’s attack on Iran , resulting in casualties and further conflict in the region. Given that geopolitical headlines influence the crypto market, the risk of further downside remains, Glassnode says. However, the decrease in tensions between the two countries helped stabilize market sentiment and fuel price recovery. Moreover, per the analysts, “the market’s ability to hold the Short-Term Holder cost basis during such a volatile and uncertain period is a constructive signal, suggesting that the bulls are still in control, and that underlying momentum may remain skewed to the upside.” You may also like: Crypto Market Enters Holding Pattern and Fatigue Grows, But Will the Bull Stay? The world’s first and most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has remained range-bound recently. This comes as crypto market profit-taking slows, spot volume fades, activity metrics cool, and futures sentiment turns cautious, according to the latest report by blockchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode. Without a notable influx of new demand, upside momentum will remain limited.BTC has been trading in a $100,000–$110,000 range, where it has been consolidating since 8 May. Macro... Investors Brace for Possible Increase in Market Volatility Citing Glassnode data, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , noted that “Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics continue to showcase the strength of its current market position.” BTC supply in profit rising reinforces “just how bullish recent momentum has been,” Chait says in an email. However, he also warns that elevated levels of profit are often followed by increased market volatility. “Historically, when such a high percentage of supply sits in profit, the chances of profit-taking rise. That, in turn, introduces short-term market movements even when there is a broadly optimistic outlook,” Chait argues. Meanwhile, the Glassnode report found that, despite a surge in profitability, investor behavior shows a strong preference for HODLing. The current price range seems insufficient to trigger significant profit-taking, it noted. Several metrics show this, namely declining realized profits, a downtrend in Liveliness, and Long-Term Holder supply hitting a new ATH. The decline in sell-side pressure can be seen in the total supply held by the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort. It reached a new all-time high of 14.7M BTC. “This underscores that HODLing remains the dominant market behavior amongst investors, with accumulation and maturation flows significantly outweighing distribution pressures,” Glassnode says. Moreover, the behavior of Long-Term Holders further reinforces this argument. After a brief uptick in sell-side pressure into the ATH, this cohort slowed their spending as well. Finally, the Liveliness metric saw significant upticks during the two previous BTC price ATH formations. This suggested that spending activity and profit taking took over the market. Yet, during the latest ATH formation, Liveliness trended downward, reinforcing “that HODLing remains the dominant behavior among investors, and that a range expansion in price may be necessary to incentivize renewed spending activity.” You may also like: Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 3, 2025 The crypto market is up today, after several days of trending mildly downwards.

As investors digested the non-farm payrolls report, the Dow opened more than 100 points higher, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite edging up to fresh all-time highs. The S&P 500 was up nearly 0.5% in early trading, while the Nasdaq Composite had added 0.6%. The gains followed upward momentum in the futures market, where the benchmark S&P 500 hovered near its previous record.

According to the report, job gains were strongest in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. The unemployment rate also surprised to the upside, falling to 4.1% versus forecasts of a rise to 4.3%. In May, the U.S. economy had added 144,000 jobs, an upward revision from the previously reported 139,000. At the time, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.

On Wednesday, bets for a rate cut by the central bank in July stood at 24%. While the jobs report has catalyzed an upward reaction across equities, investors remain cautious amid focus on President Donald Trump’s tax bill.

2025-07-03T14:06:44,"Bahrain Central Bank Launches First Stablecoin Issuance and Offering Rules—Will Crypto Soar?","The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has launched its first regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and offerings, establishing the Gulf nation as one of the few jurisdictions in the region with a formal rulebook governing the activity. The new rules issued under Volume 6 of the CBB Capital Markets Rulebook, are designed to provide legal clarity and oversight for stablecoin issuers operating in or from Bahrain. Bahrain Unveils Comprehensive Stablecoin Regulations, Marking a First for the Kingdom According to the framework , the offering, issuance, minting, and burning of stablecoins, as well as the custody and reserve asset management associated with them, will now be treated as regulated financial activities. The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has released its new Stablecoin Issuance and Offering (SIO) Module, the country’s first regulatory framework allowing the compliant issuance of stablecoins. Previously, CBB granted Binance subsidiary BPay Global a license to operate as a payment… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 3, 2025 Entities intending to offer such services must obtain a license from the CBB, and no stablecoin activity may occur in or from Bahrain without prior approval. Also, only fully fiat-backed stablecoins pegged to the Bahraini Dinar, the U.S. Dollar, or other fiat currencies are deemed acceptable by the CBB. In addition, CBB emphasized that issuers must maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio, backed by high-quality, liquid assets that meet stringent risk criteria. The framework also noted that issues must fulfill annual audit obligations, and adhere to robust standards on cybersecurity, internal controls, and consumer protection. Under the new module, the CBB also laid out a multi-layered licensing process in which applicants must demonstrate a minimum paid-up capital of BHD 250,000 and satisfy conditions related to shareholder transparency, governance, risk management, and IT system readiness. Notably, the new licensing framework introduces clear operational and prudential requirements such as issuers providing a stablecoin whitepaper and outlining key details of the project and its financial underpinnings. In particular, the regulations enforce a permanent right of redemption for stablecoin holders, prohibit the payment of interest, and require that all reserve assets be subject to external audits and held in segregated accounts. The CBB emphasized that the body retains the authority to reject any stablecoin issuance it deems contrary to the interests of Bahrain’s national economy or the general public. The body further warns that it reserves the right to impose additional capital buffers if the issuer’s activities are deemed to pose heightened risk to the financial system. Bahrain Expands Digital Asset Momentum with Licensing and Institutional Crypto Products Bahrain continues to reinforce its position as a regional crypto hub through regulatory clarity and growing institutional involvement. In April, BPay Global, a subsidiary of Binance, secured a Payment Service Provider license from the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB). Binance expands in the Gulf as BPay Global secures regulatory approval from Bahrain’s central bank for fiat payments. #CryptoRegulation #Fintech https://t.co/xt7sFsxwAW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 10, 2025 The license allows BPay to operate as a regulated entity, offering fiat on- and off-ramps, custodial services, and e-wallet functionality. This development enables Binance users in Bahrain to make fiat deposits and withdrawals via bank transfers and cards directly on the platform. “This license represents a positive step in enhancing Bahrain’s digital payments ecosystem, particularly in its support for the crypto-related sector as well as fiat payment solutions,” said Abdulla Haji, Director of the CBB’s Licensing Directorate. Bahrain’s push toward regulated crypto finance also extends to traditional institutions. In October 2024, the National Bank of Bahrain (NBB) launched the region’s first Bitcoin-linked structured investment product , offering capital-protected exposure to BTC. @NBBOnline has introduced Bitcoin investment product, which will be available “exclusively for accredited investors.” #Bitcoin #NBB #InvestmentFund https://t.co/NlKyXMPaBj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 8, 2024 Developed in collaboration with ARP Digital, co-founded by a former Goldman Sachs partner, the product targets accredited investors seeking controlled exposure to crypto assets. These developments align with wider adoption trends in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). According to Chainalysis, the region received $338.7 billion in on-chain value between July 2023 and June 2024, about 7.5% of global crypto volume. Notably, 93% of this activity came from institutional and professional transactions above $10,000, reflecting a mature and growing market.

2025-07-03T14:06:17,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Consolidates After Bull Flag Breakout: What's Next?","Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out of its bull flag and is currently consolidating above $109,000. Is the all-time high next? How high could the king of the cryptocurrencies go? Bitcoin (BTC) has broken out, has come back to test the breakout, and is now consolidating before the next piece of price action. Could it dip back inside the bull flag? No particular price move can be discarded, and although it makes sense for this upside move to continue, the bulls may run out of steam. $BTC breakout and confirmation Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart reveals the $BTC price breakout and the dip back down to confirm it. However, given that most of the shorter term Stochastic RSI momentum indicators are at or near the top of an overbought condition, it may well be that the price bounces along the top of the bull flag trendline for a while, or as mentioned above, dips back into the flag. All this said, this is a bull flag breakout and it would be more likely for the price to continue upward. At some point, the momentum indicators will need to reset, but this can come in the form of some sideways and downward movement which may not affect the price too much. The next targets for this current move are the higher high at $110,600, and then the all-time high just short of $112,000. Getting above the latter and making a new high should be the final confirmation signal that Bitcoin is heading to the next stage of its upward journey. Bullish daily engulfing candle Source: TradingView The daily chart is looking positive. Yesterday’s daily candle engulfed the previous one by quite some margin, and now a candle has opened well above the 50-day moving average (blue line). At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator is still angled upward, having bounced from the yellow moving average line and the 50.00 level. Current bull flag breakout has big potential upside Source: TradingView The weekly chart above shows the whole of the bull market so far. It can be seen that the price is just emerging from the current bull flag. Although this flag is a lot smaller in scale than the previous falling wedge or the long bull flag that went sideways for much of 2024, the length of the flag pole could translate into a measured move up to $137,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is in a bullish condition. Obviously, this does not confirm until the end of the week, but as it stands, the blue fast line is shaping to cross back above the orange slow line. This can signal the upside price momentum needed by the bulls for this next big move. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-03T14:00:45,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Will BTC Hit $120K in the Next Few Days?","Bitcoin is gaining ground as it surges toward its all-time high of $111K, fueled by renewed buying interest and strong technical momentum. With market sentiment shifting positively, expectations are building for a potential breakout that could take BTC to the $120K range in the near future. BTC Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart Following a healthy pullback to the $106K support level, BTC attracted notable demand, leading to a renewed rally back toward its all-time high at $111K. The ongoing price action reflects solid bullish momentum, likely stemming from sustained accumulation within the $100K–$111K consolidation range. A key bullish signal has also emerged: the 100-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average, forming a Golden Cross, historically associated with longer-term bullish trends. This reinforces the current upward trajectory and investor confidence. However, BTC now faces a decisive test at the $111K ATH. A successful breakout above this psychological and technical barrier could ignite a fresh impulsive leg upward, with the $120K mark as the next major target. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, BTC initially faced rejection at the upper boundary of a descending wedge near $108K, triggering a brief dip to $106K. This move, however, was likely a liquidity sweep, a strategic pullback designed to trap retail sellers and enable smart money to accumulate long positions. Following this, the BTC price broke above the wedge structure and completed a bullish retest, confirming the breakout. The cryptocurrency is now gaining momentum again, eyeing the $111K liquidity pool, where a cluster of stop orders likely resides. This area is of high interest to large players seeking to trigger a buy-side liquidity cascade. If bulls can reclaim this level, a breakout is likely to follow, potentially propelling Bitcoin to new highs around $120K. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan This chart presents the Binance Liquidation Heatmap, which visualizes areas where significant liquidation events are likely to unfold. These zones often act as liquidity magnets, drawing price action toward them. Large market participants, commonly known as whales, strategically target these levels to enter or exit positions efficiently. At present, a notable cluster of liquidation levels sits just above Bitcoin’s all-time high of $111K, suggesting a strong probability that the price may be drawn toward this region. If reached, this could spark a short-squeeze, amplifying upward momentum and potentially pushing BTC to new highs. However, this liquidity cluster also reflects persistent selling pressure around current levels. Sellers remain active, keeping the $111K resistance firm. As such, this threshold stands as a critical decision point. A confirmed breakout above could initiate a powerful bullish continuation, while a failure to breach it may result in another rejection and possible retracement.

2025-07-03T14:00:13,"Hamak Limited transitions from gold mining business to Bitcoin corporate treasury","Hamak Gold Limited, a London-listed gold exploration company, announced plans on Thursday to adopt a Bitcoin treasury management policy. The news sent its shares up by 6%, now changing hands at 1.17 GBX. According to a press statement published on July 3, Hamak successfully raised gross proceeds of £2.47 million through a placing and subscription round priced at 0.8 pence per share, a 27% discount from the previous close on July 2, 2025. The deal introduced 308.4 million new ordinary shares, representing 68.2% of Hamak’s newly enlarged share capital of 452.1 million shares. Each new share is accompanied by a two-year warrant exercisable in the second year, with a one-year lock-in period. Hamak Gold funding round to finance Bitcoin treasury Per the company’s statement, existing shareholders will receive warrants on equivalent terms, with the cut-off set as the close of business on July 2, the day before the official announcement. The share issuance process faced regulatory limitations, with Hamak unable to admit all the new shares without publishing an FCA-approved prospectus. As a workaround, the 308 million shares were issued to newly appointed directors Nick Thurlow and James Lawrence, who agreed to resell 283 million of those shares to investors at the issue price. The financing round came against the backdrop of an office shuffle, where former Executive Chairman Amara Kamara and Non-Executive Director Niall Young stepped down, and Thurlow and Lawrence took over as executive chairman and executive director, respectively. One of the investors in the fundraising was MBS Global Investments, which subscribed for £100,000. MBS is the investment arm of the Private Office of Sheikh Nayef Bin Eid Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family. The Qatari investors will see to it that part of the proceeds are used to create a Bitcoin treasury. “ With the injection of additional capital, we are now well-positioned to pursue two core objectives in parallel, maximising our gold exploration opportunities and leading the UK market in bitcoin treasury management as a Main Market-listed company ,” Chair Thurlow said in a statement. Earlier this week, Hamak submitted applications to the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) and the London Stock Exchange for the admission of 308,375,000 new shares to the equity shares (transition) category of the FCA’s Official List. The company expects the shares to begin trading on the main market on or around July 4, 2025. London-registered companies are buying Bitcoin Alongside Hamak, at least nine companies in London have disclosed their intent to purchase digital assets in the past two weeks, taking a similar approach to business intelligence firm Strategy, led by the pro-BTC Michael Saylor in the US. Among these firms is Panther Metals, which recently purchased its first Bitcoin after reporting a £2.2 million loss last year. Panther’s shares have surged over 60% in the last month. Its CEO Darren Hazelwood stated the firm will build up its Bitcoin holdings “quickly,” with a short-term goal of accumulating £4 million worth of the asset. Bluebird Mining Ventures, another natural resources company, raised £2 million in debt to buy Bitcoin and is seeking to secure another £10 million. “The company was on life support before this,” Founder Aidan Bishop remarked, adding that Bluebird had reported a $898,000 loss last year. Vinanz, a company originally formed as a Bitcoin mining operation, announced more Bitcoin acquisitions last week, funded by equity and debt offerings. Its current holdings now total $3.85 million. The market value of Smarter Web Company, a Guildford-based website builder listed on the Aquis Exchange, reportedly surged to £806.2 million in just two months since disclosing its Bitcoin-buying plans in April.
