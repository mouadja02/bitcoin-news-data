2025-07-03T11:50:51,"Altcoin Season Index at 24: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Dominant Reign","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 24: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Dominant Reign Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market? The Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric from CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered 24 at 00:30 UTC on July 3. This uptick from the previous day’s figure signals a clear message: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . But what does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these dynamic market conditions? Let’s dive deep into understanding this pivotal indicator and its implications for your cryptocurrency investing journey. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index (ASI): Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital compass for investors, helping to determine whether the broader market is favoring Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric that offers insights into prevailing crypto market trends . Here’s how this fascinating index works: Scope: The index tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a pure measure of market sentiment and capital flow. Timeframe: Its assessment is based on the performance of these coins over the past 90 days, providing a robust, medium-term view rather than short-term fluctuations. Defining Seasons: The index operates on a simple yet effective rule: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price appreciation over the 90-day period. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin during the same timeframe. The Score: The index scores range from 1 to 100. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin Season. The current reading of 24, up four points, firmly places us in Bitcoin Season territory, meaning Bitcoin is currently the dominant performer against most major altcoins. To put it simply, the ASI tells us where the smart money is flowing. Is it into the established, less volatile Bitcoin, or are investors seeking higher, albeit riskier, returns in the myriad of altcoins? What Does ‘Bitcoin Season’ Truly Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season, it signals a period where Bitcoin’s price appreciation outpaces the vast majority of altcoins. This isn’t just about Bitcoin going up; it’s about Bitcoin going up more significantly than most other cryptocurrencies, or holding its value better during market downturns. During a Bitcoin Season, you’ll typically observe: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance, its share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, tends to increase. This indicates that capital is consolidating in BTC, often seen as the ‘safe haven’ asset within the crypto space. Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, may struggle to gain significant traction. Some might even bleed value against Bitcoin, meaning their USD value might rise, but their BTC value (e.g., ETH/BTC, ADA/BTC) decreases. Reduced Volatility in BTC (Relatively): While Bitcoin is inherently volatile, during its season, it might offer comparatively more stability than the highly speculative altcoin market. Why does Bitcoin Season happen? Several factors contribute to this phenomenon: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or uncertainty, investors often flock to assets perceived as more stable. Within crypto, Bitcoin often plays this role due to its larger market cap, institutional adoption, and established network. Pre-Halving Rallies: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede significant price surges, drawing capital away from altcoins. Institutional Inflow: When large institutions enter the crypto space, their initial investments often flow into Bitcoin due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity. Market Cycle Behavior: Bitcoin often leads market rallies, with altcoins typically following once Bitcoin’s rally cools off and profits are rotated. For investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective cryptocurrency investing . It means re-evaluating risk exposure and potentially adjusting your portfolio allocation. The Elusive ‘Altcoin Season’: What Triggers the Shift? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is cyclical, and an Altcoin Season is always a possibility. This highly anticipated period is characterized by explosive growth in altcoin prices, often dwarfing Bitcoin’s gains. It’s when many investors see their smaller altcoin holdings multiply rapidly. What typically triggers a shift from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance Peak: Often, Bitcoin’s dominance reaches a peak, and capital that flowed into BTC during its run begins to seek higher returns elsewhere. This ‘profit-taking’ from Bitcoin is then rotated into altcoins. Innovation and Narratives: New technological breakthroughs, significant upgrades to existing altcoin networks (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades), or emerging narratives (like DeFi, NFTs, AI tokens, GameFi) can ignite interest and capital flow into specific altcoin sectors. Reduced Risk Aversion: As the overall market gains confidence and stability, investors become more willing to take on higher risks associated with altcoins, which have lower market caps and greater upside potential. Liquidity Spreading: Once Bitcoin establishes a new price floor or consolidates, the increased liquidity in the market starts to spread out to smaller cap assets, leading to their exponential growth. Recognizing the signs of an impending Altcoin Season is key for maximizing returns. It requires constant monitoring of market sentiment, Bitcoin dominance charts, and news from promising altcoin projects. Navigating the Seasons: Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing Knowing whether it’s Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season isn’t just academic; it has direct implications for your cryptocurrency investing strategy. Adapting your approach based on the Altcoin Season Index can significantly impact your portfolio’s performance. Strategies During Bitcoin Season: With the Altcoin Season Index at 24, here’s how to navigate the current environment: Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: This is an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value, dollar-cost averaging into BTC can be a sound strategy. Selective Altcoin Accumulation: While most altcoins underperform, this period can be excellent for accumulating strong, fundamentally sound altcoin projects at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Research projects with solid technology, active development, and clear use cases. Risk Management: Reduce exposure to highly speculative or unproven altcoins. Their volatility can be amplified during Bitcoin Season, leading to significant losses. Education and Research: Use this period to research potential altcoin gems for the next Altcoin Season. Identify sectors or projects that could lead the next bull run. Strategies for the Next Altcoin Season: When the Altcoin Season Index starts climbing towards 75 and beyond, your strategy should shift: Profit Taking: Be prepared to take profits from your altcoin holdings. Altcoin seasons are known for parabolic pumps, but they can also reverse quickly. Having a profit-taking strategy (e.g., selling in tranches) is vital. Diversification within Alts: While Bitcoin Season often means consolidating into BTC, Altcoin Season might call for diversifying across promising altcoin sectors, spreading risk and capturing different narratives. Beware of FOMO: Not every altcoin will pump. Avoid blindly investing in every coin that is rising. Stick to your research and investment thesis. Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing your portfolio by moving some profits back into Bitcoin or stablecoins to secure gains and prepare for potential market corrections. Index Value Range Market Condition Key Characteristic Investor Action 75-100 Altcoin Season 75%+ of top 100 alts outperform BTC Focus on altcoin opportunities, profit-taking 25-74 Neither (Transition) Mixed performance, market indecision Cautious approach, research, observe 1-24 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer alts outperform BTC Focus on Bitcoin, strategic alt accumulation Table: Altcoin Season Index Interpretation and Investor Strategies Historical Context and Future Outlook for Crypto Market Trends History often rhymes in the crypto world. Past bull cycles have consistently shown phases of Bitcoin Season followed by an explosive Altcoin Season . For instance, in late 2017 and early 2021, Bitcoin led the initial charge, breaking new all-time highs. Once Bitcoin’s momentum cooled, capital flowed into altcoins, leading to massive pumps across the board. Understanding these historical patterns can provide valuable context for current crypto market trends . While past performance is not indicative of future results, it offers a framework for anticipating potential shifts. What could trigger the next shift from Bitcoin Season? Keep an eye on: Bitcoin Dominance Chart: A significant reversal or consolidation in BTC dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season. Major Altcoin Developments: Breakthroughs in scalability, new DeFi protocols, or significant institutional adoption of specific altcoins could act as catalysts. Global Economic Climate: A more risk-on environment in traditional markets might encourage greater speculation in altcoins. The market is a living, breathing entity, constantly evolving. Staying informed about these broader trends is paramount for successful cryptocurrency investing . Challenges and Considerations in Following the Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations and challenges: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on 90-day performance, meaning it reflects what has already happened. It’s not a predictive tool but rather a confirmation of current market conditions. Not All Altcoins are Equal: Even during an Altcoin Season, not every altcoin will pump. Many projects may fail, and some will simply not gain traction. Individual research and due diligence remain critical. Market Volatility: The crypto market is notoriously volatile. Conditions can change rapidly, and what is Bitcoin Season today might transition faster than anticipated. External Factors: Macroeconomic events, regulatory news, and major hacks or security breaches can override typical market cycle behavior. Therefore, use the Altcoin Season Index as one piece of your analytical puzzle, not the sole determinant of your investment decisions. Conclusion: Mastering the Seasons of Cryptocurrency Investing The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 24 unequivocally signals that we are in a period dominated by Bitcoin. This understanding is not merely academic; it provides a crucial framework for informed cryptocurrency investing . Whether it’s consolidating your position in Bitcoin, strategically accumulating promising altcoins, or preparing for the eventual shift to Altcoin Season , adapting your strategy to prevailing crypto market trends is paramount. The crypto market is a dynamic landscape, constantly shifting between periods of Bitcoin leadership and altcoin exuberance. By staying informed about metrics like the Altcoin Season Index and understanding the underlying drivers of these market seasons, you empower yourself to make more strategic decisions, navigate volatility with greater confidence, and ultimately, enhance your potential for long-term success in this exciting asset class.

The allegations are tied to the $4.5 billion embezzlement conspiracy carried out against the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, known as the 1MDB scandal, which began back in 2009. Standard Chartered “emphatically rejected” the claims made in the new Singapore lawsuit, according to a new Reuters report . Liquidators from the financial services giant Kroll filed the suit, claiming that the British bank enabled the 1MDB fraud. Standard Chartered allegedly ignored red flags and processed more than 100 intrabank transfers between 2009 and 2013, which contributed to hiding the 1MDB funds, according to three companies in liquidation associated with the scandal. Explain the liquidators, “According to this lawsuit, the transfers demonstrate serious breaches and control failings which ultimately enabled the theft of public funds by people operating at the highest levels of the Malaysian government during that period.” Standard Chartered told Reuters any claims made by the companies were “without merit.” Earlier this year, former Goldman Sachs employee Tim Leissner was sentenced to two years behind bars for playing a part in the multibillion-dollar heist. Prosecutors say that Leissner and others who worked for the banking giant aided Malaysia in raising $6.5 billion for the nation’s investment fund through bond sales.

2025-07-03T11:43:11,"Arthur Hayes Does Not Expect Bitcoin to Rise Until This Date! ""There is a Risk of $90,000! I Sold All Altcoins, I Can Sell BTC Too!""","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, one of the outspoken names in the cryptocurrency industry, shared his new predictions about Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) and the market could move sideways or slightly more bearish between now and the Jackson Hole conference in August, Arthur Hayes wrote in a new blog post. Hayes stressed that US bonds should be bought instead and claimed that buying US government bonds was a mistake. Bitcoin (BTC) May Drop to These Levels! The famous name said that the US government's recent support for stablecoins is not to benefit fintech companies like Circle, but to strengthen large traditional banks and fill the treasury. At this point, Hayes said the U.S. Treasury Department needs new ways to sell trillions of dollars in bonds and replenish the U.S. Treasury (TGA) without causing interest rates to rise. This has led Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look for alternative buyers and stablecoins. However, according to Hayes, the US government's support for stablecoins is a huge liquidity game, which could negatively affect the Bitcoin price. Because the market is not interested in bonds at high prices, and this is pushing the US government towards stablecoins. At this point, according to Hayes, the issuance of stablecoins by US banks could provide a purchasing capacity of $6.8 trillion, and banks could convert their existing deposits into bond purchases. This could provide new liquidity to the market for the future and trigger an increase. However, Hayes said that by then, in the short term, Bitcoin could fall to the $90,000 to $95,000 range if the effort to refill the US Treasury and sell bonds negatively impacts USD liquidity. Arthur Hayes lastly stated that there is a risk that the US government's liquidity and stablecoin game could pull Bitcoin to the $90,000-$95,000 range, and that altcoins could also be negatively affected by this. At this point, Hayes stated that his company Maelstrom has sold all of its illiquid altcoin positions and is considering reducing its Bitcoin positions depending on market performance. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-03T11:40:47,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 73: Unpacking the Market’s Bullish Confidence","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 73: Unpacking the Market’s Bullish Confidence The pulse of the digital asset world often beats to the rhythm of investor sentiment, and right now, that pulse is strong. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has soared to a notable 73, firmly entrenching itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This significant jump, a 10-point increase from the previous day, signals a palpable shift in the broader crypto market trends . But what does this elevated level of optimism truly signify for your investments and the future direction of digital assets? What Drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? For anyone navigating the often-volatile waters of cryptocurrencies, understanding the prevailing market sentiment is crucial. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, serves as a powerful barometer for this very purpose. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed,’ the index distills complex market dynamics into a single, digestible number. But how exactly does it arrive at this figure? It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several key factors, each weighted differently to provide a holistic view: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes in a strong uptrend often indicate greedy behavior. Social Media (15%): The index sifts through various social media platforms, analyzing the number of posts and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies. A high volume of positive mentions can contribute to a ‘Greed’ reading. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component previously involved weekly polls to gauge the general sentiment of crypto investors. When active, it offered a direct insight into individual perspectives. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates a flight to safety (fear) or a belief in Bitcoin’s continued leadership (greed, if it’s leading an uptrend). Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries related to cryptocurrencies, particularly those indicative of fear or greed, this factor captures the public’s general interest and emotional state. The index’s rise to 73, therefore, isn’t arbitrary; it’s a calculated reflection of these combined forces pushing the market into a state of heightened optimism. Why the Sudden Surge in Market Sentiment? The recent 10-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73 isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal of shifting market sentiment . This significant uptick suggests a growing wave of confidence sweeping across the digital asset landscape. But what factors might be fueling this renewed optimism? While the index itself aggregates various data points, the underlying reasons often stem from a combination of on-chain activity, macroeconomic developments, and significant news events. For instance, positive developments around regulatory clarity, increasing institutional adoption, or even a sustained period of price stability can contribute to a more bullish outlook. When investors see consistent upward movement or resilience in the face of minor pullbacks, their apprehension often gives way to a desire to participate, pushing the needle further into the ‘Greed’ zone. This collective shift in perception is a powerful force, capable of creating self-fulfilling prophecies in the short term. Navigating the Greed Zone: Insights into Investor Psychology When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Greed’ zone, particularly at levels like 73, it offers fascinating insights into collective investor psychology . On one hand, high greed can be a sign of a strong bull market, where prices are rising, and confidence is high. Investors might feel a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), leading to increased buying pressure and further price appreciation. This can be a lucrative period for those already holding assets. However, it’s also a double-edged sword. Extreme greed often precedes market corrections. When everyone is optimistic, and prices are consistently hitting new highs, the market can become overextended and susceptible to sudden downturns. The prevailing sentiment might overshadow fundamental analysis, leading to speculative bubbles. For the discerning investor, understanding this psychological dynamic is paramount. It’s a time to review risk management strategies, consider taking some profits, or at least exercise caution against impulsive decisions driven by euphoria. The goal isn’t to predict the top, but to be prepared for potential shifts when sentiment is running hot. The Crucial Influence of Bitcoin Price and Dominance It’s impossible to discuss the overall crypto market trends without acknowledging the pivotal role of Bitcoin price . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the direction of the broader market. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects this influence, with Bitcoin’s volatility and market momentum being significant factors in its calculation. When Bitcoin experiences a strong upward trend, it naturally boosts overall market sentiment, pulling the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value can quickly plunge the index into ‘Fear.’ Furthermore, Bitcoin dominance , which accounts for 10% of the index’s calculation, provides another layer of insight. A rising Bitcoin dominance during a market rally can indicate that investors are prioritizing Bitcoin as the primary asset for gains, potentially at the expense of altcoins. Conversely, if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, leading to a drop in its dominance, it might signal a broader speculative phase. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin’s price action and its market share is essential for interpreting the index’s signals accurately and understanding the underlying forces shaping the market. Actionable Insights: How to Leverage the Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s crucial to remember that it’s an indicator, not a crystal ball. Here are some actionable insights on how to use it effectively: Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ A high ‘Greed’ reading (like 73) might suggest it’s a good time to be cautious, perhaps even to trim positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. Conversely, extreme ‘Fear’ can present buying opportunities. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the index. Integrate it with fundamental analysis (project utility, team, roadmap), technical analysis (chart patterns, support/resistance levels), and macroeconomic factors (interest rates, inflation) to form a comprehensive view. Risk Management: High greed periods are prime times to reassess your portfolio’s risk exposure. Ensure you’re not overleveraged or investing more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders or profit targets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: The index is most useful for gauging short to medium-term market sentiment. Long-term investors might use it to identify opportune times for dollar-cost averaging, buying more during periods of extreme fear. Emotional Discipline: The index is a stark reminder of the emotional biases that drive markets. Use it to check your own emotions. Are you buying purely out of excitement (greed) or selling out of panic (fear)? Objectivity is key. Conclusion The ascent of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 73, placing the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a compelling indicator of robust market sentiment and growing confidence among participants. While this elevated optimism reflects positive crypto market trends and the enduring influence of Bitcoin price , it also serves as a critical reminder for investors. Understanding the nuances of investor psychology is paramount; extreme greed, while exhilarating, often warrants a cautious approach. By leveraging the insights from this index in conjunction with sound financial principles and a disciplined strategy, market participants can better navigate the exciting yet unpredictable landscape of digital assets, making informed decisions rather than succumbing to emotional impulses. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and always prioritize prudent risk management.

Another factor that may have positively impacted its recent price performance is Ripple’s application for a license with the US national bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). According to multiple analysts, its ascent has yet to reach new dimensions. The X user CRYPTOWZRD noted that XRP closed the day “bullish,” setting $2.80 as the next resistance target. “The intraday chart was highly volatile and bullish. It is now testing the $2.2550 resistance target. A successful breakout and a close above this level will offer the next long opportunity,” the trader added. World of Charts believes an XRP breakout and retest has already been confirmed . The analyst expects a move towards $3 in the coming days, followed by a pump beyond $3.50 sometime this month. The X user Maxi is even more optimistic. The crypto enthusiast believes XRP could replicate its performance in 2017 when it experienced a staggering 1,200% surge in a matter of days. Nowadays, a spike of that magnitude would drive the token’s valuation to a new all-time high of $30. At the moment, such a rally seems quite unrealistic, considering that XRP’s market cap needs to skyrocket above $1.6 trillion. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is the only cryptocurrency whose capitalization exceeds that mark, while Ethereum (ETH) is far below with $313 billion. Observing Some Indicators Despite the bullish predictions, there are some red flags popping up suggesting the asset could head in the opposite direction in the short term. The Relative Strength Index, which measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes, has climbed to almost 70. Such readings generally mean that the valuation has increased too rapidly over a short period of time , signaling that it might be time for a correction.

2025-07-03T11:15:58,"IMF pushes back on Pakistan’s subsidized electricity proposal for crypto mining","The IMF has declined Pakistan’s bid for subsidised electricity for crypto mining, despite earlier plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus power to the sector. In a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power, chaired by Senator Mohsin Aziz, Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan outlined the government’s recent efforts to negotiate subsidised electricity tariffs with the International Monetary Fund, as reported by Pakistan outlet Profit. Dr. Irfan explained that the proposal aimed to offer reduced electricity rates to energy-intensive sectors, particularly crypto mining and certain industrial operations, in hopes of spurring economic activity and utilising surplus power. However, the IMF rejected the idea, arguing that such subsidies could disrupt the energy market and add further strain to the power sector’s already fragile finances. This follows Pakistan’s earlier announcement of plans to dedicate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity specifically for Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and AI data centers under a national digital infrastructure initiative. The project aimed to attract foreign investment, create jobs in emerging technologies, and put idle generation capacity to productive use. You might also like: Pakistan confirms plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve Before this latest proposal, the government had floated other measures that also failed to gain the IMF’s approval. In September last year, officials suggested a six-month electricity tariff at marginal cost, pegged at Rs 23 per kilowatt-hour, to support crypto mining and other high-consumption industries. The IMF, however, agreed only to a shorter, three-month plan, citing worries over the potential disruption such incentives might create in the market’s equilibrium. Later in November, the government tried again with a targeted subsidy specifically crafted to encourage surplus electricity consumption, but the IMF dismissed that as well, likening it to sector-specific tax holidays that risk economic imbalance. Despite these setbacks, Dr. Irfan assured the committee that discussions with the IMF and other international bodies remain ongoing in search of a workable solution.

2025-07-03T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Tops $110K as Jobs Report Looms","Crypto Daybook Americas will not be published on Friday owing to the July 4 holiday. It will return on Monday. Wishing our U.S. readers a happy Independence Day. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC hit $110,000 for the first time since June 11 and is now within striking distance of its $112,000 all-time high, which was recorded on May 22. Bitcoin dominance has slipped from its June 22 high of just over 66% and now stands a bit above 65%. This figure reflects bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the entire crypto market. Currently, bitcoin boasts a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Today's major economic event is the release of the U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 110,000 last month, the smallest gain in four months and a slowdown from May’s increase of 139,000. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.3%, up from 4.2%. If this figure materializes, it would be the highest unemployment rate since October 2021. Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate has held within a tight range between 4% and 4.2%. The report comes a day early because of the July 4 holiday weekend, which is likely to see reduced trading volumes. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close at 1 p.m. today and bond markets at 2 p.m. Markets will remain closed on Friday, July 4. Ahead of the release, markets were pricing in a 75% chance that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.50% during its meeting scheduled for July 30. “On-chain flows remain stable, suggesting that major players are awaiting further signals from this week’s Non-Farm Payrolls and Initial Jobless Claims data,"" HTX Research wrote. ""Structurally, the market is navigating between two potential scenarios."" If labor data weakens, a confirmed September rate cut could ignite a renewed rally in BTC, HTX said. On the other hand, if NFP surprises to the upside, a break below $104,000 could trigger a technical correction. ""Overall, bitcoin now finds itself at a crucial inflection point, shaped by renewed capital inflows, rising speculative interest, and diverging macroeconomic expectations. The coming days could prove pivotal for confirming the next major trend in the market"". Stay alert!

The rally accelerated Wednesday following an announcement from fund manager Bitwise, which is rolling out a NEAR exchange-traded product (ETP) for institutional investors in Europe. Daily trading volume doubled over the past 24 hours, hitting $213 million as traders attempt to ride the coattails of NEAR's recent positive shift in sentiment. “The NEAR Staking ETP on Xetra opens a new bridge to NEAR for institutions by providing a regulated, exchange-traded way to earn staking rewards,"" Near Protocol CEO Illia Polosukhin told CoinDesk. NEAR's move also reflects broader altcoin market strength, with the CoinDesk DeFi Select Index rising by 7.74% in the past 24 hours and CoinDesk's memecoin index is up by 13.2% in the same period. Memecoins BONK and WIF are leading the pack, up 21% and 15% respectively on Thursday. Derivatives Positioning DOGE, LTC, XMR have seen the biggest increases in open interest in perpetuals listed on offshore exchanges. BTC, XRP perpetual futures open interest has jumped over 5% in 24 hours, validating the spot price rise. TRX and BCH continue to see a bias for shorts, as evidenced by the negative funding rates. Meanwhile, funding rates for XMR have surged to an annualized 40%, signifying potential overcrowding of long positions. Block option flows on Deribit featured bull put spreads in BTC — a net credit strategy that profits from price rise or consolidation.

In other words, the bar of negative expectations has been set low and the market may react violently if the data does show job losses. Weaker labor market data will likely strengthen the chance of Fed rate cuts, breeding bullish bitcoin volatility.

2025-07-03T11:10:12,"NASDAQ listed DeFi company expands in the Middle East, UAE","DeFi Technologies, a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance, has expanded its operation into the GCC and MENA region. The registration of DEFI DMCC includes offices in Jumeirah Lake Towers, Dubai, as the company seeks to offer digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) through its subsidiary, Valour, which has also opened a trading desk at the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) in the UAE. As per the press release, the DeFi Technologies team and its subsidiary Valour, aim to support the increased institutional interest in digital assets in the GCC region and specifically in the UAE. As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy. This includes Valour , which offers access to more than 65 of the world’s most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs with plans to offer 100 by the end of 2025. Growth of digital assets ETP products Globally, and regionally institutional investors and their capital are entering into the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The UAE is no exception as recently UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announced it expanded its position in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF showcasing the latest example of institutions increasingly turning to non-traditional exposures wrapped in an ETF. Investors who are interested in crypto but want to utilize traditional financial tools, are gravitating towards Bitcoin ETPs. This month in July 2024, Bitcoin ETFs witnessed strong inflows totaling 18,476 BTC, while Ethereum ETFs recorded 93,427 ETH inflows in the same week, this shows the increased appetite from institutional investors towards crypto wrapped in regulated financial instruments. Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour, stated, “We believe the demand for digital asset ETPs will increase not only globally but in the GCC and Middle East. Investors whether sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, family offices and even retail investors are interested in crypto but require familiar and efficient vehicles to get exposure.” He added that when wrapping digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated financial instruments, it increases the number of crypto investors. He believes this will allow countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia to access international foreign investment through locally listed digital asset ETPs, ETFs on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, the Dubai Financial Markets and others. DeFi Technologies expanded into Turkey and Africa DeFi Technologies has already expanded into Turkey through a collaboration with Misyon Bank, and Misyon Kripto to introduce ETPs . In Turkey currently over 50% of investor population are holding digital assets. In 2024, DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour partnered with GulfCap Investment Bank (“GCIB”), a licensed investment bank as its key Transaction Advisor for the proposed cross-listing of Valour’s ETPs on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) in Kenya.

2025-07-03T11:00:05,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Crashes Below $101,000 As US Airstrikes Send Shockwaves Across Markets","Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,979 after US President Donald Trump announced that the United States conducted successful strikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $102,700. Bitcoin (BTC) Slumps As US Strikes Key Sites In Iran US President Donald Trump announced that the United States had conducted successful airstrikes targeting key nuclear installations in Iran. Markets plunged after the announcement, with BTC dropping to a low of $100,979 as traders panicked. Trump took to Truth Social to state, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. A full payload was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is no other military in the world that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” Bitwise CEO Believes US Treasuries Are Bitcoin’s Primary Rival Bitcoin has taken a key yet controversial role in global finance, competing with traditional and newer stores of value. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared his views about the flagship cryptocurrency, stating that he believes that rather than gold, Bitcoin’s main competition is US Treasuries and other government bonds. Horsley called them the ultimate store of value, stating, “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition will end up being gold. Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being US Treasuries and other government bonds, the ultimate political stores of value.” Horsley explained that while gold and Bitcoin offer different levels of volatility, both attract investors looking for alternatives to traditional monetary assets. Horsley also outlined differences between institutional and individual investors. He noted that for individual investors, real estate was the primary store of value, questioning if residential real estate could be the true total addressable market for Bitcoin, moving the comparison from financial instruments to tangible wealth preservation assets. He also highlighted the evolving obstacles for Bitcoin investments, stating, “It used to be that ‘regulatory uncertainty’ was Bitcoin’s biggest obstacle for investors. This is no longer the case in 2025, which is a huge unlock. Its impact still hasn’t fully manifested.” Michael Saylor Doubles Down On Bitcoin Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-term value despite global tensions and uncertainty. Speaking at the keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event, Saylor predicted BTC could reach $21 million in 21 years. “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It's a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million.” Saylor made a similar, albeit more conservative prediction at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he said the flagship cryptocurrency would hit $13 million by 2045. Saylor stated that his bullishness on Bitcoin is based on several geopolitical, regulatory, and adoption developments. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this.” He also said he was always bullish on the asset, even when it plunged to $16,000 during the last crypto winter. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn't think we'd get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn't think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $100,979 as market sentiment plunged after the US entered the Israel-Iran conflict, conducting airstrikes on key nuclear sites in Iran. Expectations of a recovery after Friday’s decline were further dampened, as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to regain key levels. Market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, with traders wary of possible US involvement in the escalating situation in the Middle East. BTC’s latest decline was triggered by Israel’s attack on Iran, which led to over $450 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours, compared to $60 million in short positions. According to an analyst from CryptoQuant, the liquidation was a “cleansing of latecomers chasing the rally.” “Historically, BTC has shown bullish tendencies following rate stabilization, especially when paired with signs of liquidation exhaustion and fading open interest.” BTC started trading in positive territory the previous week, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to a low of $108,325 before recovering to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826.

2025-07-03T11:00:05,"Capo Of Crypto Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000, Doom Call For Altcoins","Crypto analyst Capo of Crypto, who is currently one of the most recognizeable names in crypto spaces on social media, has sounded a warning for the market. The analyst has completely dismissed the current trajectory of the Bitcoin price and, by extension, the altcoin market, calling for only a short-lived rally. His analysis points to a Bitcoin price crash, but the most impact is expected to be felt by the altcoin market as they tumble further. Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000 In the post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Capo of Crypto shares a rather bearish thesis that suggests that the current strength in Bitcoin won’t last. He points out that the Bitcoin price hasn’t bottomed yet and that the capitulation event is yet to happen. Related Reading: XRP Roadmap To $8.5: Why The Next Impulse Could Start Soon A capitulation event is a time in the market when prices are falling, triggering panic among investors. This panic leads to further selling as investors become scared that prices will keep crashing, and this leads to deeper losses in the market. An example of a capitulation event is the FTX market crash, when the Bitcoin price fell by more than 60% in a matter of months. The crypto analyst predicts that the Bitcoin price will actually fall further, first below $100,000. Once this psychological level is broken, he sees the price heading for the $92,000 to $93,000 territory. However, he doesn’t expect the crash to end there as capitulation events often lead to deeper losses. He explains that if Bitcoin does fall below the $92,000-$93,000 support, then the market should expect to see prices as low as $60,000-$70,000. Altcoins To Get Decimated With the Bitcoin price expected to crash so hard, the effect on the altcoin market will be even more profound. Over the last few months, 10% dips in the Bitcoin price have translated to around 20-30% dips in altcoin prices. Therefore, a nearly 50% crash in the Bitcoin price would be disastrous for altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance Capo of Crypto actually expects altcoins to crash harder, predicting that they will fall another 50-80% if his idea of the market does play out. This could put the altcoin market on a path to new lows not seen in the last five years, and could be the worst bear market in recent history. This is not the first time that Capo has warned the community of an impending crash. Back in May, when the Bitcoin price was hitting new all-time highs, the analyst had warned that the market could reverse its gains. On May 15, he posted a picture of a Black Swan, suggesting that prices could crash. Since then, most altcoins have reversed their gains, with only Bitcoin managing to maintain most of its gains from that time period.

2025-07-03T10:45:12,"Law Firm Sues Michael Saylor’s Strategy Over Misleading Bitcoin Claims","New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy. Key Takeaways: Pomerantz filed a class action accusing Strategy of misleading investors about bitcoin risks. The lawsuit centers on Strategy’s failure to disclose the impact of new fair value accounting rules. Strategy revealed $5.9 billion in unrealized losses, causing an 8% stock drop in Q1 2025. The complaint, lodged in the Eastern District Court of Virginia , represents Strategy shareholders who purchased stock between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025. Investors have until July 15 to join the case. According to Pomerantz, Strategy overstated the benefits of its Bitcoin treasury strategy and downplayed the volatility and risks inherent to large-scale Bitcoin holdings. Lawsuit Alleges Strategy Misled Investors With Rosy Bitcoin Claims The lawsuit claims the company’s public statements were “materially false and misleading,” creating a distorted picture of financial performance that failed to prepare investors for potential losses. A key issue centers on Strategy’s adoption of new accounting rules under ASU 2023-08, which require fair value accounting for crypto assets. Unlike the previous cost-less-impairment method, where Bitcoin was only written down when prices fell and gains were recognized only upon sale, the new standard forces companies to mark assets to market prices each quarter. Pomerantz alleges Strategy did not properly explain how these changes could impact its financial results, leaving investors in the dark about the potential for substantial unrealized losses. ""Strategy is a ponzi scheme!!"" Saylor’s savage reply: pic.twitter.com/401E56m5iY — Alex (@AlexesNakamoto) June 11, 2025 The complaint highlights Strategy’s first-quarter 2025 earnings, in which the firm disclosed $5.9 billion in unrealized losses due to adopting the fair value accounting model. That revelation triggered an 8% drop in Strategy’s stock price, underscoring the volatility risks the lawsuit says were previously glossed over. Since shifting its corporate focus to bitcoin accumulation in 2020, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has become the largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies, amassing 597,325 BTC. The strategy has fueled explosive gains in its share price, which has climbed more than 3,300% over the past five years. That meteoric rise inspired several other firms, including Metaplanet, to emulate its Bitcoin-centric approach . Legendary Short-Seller Slams Bitcoin Treasuries as ‘Financial Gibberish’ Last month, legendary short-seller Jim Chanos criticized the business model popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, calling its approach “financial gibberish.” Chanos noted that Strategy’s market capitalization now tops $100 billion, nearly double the roughly $60 billion worth of Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. Saylor has defended Strategy’s valuation, arguing that the company’s ability to raise capital at a premium effectively renders its strategy “risk-free.” Chanos, however, rejected that logic outright. “There’s a wonderful sales job that’s being done about the fact that this is an economic engine in and of itself,” he said. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, has also voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms, warning that aggressive BTC accumulation could ultimately hurt shareholders.

2025-07-03T10:32:25,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 3, 2025","The crypto market is up today, after several days of trending mildly downwards. Nearly all of the top 100 coins per market cap have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has remained unchanged at $3.47 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $120 billion, the highest it’s been in days. TLDR: The crypto has shifted upwards, with dog-themed memecoins performing the best in both the top 10 and the top 100 categories; BTC surpassed the $109,500 level, moving closer to the ATH; ETH is the day’s second-best performer among the top 10; BTC supply in profit jumped from 87% to 98% in the last week of June; With elevated levels of profit comes elevated market volatility; US spot BTC ETFs continued positive flow streak, spot ETH ETFs saw outflows; “Any pull‑backs are more likely to be healthy consolidations than the start of a deeper reversal.” Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices appreciate today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 2.3%, surpassing the $108,000 territory and now standing at $109,515. Ethereum (ETH) has recorded the second-highest increase in the category of 6.1%, currently changing hands at $2,600. The best performer is Dogecoin (DOGE) , with an increase of 7.8% to the price of $0.1742. At the same time, the smallest increase is Binance Coin (BNB)’s 0.8% to $661. Eight of the top 100 coins saw double-digit increases. The highest among these is Bonk (BONK)’s 20.8%, trading at $0.00001738. Yesterday’s best performer, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , fell the most: 2.2% to $0.01533. Recently, BONK announced that it’s nearing 1 million onchain holders, a milestone that will trigger the burn of 1 trillion BONK.

Arthur Hayes @CryptoHayes predicts Bitcoin will dip to $90K before rebounding on a flood of liquidity from US bank-issued stablecoins. #ArthurHayes #BitcoinPrediction https://t.co/9tk8DoJgCZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 3, 2025 The market uptick follows another increase in investor interest in the space. Notably, when it comes to UK pension funds, Cartwright Pension Trusts launched an “Annual Bitcoin Review” for its institutional clients . This came after a significant discussion prompted by the company’s revelation a client had allocated 3% of their fund to BTC in November 2024 and had posted a 60% return since. ‘With Elevated Profit Levels Comes Increased Market Volatility’ Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , noted that “Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics continue to showcase the strength of its current market position.” Per Glassnode data, BTC supply in profit jumped from 87% to 98% between 22 June and 29 June. “This is significant and reinforces just how bullish recent momentum has been,” Chait says. He continues: “With these elevated levels of profit, there often also comes a familiar pattern with digital assets: increased market volatility. Historically, when such a high percentage of supply sits in profit, the chances of profit-taking rise. That, in turn, introduces short-term market movements even when there is a broadly optimistic outlook.” Glassnode notes that distribution remains muted, and “investors are holding through.” As $BTC rebounds to $107k, most holders are back into profit. But distribution remains muted – investors are holding through. Realized profits decline, LTH supply hits ATH, and ETF inflows stay strong.

Regardless, this behavior is more a marker of a healthy, maturing market and shows Bitcoin’s growing alignment with secure and long-lasting investments that can handle global shocks while also attracting high levels of capital,” Chait concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $109,515. Over the past day, the coin has seen a steady increase from the daily low of $106,925. Resistance levels now stand at $109,764 and $110,809. Should it surpass both, BTC could break its ATH. At the same time, the current support level stands at $108,600. Bitcoin Price Chart.

Notably, the crypto market sentiment jumped today. Even though it’s still moving within neutral territory, the Fear and Greed Index surged from 46 yesterday to 54 today . The sentiment dipped briefly towards the fear territory, but the overall optimism seems to be renewed today. That said, investors are awaiting further signals.

On 2 July, they recorded inflows of $407.78 million in outflows. Most ETFs saw positive flows today, led by Fidelity’s $183.96 million. The day’s amount has brought the cumulative total net inflow to $49.04 billion. However, US ETH ETFs recorded outflows today of $1.82 million . While Grayscale , Fidelity , Bitwise , and VanEck saw positive flow, BlackRock lost $46.89 million. Notably, the first Solana staking ETF in the United States, the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF , launched Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange . It ended the day strong , with $12 million in inflows and $33 million in volume. $SSK ended day with $33m in volume.

The plot thickens. Upper level of SEC telling $GDLC it can't launch until otherwise notified. Not sure why, no other info than this letter. My guess tho: They want to issue the crypto ETP listing standards before any '33 act spot ETFs hit market with these other coins. So likely… https://t.co/Za7rYk1o0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 2, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has increased over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market saw another day of mixed performance on Wednesday. For example, the S&P 500 increased by 0.47%, the Nasdaq-100 went up by 0.73%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.024%. This comes ahead of the US jobs report investors are waiting to see released on Thursday. They’re also keeping an eye on trade and US budget bill discussions. Is this rally sustainable? This current uptick may not be long-lasting and may be interrupted by short-term drops, depending on the outside factors pushing down on the market.

While Chrome is being targeted through a dangerous zero-day vulnerability, Firefox users are under attack from a slew of harmful browser extensions . On July 1, cybersecurity experts uncovered a malicious campaign involving 45 fake Firefox extensions designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet details from unsuspecting users. Malicious Firefox Extensions Mimicking Crypto Wallets The 45 malicious Firefox extensions impersonate legitimate crypto wallet tools from widely used platforms such as Coinbase, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Phantom, Exodus, OKX, Keplr, MyMonero, Bitget, Leap, Ethereum Wallet, and Filfox. A security researcher at Koi Security, Yuval Ronen, reported on Wednesday that these extensions steal users’ wallet secrets and credentials. The linkage to discover the fake extensions was made through a meticulous effort to discover shared TTPs and infrastructure. This campaign has been active since April 2025 and is still evolving to discover further harmful activities in the browser. How Was This done The first step in the destructive move was to gain trust through ratings, reviews, branding, and functionality, which makes the extension appear widely adopted and well reviewed. After gaining trust, they used identical names and logos to impersonate the real services with visual similarities to deceive the users. In cases of open source, extensions cloned the real codebase and inserted their own malicious logic, creating extensions that behaved as expected by secretly stealing personal data. “The extensions extract wallet credentials directly from the targeted websites and exfiltrate them to a remote server controlled by the attacker. During initialization, they also transmit the victim’s external IP address, likely for tracking or targeting purposes,” said Koi Security. [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] Surge of Crypto Hacks in 2025 In May 2025, Coinbase Global announced that hackers obtained personal information, putting more than 70,000 customers at risk of attacks and extortion. Many global agencies, such as OFAC and FATF, have addressed various issues related to crypto hacks; however, despite the growing awareness, millions of individuals still fall victim to these crypto kidnappings. Risk Mitigation Steps Recommendations by Koi Security Install extensions only from verified publishers Treat browser extensions as full software assets Use an extension that allows and restricts installation to validated extensions only Timely monitoring to detect ownership transfers and other signs of compromise over time. To defend against the employees who unknowingly downloaded the malicious extensions for Firefox, these steps are to be followed, as recommended by Koi Security researcher, Ronen.

2025-07-03T10:31:26,"IMF Rejects Pakistan’s Proposal to Subsidize Power for Bitcoin Mining: Reports","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected Pakistan’s repeated proposals to provide subsidized electricity to bitcoin (BTC) mining and other energy-intensive industries, according to reports . Secretary of Power Dr. Fakhray Alam Irfan said that the IMF was concerned about market distortions in a session with the Senate Standing Committee on Power on Thursday. The government had planned to allocate 2,000 megawatts from its 7,000 MW electricity surplus to crypto mining at rates of 23-24 pakistani rupee ($0.08) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). However, the IMF remained unconvinced, warning that such incentives resemble tax holidays that often undermine market efficiency. The IMF questioned how the government would transition the subsidized electricity back to market rates and argued that similar concessions had failed to deliver results in the past. Originally pitched in September 2024 as a six-month marginal cost tariff package, the plan was scaled back to three months under IMF pressure. A follow-up targeted subsidy proposal in November was also rejected. Dr. Irfan added that the government were still in talks with international institutions to refine the plan. Pakistan's government unveiled plans to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve and support BTC mining in May inspired by the plans of President Donald Trump's administration in the U.S. The country’s Minister of State for Blockchain and Crypto cited the possibilities of giving the 100 million unbanked Pakistanis the tools for saving and investment as a motivation for the government's plans. ""We want them to break their economic classes. And I really believe that crypto and blockchain can help us take that quantum leap,” Bin Saqib said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

2025-07-03T10:30:11,"US Stock Market Resilience: Nasdaq Gains Amidst Mixed Close","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Resilience: Nasdaq Gains Amidst Mixed Close In the dynamic world of finance, where every tick can send ripples across global markets, even the seemingly traditional US stock market can offer surprising insights for crypto enthusiasts. Recently, the three major U.S. indices concluded trading with a distinctly mixed performance, a scenario that often leaves investors pondering the broader implications. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq celebrated modest gains, the venerable Dow Jones saw a fractional dip, painting a complex picture of current market performance. For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these traditional market movements isn’t just an academic exercise; it’s a crucial component of informed decision-making. Understanding the Mixed US Stock Market Close The recent close of the US stock market showcased a fascinating divergence among its key indices. This isn’t just a statistical anomaly; it’s a reflection of underlying sector strengths and investor sentiment. For those tracking the highly volatile crypto space, understanding these traditional market movements is crucial, as they often serve as leading or lagging indicators for digital assets. Here’s a quick snapshot of how the major indices performed: Index Performance S&P 500 +0.47% Nasdaq Composite +0.73% Dow Jones Industrial Average -0.02% The Driving Force Behind Nasdaq Gains: What Does It Signal? The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the charge with a commendable +0.73% gain . This strong showing often signals robust investor confidence in growth sectors, particularly technology and innovation. Companies that rely on future earnings potential, rather than immediate dividends, tend to thrive in such an environment. This resilience in tech stocks can be a powerful indicator for the broader appetite for risk in the market. What does this mean for crypto? Given that many cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects are inherently tied to technological advancements and disruptive innovation, a buoyant Nasdaq can often create a favorable backdrop. It suggests a broader appetite for risk and a belief in the power of future-oriented assets. Think of it as a rising tide that might just lift some crypto boats, especially those in the DeFi, NFT, or metaverse sectors that mirror the growth-stock ethos of the Nasdaq. S&P 500’s Steady Climb: A Barometer for Broader Market Sentiment? The S&P 500, often considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities, also posted a respectable gain of +0.47% . Its positive movement indicates a generally healthy underlying market sentiment, extending beyond just the tech giants. This index encompasses a wide range of industries, from consumer discretionary to healthcare and financials. When the S&P 500 is up, it suggests that economic optimism is somewhat pervasive, even if not universally distributed. This broad-based strength can provide a foundational sense of security in the wider financial ecosystem, potentially reducing systemic risk concerns that could otherwise spill over into the more speculative crypto markets. It’s a sign that the traditional financial engine is humming along, providing a backdrop of relative stability. Decoding the Dow Jones’ Fractional Dip: A Hint of Caution? In contrast to its counterparts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered a marginal dip of -0.02% . While seemingly insignificant, this slight decline in an index dominated by established, blue-chip companies can offer subtle clues. The Dow represents the ‘old economy’ stalwarts – industrial giants, financial institutions, and consumer staples. A slight pullback here could indicate caution among investors regarding traditional sectors, perhaps due to rising input costs, supply chain disruptions, or concerns about slower economic growth in specific areas. For crypto, this might suggest a subtle rotation of capital away from ‘safe’ traditional assets towards growth-oriented ones, or simply a momentary pause as investors re-evaluate. It’s a reminder that even in a generally positive market, not all sectors move in lockstep. Navigating Market Performance: What It Means for Crypto Investors The mixed bag of results across the major indices underscores a complex financial landscape. While the positive momentum in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 might foster a risk-on environment, potentially benefiting crypto, the Dow’s slight decline suggests underlying caution in certain traditional sectors. This nuanced market performance requires a keen eye from crypto investors. Challenges and Opportunities Increasing Correlation: One significant challenge is the growing correlation between traditional markets and crypto, especially Bitcoin. When the stock market faces significant downturns, crypto often follows suit, albeit with higher volatility. The mixed signals mean investors must remain vigilant, as sudden shifts in sentiment could quickly impact digital asset valuations. Capital Flow to Innovation: Conversely, the strength in tech-heavy indices can be a significant opportunity. It suggests capital is flowing into innovation, a core tenet of the crypto space. This environment might favor projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and a focus on long-term technological development. Investors might find opportunities in sectors like Web3 gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), or enterprise blockchain solutions that align with the broader tech growth narrative. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the intricate dance between traditional and digital markets, here are some actionable insights: Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, spanning different crypto assets and even traditional investments, can help mitigate risks during periods of uncertainty. Monitor Macroeconomic Trends: Keep a close eye on inflation reports, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events. These factors significantly influence both stock and crypto markets, often dictating the broader market sentiment. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto remains highly volatile. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your personal risk appetite and financial goals. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Continuous learning about market dynamics, both traditional and digital, is your best defense against unexpected swings. Knowledge empowers you to make proactive, rather than reactive, decisions. The recent mixed close of the US stock market is more than just a daily blip; it’s a window into the complex interplay of economic forces shaping our financial future. While Nasdaq gains signal a continued appetite for innovation and growth, the broader picture from the S&P 500 and Dow Jones reminds us of the underlying currents of caution and sector-specific challenges. For crypto investors, this mixed market performance serves as a vital reminder: the world of digital assets doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Its trajectory is increasingly intertwined with the broader global economy. By understanding these traditional market signals, you can make more informed decisions, navigate volatility with greater confidence, and position yourself for long-term success in the ever-evolving financial landscape.

2025-07-03T10:27:48,"Биткоин подает редкий сигнал, который может спровоцировать падение ниже $40 000","Биткоин (BTC) недавно закрыл июньскую месячную свечу выше отметки в $100 000, что вселило надежды быков на дальнейший рост в течение лета. Однако цифровой актив сейчас подал редкий сигнал, предупреждающий о значительной коррекции цены в ближайшие месяцы. Биткоин подает редкий медвежий сигнал По данным недавнего поста в социальной сети от опытного криптоаналитика Али Мартинеса, Биткоин активировал сигнал к продаже по индикатору Tom Demark (TD) Sequential на квартальном графике. Мартинес отметил, что это редкий и исторически надежный предупреждающий сигнал, который часто предшествовал крупным снижением криптовалюты. Напомним, что ежеквартальный сигнал на продажу представляет собой редкий технический индикатор, который появляется после нескольких последовательных бычьих квартальных свечей, сигнализируя об исчерпании долгосрочного тренда. Это говорит о том, что Биткоин может столкнуться со значительной коррекцией после продолжительного восходящего тренда. В 2015 году за его появлением последовало 75%-ное снижение курса BTC, в то время как в 2018 году аналогичный сигнал предшествовал 85%-ному обвалу. Мартинес предупредил, что если текущий сигнал сработает аналогичным образом, BTC может упасть до $40 000 долларов – потенциальное падение на 64% по сравнению с текущими уровнями. Однако не все аналитики разделяют этот медвежий прогноз. Коллега-криптоаналитик CryptoGoos расценил закрытие квартала Биткоина как бычье. Он оспорил сравнение с моделью двойной вершины 2021 года и предположил, что структура рынка остается сильной. Криптоаналитик CryptoGoos отклонил последнее закрытие квартала, назвав его паттерном двойной вершины | Источник: CryptoGoos BTC готовится к покорению новой вершины? Несмотря на медвежий сигнал на последовательную продажу TD, некоторые аналитики по-прежнему уверены, что на горизонте виден новый исторический максимум (ATH). Аналитик Джелле отметил, что BTC пробил и успешно повторно протестировал 3-дневный бычий тренд, что делает его похожим на “готовый к взлету”. Источник: Джелле (Jelle) В другом посте Джелле отметил, что если BTC решительно преодолеет отметку в $110 000, его следующей целью может стать $130 000. Для справки, текущий ATH BTC составляет $111 814, зафиксированный 22 мая. Bitcoin Hyper укрепляет позиции в сегменте мем-валют: предпродажа привлекла более $1,8 млн Bitcoin растет на фоне последних заявлений Дональда Трампа о его “Большом прекрасном законопроекте” – масштабном предложении по налогообложению и расходам, которое ставит экономический рост выше финансовой сдержанности. В недавнем посте в Truth Social он заявил, что экономический рост “увеличится в 10 раз”, что вновь вызвало опасения по поводу роста государственного долга и инфляции. Как следствие, это подтолкнуло инвесторов к $BTC в качестве средства защиты. Это отличная новость для Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , нового альткоина, который обещает улучшить блокчейн Bitcoin благодаря совместимости с dApp и смарт-контрактами через совершенно новую цепь Layer-2. Учитывая, что один HYPER стоит всего $0,012075, вы можете стать частью возрождения развития сети Bitcoin, поскольку предпродажа проекта привлекла уже более $1,8 млн. В четвертом квартале 2025 года ожидается выпуск набора “инструментов разработчика” Bitcoin Hyper, который позволит создавать площадки от кредитных платформ до Web3-игр, оставаясь при этом подвязанным к основному банку Bitcoin для дополнительной безопасности. 30% от общего объема $HYPER зарезервировано на дальнейшее развитие, что обещает регулярные обновления и инновации по мере роста экосистемы. Не удивительно, что крупные инвесторы уже видят в нем долгосрочный потенциал: недавно трое “китов” вложили $74,9 тыс., $54,1 тыс. и $53,9 тыс.в $HYPER.

2025-07-03T10:22:08,"Bullish Expert Tom Lee Explains Why Bitcoin Could Not Rise!","Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee, known for his bold predictions for Bitcoin (BTC), made new statements about Bitcoin. He actually answered the question that everyone was wondering about and explained why Bitcoin could not rise despite the rapidly increasing institutional demand. Starting his words by stating that US spot Bitcoin ETFs are one of the most successful ETF launches in history, Tom Lee said that ETFs have seen strong inflows recently. Stating that this means that there is unprecedented demand for Bitcoin, Lee stated that despite this demand, the BTC price did not rise and did not meet expectations. At this point, the veteran name argued that one of the reasons behind the price stagnation in Bitcoin is related to how these ETFs are purchased. Lee noted that some of the corporate entries were not made in the form of new purchases from outside, but through the so-called “in-kind” transfer method. According to Yni Lee, the inflows into ETFs were not made by purchasing new BTC, but by investors who already owned Bitcoin transferring their assets from their cold wallets to the Bitcoin ETF manager's wallet. Since these transactions do not create new buying pressure on Bitcoin, they do not push the price up. “I see this process in Bitcoin as a kind of neutral transfer. Since no new Bitcoins are being purchased and existing BTCs are being moved, it does not have a significant impact on the price. Because the price of Bitcoin follows a simple demand-supply mechanism.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-03T10:20:17,"Jerome Powell Under Fire: Donald Trump Demands Immediate Resignation","BitcoinWorld Jerome Powell Under Fire: Donald Trump Demands Immediate Resignation The financial world, and indeed the cryptocurrency community, was jolted by a terse but impactful report from Walter Bloomberg on X: U.S. President Donald Trump has called for U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to resign immediately. This sudden and emphatic demand sends ripples across global markets, raising critical questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and the future trajectory of U.S. monetary policy . For those invested in digital assets, understanding the potential ramifications of such high-level political pressure on central banking is paramount, as it could significantly influence the broader crypto market impact . Understanding the Demand: Why Donald Trump Targets Jerome Powell Donald Trump’s call for Jerome Powell’s immediate resignation is not an isolated incident but rather the latest salvo in a long-standing public disagreement. Throughout his presidency, Trump frequently criticized Powell and the Federal Reserve, primarily over interest rate decisions and their perceived impact on economic growth. The core of Trump’s argument often revolved around the idea that the Fed’s policies were too restrictive, hindering his administration’s economic agenda. Who is Jerome Powell? Chairman of the Federal Reserve: Appointed by Donald Trump in 2018, he is the head of the U.S. central banking system. Key Responsibilities: Oversees the nation’s monetary policy, supervises and regulates banks, and maintains financial stability. Economic Philosophy: Generally seen as a pragmatic centrist, balancing inflation control with employment goals. Trump’s past criticisms have ranged from accusations that the Fed was raising interest rates too quickly, thereby strengthening the dollar and making U.S. exports less competitive, to claims that the central bank was deliberately undermining his economic achievements. This recent demand underscores the persistent tension between political leadership and the ostensibly independent institution responsible for managing the nation’s money supply. The Federal Reserve’s Role and Monetary Policy Under Scrutiny The Federal Reserve operates with a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (low and stable inflation). To fulfill these goals, the Fed employs various tools, collectively known as monetary policy : Interest Rate Adjustments: Raising or lowering the federal funds rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Tightening (QT): Buying or selling government bonds and other securities to inject or withdraw liquidity from the financial system. Bank Supervision: Regulating financial institutions to ensure stability. Trump’s frustration with Powell often stemmed from the Fed’s post-pandemic interest rate hikes, which were implemented to combat soaring inflation. While these measures were broadly seen by economists as necessary to cool an overheating economy, they also led to increased borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth – a trade-off that Trump consistently opposed. Key Criticisms Leveled Against Powell’s Fed Criticism Area Trump’s Stance Fed’s Rationale Interest Rate Hikes Too aggressive, hurting economic growth, making U.S. exports expensive. Necessary to combat high inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. Balance Sheet Reduction (QT) Draining liquidity from the market, tightening financial conditions. Normalizing the balance sheet after pandemic-era expansion, reducing inflation. Economic Slowdown Fed policies were a primary cause of any economic deceleration. Monetary policy acts with a lag; other factors (global supply chains, fiscal policy) also influence growth. Is Federal Reserve Independence at Risk? A Historical Perspective The independence of the Federal Reserve is a cornerstone of its effectiveness. By insulating monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, the Fed can make difficult, long-term economic choices that might be unpopular but are ultimately beneficial for the nation’s financial stability. This independence is not explicitly granted by law but has evolved through tradition and practice since the Fed’s inception in 1913. Historically, presidents have often voiced their opinions on Fed policy, but outright demands for a chairman’s resignation are rare and highly controversial. Such demands can undermine market confidence by suggesting that monetary policy might become politicized, leading to unpredictable economic outcomes. The challenge here lies in balancing democratic accountability with the need for an expert-driven, non-partisan approach to economic management. Decoding the Crypto Market Impact of Political Pressure and Monetary Shifts For cryptocurrency investors, the actions and rhetoric surrounding the Federal Reserve are incredibly important. The Fed’s monetary policy decisions have a profound crypto market impact because they influence the broader economic environment, liquidity, and investor risk appetite. Here’s how: Interest Rates and Risk Assets: Higher interest rates typically make traditional, less risky investments (like government bonds) more attractive. This can draw capital away from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to price declines. Conversely, lower rates can encourage investment in crypto as investors seek higher returns. Liquidity and Quantitative Easing/Tightening: When the Fed engages in quantitative easing, it injects liquidity into the financial system, which can flow into various assets, including crypto. Quantitative tightening, on the other hand, removes liquidity, potentially creating headwinds for digital assets. Inflation and Hedging Narratives: For many, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen as a hedge against inflation, particularly when central banks print more money. If political pressure leads to policies perceived as inflationary (e.g., reluctance to raise rates despite high inflation), the ‘digital gold’ narrative for Bitcoin could strengthen. Dollar Strength: Fed policy influences the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can make dollar-denominated assets (like Bitcoin, often priced in USD) less attractive to international investors, while a weaker dollar might make them more appealing. A scenario where Jerome Powell resigns or is forced out could introduce significant uncertainty. A new Fed chair might pursue a different monetary policy path, potentially leading to shifts in interest rate expectations or liquidity conditions, which would directly affect the crypto market’s volatility and direction. The perception of political interference in the Federal Reserve could also erode investor confidence in traditional markets, potentially pushing some investors towards decentralized alternatives. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the ongoing political discourse surrounding the Federal Reserve and its chairman, how can crypto investors best position themselves? Understanding the dynamics at play is crucial: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Pay close attention to inflation reports, employment data, and GDP figures. These are the primary drivers of the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Follow Fed Communications: Speeches by Fed officials, FOMC meeting minutes, and interest rate announcements provide direct insight into their thinking and future plans. Assess Risk Appetite: Understand that crypto remains a high-beta asset class. During periods of economic uncertainty or tighter monetary policy, overall market risk appetite tends to decrease, impacting crypto prices. Diversify and Manage Risk: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Set clear stop-loss orders. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions to political news can be sharp, the long-term fundamentals of blockchain technology and decentralized finance often remain robust. Focus on the underlying utility and adoption trends. The interplay between politics, central banking, and emerging digital assets is complex. Remaining informed and adaptive is key to navigating the evolving landscape. Conclusion: The Enduring Tension Between Politics and Economic Stability Donald Trump’s latest demand for Jerome Powell’s resignation highlights the enduring tension between political ambition and the pursuit of stable economic conditions. The independence of the Federal Reserve is a critical pillar of global financial stability, and any perceived threat to it can send shockwaves through traditional and digital markets alike. As monetary policy continues to be a central topic of debate, its profound crypto market impact cannot be overstated. Investors must remain vigilant, understanding that the decisions made in Washington and at the Fed directly influence the environment in which cryptocurrencies operate. The saga between Trump and Powell serves as a potent reminder of the interconnectedness of politics, economics, and the dynamic world of digital assets.

2025-07-03T10:14:30,"Trump-linked crypto ventures have added $620M to his net worth","Trump-related crypto ventures have reportedly added at least $620 million to his net worth in just a few months, powered by projects like World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin. However, US President Donald Trump’s net worth doesn’t look like it’s moved much since returning to the White House, as it stood $6.5 billion on Election Day and $6.4 billion today. The source of that wealth is transforming at warp speed, as behind the scenes, his family has quietly been building one of the most aggressive and lucrative crypto land grabs in modern financial history. Meanwhile, OFFICIAL TRUMP price has seen a dump of 20% over the last 30 days. Trumps pocket $390M from token sales According to a report, Licensing deals have long helped the Trump family monetize its name. This includes everything from real estate projects to perfume bottles and mattresses. However, crypto is allowing the Trumps to cash in faster and on a far larger scale. Real estate licensing brought in $34 million last year for the Trumps. This figure is too small in front of the money pouring in from token sales and digital asset firms that exist largely on the strength of the Trump name and MAGA brand. Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, has even said that “We have never been stronger.” The Trumps are going all-in on the digital asset boom. Since December, Eric and Don Jr. have been making the rounds at crypto events in Abu Dhabi, Washington, Dubai, and Las Vegas, turning political influence into digital currency hype. Back in the US, one of Trump’s more traditional assets, Trump National Doral in Miami, bagged a major win this January when it got the green light to build 1,500 luxury condos. This single move has increased the property’s estimated value from $350 million to $1.5 billion. Despite this, digital assets are the category that is delivering the flashiest surge to the Trumps. The most lucrative of these ventures is World Liberty Financial (WLF). This platform is offering both a Trump-branded token and a stablecoin called USD1 . Token sales have reportedly brought in $550 million, from which the Trump family has pocketed about $390 million. They also hold a massive stash of 22.5 billion World Liberty tokens, potentially worth over $2 billion. All these tokens are technically non-transferable for now. Trump family now owns 80% of TRUMP coin The report mentions that in June, the Trump family quietly reduced its stake in World Liberty from 60% to 40%. The details of the sale remain murky. Meanwhile, the USD1 stablecoin got a major push when Abu Dhabi’s MGX announced it was using the token to make a $2 billion investment in Binance. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao is now listed as a World Liberty adviser alongside Justin Sun and Bilal Bin Saqib. Meanwhile, CZ is seeking a presidential pardon after pleading guilty to US money-laundering charges. Data shows that USD1 holds $2.2 billion circulation, suggesting its reserves alone could bring in $100 million annually. On the other hand, Trump memecoin’s 80% of the supply is held by Trump-linked entities. Bloomberg estimates Trump’s stake is already worth $150 million. TRUMP price jumped by around 5% in the last 24 hours while it still remains down by 88% from its all time high of $75.34. TRUMP is trading at an average price of $9.04 with a trading volume of $269 million. To hype the memecoin, Trump hosted a private dinner for its top 220 holders in May at one of his golf clubs. Recently, Eric Trump revealed that WLF plans to amass a “substantial position” in the Trump token, linking the two projects more closely. However, American Bitcoin, a new venture spun out of a Trump-affiliated investment bank, is also gaining traction. In a merger deal, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 handed over nearly all of its mining equipment to the company. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Analysts eye a 26% rally, projecting a target high of $0.72 and an average price of $0.622 for July. A breakout above the $0.60 resistance could confirm the bullish setup. Adding strength to this bullish case, over $932 million in ADA has been withdrawn from exchanges YTD, a trend similar to the 2021 bull run accumulation phase. [post_titles_links postid=”478105″] What Could Trigger the Next ADA Rally? Cardano ETF Buzz : Grayscale has filed for the first U.S. Cardano ETF , with Bloomberg assigning it a 76% approval chance. If approved, it could unlock institutional capital and boost ADA visibility in the U.S. market. GDLC Fund Approval : The SEC approved Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) as a spot crypto ETF. The fund holds ADA alongside BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, giving Cardano passive exposure. DeFi Growth Potential : Charles Hoskinson proposed integrating the RLUSD stablecoin into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem for free. This could improve liquidity and attract new users. While the ADA price had a rocky June, sentiment may be shifting. If ETF optimism, DeFi integration, and market accumulation continue, Cardano could be poised for a breakout in July.

What The Lawsuit Says The lawsuit, filed in Virginia’s Eastern District Court , claims that Strategy misled investors between April 30, 2024, and April 4, 2025. According to the law firm, Strategy gave the impression that its Bitcoin investments were highly profitable, while hiding key risks like price volatility and changes in accounting rules. Pomerantz says both Strategy and its CEO, Michael Saylor, focused on positive results like BTC Yield and BTC Gain but didn’t talk about the real dangers, including the chance of major losses. The lawsuit says the company left out important details that investors needed to fully understand the risks involved. New Accounting Rules Exposed $5.9B Loss One big point in this case is the Strategy’s change to new crypto accounting rules known as ASU 2023-08. This new rule means companies must show the real-time value of their Bitcoin holdings, not just the cost minus past drops. Earlier, Strategy only showed losses when Bitcoin fell in price, but did not show gains until coins were sold. Under the new rule, it became clear that Strategy faced an unrealized loss of $5.9 billion in early 2025. However, this news caused the stock to fall over 8% in a short time, shocking many investors. Overall Strategy Bitcoin Holding Strategy has been a major player in the crypto space since 2020 and holds over 597,000 Bitcoins worth around ($65.85 billion, more than any other public company. Its stock has grown over 204% in the past 1 year, inspiring other firms like Metaplanet to follow its strategy.

In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions. Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC . Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . The sentiment has changed, and with market-wide optimism in early July, as the short-term EMA is breached and the XRP price is inching closer to retest the falling channel’s upper border aligned with a supply block near the key $2.40 resistance. This time, a break of the upper border could trigger a rally toward $2.80 in the short term, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. The first week of July’s momentum is backed by growing whale transaction count (>100K USD), rising exchange outflow, and spiked spot volume. It indicates a sustained short-term rally. In case, if no strong catalyst emerges to push beyond the pattern’s upper border and the $2.40 supply block, a flash crash could occur, pushing XRP’s price down. If selling pressure were to resume the $2.10 support, which aligns with the 200-day EMA is crucial, as losing grip at this mark could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market.

According to Finbold’s H1 2025 Crypto Market Report , the asset manager’s holdings surged from $54.77 billion on January 1 to $78.67 billion by June 30, a 30.38% gain. Bitcoin accounted for the bulk of the growth. BlackRock’s BTC holdings jumped from $51.16 billion to $74.47 billion, an increase of $23.3 billion, or 31.3%.

To back these products with real assets, BlackRock made substantial on-chain purchases of BTC and ETH throughout the first half of 2025. BlackRock’s Q1 crypto holdings By the end of Q1 2025, BlackRock held approximately 575,860 BTC and 1.17 million ETH, with a total crypto portfolio value of $49.85 billion. By June 30, its holdings had surged to $74.47 billion in BTC and $4.21 billion in ETH, pushing the portfolio’s total to $78.67 billion. That marks a $28.82 billion increase from Q1 to Q2 and a $23.91 billion gain across the first half of the year. While the $23.91 billion surge is publicly visible through on-chain data, it’s important to note that these figures reflect only the wallets linked to ETF custody.

2025-07-03T10:00:00,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Achieves Stunning Fee Revenue Victory Over S&P 500 Fund","BitcoinWorld BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Achieves Stunning Fee Revenue Victory Over S&P 500 Fund The financial world is abuzz with a remarkable development: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has not only made its mark but has astonishingly surpassed its long-established iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in annual fee revenue. This isn’t just a win; it’s a profound statement about the shifting landscape of investment and the undeniable ascent of digital assets. For anyone tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, this news is a powerful indicator of a new era of institutional interest and investor confidence in Bitcoin. How could a fund nearly nine times smaller in assets under management generate more income than its colossal counterpart? Let’s dive into this captivating financial phenomenon. The Astonishing Ascent of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: A Revenue Revolution It’s a tale of two titans, but with an unexpected twist. On one side, we have BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), a behemoth with a staggering amount of assets under management, representing a broad swathe of the American economy. On the other, the relatively nascent BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), launched just in January 2024. Yet, despite IVV being nearly nine times larger in assets, IBIT has managed to outshine it where it counts for the fund manager: annual fee revenue. According to Watcher Guru, IBIT, with its 0.25% expense ratio, has generated an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees. Compare this to IVV’s $187.1 million. This razor-thin difference, in favor of IBIT, speaks volumes. It’s a testament not just to the product’s design but to the underlying demand for its core asset – Bitcoin. This remarkable feat underscores the immense profitability potential when a new asset class meets enthusiastic investor adoption, even if the asset base is comparatively smaller. The higher expense ratio, though seemingly modest, compounds significantly when applied to consistent, robust inflows. What Drives IBIT’s Unprecedented Performance? The success of IBIT is not a mere fluke; it’s a reflection of several converging factors that highlight its impressive IBIT performance. The primary driver is unequivocally strong investor demand for Bitcoin exposure through a regulated, accessible vehicle. Here’s a breakdown: Ease of Access: For years, investing in Bitcoin directly presented hurdles for many traditional investors, including concerns about custody, security, and navigating unfamiliar crypto exchanges. ETFs like IBIT remove these barriers, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through their existing brokerage accounts, just like buying stocks or traditional ETFs. Institutional Trust: BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, brings an unparalleled level of credibility and trust. Its entry into the Bitcoin ETF space signaled to many institutional and retail investors that Bitcoin was maturing as an asset class, worthy of serious consideration. Consistent Inflows: Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has seen inflows in 17 of the past 18 months. This consistent accumulation of capital indicates sustained investor interest and confidence, rather than just a fleeting speculative wave. These continuous investments are the lifeblood of an ETF’s revenue generation, directly contributing to its fee income. Market Timing: The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs coincided with a renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market, fueled by anticipation of Bitcoin’s halving event and growing macroeconomic stability. This favorable market environment provided a fertile ground for IBIT’s rapid growth. Unlocking Bitcoin Exposure: A New Era for Investors For a long time, gaining Bitcoin exposure was a niche activity, largely confined to crypto-native platforms or complex direct purchases. The advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly one backed by a financial titan like BlackRock, has democratized access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This is a game-changer for several reasons: Diversification Made Easy: Traditional portfolios often seek diversification across various asset classes. Now, with a regulated ETF, investors can easily add Bitcoin to their holdings without the operational complexities of direct crypto ownership. Mainstream Integration: Bitcoin is no longer an exotic, fringe asset. Its inclusion in major investment platforms via ETFs signifies its integration into mainstream finance, making it more palatable for conservative investors and financial advisors. Liquidity and Transparency: ETFs offer superior liquidity compared to direct crypto holdings for many investors, allowing for easier buying and selling. They also provide a layer of transparency and regulatory oversight that can be reassuring. This ease of access is crucial for the continuous flow of capital into products like IBIT, directly impacting the impressive ETF fee revenue we are observing. Beyond AUM: The Significance of ETF Fee Revenue While Assets Under Management (AUM) is often the headline metric for funds, the fee revenue generated by an ETF is arguably more telling about its profitability and the value it brings to the fund manager. The fact that IBIT, with a fraction of IVV’s AUM, can generate comparable fee revenue is a powerful statement. This highlights: High Demand for Specific Exposure: Investors are willing to pay a slightly higher expense ratio for direct, regulated exposure to a high-growth, high-volatility asset like Bitcoin, rather than settling for lower-fee, broader market exposure. Profitability of Niche Markets: Even within a large fund family, a highly sought-after, specialized product can be a significant profit driver, proving that sometimes, quality of demand can outweigh sheer quantity of assets. Future of Fund Management: This trend suggests that asset managers will increasingly look to offer specialized ETFs for emerging asset classes, understanding that even with lower AUM initially, the right product with strong demand can yield substantial returns. This revenue milestone is not just about BlackRock; it’s a bellwether for the entire asset management industry, signaling where future growth and profitability might lie. Paving the Way: Institutional Adoption and Future Prospects The success of IBIT is a clear indicator of growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. When a player as significant as BlackRock sees such a positive response to its crypto-backed product, it sends a powerful message across the financial landscape. What does this mean for the future? Increased Competition: Other asset managers are likely to double down on their efforts to launch or promote their own crypto-related investment products, leading to more options and potentially lower fees for investors in the long run. Validation of Bitcoin: This level of success from a traditional finance giant further validates Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class, moving it beyond speculative circles into mainstream investment portfolios. Regulatory Clarity: The operational success of these ETFs may encourage regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks for digital assets, fostering a more mature and stable market environment. Innovation in Financial Products: We might see a proliferation of more sophisticated crypto-backed financial products, including options, futures, and even leveraged ETFs, as the market matures and investor appetite grows. The trajectory of IBIT, from its rapid launch to its astonishing revenue generation, serves as a compelling case study for the future of finance, firmly cementing Bitcoin’s place within the institutional investment landscape. What Does This Mean for You, the Investor? The triumph of IBIT in fee revenue offers several actionable insights for both seasoned and novice investors: Consider Diversification: If you haven’t already, explore how a small allocation to Bitcoin via a regulated ETF might fit into your diversified portfolio, considering its potential for growth and its low correlation with traditional assets at times. Evaluate Expense Ratios: While IBIT’s expense ratio is higher than IVV’s, its performance illustrates that sometimes, a slightly higher fee is justified by access to unique market opportunities and strong underlying asset performance. Always weigh the fee against the value and access provided. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of new product launches, regulatory changes, and market trends to make informed decisions. Understand Risk: While ETFs mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto ownership, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Invest only what you can afford to lose and align your investments with your risk tolerance. A New Dawn for Digital Assets BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF achieving higher annual fee revenue than its venerable S&P 500 counterpart is more than just a financial statistic; it’s a seismic shift. It signifies the mainstreaming of Bitcoin, the power of institutional trust, and the insatiable investor appetite for digital asset exposure. This remarkable feat underscores a future where digital assets play an increasingly prominent role in diversified investment portfolios, challenging traditional financial paradigms and opening up unprecedented opportunities.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance.

The key level to watch in July is $0.60 . If ADA holds and reclaims this level, it could trigger a move back toward the upper boundary of its falling wedge pattern. A breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.74 , and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 in the long term. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55 , with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40 .

Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF, which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high, there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-07-03T09:51:21,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as first US Solana staking ETF makes strong debut","The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF , the first U.S. exchange-traded fund to offer exposure to both Solana and on-chain staking rewards, began trading on July 2, 2025, on the Cboe exchange. The fund drew considerable investor interest, closing its debut day with approximately $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in net inflows, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While SSK’s early performance exceeded the initial activity seen in Solana and XRP futures-based ETFs, it remained below the debut volumes of this year’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which set new records earlier in 2025. As more crypto ETFs get market traction, cryptocurrency projects like Bitcoin Pepe are expected to attract more market attention as it reaches its last stage of its presale. Structure and strategy SSK is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, offering stricter investor protections and custody requirements. Anchorage Digital, the only federally chartered cryptocurrency bank authorised to custody and stake crypto assets, serves as both the ETF’s custodian and staking partner. The fund is designed to track Solana’s price while also offering yield from on-chain staking. Investors receive monthly cash distributions generated from these staking rewards. Around 80% of the fund’s assets are held in SOL, with at least half of that staked through institutional validators such as Galaxy and Figment. The remaining portfolio comprises liquid staking tokens, such as JitoSOL, as well as SOL-linked ETFs traded on Canadian and European markets. Unlike futures-based funds, SSK uses spot pricing based on the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, which enables it to closely mirror Solana’s real-time market value. SEC clearance and future outlook The ETF’s approval followed months of discussion with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had initially raised concerns regarding fund classification and staking protocols. The regulatory process concluded without further objections from the SEC by June 28, clearing the way for the fund’s launch. SSK arrives at a pivotal moment, as nine other Solana-focused ETFs remain under regulatory review. Its debut may set a precedent for staking-integrated cryptocurrency ETFs in the U.S., particularly those seeking to combine passive income generation with spot asset exposure. Bitcoin Pepe blends meme culture with Bitcoin-based infrastructure Bitcoin Pepe is establishing a unique position in the cryptocurrency space by integrating viral meme-driven appeal with a focus on infrastructure development rooted in Bitcoin. Operating as a Layer 2 solution, the project leverages Bitcoin’s security foundation while aiming to deliver scalability similar to platforms like Solana. This dual emphasis distinguishes Bitcoin Pepe from other meme-themed digital assets. Positioned as a meme-oriented Layer 2 network on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe is expanding its footprint through a series of strategic partnerships. These collaborations span multiple sectors, including gaming, content creation, decentralised finance (DeFi), and fair launch infrastructure. The aim is to cultivate an ecosystem in which the BPEP token offers both cultural resonance and cross-chain utility. These initiatives are anticipated to drive broader adoption and increase visibility for the project, with institutional players and the wider crypto community showing growing support for the PEP-20 token standard. Investor interest appears to be gaining traction, as reflected in the project’s ongoing presale, which has already raised over $16.29 million. Adding to this momentum are confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart. The project team will make the final listing announcement on July 31st.

However, just as quickly as the good news emerged, a swift and unexpected stay order from the SEC slammed the brakes on the conversion. This sudden turn of events, particularly concerning the Grayscale GDLC ETF , has left many wondering: what exactly happened, and what does it mean for the future of digital asset investments? So, What Exactly Just Happened with the Grayscale GDLC ETF? For those closely following the digital asset space, Grayscale’s efforts to convert its existing trusts into spot ETFs are well-known. Their landmark victory against the SEC last year, which paved the way for the spot Bitcoin ETFs, set a precedent. The approval for GDLC to transform into ETFs was seen as a natural progression, a testament to the growing maturity and acceptance of a broader range of cryptocurrencies by institutional bodies. The GDLC fund, a diversified portfolio of large-cap digital assets, was poised to offer investors a regulated, easily accessible way to gain exposure to a basket of leading cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. The initial approval signaled a potential paradigm shift, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to embrace other significant altcoins. But the celebration was short-lived. A stay order, essentially a temporary halt, was issued by the SEC, putting the conversion process on hold. This means that while the intent to approve was there, the actual execution is now delayed, leaving the market in a state of uncertainty. It’s a classic case of ‘one step forward, two steps back’ in the often-turbulent world of crypto regulation. Why is the SEC Throwing a Wrench in the Works? Understanding the SEC ETF Delay The immediate question on everyone’s mind is, of course, ‘Why?’ The SEC’s actions are often shrouded in regulatory jargon, but insights from industry analysts provide some clarity. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed to a few potential reasons behind the SEC ETF delay : Broader Standard Setting: The SEC might be aiming to establish a comprehensive framework or set clear standards for all digital asset ETFs, rather than approving them on a piecemeal basis. This suggests a more cautious and holistic approach to integrating crypto products into traditional finance. Unresolved Issues with GDLC’s Structure: Despite the initial approval, there might be lingering structural or operational concerns specific to the GDLC fund that the SEC wishes to address before allowing its conversion. This could relate to custody, valuation, or other technical aspects. Another Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, offered a slightly different perspective, suggesting the delay could be more directly related to establishing robust listing standards for Altcoin ETFs . While Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained some regulatory footing, the path for other altcoins is far less clear. The SEC might be grappling with how to ensure market integrity, investor protection, and surveillance capabilities for a wider array of digital assets. This regulatory pause highlights the SEC’s ongoing struggle to balance innovation with its mandate to protect investors. It’s a complex dance between allowing new financial products and ensuring they adhere to stringent regulatory requirements. Are Altcoin ETFs Now on Shaky Ground? What the Delay Implies The GDLC fund’s diverse holdings make this delay particularly impactful for the broader altcoin market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant progress in their ETF journey, the path for XRP, Solana, and Cardano has always been less certain due to various regulatory classifications and market structures. The SEC’s stay order on GDLC’s conversion could be a signal of increased scrutiny for any future Altcoin ETFs . What does this mean for investors and issuers hoping for a wave of altcoin-specific ETFs? Increased Scrutiny: Expect the SEC to apply even more rigorous standards to altcoin-focused products. This could involve deeper dives into market manipulation risks, liquidity, and the underlying technology of each asset. Slower Pace of Approvals: The dream of a rapid succession of altcoin spot ETFs might be put on hold. The SEC appears to be taking a deliberate, cautious approach, prioritizing regulatory clarity over speed. Focus on Surveillance Sharing Agreements: A key hurdle for spot ETFs has been the requirement for robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size. For altcoins, identifying such markets and establishing these agreements can be more challenging than for Bitcoin or Ethereum. This delay doesn’t necessarily spell the end for altcoin ETFs, but it certainly suggests a more challenging and protracted journey than some might have anticipated. It underscores the need for clearer regulatory guidelines for these assets. Beyond Bitcoin: The Grand Vision for Digital Asset ETFs The broader context of this delay is the evolving landscape of Digital Asset ETFs . The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a monumental achievement, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream investors. It validated Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The vision, however, extends far beyond Bitcoin. Industry players envision a future where various digital assets, from large-cap altcoins to potentially even tokenized real-world assets, are accessible through regulated ETF structures. These products offer: Benefits of Digital Asset ETFs: Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto without managing private keys or navigating complex exchanges. Liquidity: Traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying/selling. Regulation: Provides a layer of investor protection and oversight that direct crypto investments often lack. Diversification: Enables easy diversification into a basket of digital assets through a single product, like the GDLC. However, the SEC’s cautious approach, as seen with the GDLC delay, highlights the inherent challenges. The lack of a clear regulatory framework for many digital assets, concerns over market manipulation, and the unique characteristics of blockchain technology all contribute to the complexities faced by regulators. What’s Next for Crypto ETF Approval? Navigating the Regulatory Maze The road to full Crypto ETF approval for a wide range of assets remains a winding one. The Grayscale GDLC delay serves as a stark reminder that even after initial positive signals, regulatory hurdles can emerge unexpectedly. What steps might be crucial for the industry and regulators moving forward? Key Considerations for Future Approvals: Regulatory Clarity: The industry desperately needs clear, consistent guidelines on how various digital assets are classified and regulated. This includes clarity on whether an asset is a security, commodity, or something else entirely. Market Surveillance: Establishing robust surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated spot markets is paramount. This helps the SEC ensure that the underlying markets are not susceptible to fraud and manipulation. Investor Education: Both regulators and issuers need to prioritize educating investors about the risks and rewards associated with digital asset ETFs. Dialogue and Collaboration: Continued open dialogue between industry participants, regulators, and policymakers is essential to finding common ground and fostering innovation responsibly. While the delay is undoubtedly frustrating for Grayscale and investors, it also provides an opportunity for the SEC to refine its approach and for the industry to address any lingering concerns. The ultimate goal is to create a secure and transparent environment for digital asset investments within the traditional financial system. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Halt, in the Crypto ETF Journey The SEC’s stay order on the Grayscale GDLC ETF conversion is a significant development, underscoring the complexities and cautious approach regulators are taking towards digital assets beyond Bitcoin. It highlights the ongoing efforts to establish clear standards for Digital Asset ETFs and address specific concerns related to Altcoin ETFs . While the immediate impact is a delay in offering a diversified basket of crypto ETFs, it doesn’t necessarily signal a complete halt to future Crypto ETF approval . Instead, it serves as a powerful reminder that the regulatory landscape is still evolving, and patience, coupled with persistent advocacy and clear communication, will be key for the crypto industry’s continued integration into mainstream finance. The journey towards comprehensive crypto adoption through regulated products is undoubtedly long, but each step, even a delayed one, contributes to building a more robust and understood ecosystem.

2025-07-03T09:49:24,"Best crypto to buy now as BTC eyes new highs amid bullish calls from analysts","The cryptocurrency market capitalization neared $3.40 trillion by the end of Wednesday, adding close to 3% in 24 hours, driven by renewed momentum in Bitcoin and broad-based strength across altcoins. Bitcoin surged past $109,500 late in the day, fueling gains in Ethereum, which jumped 6%, while Dogecoin and Cardano climbed more than 7%. Although Bitcoin briefly pulled back by about $1,000 early Thursday, it quickly recovered to retest the highs seen in early June. Market participants are now watching whether the cryptocurrency can challenge or surpass its all-time high near $112,000, set in late May. Risk appetite remains elevated across global markets, adding to the bullish setup. However, attention is turning to the upcoming US jobs report due later Thursday. The data could either reinforce the rally or act as a roadblock, depending on its implications for Federal Reserve policy and broader risk sentiment. The bullish momentum is also seen in the early-stage project Bitcoin Pepe . The project’s presale has seen continued momentum from investors. Bitcoin to hit $200K? Standard Chartered has reaffirmed its bullish stance on Bitcoin, projecting the cryptocurrency will climb to $135,000 by the end of the third quarter and surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025. In a research note published Wednesday, the bank cited accelerating institutional demand—particularly from ETFs and corporate treasury allocations—as the key catalyst for the ongoing rally. The forecast comes from Geoff Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, who has maintained a consistently optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Kendrick wrote that the underlying drivers of Bitcoin’s market performance have shifted meaningfully, moving away from traditional halving-cycle dynamics. Earlier in the week, analysts at Bitwise also reiterated their bullish call for Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by year-end , citing surging institutional interest and a supportive regulatory backdrop. Bitcoin Pepe presale remains strong A renewed rally in Bitcoin, fueled by accelerating institutional demand, is once again spilling over into the broader crypto market, reviving speculative appetite across altcoins and meme tokens. One of the standout beneficiaries of this rotation is Bitcoin Pepe, which has positioned itself at the confluence of meme coin appeal and Layer 2 infrastructure innovation. Marketed as the first meme-centric Layer 2 on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to offer scalability and speed akin to Solana while anchored to Bitcoin’s base-layer security. This blend of cultural relevance and technical substance is helping the project differentiate itself in a crowded field of speculative assets. The team has also secured strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance, initiatives that aim to extend Bitcoin Pepe ’s ecosystem, create broader cross-platform integrations, and move the token beyond pure speculation into functional utility. With the presale now having raised over $16 million, investor interest appears to be gaining traction. A final listing announcement is expected on July 31, which could serve as a key catalyst heading into the final phase of the token’s launch.
