2025-07-23T16:00:00,"Expert Says 285,600% XRP Price Rally Isn’t Speculation, But Math. Here’s why","In a bold claim shared on X, prominent crypto analyst Pumpius stated that XRP’s path from $3.50 to $10,000 is not a speculative dream; it’s a mathematical inevitability. According to Pumpius, the forces behind XRP’s rise are already in motion: institutional infrastructure, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and suppressed price action designed to shake out retail investors before a paradigm shift. With XRP currently trading around $3.34, down slightly from its recent highs of $3.57, this prediction may seem far-fetched. But Pumpius insists that this isn’t about hype, it’s about control. Institutional Money Is Already Here Contrary to popular belief, institutional entry into XRP has already begun. ETFs, futures products , and commodity-backed financial instruments are quietly integrating Ripple’s payment corridors. Wall Street isn’t chasing “crypto”; they’re buying the underlying rails that move money across borders. $XRP to $10,000 ISN’T A MOONSHOT—IT’S A GUARANTEE From $3.50 → $10,000, XRP’s trajectory isn’t speculation — it’s mathematics. This isn’t about price. It’s about control. Here’s how pic.twitter.com/FvKS3WCcft — Pumpius (@pumpius) July 22, 2025 CME’s launch of XRP futures in May 2025 marked a turning point, followed by multiple XRP-linked ETFs like Teucrium’s 2× XXRP and the unleveraged XRPI. These instruments have drawn significant institutional capital, signaling growing confidence in XRP’s long-term role as a settlement layer for tokenized assets. On-chain data backs this up. Roughly 47 billion XRP, nearly 80% of the circulating supply, is held by custodians and whales. That’s not speculation; it’s positioning. XRP and the Real-World Asset Revolution XRP’s true utility is emerging in the tokenization of real-world assets. From U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds to real estate and even identity-linked bio-data, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is evolving far beyond its original remittance use case. Notably, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and integrations with platforms like Ondo Finance have enabled the tokenization of yield-generating U.S. Treasuries directly on XRPL . Meanwhile, projects like DNA Protocol are introducing bio-data tokenization, tying financial access to one’s digital identity, merging finance with genetics. Pumpius argues this layered utility dwarfs even Bitcoin’s impact, claiming it’s “bigger than Bitcoin + the Internet combined.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Suppression Theory and ISO 20022 Pumpius also alleges a long-running strategy to suppress XRP’s price. FUD campaigns, coordinated lawsuits, including the drawn-out SEC case, and deliberate market manipulation were all, according to him, designed to discourage retail investors from holding long-term. But with ISO 20022, the global standard for financial messaging, going live, XRP is positioned as a key liquidity token in the future of cross-border finance. Once that switch flips, Pumpius believes the suppression ends, and price discovers its real value. $10,000 XRP: Vision or Delusion? While the thesis is compelling, the math remains extreme. A $10,000 XRP would result in a market cap of nearly $600 trillion, far beyond global GDP. Still, the momentum is real. Legal clarity, expanding utility, and massive on-chain positioning suggest that XRP is no ordinary crypto asset. Pumpius ends with a warning: “You won’t be invited to the table. You have to seize your seat.” Whether or not XRP reaches $10,000, history is being written, and XRP is playing a central role.

2025-07-23T15:59:19,"World’s Largest Bitcoin Miner MARA Raises $850M to Expand 50K BTC Treasury","MARA Holdings, the world’s largest Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $850 million through zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2032 to expand its existing treasury of 44,893 BTC . According to its official press release , the Miami-based digital energy company expects to grant initial purchasers an additional $150 million option, potentially bringing the total offering to $1 billion. MARA will allocate up to $50 million of net proceeds to repurchase existing 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2026, while dedicating the remainder to Bitcoin purchases, capped call transaction costs, and general corporate purposes. The convertible notes will carry no regular interest payments and mature on August 1, 2032, with holders gaining conversion rights into cash, MARA common stock, or a combination at the company’s discretion. MARA Holdings, Inc. Announces Proposed Private Offering of $850 Million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes https://t.co/vsJOqj2Svj — MARA (@MARA) July 23, 2025 Strategic Treasury Expansion Amid Mining Headwinds The capital raise represents MARA’s response to mounting profitability pressures following Bitcoin’s April halving event, which cut mining rewards in half while energy and equipment costs continue to rise. MARA’s Q1 2025 results revealed these industry challenges, with the company reporting a net loss of $533 million despite achieving a 30% increase in revenue to $214 million. CEO Fred Thiel has previously advocated for a hybrid approach combining mining operations with strategic Bitcoin purchases during market declines to optimize acquisition costs. “As a miner that mines and buys Bitcoin, the hybrid approach provides us significant flexibility to acquire Bitcoin at attractive prices,” Thiel stated in the company’s December 2024 report. @fgthiel , CEO of Bitcoin miner @MARAHoldings , has suggested retail investors to adopt a ""buy and hold"" Bitcoin strategy. #Bitcoin #MARA $BTC https://t.co/lpbyVi7Mp0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 3, 2025 The strategy positions MARA alongside other major miners as they shift their operations, with Core Scientific facing potential divestiture of crypto assets following its $9 billion acquisition by CoreWeave, while HIVE Digital explores AI data center hosting to supplement its mining revenues. MARA’s convertible note structure includes provisions that allow the company to redeem notes for cash after January 15, 2030, while holders retain repurchase rights if stock prices fall below specified conversion thresholds. The company expects to enter capped call transactions with initial purchasers to mitigate potential dilution upon note conversion, utilizing established hedging mechanisms commonly employed in corporate convertible offerings. Divergence in Digital Treasury Strategies as Corporate Adoption Accelerates MARA’s Bitcoin-focused approach contrasts sharply with emerging trends in treasury diversification among public companies entering the digital asset space. Over 273 companies now maintain Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 companies as of June, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Yet, corporate strategies increasingly diverge from simple Bitcoin accumulation. NYSE-listed Sequans Communications recently purchased 1,264 Bitcoin for $150 million , bringing its total holdings to 2,317 BTC as part of a pure Bitcoin treasury strategy similar to MARA’s approach. NYSE-listed @Sequans buys 1,264 Bitcoin for $150 million bringing total holdings to 2,317 $BTC as corporate adoption surges 120% since July 2024. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/LlzHhB7sA8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 Meanwhile, some firms have abandoned Bitcoin entirely in favor of Ethereum’s staking yield potential, with Bit Digital recently selling 280 BTC to build a treasury of over 100,000 ETH, targeting staking rewards. BIT Mining also announced plans to raise $200$300 million for a Solana treasury , while other firms explore altcoin strategies including XRP, ADA, and emerging DeFi tokens, according to Animoca Brands Research. However, growing skepticism has surrounded the sustainability of any digital asset treasury approach, with Glassnode’s James Check warning that “the Bitcoin treasury strategy has a far shorter lifespan than most expect.” VanEck’s Matthew Sigel has similarly questioned the mechanics of Bitcoin treasury strategies, particularly criticizing at-the-market share issuance programs that can become dilutive when stock prices approach Bitcoin’s net asset value. The class-action lawsuits filed against MicroStrategy for allegedly misleading investors about the profitability of crypto investments have introduced fresh uncertainty into the corporate treasury’s use of digital assets. These contrasting developments have raised profound questions about whether corporate crypto adoption will lead to lasting financial innovation or a short-term speculative trend.

2025-07-23T15:55:23,"Block S&P500 Inclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto-Friendly Finance","BitcoinWorld Block S&P500 Inclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto-Friendly Finance In a truly electrifying development that has sent ripples across both traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world, Jack Dorsey’s innovative payment company, Block (formerly known as Square), has officially joined the prestigious S&P500 index. This isn’t just another corporate milestone; it’s a profound statement about the evolving financial landscape and the undeniable rise of digital assets. For anyone tracking the pulse of finance, especially those invested in the future of decentralized systems, Block’s S&P500 entry is a landmark event. Let’s delve into why this inclusion is so significant, especially considering Block’s substantial holdings of 8,584 Bitcoin (BTC). What Does Block’s S&P500 Inclusion Truly Mean? The S&P500 is more than just an index; it’s a benchmark of American economic prowess, representing 500 of the largest and most liquid U.S. companies. Inclusion in this elite group signifies a company’s robust financial health, market leadership, and consistent growth. For Block, a company that has championed digital payments and embraced cryptocurrency, its entry sends a clear signal: Mainstream Validation: Block’s presence in the S&P500 lends unprecedented legitimacy to a company deeply intertwined with the crypto ecosystem. It suggests that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the stability and long-term potential of businesses operating in this space. Increased Visibility and Investment: As an S&P500 component, Block will automatically be included in countless index funds and ETFs, leading to passive investment inflows. This broadens its investor base beyond tech-focused or crypto-specific funds. Enhanced Credibility: The rigorous criteria for S&P500 inclusion – including market capitalization, profitability, and liquidity – underscore Block’s operational excellence and financial stability. This can bolster investor confidence and attract new capital. To understand the gravity of this achievement, consider the typical requirements for S&P500 inclusion: Criterion Description Block’s Achievement Market Capitalization Must exceed a specific threshold (currently around $14.5 billion USD). Block comfortably exceeds this, demonstrating significant market value. Profitability Sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ GAAP earnings must be positive. Consistent profitability across its diverse business segments. Liquidity High trading volume to ensure efficient market operations. Actively traded on the NYSE, ensuring high liquidity. U.S. Company Must be a U.S. company listed on a major U.S. exchange. Headquartered in the U.S. and listed on the NYSE. Block’s Bitcoin Bet: A Bold Strategy That Paid Off? One of the most fascinating aspects of Block’s journey is its steadfast commitment to Bitcoin. With 8,584 BTC on its balance sheet, Block stands out as a publicly traded company with significant direct exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic alignment with Jack Dorsey’s vision for a decentralized financial future. Dorsey, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, believes BTC will be the native currency of the internet. Block’s decision to hold Bitcoin reflects this conviction, viewing it as a long-term investment and a key component of its future offerings. This move has been both praised for its foresight and questioned for its volatility exposure. However, with the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin, Block’s early and significant bet appears increasingly validated. Beyond its balance sheet holdings, Block facilitates Bitcoin adoption through its popular Cash App , allowing millions of users to buy, sell, and send BTC. This integration not only generates revenue but also positions Block as a pivotal player in mainstream crypto adoption. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Landscape? The inclusion of a company like Block in the S&P500 has far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It serves as a powerful testament to crypto’s growing legitimacy and integration into the global financial system. Catalyst for Institutional Adoption: When a major index like the S&P500 includes a crypto-friendly company, it subtly encourages other traditional institutions to re-evaluate their stance on digital assets. It normalizes the idea of companies holding or facilitating crypto. Validation for Bitcoin: Block’s substantial Bitcoin holdings, now part of an S&P500 company’s assets, provide a layer of indirect validation for BTC itself. It demonstrates that a reputable, large-cap company sees strategic value in the digital asset. Shifting Narratives: This event helps to shift the public and regulatory narrative around cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to legitimate components of the future financial infrastructure. Precedent for Future Inclusions: Block’s success could pave the way for other crypto-native or crypto-adjacent companies to eventually qualify for similar prestigious indices, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. Beyond the Index: Block’s Vision for Decentralized Finance Block’s ambition extends far beyond simply being an S&P500 company or holding Bitcoin. Jack Dorsey’s company is actively building the infrastructure for a more open and decentralized internet. Projects like TBD, focused on building open-source developer platforms for Bitcoin, and Spiral, a Bitcoin-focused open-source initiative, underscore this commitment. More recently, the announcement of Web5, a decentralized web platform built on Bitcoin, showcases Block’s long-term vision to empower individuals with greater control over their data and identity. This holistic approach — from facilitating everyday payments with Cash App, to building foundational decentralized technologies, and holding significant crypto assets — positions Block as a unique hybrid in the financial world. Its S&P500 inclusion is not just about its past achievements, but also about the potential for its future contributions to a more inclusive and decentralized global economy. Block’s journey from a payments processor to an S&P500 component reflects a broader shift in the financial landscape, showcasing robust growth and strategic foresight. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts What does Block’s S&P500 inclusion mean for you? For Traditional Investors: This event highlights the increasing intertwining of traditional finance and the digital asset space. Diversifying portfolios to include companies like Block, which have a foot in both worlds, could offer exposure to growth areas. For Crypto Enthusiasts: It’s a validation point. Continue to research and support projects and companies that are building real-world utility and adoption for cryptocurrencies. Block’s success demonstrates that fundamental business principles combined with crypto innovation can yield significant results. Market Observation: Keep an eye on how other major indices and institutional investors react to the success of crypto-adjacent companies. This could be a leading indicator for broader market trends. In conclusion, Block’s official inclusion in the S&P500 index is a monumental achievement, not just for the company itself, but for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It underscores the growing maturity and acceptance of cryptocurrency-aligned businesses within mainstream finance. With its substantial Bitcoin holdings and forward-thinking decentralized initiatives, Block is not just participating in the future of finance; it’s actively shaping it. This event serves as a powerful reminder that the lines between traditional and decentralized finance are blurring, paving the way for a more integrated and innovative global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the S&P500 index?

Details Here","US-based digital energy and infrastructure company MARA Holdings announced plans to sell $850 million in non-interest-bearing convertible bonds due in 2032. MARA Holdings Announces $850 Million Convertible Bond Sale Plan The company will offer the notes exclusively to qualified institutional investors under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. Initial purchasers will also be given the option to purchase an additional $150 million of notes within 13 days of the initial issuance. The bonds will be MARA's senior, unsecured debt instruments. Regular interest payments are not expected, but special interest rates may apply under certain conditions. The bonds mature on August 1, 2032. MARA will have the right to call all or part of these bonds for cash starting January 15, 2030. Investors will be able to sell their bonds back for cash if the MARA share price is below the conversion price on January 4, 2030. The bonds may be converted into cash, shares, or a combination of the two, at MARA's discretion. The full conversion right will be valid in perpetuity, effective May 1, 2032. MARA stated that the proceeds from the sale of bonds will be: To use the $50 million to buy back some of the 1% interest bonds due in 2026 that are currently in circulation, It plans to use the remainder to fund capped calls (anti-dilutive hedges on conversions), purchase additional Bitcoin, and for general corporate purposes (capital, debt repayments, strategic acquisitions). The company anticipates that holders of bonds due in 2026 may purchase MARA shares to hedge their existing positions, which could put upward pressure on the stock price. Similarly, option counterparties under capped call transactions are also expected to purchase shares. These trades could cause volatility in the prices of MARA shares and bonds.

2025-07-23T15:24:49,"Altcoins Soar as Bitcoin Rests – But Froth Builds in Crypto Markets","Altcoins are showing broad strength following Bitcoin’s explosive July rally. Surging open interest across the sector, however, suggests speculative froth may be building. Such a build-up may raise the risk of sharper volatility ahead. Traders Bet Big on Altcoins Bitcoin rallied from $105.4K to a new ATH of $122.7K this month, which pushed its realized cap above $1 trillion for the first time. However, Bitcoin’s near-term momentum has since cooled, and its price has coiled just below ATH levels. Alts, on the other hand, have begun to outperform in a classic capital rotation along the risk curve. Glassnode reported that altseason conditions first emerged on July 7 and have remained intact. Ethereum is leading the charge, and the altcoin market cap has increased by $216 billion over the past two weeks. This figure is one of the largest USD-denominated surges on record. The broad-based rally appears to be occurring largely unanchored from asset-specific fundamentals, with nearly all altcoin sectors now moving in close lockstep. Correlations with Bitcoin have decreased significantly, which confirms a growing divergence in price behavior between Bitcoin and the broader alts ecosystem. However, this growing optimism and aggressive positioning have translated into a sharp rise in futures leverage across top altcoins. Glassnode found that the combined open interest for Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin soared from $26 billion to $44 billion in July alone. This increase in leveraged positions, which is consistently above the +2 standard deviation threshold for 12 consecutive days, is the longest stretch on record. It indicates a potential speculative froth building across the altcoin sector, which could leave markets more susceptible to sharp volatility. Elevated leverage amplifies both upside and downside moves, and makes the environment “reflexive and fragile.” Glassnode also noted that the cumulative monthly funding premium paid by long-side futures across top altcoins has climbed to $32.9 million per month. This is nearing levels last seen during Bitcoin’s March 2024 peak, though it remains below the peak euphoria witnessed during the initial $100K breakout in late 2024. The elevated cost of leverage indicates that traders are aggressively seeking long exposure. Capital Flows to Ethereum Ethereum’s open interest dominance has now risen to 38%, while Bitcoin’s stands at 62%. Such a difference reflects a notable rotation of capital and speculative activity toward Ethereum at the margins. In fact, Ethereum’s open interest dominance has reached its highest level since April 2023, with only 5% of trading days recording a higher value. Meanwhile, Ethereum perpetual volume dominance has overtaken Bitcoin’s for the first time since the 2022 cycle low, the largest volume skew in ETH’s favor on record. This significant rotation towards altcoins, while indicative of renewed optimism and capital inflows into the broader crypto market, also raises caution. If Bitcoin’s consolidation continues or weakness emerges, it could pose headwinds to altcoin momentum. This, in turn, could risk a swift unwinding of leverage-heavy positions. As such, while altcoins are currently displaying broad strength, the rapid acceleration in open interest and leverage-fueled positioning points to a “frothy” backdrop that could increase volatility.

According to the official announcement, World Liberty Financial has partnered with Vaulta (A), formerly known as EOS, to accelerate web3 banking in the US. As part of this partnership, World Liberty purchased $6 million worth of Vaulta's A token. Again, as part of the partnership, World Liberty will include A tokens in its cryptocurrency reserves, while Vaulta will include the Trump-linked firm's USD1 stablecoin in its web3 banking solutions. With this acquisition, WLFI will use the A token to diversify into other crypto assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, TRON. By joining forces, WLFI and Vaulta aim to increase liquidity, expand access to real-world assets, and bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized platforms. Zak Folkman, Co-Founder of World Liberty Financial, said: “USD1 is quickly becoming the stablecoin of choice for institutions and real-world payment systems, and this partnership with Vaulta is another significant step forward. By integrating USD1 into Vaulta’s Web3 banking infrastructure, we are making decentralized finance more practical, compliant, and accessible for both everyday users and institutions.” “Partnering with World Liberty Financial is an exciting milestone for Vaulta as we reimagine the future of Web3 Banking. Both Vaulta and WLFI believe in a more accessible and transparent financial system, powered by real-world asset tokenization and seamless payment solutions. Our collaboration brings us one step closer to realizing this vision,” said Yves La Rose, Founder and CEO of the Vaulta Foundation. Following the news, the A token started to rise. Backed by Trump allies, @worldlibertyfi has entered a strategic partnership with Vaulta, committing $6M to advance Web3 banking in the United States.

2025-07-23T15:06:07,"Will Ethereum's Strong Rally Continue? Bitwise Responds and Explains Its Expectations!","The recent rise in Ethereum (ETH) has attracted all the attention and led the way for altcoins. While the reasons for the rise in Ethereum continue to be discussed, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said that Ethereum's recent rise is mainly due to the sharp increase in institutional demand. According to The Block, Bitwise CIO stated that there was a demand shock in ETH. Hougan said that since May 15, institutions have purchased approximately 2.83 million ETH with an estimated value of $10 billion, which is approximately 32 times more than what the network generated during that period. Stating that he expects this institutional demand and upward trend in Ethereum to continue, the Bitwise CIO estimated that ETFs and institutional treasuries could purchase 5.33 million ETH worth approximately $20 billion next year. Hougan also likened the current situation in Ethereum to Bitcoin's rally in 2024. The famous CIO pointed out that the surge in demand experienced after the approval of spot BTC ETFs in January 2024 was also experienced in ETH. At this point, Hougan said that the demand increase in Ethereum started late compared to Bitcoin, and that spot ETH ETFs have bought more than $5 billion worth of Ethereum since mid-May. “Apart from ETFs, companies like BitMine Immersion, SharpLink Gaming, Bit Digital, and the soon-to-be-IPO The Ether Machine have announced significant treasury strategies. These entities purchased a total of 2.83 million ETH, likely extending the current rally above $3.80.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Ethereum's Strong Rally Continue?

2025-07-23T15:05:47,"US authorities track $7.1M in crypto after dismantling international $97M oil investment scam","Seattle-based federal prosecutors have sought the forfeiture of $7.1 million in custodial cryptocurrency value associated with an oil and gas scam between June 2022 and July 2024. The U.S. Attorney’s Office alleged that the larger scheme brought in $97 million from investors by promoting a fake business model involving oil tank storage rentals. In December 2024, Homeland Security seized the $7.1 million. The prosecutors are now looking to distribute the money to legitimate victims. “Federal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.” ~ U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller The scam was allegedly international, with the criminals located in Russia and Nigeria turning victims’ cash into crypto and funneling it through domestic exchanges. Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller said that the fraudulent parties created several crypto accounts to mask the transfer of funds, a classic laundering strategy to avoid detection. Key suspect used Binance for crypto transfers One person, at least, is said to have assisted money laundering activities by transnational crime groups. Geoffrey Auyeung was indicted and charged in August 2024 with core participation in laundering stolen funds. Court records show that he used the stolen funds to purchase Bitcoin, Ether, USDT, USDC, and moved most of the sums to Binance. At the time of his arrest, $2.3 million was confiscated in his US accounts. According to the Department of Justice, Auyeung and co-conspirators appealed to be authentic investment managers who would provide huge profits in oil tank leasing activities. Upon raising funds, they shut down communication with investors. So far, prosecutors have uncovered more than $17.9 million in direct losses, although more victims are anticipated to emerge as the investigation process proceeds. DOJ ramps up crypto fraud enforcement The Seattle case is part of a broader crackdown by U.S. authorities targeting crypto-related financial crimes . Recent court filings revealed the DOJ seized $2 million in USDT and Binance-based assets linked to Hamas. Investigators traced the funds through a Gaza-based money transfer business known as BuyCash, which allegedly helped finance the group’s activities. Other fraud cases are also coming into the limelight. Shane Donovan Moore, a former rugby player, was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison after operating a Ponzi scheme using a crypto mining company as a bogus front. Between 2021 and 2022, Moore defrauded more than 40 investors of almost $900,000 through his firm Quantum Donovan LLC. In another case, a Denver-based pastor and his wife face 40 criminal charges regarding a crypto-based investment scheme based on faith that robbed people of over $3 million. The indictment cites the ongoing abuse of trust-based networks in seeking crypto funds. According to FBI data, digital asset fraud is on the rise. Victim losses grew by almost two times, reaching $4 billion in 2023 compared with $2.57 billion in 2022. The number rose to $5.8 billion in 2024.

2025-07-23T15:00:58,"Pundit: 99% of XRP Holders Will Sell between $10 and $20 Without Understanding This Power","In a striking X post, pseudonymous crypto analyst {x} (@unknowDLT) declared, “99% of XRP holders will sell between $10 and $20, not understanding that XRP is a key part of the new financial system we are entering.” He concluded emphatically: “XRP will rise without ever stopping.” This bold claim taps into a growing belief among XRP enthusiasts that the digital asset is on the verge of transcending its speculative status and becoming a foundational pillar of global finance. As XRP trades around $3.45 as of report time, just below its recent peak of $3.57, the market is watching closely to see if this token can fulfill the ambitious narrative being laid out by its most ardent supporters. A Changing Market Landscape XRP’s recent momentum comes on the back of both regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest. Ripple, the company behind XRP’s infrastructure, continues to forge major partnerships, including a collaboration with Ondo Finance to tokenize U.S. Treasury securities on the XRP Ledger. 99% of XRP holders will sell between $10 and $20, not understanding that XRP is a key part of the new financial system we are entering. In the event of a bear market, it may go down, but if it is adopted, it WILL DECOUPLE from Bitcoin. XRP WILL RISE WITHOUT EVER STOPPING. — {x} (@unknowDLT) July 23, 2025 Additionally, Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, has begun circulating across Ripple’s growing payment rails. These developments help solidify XRP’s position in real-world financial systems, distancing it from the speculative altcoin category it once occupied. On the legal front, XRP gained significant ground in 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the asset itself is not a security. This ruling paved the way for renewed market participation, including the launch of XRP futures on the CME , an institutional milestone that positioned XRP alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in the derivatives space. Will XRP Decouple from Bitcoin? One of the central arguments in @unknowDLT’s post is that XRP will eventually “decouple” from Bitcoin , meaning its price movements will no longer mirror BTC’s volatility. Traditionally, altcoins have followed Bitcoin’s lead. But XRP’s unique regulatory status and growing use cases are slowly breaking that mold. In recent months, XRP has posted gains even as Bitcoin moved sideways, thanks to distinct catalysts like its expanding liquidity hubs, growing tokenization ecosystem, and increasing attention from central banks and cross-border payment firms. Analysts have noted that XRP’s price behavior increasingly reflects institutional progress rather than market speculation.

Prominent community voices like Crypto X AiMan and Edoardo Farina have echoed similar concerns, urging XRP holders to understand the bigger picture. AiMan recently stated that 99% of holders would “sell too early,” while Farina warned that selling at $10 could be “the biggest mistake of your life.” Their message is clear: XRP’s real potential may lie far beyond commonly accepted price targets. A Defining Moment for XRP Holders XRP’s current price near $3.45 may seem modest, but with strong legal clarity, institutional adoption, and growing independence from Bitcoin, the digital asset is better positioned than ever to break past historical limits. Whether or not it reaches and sustains a price above $10 or $20 remains to be seen. But if the views of @unknowDLT and others prove correct, most XRP holders may be on the verge of exiting just as the asset begins its most powerful ascent.

2025-07-23T15:00:15,"Bitcoin Miner Mawson Fires CEO As Audit Uncovers Fraud Claims","Mawson Infrastructure Group’s board moved quickly this summer, cutting ties with its leader amid serious claims. On May 30, the company put CEO Rahul Mewawalla on notice for “ Cause ” under his contract. Days later, he was placed on administrative leave. Then, on July 8, his board seat was taken away and a lawsuit was filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. The suit accuses him of fraud and breach of duty while at the helm of the Nasdaq‑listed Bitcoin miner. Key Rewards Then Sudden Fallout According to reports, just months before his ouster, Mewawalla received $2.5 million in cash bonuses and 1.2 million restricted stock units. His base pay was also raised to $1.2 million. Back then, Mawson praised his leadership, citing 36% revenue growth, a 35% jump in gross profit and cuts in SG&A expenses during his tenure. Now, those same achievements stand alongside allegations that he misused his role and harmed shareholders. #Bitcoin Miner Mawson Fires CEO, Files Fraud Lawsuit – What’s Going On? Mawson’s leadership fallout adds to concerns over governance standards in #crypto mining, where legal accountability remains key fault line. $BTC pic.twitter.com/nKmQ1zLw5r — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) July 22, 2025 Board Names Interim CEO Kaliste Saloom, the company’s general counsel, was tapped as interim CEO for the Bitcoin mining company after Mewawalla was placed on leave. Saloom faces the task of steering the firm through what could be a long legal battle. Based on reports, the board is seeking to recover damages that it says stem from Mewawalla’s actions. At the same time, he has pushed back. In a July 17 letter, he “respectfully and vigorously” denied any wrongdoing and pointed to the board’s earlier public praise of his results. Ongoing Miner Dispute Adds Pressure This fight comes as Mawson is already tangled in another suit. Stone Ridge, which owns NYDIG, accused Mawson of wrongfully taking control of over 20,000 ASIC miners valued at about $30 million. The two sides had a colocation deal starting December 2023, set to end by March 2025. But disagreements over fees turned ugly. Mawson sent invoices totaling $1.9 million for space and power. Stone Ridge said there was a deal to cut energy use in the final month and disputed those bills. Mawson then changed the payout address for the miners and barred access to Stone Ridge staff, citing a contract clause that the other side says doesn’t apply. Investors will be watching both cases closely. If the board can prove its claims in court, Mawson might claw back millions and send a message about accountability.
