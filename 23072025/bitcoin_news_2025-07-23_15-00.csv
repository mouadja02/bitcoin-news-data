2025-07-23T12:48:47,"Bank of England Rethinks CBDC Plans","BoE Governor Andrew Bailey recently suggested that improvements in commercial payment systems may eliminate the need for a CBDC, which is a major shift from the institution's earlier pro-CBDC stance. The project also faced strong public backlash, privacy concerns, and slow progress, leaving the UK trailing behind other nations in CBDC development. Meanwhile, UK authorities seized seven illegal crypto ATMs in London and arrested two people in a crackdown on unregistered operations. Similar concerns are being addressed in the US, where lawmakers are pushing for consumer protections and regulations due to the spike in crypto ATM-related scams. CBDC Support Fades in the UK Britain's central bank is reportedly reconsidering its plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), casting doubt on the future of the so-called digital pound. According to a Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, the Bank of England (BoE) is facing increasing skepticism about whether a consumer-facing digital currency will actually provide tangible benefits to the financial system or the institution itself. BoE officials are said to be encouraging commercial banks to focus on improving existing payment systems rather than relying on the creation of a new digital form of money. Governor Andrew Bailey explained during a Treasury Committee hearing on Tuesday that if commercial innovations in payments prove successful, there may be no compelling reason to issue a digital pound. He said, ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs a success, I question why we need to introduce a new form of money.‚Äù This apparent shift is a retreat from the BoE‚Äôs earlier position. In 2023, Bailey stated that a digital pound would ‚Äùlikely‚Äù be needed in the future, mostly due to strong institutional support at the time. However, progress has been slow. The Atlantic Council‚Äôs CBDC tracker indicates that the UK is still in the development phase and is lagging behind other nations in its CBDC rollout. The project also faced a lot of public pushback, with over 50,000 largely critical responses to a request for public feedback. Concerns about consumer privacy, potential bank runs during crises, and threats from foreign or tech-backed stablecoins further complicated the digital pound‚Äôs prospects. The broader international momentum behind CBDCs also seems to be mixed. In the United States, lawmakers recently passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, effectively banning any Federal Reserve efforts to develop a CBDC without explicit congressional approval. Some critics, including Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene , argue that stablecoin regulation bills like the GENIUS Act could still allow for a CBDC to emerge indirectly through privately issued tokens. Global CBDC progress (Source: Atlantic Council ) Despite the hesitation in the UK and US, global interest in CBDCs is strong. According to the Atlantic Council , three countries‚ÄîThe Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria‚Äîalready launched digital currencies. Meanwhile, 49 countries are in the pilot phase, 20 are actively developing their projects, and 36 are still in the research stage. UK Cracks Down on Illegal Crypto ATMs Authorities in the UK also recently seized seven cryptocurrency ATMs and arrested two people in southwest London on suspicion of money laundering and operating an illegal crypto exchange. The operation was led by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in collaboration with the Metropolitan Police. (Source: FCA ) Since January of 2021, all crypto-related services in the UK are required to register with the FCA and comply with anti-money laundering regulations. Currently, no crypto ATMs are legally operating in the country, and using or managing one without proper authorization is considered a criminal offense. Therese Chambers, the executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, explained that any illegal operation of crypto ATMs or exchanges will result in serious consequences. She warned that using these unregistered machines not only violates the law but also contributes to criminal activity. The suspects in the recent enforcement action were released under investigation as inquiries continue. Across the Atlantic, US lawmakers are also responding to the growing risks associated with crypto kiosks. In Wisconsin, a new bill that was introduced by state Senator Kelda Roys and Representative Ryan Spaude seeks to establish regulations to protect consumers from fraud, hidden fees, and scams linked to digital currency machines. The proposal was made in response to a surge in crypto-related scams across the state, which pushed legislators to call for transparency, consumer education, and stricter legal protections. Phishing scams are still one of the most common forms of fraud involving crypto ATMs, where victims are deceived into sending digital currency to fraudsters posing as legitimate authorities. According to the FBI, these kinds of scams resulted in approximately $247 million in losses in 2023 alone. To stop this trend, lawmakers in Wisconsin are pushing for mandatory disclosures at kiosks and consumer protections. On a national level, Senator Dick Durbin introduced the ‚ÄúCrypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act‚Äù in February of 2025. The federal bill proposes measures like warning labels on machines, transaction limits for new users, and guaranteed refunds for scam victims who report incidents within 30 days. Crypto ATM distribution (Source: Cryptoatmradar ) Currently, the United States hosts 78.4% of the world‚Äôs Bitcoin ATMs, according to data from Coinatmradar.

2025-07-23T12:23:42,"This $0.03 Crypto Is Quietly Gaining Steam, 100x Gains Projected By BTC Investors Soon After Listing","The post This $0.03 Crypto Is Quietly Gaining Steam, 100x Gains Projected By BTC Investors Soon After Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Top decentralized finance platforms often begin quietly‚Äîlow visibility and limited capital‚Äîbut later reward early backers with massive returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following this classic blueprint. Now in its presale, muted buzz conceals fierce interest from prudent BTC investors tracking these rare 100x opportunities. With the token priced at $0.03 and an upcoming listing pegged at $0.06, early participants are positioning themselves for gains that could eclipse those seen in previous DeFi cycles. What will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) particularly compelling is its dual-lending architecture, designed to deliver both stable yield and high-risk rewards. In the upcoming Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, investors will be able to deposit major stablecoins and blue-chip assets into overcollateralized lending pools. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The presale narrative gains momentum near its midpoint: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $12.9 million to date and attracted over 13,900 token holders. With 90% of the Phase 5 allocation already sold, only a sliver of tokens remains at the $0.03 price point. In just days, the entry cost will spike to $0.035, delivering an instant 20% return. For investors who aim for a 100x surge post-listing, those final tokens at the lower price are the most strategic spot. Explosive Yield Meets Portfolio Flexibility For users looking to preserve long-term positions without selling, the borrowing side will offer overcollateralized loans in stablecoins. For instance, a borrower depositing $200,000 SOL will be able to access up to 75% of their collateral value in assets like 140,000 USDD. This feature will empower users to unlock liquidity while retaining upside exposure to SOL‚Äôs future appreciation‚Äîavoiding taxable events and maintaining strategic portfolio control. Mutuum Finance‚Äôs upcoming P2P lending feature is set to unlock high-risk, high-reward strategies compensating high risk assets and memcoins like TRUMP and FLOKI, that seasoned investors may appreciate. At the heart of the platform‚Äôs capital efficiency lies mtTokens‚ÄîERC-20 tokens minted when assets are deposited. These instruments represent fractional shares of the liquidity pool and automatically accrue both principal and interest. That means earnings accumulate in real-time, with no need for manual claims or compounding. Investors can track yield growth transparently‚Äîand even stake mtTokens to earn dividends in MUTM sourced from platform revenue. When users decide to exit, they simply return mtTokens to the smart contract and redeem their deposited assets plus all interest earned. One investor who joined during Phase 1 invested $20,000 into MUTM tokens at $0.01, securing 2 million tokens. With the presale now in Phase 5 at $0.03, that holding has already tripled in value. Once the token lists at $0.06, the return climbs to 6x, and when post-launch targets of $0.30 materialize, the upside reaches a staggering 30x. This projected growth isn‚Äôt without reason‚Äîthe Mutuum team is preparing to launch its beta platform alongside the token listing, giving users a real-world product to engage with. That utility, combined with rising user interest, could attract further investor demand and increase the likelihood of listings on major exchanges‚Äîtwo factors that naturally support higher price levels. Security, Incentives, and Investor Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes safety. The project has undergone a comprehensive CertiK audit, achieving an impressive Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. To further secure the protocol against emerging threats, a $50,000 bug bounty program is now live, rewarding bug hunters for identifying vulnerabilities across severity tiers. Early believers are being recognized through an aggressive rewards structure. Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 token giveaway , in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project‚Äôs rapidly growing community‚Äîboasting over 12,000 followers on X‚Äîis a testament to the traction building behind the scenes. Quiet and calculated, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering momentum among those who expect big moves from strategic presale positioning. With just 10% of tokens left at the current price, smart money is making its move before the price rises. If you‚Äôre watching the crypto space for a stealthy 100x setup, this may be your chance‚Äîbecause at $0.03, the door to explosive returns is still open.

This price rally has pushed its trading volume to $3.29 billion. Futures open interest also rose dramatically, by 23% to $1.27 billion, a sign of bullishness. The rally has also rekindled appetite throughout the market. Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) celebrated the price surge with a message of thanksgiving to all those who were involved with the development of the Binance ecosystem. Build and Build. $BNB Appreciations to all the ecosystem players, BTC maxis, ETH holders, meme traders, ETF applicants, treasury pub cos, good regulators, and utility builders. üôè pic.twitter.com/5YreSKU7xQ ‚Äî CZ üî∂ BNB (@cz_binance) July 23, 2025 In another post on X, CZ pointed to the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index, currently at 54 out of 100. This index tracks the performance of altcoins as they contrast against Bitcoin. A value larger than 50 is a possible sign that more funds are going into altcoins . CZ cites this change as an indication that the rally has only just begun. He believes a full-blown ‚ÄúFOMO season‚Äù might be around the corner, with investor euphoria quickly driving up prices. One Binance Square analyst observed how silent this breakout was, describing it as the most discreet all-time high in the history of any major coin. ‚ÄúThis is probably the most discreet ATH of a major cryptocurrency, based on solid fundamentals rather than speculation.‚Äù This discretion contrasts with the attention given to Bitcoin. Why is BNB surging? The recent gains by BNB are anchored on good fundamentals. The BNB Chain has registered over 5 million daily transactions. A 2025‚Äì2026 roadmap promises technical upgrades, including technical improvements and gas limit raises, as well as a new Rust client rollout. Deflationary tokenomics also play a role. The latest quarterly burn torched 2.1 million BNB valued at $1.6 billion. Regular burns contribute to long-term valuation. Also, institutional adoption is on the rise. Recently, Nasdaq-listed Nano Labs bought 45,685 BNB through OTC at an average of $764, adding 120,000 tokens in its latest acquisitions. The company hopes to buy up to 10% of BNB‚Äôs circulating supply through a program that will issue up to $500 million of convertible notes. Such developments strengthen institutional confidence in the token. BNB has been experiencing increased demand in use cases, including fee payments, staking, launchpad participation, and DeFi projects. The benefits of the BNB chain, such as low fees and scalability, have encouraged developers to build on the chain too. The altcoin fluctuated around the $800 price level for weeks before breaking the key resistance. Since early July, BNB has consolidated gains and outpaced Bitcoin, signaling a shift in market sentiment. Ethereum has also rallied by 67% over the past month, reaching $3,800. XRP climbed above $3.65, and Solana briefly traded above $200, up 24% weekly. Dogecoin has gained 35% within a week. Cardano increased by 50% over two weeks, but the two are still below historical highs.

2025-07-23T12:20:07,"BNB Hits New ATH at $800 as Altseason Index Holds Above 50 ‚Äì Is Altseason Finally Here?","Binance Coin ( BNB ) reached a new all-time high of $800 as the Altseason Index climbed to 51, prompting Binance founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao to predict that ‚ÄúFOMO season‚Äù may be approaching amid growing evidence of capital rotation from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies. The milestone coincides with Bitcoin dominance falling 5.8% in one week to under 61%, marking its lowest point since March and steepest decline since June 2022. Source: CoinMarketCap The metric had peaked near 66% at month-end, suggesting the critical inflection point that historically precedes major altcoin rallies. Altseason Index Shows a Possible Breakout CoinMarketCap‚Äôs Altcoin Season Index surged from just 16 a month ago to 51 this week. However, it remains below the 75 threshold that signals an official ‚Äúaltseason,‚Äù when at least 75 of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Current market rotation patterns mirror historical cycles where Bitcoin rallies first before capital flows into Ethereum and broader altcoin markets. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization surged from $3 trillion to $3.8 trillion over three weeks, with Ethereum gaining 110% during the same 90-day period. Meanwhile, meme coins like BONK (+148.7%) and FLOKI (+119.1%) posted triple-digit returns. In fact, lower-cap projects, including PENGU , recorded gains exceeding 500%. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin dominance may be approaching cyclical highs around 65-67%, following a declining trend from 97% in 2017 to 73% in 2021. The pattern indicates that each successive cycle sees Bitcoin maintaining a smaller market share at peaks, potentially setting the stage for sustained altcoin outperformance through 2025. Technical Indicators Signal Capital Rotation Phase Beginning Bitcoin dominance charts reveal a multi-cycle pattern connecting three major peaks: 2017 at 97%, 2021 at 73%, and a projected 2025 peak around 65-67%. The descending trendline suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs current dominance may be approaching its cyclical high before shifting to alternative cryptocurrencies, which are seeking higher returns. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC ratio appears to be bottoming in demand zones while Bitcoin dominance approaches resistance around 65-70%. This inverse relationship often becomes apparent when capital is rotating, with the ETH/BTC ratio typically rising as Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance declines. Altcoin market cap projections suggest potential expansion from the current $3.6 trillion to over $16 trillion, representing a possible 10,000% growth, following historical patterns of 18,000% in the first cycle and 12,000% in the second cycle. Each expansion phase has reached progressively higher absolute levels despite moderating percentage gains. The four-phase capital rotation framework suggests that markets may be transitioning from Phase 1 (Bitcoin dominance) to Phase 2 (Ethereum leadership). BULLISH: THE CRYPTO CAPITAL ROTATION CYCLE SHOWS THAT ALTSEASON IS COMING! pic.twitter.com/B40ZZ1TeCD ‚Äî Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) July 23, 2025 Phase 2 typically sees money flowing into Ethereum while initially struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum beginning to outperform Bitcoin consistently. BNB‚Äôs breakthrough to $800 represents the type of major altcoin leadership that emerges during Phase 2, where established layer-1 platforms and major altcoins begin outperforming Bitcoin. Historical Precedent Supports Altseason Development Theory Previous altseasons have followed predictable patterns, starting with Bitcoin rallies that boost overall sentiment and liquidity, before capital shifts into Ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies. The 2017-2018 altseason saw Bitcoin dominance collapse from 87% to 32% as ICO mania and Ethereum‚Äôs rise drove market cap from $30 billion to $600 billion. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance drop from 70% to 38% as DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins captured the attention of investors. Major altcoins, such as Dogecoin, surged in April 2021, as the altcoin season index reached 98, with the total altcoin market cap doubling during the explosive phase. Current market conditions mirror these historical setups, with Bitcoin having established new highs before stabilizing. The declining Bitcoin dominance trend from previous cycles suggests 2025 may see the third major altcoin expansion, potentially reaching massive absolute dollar amounts due to a larger market base. Ethereum‚Äôs 110% gain over 90 days, compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs relative stability, suggests that the rotation mechanism is in effect. The Altcoin Season Index, which climbed from 16 to 51 in one month, indicates accelerating momentum, although an official altseason is typically defined by crossing the 75 threshold. Historical data shows rapid acceleration once rotation begins, with major altcoins typically posting gains exceeding 170% compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs modest performance during peak altseason periods.

2025-07-23T12:19:24,"Crypto Billionaire Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $250,000, ETH $10K by End of 2025 ‚Äì Bull Market Heating Up?","Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 and Ethereum $10,000 by the end of 2025. In a recent blog post , Hayes laid out his thesis, tying the potential price surge to U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs economic policies and what he describes as a shift to a wartime economy. Crypto to Thrive Under Trump‚Äôs Industrial Strategy, Says Arthur Hayes According to Hayes, the return of Trump has ushered in a credit-heavy economic strategy designed to increase industrial output, especially in areas like rare earths and defense manufacturing. Hayes believes this approach, which mirrors aspects of economic planning in China, will flood the system with credit. That, he argues, will create favorable conditions for risk assets, especially crypto. ‚ÄúIf we are to remain beautiful and prosperous, to which instrument within the financial markets must we tune our ears?‚Äù Hayes wrote, comparing financial markets to music and investing to dance. He believes this wave of government borrowing will be indirectly supported by stablecoins, as issuers increasingly invest user funds into U.S. Treasury bills. As crypto adoption grows, so does the capital held in stablecoins, money that flows into government debt markets and helps fund the federal deficit. According to Hayes, this forms a loop between crypto and traditional finance: credit creation boosts crypto demand, stablecoins funnel cash into Treasuries, and the government recycles that capital into more credit. He calls it a ‚Äúcredit waltz.‚Äù Hayes also suggested that Trump-era regulatory changes, such as allowing 401(k) retirement funds to include crypto or potentially eliminating capital gains tax on digital assets, could deepen institutional involvement in the space. While Bitcoin remains his primary focus, Hayes believes Ethereum may outperform in the next cycle. He cited renewed institutional interest in Ethereum and shifting attention from faster chains like Solana back to larger, more established assets. SharpLink Gaming ($SBET) is now the world‚Äôs largest corporate holder of Ethereum. As of July 20, the company holds 360,807 ETH. #Ethereum #SBET https://t.co/iJ1ay05mxW ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 22, 2025 With just over 5 months left until the end of 2025, Hayes is betting that aggressive fiscal policies and looser financial conditions will drive crypto to new highs. His predictions reflect a growing narrative among crypto advocates: that a highly leveraged, credit-fueled economy will benefit digital assets more than ever before. Bitcoin and Ethereum Eye Long-Term Highs, But Short-Term Resistance Looms While Arthur Hayes has projected long-term price targets of $250,000 for Bitcoin and $10,000 for Ethereum, current technical indicators suggest that both assets may encounter short-term resistance before any further upward movement. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at around $118,200, up 8.7% in the past week. However, despite the price surge, 24-hour trading volume has declined by over 10%, down to $49.2 billion, suggesting weaker momentum behind the rally. Analysts caution that the recent rise lacks strong follow-through, a warning sign for traders expecting an imminent breakout. According to Glassnode lead analyst James Check, the lack of growing volume raises doubts about Bitcoin reaching the $200,000 mark this year. Hot new episode off the printer, with @_Checkmatey_ from @_checkonchain We discuss: -How he was able to predict Bitcoin‚Äôs ATH breakout -How to approach the current price discovery phase -Early signals that already foreshadow the future bear market -Key Bitcoin price levels‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ijXpzkYn63 ‚Äî Pahueg (Less Noise More Signal) (@pahueg) July 21, 2025 He emphasized that while Bitcoin has crossed the initial barrier at $120,000, it must firmly establish support above successive resistance levels‚Äî$130K, $140K, and $150K‚Äîto validate such a bullish trajectory. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin recently filled the CME gap at $117,255‚Äì$116,675 and is now testing the key resistance zone between $118,270 and $119,530. Source: TradingView The Elliott Wave pattern suggests the fourth wave correction may be complete, with the fifth wave potentially forming now. However, due to waning momentum, this wave could be truncated, meaning a lower high may form before resuming a stronger trend later in the cycle. Source: TradingView Longer-term, some chart watchers suggest Bitcoin is in the early stages of a rising channel targeting the $340,000 mark, aligning with cycle-based models pointing to a peak around late 2025. Ethereum (ETH) , meanwhile, is trading near $3,688 after a 1.2% rise in 24 hours. ETH remains 24.5% below its all-time high, yet technical indicators show strength. On-chain activity has surged, with daily active addresses reaching 463,880 and network fees jumping over 475% since early July, a sign of increased usage and demand. Analysts point to Ethereum‚Äôs RSI, which recently signaled a long-term ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù historically preceding major rallies. A recent chart analysis shows ETH forming a bullish Cup & Handle pattern and coiling within a rising channel. Fibonacci projections offer long-term targets of $5,790, $8,513, and potentially $13,000 over a multi-year horizon. While short-term resistance and pullbacks remain likely, especially as ETH tests the $4,100 level again, technical signals suggest Ethereum‚Äôs long-term bullish structure remains intact.

2025-07-23T12:16:59,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? ‚Äì July 23, 2025","Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 3.3%, but it still holds at $4 trillion. That said, the market is up today, with the large majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization increasing in this period. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $222 billion, maintaining similar levels for days now. TLDR: Crypto market cap holds at $4 trillion; Majority of top 100 coins have increased in 24 hours; BTC and ETH are largely unchanged, trading at $118,487 and $3,695; Market sentiment rises within the greed zone; US ETH spot ETFs celebrates its 1y anniversary with 13 days of positive flows and 3d highest inflows; US BTC spot ETFs saw outflows for the 2nd day in a row; In 2025, the price of BTC could go down to $70,000 or up to $160,000; ‚ÄôBitcoin‚Äôs collapsing volatility isn‚Äôt just a blip, it‚Äôs structural‚Äô. Crypto Winners & Losers Over the past 24 hours, of the top 10 coins per market cap, three are red and five are green (not taking the two stablecoins into account). Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 0.4% in a day, meaning it‚Äôs largely unchanged. The current price is $118,487. The price is back above the $118,000 level. Then, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 0.1%, meaning that it too is currently unchanged. It‚Äôs now trading at $3,695. The price is still moving towards the $4,000 mark. Binance Coin (BNB) is the highest gainer in this category. It‚Äôs up 4.6% to $794. Notably, it hit its latest ATH of $801 just hours ago. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped the most: 1.2%, now trading at $0.2618. The other coins in this category saw a change of less than 1% each. In the top 100 coins category, two coins recorded double-digit increases, and both above 20%. Flare (FLR) is up 23.4% to the price of $0.02592, while Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) rose by 21.6%, now changing hands at $0.04466. Others appreciated by up to 9.8% per coin. Also, around a dozen coins are red. The highest decrease is 5.4% by Jupiter (JUP) , trading at $0.6153. The rally has regained its momentum after a brief and expected pullback. For now, analysts expect it to continue on the same or similar note. Meanwhile, the US-based financial services corporation PNC Bank said it would add Coinbase‚Äôs Crypto-as-a-Service platform, enabling customers to buy, hold, and sell crypto. ‚ÄúTraditional finance is slowly waking up to crypto‚Äôs call and is vying for a piece of the pie,‚Äù Gadi Chait, Xapo Bank‚Äôs Investment Manager, told Cryptonews .

Very glad to have this behind me. It never made sense but neither does the @rstormsf trial. Wild how quickly you can have your life upended. I'm grateful for those who saw through it and for my stellar legal team. Now, turning my attention back to @krakenfx . https://t.co/LbaDxN0bCl ‚Äî Jesse Powell (@jespow) July 22, 2025 ‚ÄòBitcoin‚Äôs Collapsing Volatility Isn‚Äôt Just a Blip, It‚Äôs Structural‚Äô According to Zondacrypto‚Äôs CEO Przemys≈Çaw Kral, following BTC‚Äôs recent price surge, we‚Äôve seen a period of ‚Äúrelative stability that is healthy for the market.‚Äù This period allows investors to digest gains and prevents speculative overheating, he says. Also, it ‚Äúcan set a foundation for further, sustainable growth.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis year, the price of Bitcoin could go down to $70,000 or up to $160,000. This will largely come down to the level of adoption in H2.‚Äù Moreover, there is ‚Äúa calm confidence‚Äù in BTC‚Äôs long-term value now, Kral says, but there‚Äôs also ‚Äúfevered interest‚Äù in altcoins. In particular, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP have seen significant increases over the past week. Moreover, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , commented that despite trading at all-time highs, Bitcoin‚Äôs implied volatility has collapsed to its lowest level in almost two years. 30-day at-the-money implied volatility for ETH (blue) and BTC (orange) Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Also, Ethereum‚Äôs implied volatility ‚Äúremains sticky and elevated.‚Äù This has resulted in the ‚Äúwidest divergence‚Äù in BTC vs ETH volatility seen in years. Time series of the difference between ETH and BTC ATM volatility for the 30-day tenor between 1 January 2024 and mid-July 2025 Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata There are a few key factors why Bitcoin is becoming less volatile and Ethereum remains significantly more reactive. One is institutional participation. BTC adoption through ETFs is now some 10 times deeper than ETH‚Äôs, with $154 billion held in BTC ETFs compared to $15.3 billion for ETH. ‚ÄúInstitutional footprint in Bitcoin helps dampen volatility. More passive, long-term holders and less speculative trading lead to smoother price action,‚Äù Dawson says. Another factor is that Ethereum is still very yield-driven, he argues. Furthermore, BTC also ‚Äúhas a unique suppressor in Strategy.‚Äù It has bought more than 226,000 BTC using convertible bonds. ‚ÄúThese convertibles give institutions leveraged upside exposure to BTC without needing to bid up the crypto options market directly,‚Äù Dawson explains. ‚ÄúAt the same time, many of these investors hedge their exposure using futures and MSTR equity, which introduces mechanical hedging flows that further stabilize Bitcoin‚Äôs price. There‚Äôs currently no ETH equivalent to this.‚Äù Dawson continues: ‚ÄúAll of this suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs collapsing volatility isn‚Äôt just a blip, it‚Äôs structural. It‚Äôs the result of growing institutional involvement, passive ETF inflows, and sophisticated hedging flows. Ethereum, in contrast, remains speculative, yield-focused, and structurally levered, and that keeps volatility elevated. But in crypto, nothing stays still for long. We could see that structure shift quickly.‚Äù Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,487. This is an increase from the intraday low of $117,697. The highest price reached over the past 24 hours is $120,122. This is significant, as it‚Äôs likely that BTC will continue its efforts to retake the $120,000 level. Should it manage to do so and hold it, we could see further growth in the next few days. On the other hand, market watchers are observing its moves downward and whether it will revisit the $117,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,692. It saw choppy trade over the past day. The lowest it hit was $3,630, and the highest it reached was $3,758. It now remains to be seen if the price will retake and hold the $3,700 mark, or will it pull back to $3,625. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment keeps moving slightly up and down within greed territory, between 68 and 71. It stands at 70 today , up from 68 yesterday. While this may indicate a correction, so far, there are no major indications of overbought conditions. The sentiment remains overall positive, but not extremely so.

Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has rallied again over the past 24 hours, while the stock market closed with a mixed performance on Tuesday, following a mixed Monday. The S&P 500 is up by 0.064%, the Nasdaq-100 is down by 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.4%. Market participants are now anticipating further tariff-related developments. This was mostly a reaction to quarterly results from a number of major companies. Investors are also sitting tight for the Big Tech earnings reports that will be coming out this week. Is this rally sustainable? For now, still yes. The rally, per analysts, is here to stay for a while longer, likely for the remainder of this year. That said, dips are to be expected.

2025-07-23T12:15:42,"Colorado pastor and wife indicted in $3.4M crypto scam; 'God told him' to shill INDXcoin","A Colorado-based online pastor and his wife have been indicted after allegedly swindling millions of dollars from religious followers through a crypto scheme. Eli Regalado, a self-proclaimed pastor in Denver, and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, are accused of using ‚Äúfaith in God‚Äù to defraud investors through the promotion and sale of a digital token called INDXcoin. The indictment was handed down on Tuesday, including 40 criminal counts against the couple. Denver District Attorney John Walsh said the two are being sued for breach of trust, because the alleged fraud involved the manipulation of religious faith and language to entice victims. ‚ÄúThese charges show our work to hold the Regalados accountable for their alleged crimes and to bring a measure of justice to the victims,‚Äù Walsh said in a statement. 40 criminal counts for fraudulent faith investments Between January 2022 and July 2023, the Regalados raised approximately $3.4 million from more than 300 investors, many of whom were members of their Christian community. Excerpts from the Relegados indictment. Source: denverda.org They promoted INDXcoin through their online ministry and associated platforms, where Eli Regalado reportedly told investors that ‚ÄúGod told him‚Äù to promote the token sold via a platform called Kingdom Wealth Exchange. The couple claimed the crypto would bring substantial returns, is less volatile and risky than other digital assets. According to the INDXcoin whitepaper, the token was ‚Äúinsulated‚Äù from the hazards of crypto trading. The Denver pastor and his wife insisted INDX was not a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme, and asserted that its value was backed by the momentum of the crypto market. According to redacted court documents seen by Cryptopolitan, the couple exaggerated the potential of INDXcoin, stating it could become a top-ten cryptocurrency and a stable store of value, competing with stablecoins and providing higher returns. Prosecutors say these promises were deceptive and unsupported. The token, according to authorities, ‚Äúmaintained zero value,‚Äù causing complete losses for the hundreds who invested. Investigators found that little of the funds raised were actually used to support or develop the token, and the Regalados allegedly diverted at least $1.3 million toward personal expenses. These include luxury retail purchases, credit card bills, cosmetic and medical procedures, airline tickets, and home renovations. The indictment also notes they used investor funds to pay for food, auto-related bills, au pair services, manicures, and other non-business costs. Eli Regalado allegedly told followers that ‚Äúthe Lord‚Äù had instructed him to renovate their home.. Enterprises and RICO allegations The court documents also revealed several entities tied to the Regalados‚Äô faith crypto fraud , including INDXCOIN INC., INDXCOIN LLC, Grace Led Marketers, Kingdom Wealth Exchange companies, along with Victorious Grace Church. ‚ÄúEli and Kaitlyn Regalado owned or controlled Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing, Victorious Grace Church, INDXcoin/INDXcoin LLC, Kingdom Wealth Exchange LLC/Kingdom Wealth Exchange. Only Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing and Victorious Grace Church were registered with the Colorado Secretary of State‚Äôs Office to conduct business within the State of Colorado,‚Äù the prosecution wrote. The organizations were allegedly used to build credibility among the couple‚Äôs followers while creating a financial structure to conceal their fraudulent activities. At the time of the alleged scheme, Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were operating INDXcoin, LLC out of a residence located at 2355 South Eudora Street in Denver, Colorado. Even though the company was functioning from that address, INDXcoin, LLC was never registered to legally conduct business in the state, according to the indictment. Both Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were charged under Colorado‚Äôs organized crime laws for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity while participating in the operation of these enterprises. The first count of the indictment cites violations of Sections 18-17-104(3) and 18-17-105 of the Colorado Revised Statutes, which deal with racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations (RICO) offenses.

Thanks to the recent inflow of liquidity in crypto markets, analysts and crypto experts are offering fresh insights into market trends and likely winners in this cycle. Pepe Coin and the Race to $100 Billion Market Cap Pepe Coin, the crypto industry‚Äôs largest frog-based meme coin, is one of the altcoins analysts are touting as a serious contender for the top crypto to buy now in the market. Analysts have made several bold predictions about the meme coin, including a bold Pepe price prediction of up to $20 and a rally to hit a $100 billion market cap by the end of the ongoing cycle. If previous cycles are to be taken into context, it becomes undeniably clear that this ‚Äúimpossible feat‚Äù is most definitely possible for Pepe Coin. At the height of the meme coin rally last year, Pepe Coin hit an all-time high market cap of $11 billion, an impressive feat considering most of the attention and liquidity during that cycle were on meme coins based on Solana and Base. With mindshare and capital more evenly distributed during this cycle, analysts believe Pepe Coin could experience a surge in both price and market cap. According to many analysts, the Pepe price prediction could reach anywhere between $10 and $20 by the end of the cycle. Remittix Introduces a New Era in Payment Solutions and Remittances Another altcoin making the rounds in crypto news rooms is Remittix, an upcoming PayFi giant currently on presale with a very lucrative offer that many analysts believe could spark newfound interest in the coin. Token owners now stand the chance to win from a prize pool of $250,000 during the token‚Äôs ongoing giveaway program. Aside from that, the interest in Remittix appears to be sparked by strong fundamentals and use cases within the payments section. With features such as: Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 20 countries worldwide, Over $16.8 million raised by community members 50% token bonus for early token holders Ownership of the Remittix token seems a no-brainer in current market conditions. When you combine this with the fact that Remittix is on course to transform the payments industry worth $19 trillion, it‚Äôs easy to see why many analysts and crypto enthusiasts have begun to refer to the token as an ‚ÄúXRP 2.0.‚Äù Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their presale here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250K Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/pepe-price-prediction-pepe-coin-to-100b-the-when-why-how/,"TRADING|MARKET|PEPE|ALTCOIN|BTC","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T12:14:56,"Capital Shift? Ethereum ETFs Surge as Bitcoin ETFs Cool Off","While the 12-day inflow streak for spot Bitcoin ETFs ended, the same cannot be said for their Ethereum counterparts. In fact, spot Ethereum ETFs have extended their 12-day inflow streak. On July 21 alone, spot BTC ETFs saw $131 million in outflows. This represented the first net withdrawals during this rally toward Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high, while spot ETH ETFs recorded $297 million in inflows. Divergence in ETF Flows CryptoRank stated that the divergence could simply reflect institutional investors taking profits after Bitcoin‚Äôs 10% gain in July and over 25% rise year-to-date, which is a logical rebalancing after a strong run. Spot Bitcoin ETF 12-day inflow streak ended. Spot Ethereum ETF 12-day inflow streak continues. On July 21, the market saw $131M in outflows from $BTC Spot ETFs and $297M in inflows into $ETH Spot ETFs. Is this the beginning of a market shift? pic.twitter.com/2EE8E8KBh4 ‚Äî CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 22, 2025 Another factor could be capital rotation, with BTC‚Äôs growth pausing at ATH levels and investors seeking alternative large-cap opportunities like Ethereum. ETH ETFs continue to attract capital, with record inflows of $726 million on July 16 and $297 million on July 21, which pushed cumulative new inflows to $7.78 billion. Additionally, ETH has surpassed BTC in terms of daily derivatives volume over the past week as well, which reflects strong trading activity. Ethereum appears to be benefiting from capital rotation , ETF-driven FOMO, and a potential altseason, with the altseason index near 60, its highest in months. While these signs reflect a potential pivot in investor sentiment, CryptoRank noted there is nothing bearish in BTC‚Äôs current outflows. The analytics firm views them as standard rebalancing rather than a sign of weakening fundamentals. Overall, the continuation of ETH ETF inflows amid Bitcoin‚Äôs pause could mark the beginning of a market rotation toward Ether and large-cap alts. Near-Term Pullback Concerns However, as Ethereum continues to attract institutional flows, some investors are questioning if its recent momentum could lead to a near-term pullback. Despite the concerns, analysts note the current market is far from overheating. Compared to the futures market peaks in March and November 2024, Ethereum‚Äôs present positioning appears modest, which means that any pullback would likely be shallow and brief. Throughout this cycle, the altcoin‚Äôs price action has remained sluggish despite an ongoing uptrend. It even dipped into undervalued territory before clearly bottoming out. This positions Ethereum for further upside potential in the second half of 2025. As such, Ethereum‚Äôs continued climb could set the stage for altcoins to surge, a pattern that typically signals the arrival of altseason. The post Capital Shift?

2025-07-23T12:05:54,"Expert Shares Clear Message about XRP Price Potential","In a market where speculation often drives the narrative, one analyst is challenging widely accepted methods of price forecasting. UnknownDLT, a crypto pundit and XRP advocate, shared a firm stance on the limitations of technical analysis (TA) when applied to XRP within a future utility-driven financial ecosystem. In his view, the idea of selling XRP at $10‚Äì20 based on charting tools tied to Bitcoin cycles is misguided. Instead, he argues that the market is shifting toward a system defined by real-world use , not speculative trading patterns. People, I want to be clear once and for all. There is no TA capable of estimating the price of XRP in a utility market. They tell you to sell XRP at $10-20 because of the Bitcoin speculative bullrun. The reality is that we are entering a new financial system that will last 70y ‚Äî {x} (@unknowDLT) July 22, 2025 Beyond Speculation and Cyclical Models The post states that the crypto market is on the verge of a foundational transformation. According to UnknownDLT, XRP is not simply riding the coattails of Bitcoin in a speculative bull run; it was built to address Bitcoin‚Äôs flaws , and is being positioned within a new financial structure that could last for decades. He claims that traditional tools like TA are ill-equipped to capture this kind of transition, emphasizing that ‚Äúthere is no TA capable of estimating the price of XRP in a utility market.‚Äù This view resonated with some community members who believe that XRP‚Äôs potential value lies beyond the visible scope of typical market cycles. One response highlighted that charting systems have proven effective when assets go parabolic, and that technical analysis itself isn‚Äôt inherently flawed. Instead, what most traders lack is the right mix of perspective, optimism, understanding of fundamentals, and imagination. A Utility Market in Unfamiliar Territory Another commenter reinforced the core of UnknownDLT‚Äôs argument, describing the utility market as part of an emerging industry that is only just beginning to define itself. He pointed out that institutional and governmental incentives are now aligned to promote this sector‚Äôs expansion, setting the stage for a ‚Äúsuper super-cycle.‚Äù Traditional technical analysis is built on the assumption that historical data and certain price movements can inform future prices. Analysts often share bullish predictions , taking XRP‚Äôs utility and market position into account. However, one user pointed out that demand driven by utility has no established pattern to model from, making accurate forecasting nearly impossible without clearer inputs. XRP, the Asset Outside the Traditional Playbook The conversation reflects a growing shift in how some XRP advocates perceive value. Rather than seeing the asset as part of another speculative rally, they argue it is embedded in the foundation of a redesigned financial system with a multi-decade lifespan. XRP is already growing beyond speculation . Whoever predicts its price using only short-term trading patterns may miss the bigger rally.

2025-07-23T12:03:23,"Worldcoin (WLD) Price Eyes $1.50 Breakout‚ÄîWill the Current Pullback Hinder the 30% Rally Ahead?","The post Worldcoin (WLD) Price Eyes $1.50 Breakout‚ÄîWill the Current Pullback Hinder the 30% Rally Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Worldcoin (WLD) price is making headlines again as the token inches toward a potential breakout above $1.28, signaling a short-term rally toward the $1.50 resistance. After consolidating in the $1.20‚Äì$1.27 zone for the past week, WLD is riding the wave of a broader altcoin market recovery‚Äîgaining over 20% in the past seven days. Bolstered by high trading volumes, favorable technical signals, and increasing adoption of its World ID ecosystem, the WLD price appears to be primed for a significant move. Now that the Worldcoin price is undergoing a correction, the question arises whether it will be restrained from reaching $2. Price Structure Tightens as Bulls Defend Support Worldcoin is currently trading at $1.27, well above the $1.20 support that has held firm over the past week. Price action is tightening below the 0.236 FIB levels at $1.435, a continuation pattern that often resolves upward if the levels are secured. Momentum indicators are aligning: RSI sits near 65 after plunging from 80, pointing towards a correction. 200-MA is offering a strong base and hence the pullback could be reversed if the price continues to drop Volume is rising, signaling strong accumulation and also an increase in the volatility. If bulls can sustain a close above $1.28, the door opens to a quick rally toward $1.50. Beyond that, the next key zone sits around $1.70, a level not seen since early May. However, if $1.20 breaks, downside risks include a drop to $1.05. WLD Riding Wave of Altcoin Rotation and On-Chain Demand This move isn‚Äôt happening in isolation. WLD is benefiting from a broader altcoin resurgence, with capital rotating out of Bitcoin and into high-potential Layer-1 and identity-based tokens. More importantly, Worldcoin‚Äôs fundamentals are catching up with its hype. The expansion of Orbs (biometric identity scanners) to over 46 countries is driving adoption of the World ID protocol. Strategic partnerships‚Äîwith brands like Tinder (Match Group) and Story Protocol‚Äîadd utility and relevance. WLD token usage may spike as World ID becomes more integrated into real-world apps, potentially increasing demand. Altogether, this growing use case backs the price action, adding fuel to the technical breakout setup. Beyond project-level factors, macro sentiment is turning supportive. With expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut in September, liquidity may start to return to risk-on markets‚Äîincluding crypto. At the same time, recent U.S. regulatory developments, like the GENIUS Act, are reinforcing investor confidence in compliant crypto projects. Moreover, as the capital flows back into altcoins, technically backed, utility-driven tokens like Worldcoin (WLD) are expected to benefit the most.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/worldcoin-wld-price-eyes-1-50-breakout-will-the-current-pullback-hinder-the-30-rally-ahead/,"TRADING|WLD|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T12:01:43,"Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial just bought millions of this crypto","World Liberty Financial (WLFI), President Trump‚Äôs decentralized finance ( DeFi ) platform, has made another monster crypto purchase. According to data on Arkham Intel , the platform added 3,473 Ethereum ( ETH ) to several wallets on Tuesday, July 22, which was then staked on the decentralized staking protocol Aave . With the average ETH price of $3,743 at the time of buying, the purchase amounts to nearly $13 million. Right now, WLFI holds a total of 73,616 ETH, valued at over $275 million. WLFI‚Äôs crypto moves. Source: Arkham Compared to the platform‚Äôs crypto holdings at the end of H1 2025, which sat at $178.15 million, the new number marks a 54.37% increase in less than a month. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Ethereum adoption accelerates With the current price of $3,673 (up 63.78% in the past month), Ethereum is currently trading well above its major moving averages, with a possible price target of $3,800 by the end of the month. Institutional demand is also picking up, as improved regulatory clarity in the U.S. is creating a more favorable trading environment. President Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act into law, a bipartisan measure establishing a federal framework for digital assets and stablecoins. Capitalizing on the momentum, SharpLink Gaming alone bought 79,949 ETH between July 14 and July 20 at an average price of $3,238, bringing its total holdings to 360,807 ETH. The acquisition was funded through a $96.6 million equity program, making SharpLink the largest corporate holder of Ethereum to date. The appeal is also reflected in exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) performance. Indeed, ETH has even outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the past month, rising 63.78% compared to ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äôs‚Äù 17.12% gain. Given the strategic treasury adoption and surging ETF inflows, analysts are expecting a lot from Ethereum. Sean Dawson, for example, Head of Research at Derive, projected in a talk with Decrypt that the cryptocurrency could hit $8,000 by the end of the year.

2025-07-23T12:00:39,"Bitcoin $250,000, Ether $10,000 By Year-End? Arthur Hayes Thinks So","Arthur‚ÄØHayes has never been shy about big numbers, but his latest essay, Time‚ÄØSignature, frames those targets inside a sweeping macro thesis: a wartime‚Äëstyle US credit boom that‚Äîif it unfolds as he expects‚Äîcould send Bitcoin and crypto markets into their largest bubble yet. Writing on‚ÄØ22‚ÄØJuly, the BitMEX co‚Äëfounder argues that financial markets, like dancers, must keep time with the ‚Äúkick drum‚Äù of credit creation. ‚ÄúIf we are out of time, we lose money,‚Äù he warns, before identifying the beat he believes traders must follow today: US wartime industrial policy, or what he bluntly calls a shift toward economic ‚Äúfascism.‚Äù Hayes centres his argument on the Pentagon‚Äôs newly announced deal with MP‚ÄØMaterials, under which the US Defense Department will become the miner‚Äôs largest shareholder, guarantee a floor price for critical rare‚Äëearth elements at twice China‚Äôs current market rate, and back a $1‚ÄØbillion bank loan to build a Nevada processing plant. The structure, he writes, is the template for ‚ÄúQE‚ÄØ4‚ÄØPoor People,‚Äù a credit‚Äëmultiplier that expands the money supply without formal Congressional approval. Related Reading: Trump Shares Viral Bitcoin Breakdown ‚Äî Here‚Äôs What He Posted In his schematic example a single commercial‚Äëbank loan to MP‚ÄØMaterials ‚Äúcreates $1,000 of new fiat wampum,‚Äù then ripples outward as wages, deposits and discounted Treasury borrowing. ‚ÄúThe money multiplier is‚ÄØ>‚ÄØ1, and this wartime production leads to an increase in economic activity, which is accounted for as ‚Äògrowth,‚Äô‚Äù Hayes observes. The result, he says, is inevitable inflation, yet also ‚Äúgovernment‚Äëguaranteed profits‚Äù for banks and industry. Why Bitcoin And Crypto Is The Bubble Of Choice Hayes‚Äô historical analogy is China‚Äôs 1990s‚Äì2020s property boom, where a five‚Äëthousand‚Äëpercent expansion of M2 forced households into apartments, inflating land values and local‚Äëgovernment coffers. In the United States, he contends, the socially acceptable pressure valve will be digital assets. Two policy shifts underpin that call. First, retirement plans‚Äîan $8.7‚ÄØtrillion pool‚Äîmay now allocate to crypto under a recent executive order. Second, the Trump campaign‚Äôs floated proposal to eliminate capital‚Äëgains tax on digital assets could, in Hayes‚Äô words, provide ‚Äúinsane war‚Äëdriven credit growth‚Äù with ‚Äúno fucking taxes.‚Äù The broader attraction for politicians, he claims, is demographic: younger and more diverse investors own crypto in greater proportions than they own equities, so a bull market would ‚Äúcreate a broader, more diverse set of people who are pleased with the ruling party‚Äôs economic platform.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? Even a credit‚Äëfuelled boom must find an audience for the mounting federal deficit. Hayes‚Äô solution is the stablecoin sector, which already places most of its assets under custody in US Treasury bills. On-chain data, he notes, suggest that roughly nine cents of every new dollar in total crypto market value migrates into stablecoins. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs assume that Trump propels the total crypto market cap to‚ÄØ$100‚ÄØtrillion by 2028,‚Äù he writes; ‚Äúthat would create roughly $9‚ÄØtrillion in T‚Äëbill purchasing power.‚Äù The mechanism recalls World War‚ÄØII financing, when the Treasury skewed issuance toward short‚Äëterm bills. In Hayes‚Äô view, a self‚Äëreinforcing loop emerges: wartime procurement fuels credit expansion, higher credit lifts crypto, larger crypto capitalization feeds stablecoin demand for T‚Äëbills, and those purchases backstop further deficits. Trading Tactics‚ÄîAnd The Year‚ÄëEnd Call Against that macro backdrop Hayes declares his investment vehicle, Maelstrom, ‚Äúfully invested,‚Äù and explains why: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty simple: Maelstrom is fully invested. Because we are degens, the shitcoin space offers amazing opportunities to outperform Bitcoin, the crypto reserve asset. Ether has been the most hated large-cap crypto. No more; the Western institutional investor class, whose chief cheerleader is Tom Lee, loves Ether. Buy first, ask questions later.‚Äù His numerical convictions are explicit: Bitcoin‚ÄØ$250,000 and Ether‚ÄØ$10,000 by 31‚ÄØDecember‚ÄØ2025. The Western credit geyser is, he writes, ‚Äúabout to tear the market a new asshole.‚Äù Yet he repeatedly reminds readers that these are personal views, not investment advice. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $118,368.

2025-07-23T11:50:10,"XRP's July Uptrend Threatened as Bitcoin's $120K Price Resistance Holds","This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin: Rangeplay continues with MACD teasing bearish flip Bitcoin (BTC) hit a record high above $123,000 on July 14, before entering a period of consolidation. Prices have since been range-bound between resistance at $120,000 and support at $116,000, with bulls once again failing to establish a foothold above the former in the past 24 hours. This choppy trading, along with the flattening of the intraday moving averages and the daily MACD histogram hinting at a bearish shift, has increased the risk of a pullback. Still, the uptrend line from the June lows remains intact, keeping hopes alive for a bullish resolution that could lead to new record highs. AI's take: Bitcoin is showing weakening momentum as it consolidates below the $120,000 resistance, with the MACD histogram hinting at a potential bearish shift. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000, $115,739, $111,965. XRP: July bullish trend threatened Like BTC, XRP (XRP) has lacked clear directionality lately, trading choppy between $3.35 and $3.65. What has changed in the past 24 hours is that the trendline representing the price rise from $2.2 to record highs has been breached, strengthening the case for a bearish resolution of the recent range play. Further, the spread between Bollinger bands has widened to levels that presaged the December correction. Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the asset's 20-day simple moving average. In case the lower end of the recent range fails to hold, there would be a risk of an extended down move. AI's take: While the Bollinger Band spread at a multi-year high points to extreme volatility and a coming breather, the breach of the uptrend line warrants caution for bulls. Resistance: $3.65, $4 Support: $3.35, $3, $2.65. Ether: Consolidation likely as Bollinger Bands widen Ether's (ETH) sharp ascent from its June lows near $2,200 has paused this week, with prices pulling back to $3,600 from a high of $3,850. A short-term consolidation in a broad range looks likely, as the daily chart's Bollinger Bands have widened to their highest level since April-May 2021. This widening is a classic technical signal that the market has experienced a period of extreme volatility and strong directional movement, suggesting it may now be due for a period of ranging or a ""breather"" before its next major move. This view is supported by the 14-day relative strength index, which has topped in the so-called overbought or above-70 zone. AI's take: Ether's rally has pushed its RSI above 70 and widened its Bollinger bands to their highest level since 2021, both signaling an extremely overbought market. Resistance: $4,000, $4,109 , $4,382. Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879. SOL: Looks north Solana's SOL (SOL) has pulled back to under $200 as of writing. Still, the bull case remains intact, as suggested by the upward-sloping intraday and daily chart moving averages. The Bollinger Bands have widened to their highest level since the first quarter, ending a prolonged low-volatility coil to suggest bullish directionality. Additionally, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to move above the 200-day SMA in what's known as the bullish golden cross. All of this suggests that SOL could tap the upper end of the rising channel with a potential move to $215 and higher. AI's take : The price action is contained within a well-defined ascending channel, demonstrating that the rally from the April lows is a strong and consistent uptrend. The recent breakout to the upper half of this channel further reinforces the bullish momentum. Resistance : $218, $252-$264. Support : $187-$185, $163 (the 50-day SMA), $145.
