Will it be Inverse Cramer Again?","Famous financial commentator Jim Cramer, in his statement on CNBC screens, recommended investors to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Cramer considered these two crypto assets as a hedge against the rapidly rising national debt of the United States. ‚ÄúGet some protection for yourself against the $37.8 trillion debt,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúGet it for your children, for future generations. Anyone who thinks that way is the same way I do. I don't want this debt. I'm worried about my children.‚Äù Related News: Huge Ethereum (ETH) Withdrawals Are Taking Place - CEO Reveals the Identity of the Whale Behind Them Cramer, who said that the growing national debt of the United States could pose serious economic risks in the long run, conveyed his message clearly to the audience by saying, ‚ÄúBuy some Bitcoin, buy some ETH.‚Äù However, Jim Cramer's statements have been widely debated, as there's a widespread belief in the cryptocurrency market that the analyst's sentiments are contradictory. Cramer, previously a staunch Ethereum supporter, announced that he had sold all his ETH and has refrained from commenting on the cryptocurrency market. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-23T17:54:33,"SEC Approves Bitwise ETF, Then Immediately Reverses Decision Hours Later","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted accelerated approval for Bitwise‚Äôs 10 Crypto Index ETF on July 22, only to reverse the decision hours later through a stay order. The approved ETF would have tracked ten digital assets, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , Solana , Cardano , SUI , Avalanche , Litecoin , Polkadot , and others, with at least 85% of its allocation dedicated to previously approved components, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

NYSE Arca received permission to amend its rules for listing the multi-asset fund before the Commission intervened. Assistant Secretary Sherry Haywood issued a stay notice under Rule 431, stating that the Commission would review the delegated action taken by the Division of Trading and Markets. Just hours after the initial approval, SEC Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood invoked Rule 431 to stay the order, sending the decision to the full Commission for further review and freezing the conversion process pic.twitter.com/aPjZlHEvdV ‚Äî Martyn Lucas Investor (@MartynInvestor) July 23, 2025 The reversal occurred despite the SEC finding the proposal consistent with Exchange Act requirements for preventing fraudulent practices and protecting investors. The dramatic policy flip comes as 72 crypto-related ETF applications await regulatory approval from providers including Grayscale, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Bloomberg Intelligence assigns 95% approval odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs this year, while existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue attracting billions in institutional inflows. Ethereum ETFs recorded $533.87 million in net inflows on July 22 , marking the third-largest single-day inflow since inception, while Bitcoin ETFs experienced $67.93 million in outflows. Regulatory Confusion Emerges as Multi-Asset Approval Process Stalls The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF approval represented a major expansion beyond existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products, with holdings weighted by market capitalization and monthly rebalancing. As of June 30, Bitcoin comprised 78.72% and Ethereum 11.10% of the proposed fund, with the remaining eight cryptocurrencies making up the rest. The SEC‚Äôs accelerated approval process typically applies to non-controversial rule changes that align with existing regulations. The Commission found Bitwise‚Äôs 85% allocation requirement for previously approved components to be sufficient to mitigate fraud and manipulation risks, consistent with prior 80% thresholds for similar products. NYSE Arca‚Äôs rule amendments would have allowed Trust Units issued by limited liability companies and explicitly permitted index-based investments. The changes included conforming corporate governance policies and eliminating shareholder meeting requirements, aligning with existing treatment of investment vehicles. The Division of Trading and Markets took the initial approval action under delegated authority before senior Commission officials intervened with the stay order. The reversal suggests disagreement within the SEC about multi-asset crypto product approvals despite technical rule compliance. Coinbase Custody Trust Company would have served as a digital asset custodian, while Bank of New York Mellon provided cash custody and administration services. The ETF structure included cash-based creation and redemption in 10,000-share units, with daily net asset value calculations using CF Benchmarks pricing data. Institutional Demand Surges Despite Regulatory Uncertainty Existing crypto ETFs continue to experience massive institutional adoption despite regulatory confusion. Ethereum ETFs have attracted $8.32 billion in cumulative inflows since their inception, with BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA leading Tuesday‚Äôs surge with $426.22 million. The fund now manages over $10 billion in assets, representing 2.24% of Ethereum‚Äôs circulating supply. Bitcoin ETFs hold a total of $154.77 billion in assets , despite recent outflows, accounting for approximately 6.5% of Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization. Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC recorded $7.51 million in inflows, while Ark Invest‚Äôs ARKB and Bitwise‚Äôs BITB experienced outflows exceeding $30 million each. The pending ETF pipeline includes applications for Dogecoin, MELANIA, TRUMP, and other meme tokens alongside serious institutional products. Most recently, 21Shares filed for an ONDO token ETF that tracks the native token of Ondo Finance, a layer-1 blockchain designed for institutional finance and the tokenization of real-world assets. Grayscale‚Äôs Digital Large Cap Fund conversion to ETF status faced similar approval-then-uncertainty patterns, with speculation mounting about potential stays.

2025-07-23T17:30:49,"Binance Unrealized Profits Hit A Record 60,000 Bitcoin Despite Falling Reserves","Binance Coin (BNB) just hit a new all-time high, surging to $804 a few hours ago as momentum in select altcoins continues despite broader market consolidation. While Bitcoin and Ethereum enter a period of sideways movement, BNB is breaking out with renewed strength. This bullish move comes amid strong fundamentals tied to Binance‚Äôs growing profitability and market dominance. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, Binance‚Äôs unrealized profit on its BTC reserves has climbed to a record 60,000 BTC, marking a new all-time high. This surge in unrealized gains is particularly notable given that Binance‚Äôs BTC reserves have actually been declining steadily since September 2024. As institutional demand grows and altcoins attract renewed interest, BNB‚Äôs performance may be a leading signal of what‚Äôs to come for the broader market. With Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilizing above key zones, Binance Coin stands out as a top performer, underpinned by rising exchange profitability and investor confidence. The coming days could be pivotal in confirming whether this move has room to run. Strategic Reserves: What Binance‚Äôs BTC Holdings Reveal Top analyst Darkfost has shared critical insights into Binance‚Äôs Bitcoin reserves, shedding light on the strategic decisions underpinning the platform‚Äôs operations. According to Darkfost, Binance‚Äôs core BTC reserve‚Äîprimarily used to support exchange activity and the BNB Chain ecosystem‚Äîhas declined from approximately 631,000 BTC in September 2024 to 574,000 BTC today. This trend underscores a calculated shift in reserve strategy rather than weakness, aligning with broader market changes and demand dynamics. In addition to this strategic reserve, Binance holds roughly 16,000 BTC in custodial wallets. These funds serve a specific purpose: backing the BTCB token and fulfilling user demand for tokenized Bitcoin within the BNB Chain environment. This structure allows Binance to maintain flexibility while ensuring liquidity and transparency across its ecosystem. Tracking these reserves offers a unique window into macro sentiment. Declining exchange reserves often point to increasing confidence among long-term holders, as more Bitcoin is withdrawn for cold storage or long-term holding. This behavior signals growing conviction that prices will continue rising. Notably, despite the reduction in total BTC holdings, the value of Binance‚Äôs remaining reserves has soared. The continued rally in Bitcoin‚Äôs price has pushed Binance‚Äôs unrealized profit to a record 60,000 BTC. This divergence, falling reserves yet rising profits, highlights the strength of this market phase and Binance‚Äôs ability to navigate it profitably. As the market matures, Binance‚Äôs reserve data will remain a valuable barometer of institutional and investor behavior. Price Analysis: Breakout Pushes BNB Into Price Discovery Binance Coin (BNB) has officially broken into uncharted territory, reaching a new all-time high of $804. The chart shows a sustained and aggressive uptrend, with BNB surging from the $670 zone in early July to nearly $800 in just weeks. This move confirms bullish momentum and strong market confidence. All key moving averages‚Äî50-day ($671), 100-day ($652), and 200-day ($642)‚Äîare trending upward, and price is well above all of them. This alignment confirms a robust bullish structure. The recent price surge has also been supported by a noticeable rise in trading volume, further validating the breakout. BNB has cleared all major resistance levels and is now in price discovery, meaning it‚Äôs exploring new highs with little technical resistance overhead. The clean break above the $720‚Äì740 zone was a key trigger for acceleration. Traders should now watch the $780‚Äì790 area as short-term support. As long as BNB holds this range, the bullish trend remains intact. With no historical resistance ahead, momentum could push toward $850 or higher‚Äîespecially if market sentiment stays strong and BTC/ETH remain in consolidation.

He said that the SEC was initially hesitant. They asked Teucrium and others to withdraw their filings, citing low liquidity in the futures market. Sal recalled that the government‚Äôs stance at the time forced firms like his to comply. Yet, he and his team continued to track the market closely. When they believed liquidity had improved, they refiled. SEC Changes the Rules Midway Teucrium filed its Bitcoin futures ETF under the 1933 Act, which came with a long 270-day approval timeline. Later that same year, former SEC ChairmanGary Gensler changed the rules and allowed filings under the 1940 Act, a quicker, 75-day process commonly used for mutual funds. Many large firms like BlackRock and Fidelity jumped in under this structure and got approvals faster, even though Teucrium had filed first. Talking to Thinking Crypto, Sal described this sudden shift as ‚Äúvery disconcerting,‚Äù explaining how it cost his firm valuable market opportunities. Despite this, Teucrium‚Äôs approved filing played a key role in Grayscale‚Äôs legal battle against the SEC. Sal said that Teucrium‚Äôs approval was referenced in the lawsuit, which Grayscale ultimately won.. Why Teucrium Is Betting on XRP Sal also shared why his firm has now filed for a leveraged XRP ETF, called ‚ÄúDouble XRP.‚Äù While he doesn‚Äôt consider himself a fan of coins like Ethereum or Solana, he understands and supports the mission behind XRP. According to him, Ripple‚Äôs focus on modernizing cross-border payments and replacing the outdated SWIFT system is both practical and powerful. He believes Ripple has consistently demonstrated professionalism and long-term strategy, particularly in improving the speed and efficiency of asset transfers. He said, ‚ÄúAnything that speeds up the system makes sense.‚Äù Rather than compete head-to-head with big firms like BlackRock and Fidelity for a basic spot XRP ETF, Teucrium filed for a more specialized leveraged XRP ETF.

2025-07-23T17:25:47,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Above $118,000 But $120,000 A Bridge Too Far For Now","Bitcoin (BTC) has maintained its position above $118,000 despite facing selling pressure over the weekend and dropping to a low of $116,144 earlier this week. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to reclaim $118,000 and reach $119,980 on Tuesday. However, it could not cross $120,000 and retreated during the ongoing session. BTC is down 1.48% during the ongoing session, trading around $118,201. Bitcoin ETFs Snap 12-Day Inflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs broke their 12-day inflow streak amid profit-taking, registering a net outflow of $131.5 million on Monday. The 12-day inflow streak had seen investors pour $6.6 billion into the ETFs. ARK Invest saw the largest outflow, shedding $77.6 million, followed by Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, which registered $36.7 million worth of inflows. Meanwhile, Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC registered outflows of around $12.75 million. Bitwise‚Äôs BITB and VanEck‚Äôs HODL also registered nominal outflows of $1.91 million and $2.48 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT did not register any inflows or outflows. The cumulative net inflows stand at a healthy $54.62 billion, while total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $151 billion, 6.52% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total market capitalization. The outflows came as investors and institutions locked in their profits to manage risk. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, stated, ‚ÄúThe recent ETF outflows reflect profit-taking near the highs and measured institutional rebalancing to lock in gains.‚Äù Strategy Owns 3% of Bitcoin (BTC) Supply Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy owns 3% of the Bitcoin (BTC) supply after completing its latest purchase of the asset earlier this week. The firm announced its latest purchase earlier this week, acquiring 6,220 BTC for $739 million, taking its total Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC , worth $72 billion at current prices. Strategy has used a combination of common and preferred shares, along with debt, to fund its Bitcoin purchases. The company began accumulating the asset in late 2020 as a hedge against inflation. In a separate announcement, Strategy stated that it planned to offer 5 million variable-rate Series A perpetual Stretch preferred shares to finance future Bitcoin purchases. Bitcoin (BTC) Unlikely To Hit $200,000 In 2025 Glassnode lead analyst James Check believes Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year as buying volume is not increasing enough to push prices higher. The observation comes amid several industry executives predicting a rally to $200,000. Check stated in an interview, ‚ÄúHow on earth can we be going up when there is no volume? $200,000 in six months is a big move ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big move.‚Äù Check added that a rally would double Bitcoin‚Äôs current market capitalization of around $2.38 trillion. However, he said he does not see such a move materializing until volumes increase. ‚ÄúCould it happen? Absolutely. Is it likely to happen? Very improbable. Until I see that volume kick in, until I feel a bit more confident, I am certainly not going to put on any levered positions. I‚Äôm probably not going to go out on the risk curve until I see that the market is stabilized.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) failed to reclaim $120,000 on Tuesday despite building on Monday‚Äôs positive start. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday before losing momentum and settling at $117,387. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 2%, crossing $119,000. However, it fell short of the $120,000 mark, settling at $119,980 before declining during the ongoing session. While BTC continues consolidating below $120,000, market analysts believe the bull cycle has some way to run. According to analytics firm Bitcoin Vector, although momentum has slowed, on-chain metrics indicate that the bullish structure remains intact. The firm stated in a post on X, ‚ÄúMomentum has cooled, but structure and fundamentals remain solid. This isn‚Äôt a top. It‚Äôs a coiled setup with support beneath it.‚Äù Bitcoin Vector explained that with the BTC price compressed, fundamentals have paused and are not weakening. Buyers could simply be waiting for confirmation of the breakout. Meanwhile, Swissblock analyzed Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term holder (STH) cost basis, stating that STHs were active and not exhausted. The STH cost basis is the average purchase price of investors who have held BTC for less than 155 days. According to Swissblocks, the price reached the ‚Äúheated‚Äù band of this metric on July 14, but did not push into the overheated zone. Swissblock added, ‚ÄúProfit-taking is present, but the STH risk zone at $138K hasn‚Äôt been reached. This suggests there's still room for expansion before we see any panic selling or euphoria.‚Äù BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 2% to $118,626. It soared past $120,000 on Monday, surging to a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,716, ultimately registering a 0.92% increase. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday as traders began locking in their gains. As a result, it fell almost 2%, dropping to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.82% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. BTC encountered volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Friday as BTC fell 1.03% to $117,877. The price remained bearish over the weekend, registering a marginal decline on Saturday and dropping 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240. BTC reached an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday, making a positive start to the week. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $117,397, ultimately registering a marginal increase.

2025-07-23T17:25:18,"Unveiling Jim Cramer‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin & Ether Bet for His Kids","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Jim Cramer‚Äôs Bold Bitcoin & Ether Bet for His Kids The financial world often buzzes with pronouncements from seasoned experts, but few spark as much debate and amusement as those from CNBC‚Äôs Mad Money host, Jim Cramer. In a move that has certainly turned heads, Jim Cramer recently declared his surprising desire to hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) for his children, viewing them as a crucial hedge against burgeoning U.S. debt. This statement is particularly intriguing given Cramer‚Äôs well-known, and sometimes contrarian, market forecasting track record. But what exactly drives this unexpected pivot towards digital assets, and what does it mean for the broader discussion around cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment for the future? Why Jim Cramer Sees Bitcoin and Ether as a Hedge? Jim Cramer‚Äôs rationale for embracing digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether is rooted in a fundamental concern about the future of traditional finance, specifically the escalating U.S. national debt. A ‚Äúhedge‚Äù in financial terms is an investment intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. In this context, Cramer views Bitcoin and Ether as potential safeguards against the devaluation of fiat currency and the erosion of purchasing power that could result from unchecked government spending and increasing debt burdens. Inflationary Pressures: As national debt grows, governments may resort to printing more money, which can lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin with its capped supply, are often seen as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin and Ether operate on decentralized networks, making them less susceptible to government interference or policy shifts that could impact their value. Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù serves as a robust store of value due to its scarcity and global accessibility, preserving wealth across generations. Long-Term Vision: Cramer‚Äôs emphasis on holding these assets for his children underscores a long-term investment perspective, suggesting he believes in their enduring value proposition beyond short-term market volatility. This perspective aligns with a growing sentiment among some investors who are seeking alternatives to traditional assets in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. The idea that digital assets could serve as a modern-day financial ark against the flood of national debt is gaining traction, even if the volatility of these assets remains a significant consideration. The Jim Cramer Effect: Navigating Market Predictions Jim Cramer is undeniably a polarizing figure in financial media. His enthusiastic, often theatrical, market predictions have earned him a loyal following, but also a reputation for being a ‚Äúcontra-indicator.‚Äù This phenomenon, humorously dubbed the ‚ÄúJim Cramer effect,‚Äù suggests that the opposite of his predictions often comes true. This makes his recent endorsement of Jim Cramer Bitcoin and Ether all the more fascinating for observers. For years, Cramer has offered advice across various asset classes, from stocks to commodities. While he has had notable successes, some of his more high-profile calls have famously gone awry, leading to the creation of inverse Cramer ETFs and online memes. This history prompts a critical question: should investors take his crypto endorsement seriously, or is it another signal to do the opposite? It‚Äôs crucial to differentiate between an individual‚Äôs personal investment philosophy and general market advice. Cramer‚Äôs decision to hold Bitcoin and Ether for his children speaks to his personal conviction about long-term wealth preservation, rather than a short-term trading tip. His evolving stance on cryptocurrencies also reflects a broader shift in mainstream financial perception, where once-skeptical figures are beginning to acknowledge the potential of digital assets. Ultimately, the ‚ÄúJim Cramer effect‚Äù serves as a reminder for all investors to conduct their own thorough research and not rely solely on any single personality‚Äôs pronouncements, regardless of their prominence. Personal financial decisions, especially regarding volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, should always be based on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and independent analysis. Understanding Digital Assets: Bitcoin and Ether‚Äôs Role To fully grasp Jim Cramer‚Äôs interest, it‚Äôs essential to understand what Bitcoin and Ether are and why they stand out in the vast digital asset landscape. Both are foundational cryptocurrencies, but they serve different, albeit sometimes overlapping, purposes. Bitcoin (BTC): The Pioneer Digital Gold Scarcity: Capped supply of 21 million coins, making it deflationary by design. Decentralization: Operates on a proof-of-work blockchain, secured by a global network of miners. Primary Use Case: Primarily functions as a store of value and a medium of exchange. It‚Äôs often compared to digital gold due to its scarcity and perceived hedge properties against inflation and economic uncertainty. Ether (ETH): The Fuel for Decentralized Applications Smart Contracts: Powers the Ethereum blockchain, which enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Utility: ETH is used to pay for transaction fees (gas) on the Ethereum network and is central to the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ecosystems. Evolving Supply: While not capped like Bitcoin, Ethereum‚Äôs transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge) and subsequent upgrades have introduced deflationary mechanisms, making its supply more dynamic. Here‚Äôs a simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ether (ETH) Primary Purpose Store of Value, Digital Gold Utility, Fuel for dApps, DeFi, NFTs Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Supply Cap 21 Million No fixed cap, but deflationary mechanisms Innovation Focus Security, Scarcity, Decentralization Scalability, Programmability, Ecosystem Development Both assets represent significant innovations in finance and technology. Jim Cramer‚Äôs interest in both suggests a recognition of their distinct yet complementary roles in a diversified digital asset portfolio, particularly one aimed at long-term wealth preservation. Is Jim Cramer‚Äôs Crypto Vision Right for Your Family? Actionable Insights While Jim Cramer‚Äôs personal conviction about holding Bitcoin and Ether for his children is noteworthy, it prompts a broader question for every individual and family: are digital assets a suitable addition to your long-term investment strategy? The decision to invest in cryptocurrencies should be approached with caution, comprehensive research, and a clear understanding of the associated risks and potential benefits. Benefits of Considering Crypto as a Long-Term Asset: Potential for High Returns: Historically, cryptocurrencies have offered significant returns, though past performance is not indicative of future results. Diversification: They can offer diversification from traditional asset classes, as their price movements may not always correlate with stocks or bonds. Technological Advancement: Investing in crypto is also an investment in a burgeoning technology that could reshape global finance and digital interactions. Challenges and Risks to Be Aware Of: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for extreme price swings, which can lead to substantial losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving globally, posing risks for investors. Security Concerns: Digital assets are susceptible to hacking, fraud, and loss if not stored securely. Complexity: Understanding the underlying technology and market dynamics can be challenging for new investors. Actionable Insights for Your Investment Journey: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on celebrity endorsements. Understand the technology, market cap, use cases, and risks of any crypto asset. Start Small: Begin with a small percentage of your overall portfolio that you are comfortable losing. Long-Term Horizon: If you‚Äôre considering crypto as a hedge, adopt a long-term investment mindset to ride out short-term volatility. Secure Your Assets: Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Stay Informed: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Continuously educate yourself on market trends, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and risk tolerance, seek guidance from a qualified financial professional. Jim Cramer‚Äôs endorsement is a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, but it should serve as a starting point for your own diligent exploration, not as a definitive guide. Investing for your children‚Äôs future requires a thoughtful and responsible approach, prioritizing education and risk management above all else. Summary: Jim Cramer‚Äôs surprising revelation about wanting to hold Bitcoin and Ether for his children as a hedge against U.S. debt highlights a fascinating intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. While Cramer‚Äôs market predictions often invite skepticism, his personal long-term conviction underscores a growing narrative around cryptocurrencies as potential safeguards against economic uncertainty. Both Bitcoin and Ether offer distinct value propositions, from Bitcoin‚Äôs role as digital gold to Ether‚Äôs utility in decentralized ecosystems. However, for any investor, particularly those considering digital assets for their family‚Äôs future, thorough research, understanding of volatility and risks, and a long-term perspective are paramount. Ultimately, Cramer‚Äôs move serves as a powerful catalyst for a broader discussion on how digital assets might fit into a diversified portfolio aimed at preserving wealth across generations.

2025-07-23T17:22:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $118K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC‚Äôs price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the so-called ‚ÄúTrump trade,‚Äù with the president-elect‚Äôs positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: ‚ÄúDoes Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWill Bitcoin go up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere will Bitcoin be in 5 years?‚Äù Let‚Äôs answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $117,614 (-1.1%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $118,498 24-hour low $117,455 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $118,075 Price Prediction $‚ÄØ128,009 (10.76%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 1.77% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $‚ÄØ106,055 200-Day SMA $‚ÄØ87,760 14-Day RSI 54.56 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin struggles in holding above $118K. Resistance for BTC is at $120,838 Support for BTC/USD is at $115,736 The BTC price analysis for 23 July confirms that BTC faces a surge in bearish volatility as the price struggled to hold around $118K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation below $118K. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces bearish volatility toward $118K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced minor bearish pressure as it failed to hold above $118K. Currently, sellers are triggering minor domination, resulting in a drop below immediate Fib levels toward $117.5K. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.73 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $117,614, declining by over 1.1% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level but trades around the bullish region at 59.9, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $118K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.9, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders‚Äô confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC‚Äôs price holds momentum above $120,838, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,185. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $115,736, beginning a bearish trend to $107,777. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $118K. However, the rejection triggered a downward trend for BTC price. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin‚Äôs price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its ‚Äúhalving‚Äù events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we‚Äôll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025‚Äôs halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan‚Äôs Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of ‚ÄúBitcoin bubble‚Äù in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year‚Äôs start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October‚Äôs Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T17:18:13,"Strategy: The $84 Billion Bitcoin Flywheel","Summary MicroStrategy stock surged ~25% since coverage began, outperforming the S&P 500‚Äôs 9% return during the same period. The company holds 607,770 Bitcoins worth ~$71.96 billion, while trading at a ~$120.87 billion market capitalization. The $84 billion ""42-42 Capital Plan"" aims to raise $42B in equity and $42B in debt to scale. A prolonged crypto winter could cripple MSTR‚Äôs capital flywheel, with $12B in liabilities and no organic cash flow to cover them. Despite $12B in liabilities, including debt and preferred stock, MSTR uses leverage to boost Bitcoin-per-share growth. Investment Thesis Since initiating coverage on MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), the stock has surged ~25%, far outperforming the S&P 500‚Äôs 9% price return. The analysis was focused on the company‚Äôs Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) accumulation strategy through capital markets that generated $15.7 billion in unrealized gains. Today, that thesis has evolved into a capital flywheel. Strategy‚Äôs main strength lies in its systematic use of equity and debt at a premium to its Bitcoin NAV that is allowing it to outperform even BTC itself. This strategy, combined with new fair-value accounting standards and $84 billion capital plans push MSTR as the most leveraged, and potentially rewarding, Bitcoin proxy. seekingalpha.com Strategy Targets Bitcoin Per Share Growth via $84 billion Capital Flywheel Strategy's main strength is in its execution of a strategic capital-to-Bitcoin acquisition flywheel. This is far more than a simple corporate treasury strategy of buying and holding an asset. It is a self-reinforcing mechanism to leverage the public capital markets to systematically increase its Bitcoin holdings per share. The entire operation is predicated on the significant premium at which its stock trades relative to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium expressed as the mNAV multiple (Market Capitalization divided by Bitcoin NAV) serves as the value-creation machine that separates Strategy from any passive investment vehicle, including the big spot Bitcoin ETFs. By converting its inflated equity value into additional Bitcoin, the company creates a narrative for investors that can continue to outpace the performance of Bitcoin itself. This flywheel is not a byproduct of its stock performance. It is an architected and transparently communicated corporate strategy that may continue to support its growth. strategy.com/charts The mechanics of this flywheel is in fundamental market arbitrage. Based on the provided data, Strategy's market capitalization stands at ~ $120.87 billion with the market value of its 607,770 bitcoins is ~$71.96 billion as of writing. This yields an mNAV multiple of roughly 1.68x that means the market values the company at a 68% premium to its direct Bitcoin holdings. It is the gap that the company exploits. When Strategy executes an at-the-market (ATM) offering, as observed in its recent sale of 1.64 million shares for $736.4 million , it is effectively selling its equity at this 1.68x premium. For every dollar of underlying Bitcoin value that a new share represents, the company receives $1.68 in cash. This additional $0.68 refers to as a ""BTC Gain,"" that represents an immediate and direct value accretion for existing shareholders. The capital raised is then deployed to purchase more Bitcoin that is increasing the total size of the company's treasury. Because the capital was raised at a premium, the number of Bitcoins acquired with that capital outpaces the dilutive effect on a value-for-value basis. In short, this is increasing the total amount of Bitcoin for each pre-existing share. strategy.com/history The Q1-FY25 earnings call reveals the $84 billion ""42-42 Capital Plan"" that is a framework to raise $42 billion in equity and $42 billion in fixed income . This plan solidifies the flywheel and signaling that the company intends to continue this process at scale. Michael Saylor‚Äôs aim on framing the company as a ""crypto reactor"" that runs on volatility and market premiums is a source for continued stock value growth. He argues that this active management and value creation is the reason why investors should pay a premium for MSTR over a passive spot ETF. An ETF merely provides exposure to Bitcoin's price movement. However, Strategy holds the potential for leveraged outperformance through its treasury operations. This active, value-accretive process creates a loop and justifies the stock's premium, and this premium enables the flywheel to continue operating, driving further accretive acquisitions and supporting the company‚Äôs long-term growth beyond the passive appreciation of its core asset. Strategy Q1 Strategy Bets $12 Billion on Leverage to Amplify Bitcoin Gains Strategy's most vital problem is its aggressive and ever-expanding use of leverage that has become an indispensable component of its growth. From a traditional perspective, the company‚Äôs balance sheet exhibits numerous red flags that signal excessive risk and potential instability. The debt and preferred equity need the dependence on capital markets to service its obligations rather than organic cash flow. The multi-layered nature of its financing instruments create a weakness. However, Strategy has not sought to mitigate this weakness but has instead supported it. The company is transforming leverage from a source of risk into a tool for expanding returns for its stockholders. This calculated move, that the rewards of leveraged Bitcoin acquisition will outweigh the associated financial risks, is a main feature of its corporate strategy. The company carries a big burden of +$8 billion in debt, primarily structured as convertible notes,and an additional +4 billion in various series of preferred stock (including STRC). This is a total of ~$12 billion in liabilities that hold a claim on the company‚Äôs assets senior to that of its common stock. This figure represents a material ~17% of the company's entire Bitcoin NAV with fixed annual obligations for interest and dividend payments. Critically, these obligations are not covered by the cash flow from its legacy software business but rather by the proceeds from ""new stock issuances."" This practice of issuing new equity/debt to pay the interest on old debt is a hallmark of financial distress in conventional sense. Why? The company has a complete dependence on favorable capital market conditions to remain solvent. The capital is stacked with the stock and four distinct series of preferred stock (STRK, STRF, STRD, STRC), each with unique dividend yields and terms, in addition to multiple tranches of convertible bonds. This complex structure can make it hard to determine the actual risk profile of the company. strc-investor-presentation Despite these risks, Strategy has inverted this weakness into a growth driver. The company‚Äôs leadership, particularly Michael Saylor, has a clear framework for how this leverage generates superior returns (""BTC Torque"") on common stock. The logic is that raising capital through debt + preferred stock is more accretive than issuing equity when the mNAV premium is high. When Strategy issues $100 million of its 10% perpetual preferred stock (Strife), it acquires $100 million in cash to purchase Bitcoin without any immediate dilution to the common share count. The entire upside from these newly acquired Bitcoins accrues to the benefit of existing stockholders with the only cost being the 10% annual dividend. This single transaction generates a ""BTC dollar gain"" of the full $100 million and a BTC yield of 0.19%-points. Whereas, raising the same $100 million via common stock at a 2x mNAV would yield a gain of only $50 million and a yield of just 0.09%-points. Overall, this comparison points to how the weakness of leverage is wielded as a tool for amplification. This entire strategy is a high-stakes move on the forward price of Bitcoin. The company is borrowing capital at a fixed and known cost to invest in a highly volatile asset that it believes will appreciate at a far greater rate. The spread between Bitcoin's return and the cost of servicing its complex capital structure represents the pure profit generated for MSTR stock. By deliberately taking on the risk associated with this leverage, Strategy aims to grow its Bitcoin-per-share holdings at an accelerated pace for outsized growth that would be impossible to hit through unlevered financing. Built for Bull Runs, Exposed to Crypto Winters MicroStrategy‚Äôs strategy is genius in upmarkets but vulnerable in downtrends. A key risk to the thesis is an extended crypto winter where Bitcoin prices stagnate or drop for several months. Bitcoin typically loses momentum 12-18 months after the halving cycles and usually goes on multi-quarter pullbacks. We‚Äôre about 15 months out from the prior halving cycle , and the risk of Bitcoin losing momentum, especially should macro tightening re-engage or retail sentiment die back, is rel. MSTR‚Äôs entire capital flywheel is based on maintaining a healthy market premium over its Bitcoin NAV. If Bitcoin prices drop sharply, or the mNAV multiple contracts due to broader crypto pessimism, the company‚Äôs ability to raise accretive capital (via equity or preferreds) dries up. Worse, its $12 billion in fixed liabilities (this is mostly debt and preferred dividends) don‚Äôt pause when crypto pauses. Unlike a passive ETF, MSTR has actively committed funding with little recurring operating cash flow to fund them. If the capital markets lose faith and Bitcoin drops, MSTR could face a squeeze both ways: falling asset values and tightening funding options. The flywheel that amplifies upside could just as easily magnify the downside. calebandbrown.com Takeaway MicroStrategy isn‚Äôt just buying Bitcoin, it‚Äôs engineering a capital flywheel that converts market premiums into accelerated Bitcoin-per-share growth. By strategically using leverage and equity at a premium, MSTR is outperforming Bitcoin itself. For investors seeking amplified BTC exposure, this is arguably the boldest, and potentially most rewarding, Bitcoin proxy on the market.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803538-strategy-84-billion-bitcoin-flywheel?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-07-23T17:10:23,"Trump AI: A Bold Strategy to Unleash Innovation in the US-China Race","BitcoinWorld Trump AI: A Bold Strategy to Unleash Innovation in the US-China Race For those closely tracking the dynamic intersection of technology, finance, and policy, particularly after engaging events like Bitcoin World Disrupt, the recent unveiling of the Trump administration‚Äôs AI Action Plan signals a pivotal shift. This strategy, prioritizing aggressive growth and deregulation, promises to reshape the AI landscape, impacting everything from critical infrastructure to innovation and even the competitive stance against global rivals like China. It‚Äôs a move that could have profound implications for the future of digital assets and the broader tech ecosystem. How Does Trump‚Äôs AI Strategy Prioritize Growth? The Trump administration‚Äôs AI strategy , as outlined in its much-anticipated AI Action Plan, marks a significant departure from previous cautious approaches. Instead of primarily focusing on addressing the risks of artificial intelligence, it champions rapid development, infrastructure expansion, and reduced bureaucracy. The core tenet of this Trump AI philosophy is clear: a resounding call to ‚ÄúBuild, Baby, Build!‚Äù This aggressive stance downplays immediate concerns about AI‚Äôs potential harms, instead focusing on an ambitious build-out of data centers and related infrastructure. The administration envisions this as the definitive path to a ‚Äúnew golden age of human flourishing,‚Äù justifying significant taxpayer investment in the process. This forward-looking approach also includes initiatives for upskilling the American workforce and partnering with local governments to create jobs within the burgeoning data center sector, aiming to ensure that economic benefits are broadly distributed. Boosting AI Data Centers : What‚Äôs the Deregulatory Drive? A cornerstone of the Trump administration‚Äôs plan is the expedited development of AI data centers , semiconductor fabrication facilities, and robust power sources. The administration contends that existing environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act, currently impede this crucial progress. To overcome these perceived obstacles, the plan advocates for streamlining permitting processes, creating categorical exclusions, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41. This includes leveraging federal lands, even national parks and military bases, for critical infrastructure development. The strategy also addresses America‚Äôs energy grid stability, urging large power consumers, such as AI companies, to manage their consumption during critical grid periods. This point has drawn scrutiny, given past criticisms of companies like xAI and Meta for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities with their energy-intensive operations. Navigating AI Regulation : Will States Lose Control? The AI Action Plan signals a clear intent to limit state-level AI regulation . While a controversial provision in the budget bill that would have barred states from regulating AI for 10 years was recently removed from Senate consideration, the Trump administration proposes alternative mechanisms to achieve similar aims. The plan suggests a direct linkage between states‚Äô federal funding and their compliance with AI regulatory limits. Furthermore, it directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with its existing obligations and authorities, particularly concerning radio, television, and the internet, opening a potential avenue for federal intervention. On the federal level, the Office of Science and Technology Policy will solicit feedback from businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that might hinder AI innovation and adoption, with the ultimate goal of further deregulation. The Intensifying US China AI Race : What‚Äôs at Stake for National Security? Central to the Trump administration‚Äôs AI strategy is the intensifying US China AI race . The plan explicitly targets national security threats, aiming to prevent ‚Äúadversarial technology,‚Äù such as Chinese-made chips and hardware, from entering the U.S. supply chain. It mandates federal agencies to work collaboratively to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one notable effort, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. ‚ÄúNational security‚Äù is a recurring theme throughout the document, appearing 23 times, underscoring the deep integration of AI into U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus. The plan calls for regular assessments of U.S. AI adoption compared to rivals like China, adapting strategies accordingly, and evaluating risks posed by both domestic and adversary AI systems. Within the Department of Defense, the strategy emphasizes upskilling the military workforce, automating workflows, and securing preferential access to compute resources during national emergencies, solidifying America‚Äôs competitive edge. Beyond Infrastructure: What Defines Trump‚Äôs Broader AI Strategy ? Beyond infrastructure and international competition, Trump‚Äôs broader AI strategy places significant emphasis on protecting free speech and ‚ÄúAmerican values.‚Äù This includes a directive to eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and climate change from federal risk assessment frameworks, aiming for what it describes as ‚Äúobjective‚Äù AI systems. The plan states that it is essential for AI systems to be ‚Äúbuilt from the ground up with freedom of speech and expression in mind.‚Äù It also suggests updating federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with frontier large language model developers who ‚Äúensure their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.‚Äù This stance, however, raises complex questions about defining and enforcing ‚Äúneutrality‚Äù in AI models, a challenge highlighted by experts. Furthermore, the plan actively encourages the development and adoption of open AI models, particularly those created with American values in mind. This move is largely seen as a direct reaction to the rise of open-source AI models from Chinese AI labs like DeepSeek and Alibaba‚Äôs Qwen. To foster this, Trump‚Äôs plan aims to ensure that startups and researchers working on open models have access to large, expensive computing clusters, resources typically only available to major tech companies through multi-million or billion-dollar contracts with cloud providers. This aspect could significantly benefit American AI companies and organizations that have embraced an open approach, including Meta, AI2, and Hugging Face. Balancing Innovation with Responsibility: Challenges Ahead While the Trump administration‚Äôs AI Action Plan outlines an ambitious vision for American AI leadership, it also presents significant challenges and potential points of contention. The strong emphasis on deregulation and rapid infrastructure build-out, particularly concerning AI data centers , raises environmental concerns and questions about community impact. Critics have pointed to instances where rapid development has bypassed environmental safeguards, leading to localized pollution. The ‚Äúwar on biased AI‚Äù and the push for ‚Äúobjective‚Äù systems could lead to complex legal and ethical debates regarding free speech, censorship, and the very definition of neutrality in artificial intelligence, as legal scholars like Eugene Volokh have noted. Defining and enforcing ‚Äúneutrality‚Äù in AI models remains a formidable task, with some experts suggesting that true neutrality might be ‚Äúliteral non-engagement.‚Äù While the plan includes some provisions for AI safety and security, such as research into interpretability and adversarial robustness, it generally reduces the reporting burden on tech companies compared to previous administrations, which could raise questions about accountability and risk mitigation. The plan‚Äôs focus on integrating AI into national security also necessitates careful consideration of ethical AI use in defense and intelligence. The success of this ambitious AI strategy will ultimately hinge on its execution and its ability to balance rapid innovation with responsible development and addressing the societal implications of AI. Conclusion: A New Era for American AI? The Trump administration‚Äôs AI Action Plan undeniably charts a bold, growth-centric course for American AI. It signals a readiness to invest heavily in infrastructure, cut bureaucratic hurdles, and aggressively compete on the global stage, particularly against China in the burgeoning US China AI race . For those tracking the broader tech and crypto markets, this shift could mean new opportunities in data center development, AI-driven applications, and potentially a redefinition of regulatory frameworks. The emphasis on deregulating the development of AI data centers and limiting state-level AI regulation could accelerate technological progress but also ignite debates over environmental and ethical safeguards. However, its execution will be key, and the delicate balance between rapid innovation and addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns will define its ultimate success. The plan sets the stage for a transformative, albeit potentially contentious, era in American AI development, one that promises to reshape the technological landscape for years to come.

2025-07-23T17:08:38,"Mara Holdings raise $1 billion in convertible notes to expand its BTC holdings","Mara Holdings, a major crypto miner, said on Wednesday it plans to issue up to $1‚ÄØbillion of convertible senior notes to raise money for new Bitcoin purchases. According to its announcement , the company will offer $850‚ÄØmillion of these notes to qualified institutional purchasers. The notes are due to mature in 2032. In addition, investors can purchase up to $150‚ÄØmillion more in principal, which could raise the total proceeds to $1‚ÄØbillion if the option is exercised. Mara said the company plans to use up to $50‚ÄØmillion of the net proceeds to repurchase a piece of its outstanding 1.00‚ÄØpercent convertible senior notes that mature in 2026. The balance of the funds will be set aside for capped‚Äëcall transaction fees, the purchase of Bitcoin at roughly $118,487 a coin, and general corporate expenses. The new notes will rank as Mara‚Äôs senior unsecured obligations and won‚Äôt carry any interest payments. The offering remains subject to conditions such as the market, the company said, and it has not set a final date for pricing or completion of the sale. Mara reiterated that BTC is central to its treasury strategy In its latest remarks, the company reiterated that Bitcoin is central to its treasury strategy and that accumulating digital currency is a key part of its long‚Äëterm plan for growth. This news follows Mara‚Äôs minority investment completion in Two Prime, an institutional adviser that oversees $1.75‚ÄØbillion in assets. The deal will significantly boost Bitcoin managed by Two Prime for Mara, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. In early June, Mara reported that its Bitcoin output rose by 35‚ÄØpercent in May, despite ongoing higher difficulty in mining and a rising network hashrate. Figures from late May released by the company also showed its annual revenue from mining exceeded $752‚ÄØmillion, setting a new record for its operations. As of this publication, Mara is holding 50,000‚ÄØBTC, serving as part of its digital asset reserve. With that amount, Mara ranks as the second-largest corporate BTC holder, behind Strategy, which reports 607,000‚ÄØBTC in its own treasury. The announcement follows a late‚ÄëMarch filing in which Mara said it had agreements with institutional investors to sell $2‚ÄØbillion of its stock. ‚ÄúWe currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,‚Äù the firm added. Trump Media acquired $2 billion in BTC again Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, acquired about $2‚ÄØbillion in BTC this week and related securities to solidify its position as a company with a crypto treasury. It also allocated roughly $300‚ÄØmillion for securities related to Bitcoin. Trump Media said it will continue adding to its Bitcoin holdings and may convert the company‚Äôs options into BTC based on the conditions of the market. In May, the firm joined a growing list of companies following the crypto treasury model from Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy. PSQ Holdings, in which Trump Jr. serves as a member of the board, has also said that it will be exploring a treasury strategy involving digital assets. ‚ÄúThese assets help ensure our company‚Äôs financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we‚Äôre planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,‚Äù said Devin Nunes, chief executive officer and president of Trump Media. Based in Sarasota, Florida, Trump Media said it will use its BTC holdings to bring revenue. It may also purchase more crypto coins. Shares of Trump Media rose more than 7‚ÄØpercent following the announcement, though the company‚Äôs stock has fallen about 45‚ÄØpercent in 2025.
