2025-07-23T06:30:17,"Bitcoin is Heading to $200,000: Why MAGACOIN Has More Upside","Bitcoin just broke through a new all-time high of $118,667 on July 11, 2025 ‚Äî a level that would have seemed unbelievable just a year ago. But market analysts believe the uptrend is just beginning, with Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expecting the Bitcoin price to reach $200,000 by year‚Äôs end. So, if Bitcoin is primed for further gains, where does that leave the next wave of altcoins? For some early-stage investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer an even more interesting angle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Meme-Powered Altcoin To Watch So, what exactly is MAGACOIN FINANCE? It‚Äôs a decentralized political meme coin designed for holders who want more than just speculation. Unlike DOGE or SHIB, which lean on humor and viral memes, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built around the ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù theme, giving it an instantly recognizable identity. Its zero-tax model means there are no hidden fees for buying, selling, or transferring the MAGA token. That‚Äôs a major difference from typical meme coins that quietly tax holders to fund central treasuries. Here, the community owns 100% of the supply ‚Äî no venture capital or dev wallets holding everyone hostage. Metric Detail Supply Fixed at 170 billion tokens Audit Fully verified by HashEx Control 100% community ownership Tax Zero-tax model Still Early Presale: Timing and Upside Could MAGACOIN FINANCE really deliver more upside than BTC? For traders hunting early-stage opportunities, the numbers show there‚Äôs still room. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs successful fundraising so far sits at just $11.2M raised, keeping it well below the big-cap meme coins. Many see this as a phase of still early presale, where holders are positioning ahead of broader listings. Unlike Bitcoin, which is already heavily institutionalized, this meme-powered altcoin gives retail buyers more control over supply shocks. As funds rotate from major layer-ones, alt-chain capital rotation favors the MAGACOIN narrative. The project‚Äôs unique political edge sets it apart from coins like XRP, ADA, or ETH, which rely on enterprise use cases rather than grassroots identity. Bitcoin‚Äôs Supply Squeeze Fuels Broader Crypto Moves As Matt Hougan explained in a recent interview, Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúmassive, unrelenting demand is meeting limited supply,‚Äù with ETFs alone adding $5.2 billion in BTC over just 30 days. These flows keep pushing price ceilings higher, and that enthusiasm often spills over into the altcoin market. BTC 7D price chart from CoinGecko When Bitcoin rallies, retail investors typically look for high-upside plays that match the market‚Äôs energy but with lower barriers to entry. That‚Äôs where narrative-driven coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE come in. While BTC may be about institutional hedging, MAGACOIN is about community power and ideology. MAGACOIN‚Äôs Branding vs XRP, ADA, and DOGE Unlike XRP, which battles regulatory headlines, or ADA and ETH, which pitch smart contract scaling, MAGACOIN FINANCE is all about the grassroots holder. It fuses ideological branding with real tokenomics ‚Äî no big treasury, no constant dilution. This anti-centralization theme is resonating. Holders see it as a decentralized political memecoin that can‚Äôt be easily captured by whales. Its tight supply model mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs own scarcity narrative, which is what many believe will push BTC toward $200,000 by year-end. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE see a similar narrative lift on a smaller scale? That‚Äôs the trend many are betting on as the meme coin market pivots from jokes to identity-driven community projects. Final Takeaway: More Than a Meme Bitcoin‚Äôs path toward $200,000 reminds everyone how powerful a fixed supply and strong narrative can be. MAGACOIN FINANCE takes that same scarcity-driven model and layers on an ideological message that resonates deeply with its target community. For holders seeking early-stage exposure to a meme-powered altcoin that combines decentralization, zero tax, and American political branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE may stand out as one of the few genuinely narrative-driven tokens ready to catch the next wave.

2025-07-23T06:20:21,"XRP/BTC Approaches Major Breakout From 8-Year Resistance","A chart posted by investor and self-proclaimed crypto millionaire Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) has caught the attention of market watchers because it shows that XRP/BTC is once again testing a trendline that has capped the pair for nearly eight years. This resistance, drawn from a high point in 2017, has triggered lower highs since then, forming the upper boundary of a long-term descending triangle pattern . Now, that structure appears to be under threat. XRP: Long-Term Resistance Under Pressure The chart utilizes a 2-week timeframe and outlines a narrowing consolidation range that dates back to 2017. A breakout above the descending resistance currently located just below the 0.00003400 BTC level would mark a major technical event for XRP. The asset has been in a multi-year downtrend versus Bitcoin, and recent price action indicates that the pair is approaching the upper trendline once again, currently sitting at around 0.00002993 BTC. ‚ÄúThis is not just a random breakout, but a generational wealth opportunity,‚Äù Gordon wrote. While such claims are bold, the technical structure he references is not easily dismissed. The formation, bound by a falling upper trendline and a gradually rising lower trendline, has been respected by the market since 2017. The asset‚Äôs price is currently near the apex of this triangle, suggesting that a decisive move is approaching. XRP/BTC is about to smash through its 8 year resistance level. This is not just a random breakout, but a generational wealth opportunity. And guess what? XRP Spot ETFs aren't approved yet, which makes this breakout just a beginning. Double-digits XRP is not a meme anymore,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/pj586vG6q3 ‚Äî Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 21, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Repeated Tests and Momentum Shift The XRP/BTC pair briefly rallied into this resistance zone in 2018 and early 2025, but failed to close above it. However, XRP recently reached a new all-time high , and with its renewed strength, traders are watching to see whether this third major test results in a clean breakout. A close above 0.00003400 BTC with volume could confirm the move and shift long-term momentum in XRP‚Äôs favor. Potential Catalysts and Double-digit Targets Adding to the narrative is the fact that spot XRP ETFs have not yet been approved. Gordon referenced this point in his post, noting that such regulatory catalysts could fuel further upside. He believes the current phase is just the beginning, and spot ETF approval could start another phase of growth for XRP, amplifying price discovery and clearing technical barriers. Gordon concluded, ‚ÄúDouble-digits XRP is not a meme anymore, it‚Äôll be a reality in 2025.‚Äù XRP has become undeniable in 2025, and even Bitcoin maximalists have set double-digit targets for the asset. The asset is currently on the verge of a breakout, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before we see a move to these high targets.

2025-07-23T06:15:19,"Unveiling Critical Insights: BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Explained","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Critical Insights: BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Explained Are you looking to sharpen your edge in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading? Understanding market sentiment is paramount, and few metrics offer as clear a window into trader psychology as the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios provide a real-time pulse on whether the collective market is leaning towards bullish (long) or bearish (short) positions. For anyone navigating the volatile waters of Bitcoin derivatives, knowing these figures can be the difference between anticipating a move and being caught off guard. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: A Key Indicator? In the realm of cryptocurrency trading, BTC perpetual futures contracts are a cornerstone for many professional and retail traders. Unlike traditional futures, they don‚Äôt have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely, provided they maintain sufficient margin. The long-short ratio, in essence, measures the proportion of open long positions versus open short positions on these contracts. A higher long percentage suggests a bullish sentiment, indicating more traders expect prices to rise, while a higher short percentage points to a bearish outlook. This ratio isn‚Äôt just a number; it‚Äôs a reflection of aggregated trader sentiment across major exchanges. It helps us gauge the prevailing mood: are traders feeling optimistic and buying, or are they pessimistic and selling short? This collective wisdom can offer valuable clues about potential price movements, especially when extreme imbalances occur. A Glimpse into the Latest BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment: 24-Hour Overview Let‚Äôs dive into the most recent 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot offers immediate insights into how traders are positioning themselves as Bitcoin navigates its current market cycle. Total Market Sentiment (Past 24 Hours): Long: 50.33% Short: 49.67% This overall ratio suggests a remarkably balanced market sentiment, with a slight lean towards long positions. Such a near 50/50 split indicates a lack of strong consensus among traders, which can sometimes precede periods of consolidation or heightened volatility as neither bulls nor bears hold a significant upper hand. Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios: Spotting Nuances While aggregated data provides a broad overview, examining individual exchange data for BTC perpetual futures can reveal interesting nuances. Different exchanges cater to different demographics of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes highlight unique sentiment pockets or trading strategies. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the top three exchanges: Exchange Long (%) Short (%) Binance 51.20% 48.80% Bybit 49.30% 50.70% Gate.io 48.71% 51.29% What do these individual exchange figures tell us? Binance: With a noticeable lean towards long positions (51.20%), Binance traders appear slightly more bullish than the overall market average. This could indicate a higher retail participation base on the platform. Bybit: Bybit shows a slight tilt towards short positions (50.70%), suggesting a segment of its traders might be anticipating a minor correction or are engaging in hedging strategies. Gate.io: Similar to Bybit, Gate.io also displays a short bias (51.29%), indicating a cautious or bearish sentiment among its user base. These variations can stem from factors like user demographics, liquidity, and even funding rates specific to each platform. Understanding these nuances helps traders refine their strategies. Leveraging BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios for Your Trading Strategy How can you integrate this valuable data into your daily trading decisions for BTC perpetual futures ? Here are some actionable insights: Gauge Overall Market Sentiment: Use the aggregated ratio to understand the general mood. A very high long ratio (e.g., 60%+) might indicate over-optimism and a potential for a ‚Äúlong squeeze,‚Äù where prices drop sharply, forcing longs to liquidate. Conversely, an extremely high short ratio could signal a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù Identify Potential Reversals: When the long-short ratio reaches extreme levels, it often acts as a contrarian indicator. If almost everyone is long, there are fewer buyers left to push the price higher, making a correction more likely. Confirm Trends: A rising price accompanied by a growing long ratio can confirm a bullish trend. Similarly, a falling price with an increasing short ratio supports a bearish trend. Spot Divergences: Pay attention if the price is moving in one direction, but the long-short ratio is moving in the opposite direction. This divergence can signal a weakening trend or an impending reversal. Remember, while the long-short ratio is a powerful tool, it should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis. No single indicator provides a complete picture. Challenges and Considerations When Analyzing BTC Perpetual Futures Data While invaluable, relying solely on long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures comes with its own set of challenges: Lagging Indicator: The data reflects past positioning. Rapid market shifts can quickly render it outdated. Whale Activity: A few large ‚Äúwhale‚Äù traders can significantly skew the ratios, potentially misleading retail traders. Funding Rate Influence: Funding rates can influence positioning, sometimes artificially inflating one side of the ratio as traders seek to collect funding. Context is Key: A 55% long ratio might be normal in a strong bull market but extremely bullish in a bear market. Always consider the broader market context. By being aware of these limitations, you can use the long-short ratio more effectively and avoid common pitfalls. In conclusion, the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures provide a vital snapshot of market sentiment. While the overall market currently shows a near-even split, individual exchange data reveals interesting variations, with Binance leaning slightly bullish and Bybit and Gate.io showing a minor bearish bias. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any trader looking to navigate the complex world of Bitcoin derivatives. By integrating these ratios with other analytical tools and acknowledging their limitations, you can gain a significant edge in anticipating market movements and refining your trading strategies. Stay informed, stay strategic, and may your trades be profitable! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Q1: What exactly are BTC perpetual futures? A1: BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin‚Äôs price without an expiry date, requiring margin maintenance. Q2: How is the long-short ratio calculated? A2: It‚Äôs calculated by dividing total open long positions by total open short positions on an exchange, reflecting bullish vs. bearish sentiment. Q3: Is a high long-short ratio always bullish? A3: Not always. Extremely high ratios can be a contrarian indicator, suggesting over-optimism and a potential for reversal as fewer buyers remain. Q4: Why do long-short ratios differ across exchanges? A4: Differences stem from varying user demographics, regional preferences, liquidity, funding rate mechanisms, and market maker strategies unique to each platform. Q5: How can I use this data to improve my trading strategy for BTC perpetual futures? A5: Use it to gauge overall market sentiment, identify potential reversals at extreme ratios, confirm trends, and spot divergences. Always combine with other technical and fundamental analysis.

2025-07-23T06:11:08,"Investment Bank Piper Sandler Issues Bitcoin Price Warning for the Coming Weeks","US-based investment bank Piper Sandler warned that Bitcoin could retreat in the coming weeks due to its high correlation with stock markets, despite its strong performance in recent months. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler, warned in an investment note published Tuesday that profits should be taken from stocks that have risen the most in the relief rally that has continued since early April. ‚ÄúMarkets have shifted from the inflationary recession scenario they priced in on April 8th to what is now being described as a 'Goldilocks' economic outlook, neither too hot nor too cold. The stocks most at risk during this period are high-beta, low-quality stocks that appreciate without improving their earnings outlook,‚Äù Kantrowitz said. Kantrowitz, claiming that a similar risk exists for Bitcoin, said, ‚ÄúCryptocurrency is very closely directionally correlated with risk appetite in equity markets. Therefore, any sell-off in which a macroeconomic risk is priced in, Bitcoin is likely to decline in the short term.‚Äù Bitcoin, which has gained 54% since its market bottom in April, reached a new all-time high last week. This rise was driven by increased interest from institutional investors through Bitcoin ETFs and the strategy of holding BTC in corporate treasuries. The S&P 500 index returned a more modest 27% during the same period. Related News: JUST IN: Popular Cryptocurrency Platform May Launch Its Own Altcoin, Sources Say While Bitcoin has been less volatile this year, it still closely aligns with global risk appetite. For example, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on April 3rd, Bitcoin fell 5%, while the S&P 500 fell 4%. This suggests that Bitcoin still trades in tandem with riskier assets during periods of heightened macroeconomic fears. Piper Sandler notes that the August 1st tariff deadline hasn't been sufficiently priced into the markets. However, a potential surprise could disrupt the current ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù environment, with a modest increase in consumer prices expected over the next three to four months. Kantrowitz noted that this scenario could complicate market expectations for a short-term interest rate cut. August is historically known as a weak month for both Bitcoin and stocks due to the decline in trading volume during the summer months. Kantrowitz emphasized that his warnings were not a general negative outlook for US stock markets, adding, ‚ÄúThis is more of a tactical and risk-management move. While valuations are expensive, we expect earnings to continue to drive stocks higher, but with less speculative leadership.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-23T06:00:43,"SharpLink Acquires 79,949 Ethereum, Expands Treasury to 360,807 ETH","SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed company chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, has increased its Ethereum (ETH) reserves by nearly 30% in a strategic treasury move. The company acquired 79,949 ETH between July 14 and July 20 at an average price of $3,238 per token, bringing its total holdings to 360,807 ETH. The acquisition comes amid a broader trend of corporates diversifying treasury strategies by incorporating digital assets like Ethereum. Staking Activity and Market Strategy To fund the purchases, SharpLink raised $96.6 million through its at-the-market (ATM) equity program, issuing approximately 3.8 million shares. According to the company, the funds are not fully deployed, leaving room for additional ETH acquisitions in the coming weeks. This move strengthens the firm‚Äôs position as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, positioning the token as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company‚Äôs ETH Concentration metric, which gauges crypto exposure per share, rose to 3.06, reflecting a 53% increase since mid-June. Since announcing its digital treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has earned 567 ETH in staking rewards, highlighting its intent to generate yield while maintaining long-term holdings . The weekly ETH purchase of nearly 80,000 tokens marked the company‚Äôs largest acquisition during any reported period, signaling continued execution of its accumulation strategy. SharpLink emphasized that its treasury model aligns with its broader business goals and shareholder value enhancement efforts. Chairman Joseph Lubin, who is also the founder of Consensys and a well-known figure in Ethereum‚Äôs development , stated that the company‚Äôs treasury strategy aims to capitalize on market conditions to build a substantial ETH reserve. Lubin noted in the company‚Äôs latest update. The continued strength of ETH and our ability to acquire significant volume at opportunistic prices support our aim to continue enhancing ETH concentration and shareholder value through disciplined execution of our treasury growth strategies. Policy Developments and Regulatory Context In addition to its ETH expansion, SharpLink also responded to regulatory developments , specifically the recent passage of the GENIUS Act by US President Donald Trump. The bipartisan legislation introduces a federal framework for stablecoins and digital asset operations, requiring full asset backing, regular audits, and clear issuer guidelines. SharpLink expressed support for the bill, citing its potential to create a more favorable climate for blockchain integration and innovation. Lubin remarked that the legislation reduces regulatory ambiguity, enabling firms like SharpLink to build more confidently in the digital asset space. Lubin¬†said. With the GENIUS Act now law, the regulatory uncertainty that has surrounded crypto innovation is finally easing. We believe this ushers in a more supportive environment for companies like SharpLink to‚Ä¶ harness the full potential of Ethereum ‚Äî including its security, scalability and smart contract utility. With more capital still available for ETH purchases and favorable legislative conditions emerging, SharpLink‚Äôs Ethereum-based treasury strategy may continue to expand. The firm‚Äôs alignment with Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem positions it to capitalize on infrastructure growth, institutional adoption, and broader market developments in the crypto space.

2025-07-23T06:00:18,"Grayscale Eyes BONK and BNB, but MAGACOIN Is the Real Contender to Watch","Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be emerging as the political memecoin market‚Äôs next serious challenger? Daily new wallet additions for this meme-powered altcoin are quietly on the rise, outperforming many small caps on sheer user traction. Meanwhile, analyst mentions in crypto newsletters have tripled over the past month, pointing to a growing narrative: MAGACOIN isn‚Äôt just a novelty play. It offers a real alternative to BONK, underpinned by zero-tax transactions, strong ideological appeal, and expanding cross-wallet utility that‚Äôs fueling its climb. In a market chasing fresh contenders, that blend of community governance and functional growth is pushing MAGACOIN into the spotlight. MAGACOIN: Political memecoin with a purpose Unlike BONK or even BNB, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its explicit ideological brand as a decentralized political memecoin . Built around an anti-centralization ethos and zero-tax transactions, it taps directly into a cultural segment often overlooked by purely speculative meme tokens. Recent announcements on MAGACOIN‚Äôs new cross-wallet compatibility aim to solve fragmentation issues, letting holders move assets seamlessly across major chains. This utility-first expansion is catching attention. MAGACOIN‚Äôs community has already been lauded for driving grassroots marketing efforts that position it as more than just a meme gamble. Instead, it‚Äôs evolving into a politically charged store-of-value narrative with tangible usage, differentiating it from BONK‚Äôs primarily ecosystem-dependent growth or BNB‚Äôs traditional exchange utility. Grayscale‚Äôs strategic pivot: BONK, BNB‚Äîand wider sector hunts Grayscale‚Äôs July update has electrified crypto circles. Its expanded asset watchlist now includes BONK and BNB among 28 newly tracked tokens, alongside AI and DeFi players like Mantle and Monad. This follows hot on the heels of the SEC‚Äôs conditional approval of Grayscale‚Äôs Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) ETF‚Äîa multi-crypto product currently delayed by procedural disputes. The asset manager‚Äôs aggressive move to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into meme coins and ecosystem plays signals one thing: even institutions see meme-driven volatility as a strategic hedge. For BONK, this news compounds existing momentum. BONK‚Äôs daily volumes recently surged past $539 million on Bonk.fun, with token burns and buybacks pushing it toward a potential golden cross. However, skeptics note that BONK‚Äôs core dependence on Solana token launches could limit its broader cross-chain reach. Could MAGACOIN outshine BNB or BONK this quarter? As Grayscale‚Äôs institutional spotlight widens, altcoins like BONK and BNB benefit from fresh inflows and potential ETF chatter. Yet MAGACOIN‚Äôs trajectory suggests it could carve a unique lane. With XRP dealing with lingering SEC clarity despite price targets pushing toward $5, and BONK facing the ceiling of Solana-centric expansion, MAGACOIN‚Äôs broader multi-chain, ideology-driven pitch offers a rare combination of narrative and functionality. Moreover, MAGACOIN‚Äôs zero-tax model is proving attractive to traders looking to sidestep compounding transaction fees that still burden swaps in ecosystems like BNB‚Äôs. As analysts track wallet activity, the steady uptick in MAGACOIN addresses is a hard on-chain metric supporting this story. The market‚Äôs next phase: diversification with values Grayscale‚Äôs aggressive watchlist expansion underscores how 2025 isn‚Äôt just about Bitcoin or even big-layer chains anymore. Investors are exploring new frontiers: utility meme coins, politically anchored tokens, and community-owned protocols. MAGACOIN FINANCE encapsulates this trend. It‚Äôs not simply chasing speculative hype like many meme plays; its community governance and cultural identity create a narrative that institutions can‚Äôt replicate with ETFs alone. For traders and crypto observers, the big takeaway is clear: while Grayscale‚Äôs interest in BONK and BNB is headline-worthy, the real alpha may lie in decentralized political memecoins like MAGACOIN‚Äîprojects that blend meme culture with genuine, ideology-fueled financial ecosystems.

2025-07-23T05:59:58,"21Shares Files for Spot ETF Tied to Ondo Finance‚Äôs Native Token","Exchange-traded fund provider 21Shares is pushing further into the tokenized finance sector, filing with U.S. regulators for a spot ETF that tracks the native token of Ondo Finance. Key Takeaways: 21Shares has filed for a spot ETF that would directly hold ONDO. Ondo is building out institutional-focused tokenization infrastructure. Tokenized real-world assets are on the rise, with $25B now on-chain. According to a preliminary prospectus submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the proposed ‚Äú21Shares Ondo Trust‚Äù will hold ONDO tokens directly and follow the CME CF Ondo Finance-Dollar Reference Rate. Coinbase will act as custodian of the tokens. The fund is designed to be a passive investment vehicle, with no leverage or active speculation. Shares can be created or redeemed in cash or in-kind. ONDO Powers Layer-1 Blockchain Built for Institutional Finance and RWAs ONDO is the utility token powering Ondo Chain, a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain purpose-built for institutional finance and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). With a current market cap of $3.5 billion and a circulating supply of 3.1 billion tokens, ONDO is priced at $1.12, down 48% from its December peak of $2.14, per CoinGecko. Among the token‚Äôs notable backers is World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated DeFi platform. The group purchased $250,000 worth of ONDO in December and currently holds 342,000 tokens, valued at around $383,000, per Nansen data. Still, ONDO accounts for just 0.2% of the platform‚Äôs $208 million portfolio, which leans heavily on stablecoins, wrapped Ether, and Bitcoin. MASSIVE ALERT: $ONDO is the next institutional darling!

Earlier in July, the protocol acquired SEC-registered broker-dealer Oasis Pro to advance its tokenized securities strategy. The move, made in collaboration with Pantera Capital, is seen as a bid to bridge traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. Oasis Pro, which operates as an Alternative Trading System and SEC-registered transfer agent, has been a FINRA member since 2020. Ondo‚Äôs broader vision was laid out in February with the launch of Ondo Chain, its dedicated blockchain designed to cater to Wall Street firms and institutional-grade tokenization. The filing comes amid a surge in tokenized real-world asset activity. On-chain RWA value has jumped 58% this year to nearly $25 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum currently dominates the space, with 55% of RWA tokenization activity, largely in private credit and U.S. Treasurys. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. As reported, Singapore-headquartered edtech firm Genius Group has doubled its Bitcoin holdings to 200 BTC after acquiring 20 BTC last week, part of a wider strategy to build a 10,000-BTC treasury. Public companies are increasingly adding altcoins like Ether (ETH), Solana‚Äôs SOL, and XRP to their treasury strategies, according to a report from Animoca Brands Research. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy popularized this model by holding over 600,000 Bitcoins as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
