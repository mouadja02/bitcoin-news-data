2025-07-23T09:55:21,"Bitcoin Price Alert: Decoding the Sudden Drop Below $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Alert: Decoding the Sudden Drop Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with the latest market movement: Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has recently experienced a significant tumble, falling below the $118,000 mark. This crucial development has sent ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to ponder the immediate implications and future trajectory of the Bitcoin price . According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC was observed trading at $117,968 on the Binance USDT market. This dip, while not unprecedented in Bitcoin’s volatile history, certainly commands attention and warrants a deeper dive into its potential causes and consequences. For anyone invested in or considering entering the crypto space, understanding these market shifts is absolutely essential. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Movement? When the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip, it’s rarely due to a single, isolated event. Instead, it’s typically a complex interplay of various factors, both internal to the crypto market and external macroeconomic forces. Understanding these triggers is key to interpreting market behavior. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader global economic landscape significantly influences risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Concerns over persistent inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks (such as the Federal Reserve), and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, pulling funds from more speculative assets. When traditional markets show signs of instability, the ripple effect often reaches the crypto market, impacting the Bitcoin price . Market Sentiment and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to news and rumors. Negative regulatory news from major economies, concerns over the solvency of crypto exchanges or lending platforms, or even widespread social media speculation can quickly erode investor confidence. This FUD can trigger panic selling, creating a downward spiral for prices. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: Professional traders and algorithms often rely on technical indicators and support levels. When the Bitcoin price breaks below a significant psychological or technical support level, such as the $118,000 mark, it can trigger automatic sell orders and encourage further selling pressure as traders anticipate continued declines. Whale Activity: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can exert considerable influence on the market. A significant sell-off by one or more whales can inject a large supply of Bitcoin into the market, overwhelming demand and causing a rapid decline in price. Tracking these large movements is a constant endeavor for market analysts. Liquidity Issues: While Bitcoin is highly liquid, sudden large sell orders in a specific market can temporarily overwhelm buying interest, especially if liquidity is concentrated on a few exchanges. This can lead to rapid price discovery downwards until new buyers step in. The confluence of these factors often creates a perfect storm, leading to sharp corrections in the Bitcoin price , reminding us of the inherent volatility that defines this innovative asset class. The Immediate Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Wider Market A sudden drop in Bitcoin price below a key level like $118,000 doesn’t just affect Bitcoin itself; it sends tremors throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The immediate aftermath can be a period of heightened uncertainty and rapid re-evaluation for all market participants. Investor Reaction and Sentiment: For many investors, a sharp decline triggers a mix of fear and opportunity. Some may panic sell to cut losses, contributing to further downward pressure. Others, particularly those with a long-term conviction, may view it as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, looking to accumulate more Bitcoin at a perceived discount. This divergence in reaction often creates choppy market conditions. Altcoin Correlation: Bitcoin is often considered the bellwether of the crypto market. When the Bitcoin price moves significantly, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) tend to follow suit. A drop in BTC usually leads to a corresponding decline across most altcoins, although some may experience more severe percentage losses due to their smaller market caps and higher volatility. Projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano often see their prices influenced heavily by Bitcoin’s performance. Liquidation Events: For traders using leverage, a sharp drop in price can trigger forced liquidations. When the value of their collateral falls below a certain threshold, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent further losses, which can amplify selling pressure and accelerate the price decline in a cascading effect. This is a particularly dangerous aspect of highly leveraged trading during volatile periods. Market Narrative Shift: A significant price drop can shift the overall market narrative from bullish optimism to cautious pessimism. Media coverage might focus more on the risks and challenges of cryptocurrency investment, which can further deter new entrants and put pressure on existing holders. Potential for Rebound: While immediate impact can be negative, history shows that significant dips in Bitcoin price often precede periods of strong recovery. The question becomes whether the underlying fundamentals remain strong enough to attract new buying interest and overcome the bearish sentiment. Understanding these immediate impacts is crucial for investors to make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively in the face of market volatility. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for Bitcoin Price Swings The recent drop in Bitcoin price serves as a potent reminder that volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. While it can be daunting, experienced investors employ several strategies to navigate these swings and potentially turn them into opportunities. Here’s how you can approach periods of significant price movement: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, especially during periods of market stress, thoroughly research Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its underlying technology, and its long-term potential. Rely on credible sources like Bitcoin World and avoid making decisions based solely on social media hype or fear. Understanding why the Bitcoin price is moving helps in making rational choices. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the asset’s price. When the price is high, your fixed amount buys fewer units; when the price is low, it buys more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and reduces the risk associated with trying to ‘time the market.’ It’s an excellent approach for mitigating the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuations. Implement Robust Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This golden rule is paramount in volatile markets. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential downside if the price continues to fall beyond a certain point. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, perhaps into other asset classes or even stablecoins, can also reduce overall risk exposure. Maintain a Long-Term Vision (HODL): For those who believe in Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential and its role as a digital store of value, significant price dips can be viewed as temporary setbacks on a long-term growth trajectory. The ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) philosophy encourages investors to ride out short-term volatility based on a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. Historically, Bitcoin has recovered from far more severe corrections. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: While it’s important to be aware of market developments, constantly checking charts and reacting to every minor fluctuation can lead to emotional decisions. Follow reputable news outlets and analysis, but avoid getting caught up in the daily noise. Focus on the broader trends and the factors influencing the long-term Bitcoin price . By adopting these disciplined strategies, investors can approach market volatility with a clearer mind and a more resilient portfolio, rather than being swept away by fear or greed. What Does This Bitcoin Price Dip Mean for the Future? While the recent drop in Bitcoin price below $118,000 may seem concerning in the short term, it’s crucial to view such movements within the broader context of Bitcoin’s historical performance and its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Bitcoin has a proven track record of resilience, often recovering from significant corrections to reach new all-time highs. Historical Resilience: Bitcoin has endured numerous dramatic price crashes throughout its history, only to rebound stronger. Each major correction has often purged speculative excess from the market, paving the way for more sustainable growth. This inherent resilience suggests that while dips are painful, they are a normal part of its growth cycle. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The cryptocurrency market is far more mature now than it was during previous cycles. We’re seeing increased institutional adoption, clearer regulatory discussions (even if slow), and the development of more robust financial products like Bitcoin ETFs. This growing infrastructure provides a stronger foundation, potentially cushioning future drops and supporting long-term growth for the Bitcoin price . Upcoming Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s supply is programmatically capped, and its issuance rate is cut in half approximately every four years through an event known as ‘halving.’ Historically, these halving events have preceded significant bull runs due to the reduced supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. While not an immediate factor, future halvings remain a powerful long-term driver for the Bitcoin price . Global Adoption Trends: Despite short-term price volatility, the fundamental adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology continues to expand globally. More businesses are accepting crypto payments, more countries are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and awareness is growing. This increasing utility and acceptance are strong long-term tailwinds. A Test of Conviction: For many, these dips are a test of conviction. They separate those looking for quick gains from those who truly believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset. The current Bitcoin price action, therefore, can be seen as a necessary market correction that strengthens its foundation for future growth. In essence, while short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin price remains tied to its fundamental strengths, increasing utility, and the relentless innovation within the broader crypto space. Informed investors understand that patience and a long-term perspective are often rewarded. Conclusion The recent fall of the Bitcoin price below $118,000, as reported by Bitcoin World and observed on Binance, underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. This movement is a result of a complex interplay of macroeconomic pressures, market sentiment, technical indicators, and whale activity. While such dips can trigger immediate concerns, they are also a fundamental characteristic of a maturing asset class. For investors, understanding these triggers and their immediate impacts is crucial. More importantly, adopting disciplined strategies such as Dollar-Cost Averaging, robust risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective are vital for navigating volatility. History has shown Bitcoin’s remarkable resilience, consistently recovering from significant corrections to achieve new milestones. As the market matures, with increasing institutional interest and ongoing technological advancements, the long-term outlook for the Bitcoin price remains compelling, albeit with the continued expectation of short-term fluctuations. Stay informed, stay strategic, and approach the crypto market with a well-researched perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $118,000? The recent drop in Bitcoin price is likely due to a combination of factors, including broader macroeconomic concerns (like inflation and interest rate hikes), negative market sentiment fueled by regulatory news or FUD, technical breakdowns below key support levels, and potential large sell-offs by significant holders (whales). It’s rarely a single cause but rather a confluence of these elements. Q2: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Whether it’s a ‘good’ time to buy depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Some investors view significant dips in Bitcoin price as opportunities to ‘buy the dip’ and accumulate more at a lower cost, especially if they have a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value. Others prefer to wait for signs of market stabilization. Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can help mitigate risk by spreading purchases over time. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s price volatility affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often acts as the market leader for the broader cryptocurrency space. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant volatility, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) typically follow suit. A sharp drop in Bitcoin often leads to a corresponding decline across most altcoins, while a strong Bitcoin rally can pull the rest of the market up. This correlation is a key characteristic of the crypto market. Q4: What are some common strategies for managing Bitcoin price risk? Key strategies include: 1) Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to average out your purchase price over time; 2) Setting Stop-Loss Orders to limit potential losses; 3) Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin; 4) Only investing what you can afford to lose ; and 5) Conducting thorough research (DYOR) to understand the asset’s fundamentals. Q5: What is the long-term outlook for Bitcoin’s price? Despite short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin price remains largely positive for many analysts and investors. This is based on Bitcoin’s scarcity, its growing adoption as a digital store of value and medium of exchange, increasing institutional interest, and the anticipation of future halving events that reduce new supply. While dips are expected, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated strong resilience and growth over longer periods. Did you find this analysis helpful?

2025-07-23T09:47:32,"Strategy's 4th Preferred Stock: STRC Is Here To Attack Money Market Funds","Summary Strategy's capital structure is a masterclass in financial engineering, creating a Bitcoin-backed yield curve to attract diverse investor capital efficiently. The new STRC preferred stock is designed as a low-duration, high-yield instrument to directly compete with money market funds, offering superior yield and stability. STRC's price stabilization mechanisms ensure principal preservation and yield competitiveness, drawing capital away from traditional cash equivalents and fueling further Bitcoin accumulation. I remain bullish on Strategy's common and preferreds, as each issuance strengthens the capital stack, increases intrinsic value, and perpetuates the Bitcoin accumulation flywheel. If you’ve been following my coverage of Strategy’s ( MSTR ) capital structure, you know I’m a firm believer in Saylor’s vision to develop Strategy into the ultimate levered Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) investment vehicle by essentially selling superior financial securities to the market. I previously covered ( STRK ) and ( STRF ) extensively here and here , while my previous article on STRD, their third preferred stock, highlighted how Saylor’s financial engineering creates a self-reinforcing flywheel, capturing capital from diverse investor classes to fuel Bitcoin accumulation. With STRC (STRC), Strategy takes this utterly corporate finance textbook-shuttering plan to a new level, introducing a low-duration, high-yield security designed to compete directly with money market funds. So, beyond further opening up its capital stack, Strategy is set to optimize its yield curve further. In fact, as I am about to explain, Strategy is setting itself to attract capital at unprecedented efficiency through STRC by creating what you can think of as a ""black hole"" in the world of short-term yield parking. Building the Yield Curve We have so far witnessed how Strategy's capital structure is a carefully crafted ecosystem, with each preferred (STRK, STRF, STRD, and now STRC) serving a distinct purpose in attracting capital from different investor profiles, which, in turn, Strategy leverages by attaching an at-the-money offering program. By issuing securities with varying risk/reward characteristics, Saylor and Co. is effectively building a Bitcoin-backed yield curve, where each instrument settles a specific niche in terms of duration, yield, and seniority. This system enables Strategy to tap into a broad spectrum of capital markets, ranging from risk-tolerant equity investors ( MSTR ) to conservative fixed-income seekers ( STRF ), to those seeking a middle ground ( STRK ) or even those willing to sit at a lower seniority level for higher yield ( STRD ), while minimizing financing costs and maximizing Bitcoin accumulation. MSTR's Yield Curve (STRC IPO Presentation) In my previous article, I explained how the introduction of STRD, a high-yield, junior preferred stock with a 10% dividend, was an indirect move to elevate the creditworthiness of STRF, the senior-most preferred in the capital stack. By offering a “junky” security with the exact same 10% yield as STRF, Strategy effectively pushed STRF’s perceived safety higher, encouraging investors to bid up its price above par, thus lowering its effective yield. This dynamic has allowed Strategy to issue STRF at a premium, raising capital at a lower cost while reinforcing the collateral base backing the entire capital structure. The result is a virtuous cycle where each new issuance strengthens the senior securities, attracts more capital, and funds further Bitcoin buys. MSTR's Preferred Stock Yields (STRC IPO Presentation) You can see in the chart above how my prediction played out quite accurately. The moment STRD entered the chat, the market has been chasing all three preferreds higher in order for each to more accurately reflect its underlying risk/reward ratio. The reality that the market is also getting increasingly educated about how these products are indeed superior to their tradfi peers (i.e., STRF is a superior credit instrument versus any other super long-term competitor, from the 30-Y US bond to Austria's 100-Y government bond ) has also contributed to this rally. It’s also clear that capital keeps flowing steadily into Strategy’s preferreds, especially when you compare them to the broader market. Just look at the underwhelming performance of the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF ( PFF ), which has lagged well behind. Again, this makes total sense as Strategy's preferreds are structurally superior in every shape or form, including the fact that they are overcollateralized multiple times over against Strategy's BTC holdings. MSTR's Preferreds vs. PFF (STRC IPO Presentation) STRC: The Money Market Competitor Now, here comes STRC, a perpetual preferred stock with a variable monthly dividend , initially set to deliver a high yield but (in my view) engineered to stabilize just above money market fund rates. Unlike say STRF, which competes with ultra-long-duration instruments due to its perpetual nature, STRC is engineered to be a low-duration security, offering investors near-cash-like stability with a superior yield. This positions STRC as a direct competitor to money market funds , which typically provide low yields (currently around 4-5% in a high-rate environment) but are prized for their liquidity and principal preservation. The financial engineering behind STRC is nothing short of marvelous (or crazy, depending on which camp you are sitting in). Strategy basically aims to maintain STRC’s price close to its $100 par value through a series of levers: If STRC trades at $101 or above: Strategy can (1) decrease the dividend rate, (2) issue additional STRC via secondary offerings at or below $101, or (3) call STRC at $101. If STRC trades at $99 or below: Strategy can (1) increase the dividend rate or (2) cease selling STRC in at-the-market (ATM) offerings below $99. STRC's Price Manipulation Mechanisms (STRC IPO Presentation) These mechanisms synthetically ensure that STRC remains a highly attractive, stable investment, mimicking the principal preservation of money market funds while offering a higher yield. Initially, STRC’s yield may be elevated to draw capital, potentially in the 9.5% to 10% range. However, as the security gains traction, I believe Strategy will fine-tune the dividend to hover just above money market fund rates, say, 4% to 5% in 3% to 3.5% rate environment. This strategy ensures STRC remains competitive compared to investing in a money market fund, thus gradually drawing capital away from traditional cash equivalents. It's essentially an attack on money market funds. Now here's where things get really interesting. In a scenario where the money market fund rates drop to 1-2% in a low-rate environment (as they did in the early 2020s - they, in fact, went negative in Europe ), STRC could offer a 2.5% to 3% yield, providing a premium while still being an ultra-low-cost financing tool for Strategy. This is a win-win as STRC holders enjoy a higher yield than money market funds with comparable principal stability, while Strategy secures cheap capital to acquire Bitcoin, which they project will appreciate at a CAGR of 21% over the next 21 years. The Flywheel: Why This Isn’t a Ponzi Scheme I know that many believe that Strategy’s non-stop issuance of common and preferred shares looks like a Ponzi scheme, as it relies on new capital to sustain dividends and fuel Bitcoin purchases. However, this perspective misses the mark of Strategy's engineering. As I argued in my STRD article, Strategy isn’t just issuing securities for the sake of raising capital. It is instead creating superior financial products that attract capital precisely because they offer better risk/reward profiles than competing instruments. Now, skeptics will proudly counter by arguing that this structure depends on MSTR’s common stock trading above par to fund preferred dividends, which is both very risky and dilutive. However, the accretive nature of Strategy’s preferreds supports the common stock’s premium . By issuing STRC, STRD, STRK, and STRF, Strategy raises capital at low costs, acquires more Bitcoin, and strengthens the collateral base backing the entire capital stack. This increases the intrinsic value of MSTR’s common stock, thus justifying its >1mNAV multiple. In the flywheel effect, each preferred issuance fuels Bitcoin accumulation, which boosts the value of the common per share, which in turn supports further preferred issuances. Besides, issuing common stock above NAV to pay preferred dividends is by definition accretive. If your common stock is trading at 2x NAV, you are selling $1 for $2 to pay dividends, which is something you want to do all day long. This is why, as long as, in theory, the engineering after Strategy's instruments remains legit, I remain bullish on common and its preferreds. I have also been selling OTM puts on the common as the premiums are just too juicy not to harvest them. I am looking forward to reading your thoughts on STRC. I know it's a very new instrument, and there's nothing quite like it on the market, so feel free to leave your questions, and I will try to address each one to the best of my ability.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803335-strategys-4th-preferred-stock-strc-is-here-to-attack-money-market-funds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|STRK","PFF|BTC-USD|MSTR|STRK|STRF|STRD",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T09:43:08,"SEC May Soon Grant Highly-Awaited Approval for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs! ""Positive Developments!"" Bloomberg Analyst Explains","While positive decisions regarding the cryptocurrency industry continue to come from the SEC, the latest news came for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Accordingly, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said that the SEC is increasingly likely to approve in-kind refunds for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Seyffart cited numerous filings filed with the SEC yesterday, stating that progress has been made with the SEC following recent filings by issuers to add in-kind payments to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. At this point, Seyffart noted that five issuers with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the CBOE have amended their prospectuses, citing “positive action” from the SEC regarding approval of in-kind redemptions for their funds. These include Invesco Galaxy, Ark 21Shares, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Fidelity. The analyst noted that these changes could be a sign that issuers have reached an agreement with federal regulators regarding their demands to add in-kind reimbursements to BTC and ETH ETF funds. “More positive signs regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs becoming available for in-kind creation and redemption Five different funds on the CBOE have filed amendments with the SEC. This to me indicates positive movement and likely fine-tuning at the SEC.” Spot redemption is a method where ETF investors are repaid with actual virtual assets (cryptocurrencies) rather than cash, and is considered advantageous in terms of market efficiency and taxation. *This is not investment advice.

While Schiff maintains his stance as a staunch Bitcoin skeptic, the presence of BTC and other digital assets in his portfolio reflects the irony of his public persona, and perhaps the ongoing evolution of the crypto conversation, even among its most vocal critics.

2025-07-23T09:35:15,"JPMorgan Explores Crypto-Backed Loans and Stablecoins as Bitcoin Hyper Surges","JPMorgan is reportedly exploring directly lending $BTC and $ETH by 2026, while also turning its attention to stablecoins. The largest bank worldwide possibly accepting crypto as collateral is a huge deal. It confirms that traditional banking entities are finally taking crypto seriously. It’s also a major win for Layer 2 (L2) solutions, like Bitcoin Hyper . As more institutional investors gravitate to $BTC, the need for faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin infrastructure grows. Bitcoin Hyper is in a prime position to support this increased demand. JPMorgan Might Step Into Crypto Alongside Morgan Stanley JPMorgan’s favorable crypto stance comes after years of skepticism from Jamie Dimon, the bank’s CEO. Back in 2017, Dimon called $BTC a ‘fraud’ and said that he’d ‘fire any employee trading $BTC on the company’s accounts.’ Years later, his viewpoint hadn’t softened much. In January 2025, he referred to $BTC as ‘a Ponzi scheme’ and ‘as useless as a pet rock.’ But now, just months later, he seems to have come around. And it’s no wonder. Other banking giants are entering the Web3 arena, and JPMorgan is unlikely to want to be left behind. Morgan Stanley, for instance, plans to roll out crypto trading on its E*Trade platform in 2026, allowing clients to buy and sell $BTC and $ETH directly. Still, as the biggest TradFi player internationally, JPMorgan offering crypto-backed loans would mark one of the most significant institutional validations of digital assets to date. Especially if $BTC (currently trading at over $118K ) becomes acceptable collateral on Wall Street. And that happening isn’t far-fetched, as institutions are already treating $BTC as a core asset. For example, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) holds over $72B in $BTC, which places it ninth among all S&P 500 firms by treasury size, ahead of heavyweights, like Exxon, NVIDIA, PayPal, and CVS. However, as demand for the #1 crypto continues to skyrocket (also propelled by Donald Trump praising $BTC as ‘the world’s first public digital payments infrastructure’), network congestion and high fees on the original Bitcoin network are inevitable. But fear not. This is where Bitcoin Hyper comes in. Bitcoin Hyper to Fix Bitcoin’s Flaws Ahead of Wall Street Demand Once launched in Q3 2025, Bitcoin Hyper sets out to fix some of the Bitcoin network’s biggest woes – slow transaction speeds, high fees, and limited smart contract capabilities. Integrated with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it aims to bring high-performance dApp functionality to Bitcoin. As a result, it’ll unlock use cases that were previously only possible on other blockchain networks, like Ethereum. To create a faster, cheaper, and more scalable user experience, it’ll leverage a Canonical Bridge , enabling $BTC to switch between Bitcoin’s L1 and L2. And all will be achieved without sacrificing decentralization, which is the core principle of blockchain tech, after all. $HYPER is the linchpin of the entire ecosystem. It facilitates governance rights and staking rewards at a sizable 221% APY. Once the L2 officially launches, it’ll also help you save funds on gas fees. Given that a whopping 30% of $HYPER is earmarked for development, major investors are making strategic moves to get the most out of the ecosystem and reap the perks. Since going live on presale on May 16, 2025, $HYPER has raised $4.3M+. Whale buyers have significantly propelled its growth, three of whom invested $74.9K , $54.1K , and $53.9K . Grab $HYPER for Potential 2,400%+ Returns If banking titans like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley officially enter the crypto realm, they’ll accelerate the mainstream adoption of $BTC. And as $BTC gains more Wall Street traction, the need for faster and more cost-friendly infrastructure becomes vital. Luckily, Bitcoin Hyper steps in to meet this demand. To get the most out of the ecosystem, you can purchase $HYPER on presale for as little as $0.012375, using either $USDT, $ETH, $USDC, $BNB, or fiat. Following its L2 launch, it could reach $0.32 before 2026 kicks off, which means there’s no better time to join the presale for possible returns surpassing 2,400%. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research and never invest more than you’d be sad to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/jp-morgan-eyes-crypto-loans-bitcoin-hyper-gains/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-07-23T09:30:00,"SEC Approves Then Stays Bitwise Crypto ETF Conversion","The fund includes top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and was granted accelerated approval before being stayed by the Commission for further review. Industry analysts compared the move to a similar delay experienced by Grayscale and speculate the pause may be tied to internal SEC politics or a broader effort to create new crypto ETF listing standards. Meanwhile, 21Shares filed for a spot ETF tracking the price of Ondo (ONDO), the native token of the Ondo Chain, which focuses on institutional-grade tokenized real-world assets. This filing was made after Ondo Finance’s acquisition of regulated broker-dealer Oasis Pro to strengthen its position in the booming RWA market. Bitwise Crypto ETF in Limbo The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved, and then promptly paused, the conversion of Bitwise’s crypto index fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund (traded under BITW) includes exposure to leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It received an “accelerated approval” from the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets. This designation would have allowed Bitwise to request earlier activation of its ETF status. However, in an unusual twist, the same day saw the SEC issue a stay on that approval, pending a full Commission review. (Source: SEC ) The move immediately sparked comparisons to a similar delay involving Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF, which was also approved and then paused shortly thereafter. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart explained that the approval was stayed by one or more SEC commissioners, which now prevents Bitwise from proceeding with the conversion for the time being. He pointed out that the timing was earlier than expected, as the decision wasn’t due until the following week. Naturally, the pause drew a lot of reactions from people in the industry. Nate Geraci , president of NovaDius Wealth Management, called the situation “bizarre,” while Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital speculated that the approval was rushed under delegated authority to circumvent potential opposition from SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. Johnsson also theorized the delay could be part of a strategy by SEC Chair Paul Atkins to avoid the constraints of the 240-day statutory period that is required for final ETF approvals. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added that the SEC might be intentionally stalling ETF conversions while it works to establish a comprehensive listing standard for crypto ETFs. He suggested that new generic guidelines could be announced soon, which would include a public comment period and implementation before the upcoming deadlines in October. Meanwhile, the SEC also extended its decision timeline on whether to allow in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, discussions are ongoing among the SEC, fund managers, and stock exchanges on how to streamline the approval process for certain crypto-related investment products. This could suggest that broader structural changes may be on the horizon. 21Shares Files for Ondo Spot ETF Meanwhile, 21Shares filed a preliminary prospectus with the US SEC for a new exchange-traded product that will track the spot price of Ondo, the native token of the decentralized finance protocol Ondo Finance. The proposed “21Shares Ondo Trust” is designed to passively hold ONDO tokens, with performance benchmarked to the CME CF Ondo Finance-Dollar Reference Rate. Coinbase was tapped to provide custody services for the fund’s assets. 21Shares Ondo ETF filing (Source: SEC ) The product is intended to serve as a straightforward investment vehicle without any use of speculation or leverage. Investors will be able to create or redeem shares either in cash or in-kind. Ondo , which is the underlying token, powers the Ondo Chain. This is a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain purpose-built for institutional-grade financial markets and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). With a circulating supply of 3.1 billion tokens and a total cap of 10 billion, Ondo currently trades around $1.11. This means it is down almost 48% from its December all-time high of $2.14. Its total market capitalization stands at $3.5 billion. ONDO all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ondo Finance also attracted attention from the Trump family’s decentralized finance venture, World Liberty Financial, which bought $250,000 worth of ONDO tokens in December. It currently holds 342,000 tokens valued at roughly $383,000, but this is only a minor 0.2% fraction of its $208 million portfolio that mainly consists of stablecoins, wrapped Ether, and Bitcoin. Earlier this month, Ondo Finance made a strategic move by acquiring Oasis Pro, a registered broker-dealer, to accelerate its efforts in launching tokenized securities. This initiative is being developed in collaboration with Pantera Capital. Oasis Pro holds multiple regulatory registrations, including as an Alternative Trading System and a transfer agent, and has been a FINRA member since 2020. This acquisition is part of Ondo Chain’s goal of providing a compliant blockchain infrastructure for institutions looking to tokenize real-world assets, particularly in traditional finance sectors. The broader market for tokenized real-world assets has seen explosive growth this year, with the total value of on-chain RWAs rising 58% to nearly $25 billion. Ethereum still dominates this space as it accounts for 55% of all tokenized RWAs, which are primarily composed of private credit and US Treasurys.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10104/sec-approves-then-stays-bitwise-crypto-etf-conversion,"ONDO|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BTC","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Whale Alert recently flagged a massive XRP transfer that sparked speculation in the XRP community. As per the transaction, 200,000,005 XRP worth $700,609,232 was moved between two unknown wallets. 200M XRP Moved Back to Back Some users believe that it could be an old whale cashing out after XRP’s latest price surge. However, XRPwallets clarified that the XRP came from a Ripple wallet (active since June 2020) and was sent to a new subwallet. This is the second transfer of the same size in a short period of time, which is raising eyebrows. The community is closely watching to see where the funds go next. Ripple 46 to Ripple subwallet Activated June 2020 with 200M XRP. Sent to new wallet address today. This is now the second transaction of same amount and same time frame. Quite interesting. We will be monitoring where these are sent to next. https://t.co/6Tg6wCqIW7 — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) July 23, 2025 Additionally, 16.8 million XRP, worth about $58.3 million, was moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase, likely signaling a possible sell-off or liquidity move. Traders often see this as a bearish signal. Yesterday, over 200 million XRP, worth $687 million, was moved between two unknown wallets. XRPwallets had shared that it was again Ripple moving funds between its wallets. The transfer moved funds from a wallet opened in 2020 to a newly created one. Before this, another big Ripple-linked transfer of 210 million XRP ($738M) was also tracked. XRP Eyes $5.85 and $9.76 Next The community is buzzing as whale transfers usually hint that whales are making strategic moves, like taking profits after a price surge, moving funds to prepare for big trades, or bracing for volatility. XRP has been smashing new highs lately. It is currently trading at $3.47, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours. Analyst Dark Defender says that XRP is gearing up for its next big move, targeting $5.85 and $9.76 based on Fibonacci levels. Support levels are holding strong around $3.39 and $3.52, which means it could be ready for another leg up. XRP Gets Spotlight in Bitwise ETF approval; But Approval On Hold Recently, the SEC initially approved Bitwise’s plan to convert its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) into a spot ETF, which includes XRP alongside BTC, ETH, SOL, and others. This would mark a major step for XRP toward full regulatory recognition. However, shortly after, the SEC hit pause on the approval, creating fresh uncertainty around crypto ETF rules.

2025-07-23T09:27:00,"Trump Media Buys $2 Billion in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy Adds Another $800 Million – Is $250K for 1 BTC Possible This Year?","Bitcoin is back in the headlines and this time, not for the value. With Trump Media investing $2 Billion and MicroStrategy shelling out another $800 Million, everyone’s now glued to the million-dollar question: will Bitcoin hit $250,000 by 2025? Even as the big guns double down on wagers, fly-under-the-radar newcomers like Remittix are making waves off the grid delivering in-the-real-world utility and the power to redefine the usage of crypto on the world stage. Big Money, Bigger Bets: What’s Fueling Bitcoin’s Surge? Bitcoin currently trades at around $118,951.53, CoinMarketCap shows, with the market cap going up over $2.36 Trillion. Volume rises over 16% now to $76.33 Billion, another sign of rising institutional demand. With MicroStrategy and Trump Media joining in on the action, it’s no question that Bitcoin remains the institutional crypto play to beat. The majority now anticipate a new wave of institutional capital coming in something that will drive BTC to $250,000 sooner than expected. More and more investors are searching for the next great altcoin of 2025, but Bitcoin’s dominance is hard to ignore. Bloomberg and Fidelity analysts have also noted long-term bullish trends as an indicator that this can be a high-growth crypto breakout year. Remittix: The Real-World Use Case Crypto Can’t Ignore While Bitcoin makes the headlines, Remittix (RTX) makes history behind the scenes. Having raised over $16.7 Million, sold 562 Million+ tokens and a current price of as little as $0.0842, Remittix is positioning itself as the best DeFi altcoin for 2025. What makes Remittix different? It’s not vaporware or meme currency. It’s a DeFi project that is audited, enabling real-time crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 nations. It bridges low gas fee crypto to payments in the real world, solving a $19 Trillion issue of international remittances.

With centralized exchanges and decentralized exchange integration on the table, RTX is one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in today. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Crypto in 2025? The Bitcoin rally is a sign but not the only one. With Trump and Saylor now fully invested, the market is clearly hungry for crypto with real utility. But real growth will be spurred by more than just speculation. Tokens such as Remittix are preparing for the next phase of crypto adoption: true users and usage, not mania to invest but real people and consumption.

In a post on X, Fergani captioned a price chart showing a significant bullish breakout, supported by a triangular consolidation pattern that precedes the aggressive upward move that began in late 2024. The chart points to a target near $12, suggesting that XRP could be on the verge of a substantial rally within this market cycle. $XRP WILL REACH $12 THIS YEAR YES OR NO? pic.twitter.com/XG8KFB5bct — Crypto Fergani (@cryptofergani) July 21, 2025 At the time of posting, XRP was trading around $3.54 with a daily increase of 2.73%. The chart shows an extended period of narrowing price action followed by a sudden breakout, which is a textbook representation of long-term accumulation resolving to the upside. However, the analysis suggests this upward climb is not over, and Fergani expects a push toward a double-digit price before the end of 2025. Community Response and Aggressive Targets While Crypto Fergani’s chart implies that $12 may be a realistic near-term goal, some community members see it as a conservative projection. One user argued that a move to $12 is only about three times higher than current levels, and expects XRP to hit $58 by year-end instead. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter believes $15 is more aligned with current market sentiment, and other analysts have also set the $15 target . Others mentioned even more aggressive cycle tops, with one commenter suggesting a move to $34, describing this target as conservative. One commenter projected a target of $25 to $30. He posed the question of holding on further based on belief in XRP’s fundamentals and potential, or divesting through strategies like Dollar Cost Averaging to collect some profit from its growth. These responses reflect the overwhelmingly bullish expectations of community members. While there were some detractors, many believe XRP is gearing up for a big move. They see $12 as small compared to how high it can climb in 2025. Looking Ahead The debate isn’t whether XRP will rise, but how far and how quickly. Even detractors can see XRP’s potential, as Davinci Jeremie, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist, has predicted that XRP can hit $24 before the end of 2025 . With many users expecting levels well beyond $12, the discussion now centers on timing, strategy, and the choice of holding based on long-term conviction in the underlying technology, or planning an exit strategy to take profit as the price accelerates.

2025-07-23T09:18:07,"ETHT: 2x Ether ETF, Up Over 100% In The Past Month","Summary ETHT offers 2x daily leveraged exposure to ether, making it a highly speculative tool for short-term momentum trading, not long-term investing. The ETF structure provides regulated, transparent access to ether futures, reducing risks of exchange fraud compared to direct crypto trading. Due to extreme volatility and drawdowns, investors can gain or lose capital rapidly with ETHT. ETHT is best used with clear entry and exit points by sophisticated traders seeking amplified ether exposure, not for buy-and-hold strategies. Thesis Cryptocurrencies used to be a fringe market traded on specific exchanges that occasionally blew up . Nowadays, crypto is an established asset class that has permeated the traditional investment ecosystem, and retail investors have access to crypto via exchange-traded funds. Not only can one buy ether via an ETF now, but one can leverage up via the advent of leveraged ETFs in the space. In today's article, we are going to discuss exactly such a fund, namely the Proshares Ultra Ether ETF ( ETHT ). We are going to go through the fund's structure and history and highlight for investors what the name does and why it is purely a speculative tool. Crypto in the ETF format The crypto asset class has been historically plagued by many scandals, such as the Mt. Gox and FTX occurrences, where investors lost significant amounts of money. The transitioning to traditional finance ensured the checks and balances that have been refined for many years now apply to cryptocurrencies such as ether. Investors using ETHT for ether exposure can rest assured that the framework for their purchase is tried and tested, and in fact, as we shall see in the holdings section, the fund has ether futures as holdings, thus cutting out any possibilities of exchange-related fraud. What does the fund actually do? Now let us take a look at the fund objective: This ProShares ETF seeks daily investment results that correspond, before fees and expenses, to 2x the daily performance of its underlying benchmark, the Bloomberg Ethereum Index. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a single ether traded in USD. The Index is constructed and maintained by Bloomberg Index Services Limited. While the Fund has a daily investment objective, you may hold Fund shares for longer than one day if you believe it is consistent with your goals and risk tolerance. The name aims to provide the 2x daily performance of ether. While on crypto dedicated platforms investors can easily obtain leverage, the ETF asset class needs dedicated funds for enhanced returns. And ETHT is exactly such a fund. Please note that, just like any leveraged instrument, the fund aims to provide a 2x return only on a daily basis: For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target. These differences may be significant. Smaller index gains/losses and higher index volatility contribute to returns worse than the Daily Target. Larger index gains/losses and lower index volatility contribute to returns better than the Daily Target. The above is the standard disclosure regarding leveraged names, and investors should always read the following from FINRA : Most leveraged and inverse ETFs reset each day, which means they are designed to achieve their stated objective on a daily basis. With the effects of compounding, over longer timeframes the results can differ significantly from their objective. Please see Regulatory Notice 09-31 and the SEC/FINRA Investor Alert for illustrations of how these discrepancies can occur. Because they reset each day, leveraged and inverse ETFs typically are inappropriate as an intermediate or long-term investment. They may be appropriate, however, if recommended as part of a sophisticated trading or hedging strategy that will be closely monitored by a financial professional. However, a registered representative must carefully address the question of how to engage in these strategies in a manner consistent with the suitability rule. When to use it Just like regular equities or commodities funds, the ether ecosystem in the ETF format consists of regular 1x funds and now a 2x instrument: Ether 1x ETF: iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) Ether 2x ETF: Proshares Ultra Ether ETF Speculative investors who want to enhance their exposure to the asset class for a very short period of time can get access to a larger notional via a leveraged fund such as ETHT. At the end of the day, the ETF ensures that an investor with the same $100 of capital can get 2x the returns for ether. A very speculative and volatile asset class We are not going to discuss the merits of ether as an asset class in this article, but we are merely going to point out that it is a very, very speculative and volatile asset class. Let us look at some analytics for the non-leveraged ETHA ETF first: Annualized volatility: 75% 1-year drawdown profile: -70% Unleveraged ether is highly, highly speculative; thus, 2x leveraged ether is the same but on steroids. Investors need to be aware they can make money twice as fast but also lose capital quickly. Let us look at the ether performance this year: Data by YCharts Until the beginning of July 2025, there was a significant disconnect in the market between the price of bitcoin and the price of ether. While bitcoin was up over +15% for the year, ether was down -20%. That gap has now narrowed, with a massive rally in the past month, which saw ETHA gain +55%, while ETHT is up +127%: Data by YCharts Investors who get greedy need to remember, however, that the flip side of the coin also applies - ETHT was down an astounding -80% in May 2025 for the year. ETHT, in our view, is a very short-term momentum trading tool where investors bullish on ether can obtain a higher than normal return via this 2x fund. ETHT comes in handy because options on the unleveraged ETHA fund have a very high implied volatility, which makes buying options on ETHA very expensive. We view ETHT as a useful tool to have when one has a very distinct view on the underlying asset class. The best way to trade this is with clear-cut entry and exit points, and never fall in the mirage of a continuous doubling of capital for this name. What goes up fast also can come crashing down swiftly. Suffice to see the -80% drawdown for ETHT in 2025. Composition and fees As mentioned before in the article, the ETF obtains its returns via a mix of swaps and futures positions: Holdings (Fund Website) We can see the names containing July 2025 and August 2025 futures in the above chart. The name also has two swaps in place with Nomura and Goldman. The ETF comes with a net expense ratio of 0.94%. Conclusion ETHT is an exchange-traded fund from ProShares. The name provides for the 2x daily return of ether via a portfolio that includes ether futures and swaps. The fund is a highly speculative instrument and should only be used by investors who are very familiar with this crypto-currency and aim to boost returns via this leveraged fund. The name is not a buy and hold, and although up +127% in the past month, had a -80% drawdown earlier in the year.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803323-etht-2x-ether-etf-up-over-100-percent-in-the-past-month?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ETH","ETHA|ETHT",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T09:16:25,"DOJ moves to recover $7M in crypto tied to oil and gas investment scam","US regulators have moved to recover over $7 million in cryptocurrencies seized by Homeland Security during an investigation into a suspected oil and gas investment scam. The Seattle US Attorney’s Office has filed a civil forfeiture action to claim the digital assets, which were allegedly used to launder proceeds from the fraudulent scheme. The funds were part of a $97 million scam that defrauded investors between June 2022 and July 2024. According to Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller, the defendants transferred the illicit gains through various cryptocurrency accounts in an attempt to obscure their origin and avoid detection. The seized assets include crypto held in wallets linked to individuals based in Russia and Nigeria, who allegedly routed part of the funds to exchanges in their home countries. Scammers promised unrealistic gains; one was indicted An initial probe found that victims were lured with promises of high returns from investments in oil tank storage facilities in Rotterdam and Houston. They were told that these assets would be rented out for substantial profits. However, after the money was sent, the operators stopped responding, and the investors received no documentation or further contact. According to Investigators, the funds were directed to several business entities, including Sea Forest International LLC and Apex Oil and Gas Trading LLC, which were used as fronts for the operation. The fraud also involved multiple accounts and wallets to obscure money flows. Geoffrey Auyeung, a 47-year-old from Newcastle, Washington, was indicted in August 2024 as the primary US-based co-conspirator. Authorities alleged he received a large share of the proceeds and converted the funds into Bitcoin, Tether, USDC, and Ether. A portion of the funds was transferred to Binance. At the time of his arrest, the DOJ seized approximately $2.3 million from Auyeung’s bank accounts. If the court grants the $7.1 million forfeiture request, the total recovered amount will rise to $9.4 million, which will be distributed to confirmed victims. Prosecutors have so far identified around $17.9 million in verified losses but expect more victims to come forward. DOJ’s focus on recovery efforts With billions lost to fraud in 2024, according to FBI estimates , federal authorities have continued to pursue cross-border enforcement and prosecutions. Over the past month, the Justice Department, in particular, has been busy pursuing recovery actions tied to various crypto fraud cases In June, the DOJ filed a civil complaint to seize over $225 million in Tether linked to a massive pig butchering scheme that defrauded more than 400 victims globally. Bad actors were found to be using blockchain-based laundering tools to mask the origin of the stolen funds. However, authorities were able to trace the assets with assistance from stablecoin issuer Tether. Just weeks later, the DOJ recovered $40,300 in USDT following a phishing scam involving impersonation of the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. A donor was tricked into transferring $250,300 in crypto after receiving a fake email request. The scam was uncovered, and with help from Tether , part of the funds was successfully retrieved. Separately, the DOJ resolved a $35 million crypto dispute with bankrupt lender BlockFi. The department had initially sought to seize the assets as part of a criminal fraud case involving Estonian nationals. The settlement, approved in June, allowed the funds to be removed from the bankruptcy estate and concluded the case without further litigation.

Last month, Donna Nestler, a resident of Monticello, New York, allegedly stole $219,000 from her long-term friend’s Bank of America account using a fake identification card, reports the KMZU news radio station. According to an investigation by the Daviess County Sheriff’s Office in Missouri, Nestler allegedly stole the funds between June 2nd and June 9th from the bank account of the unidentified victim, who is a resident of Daviess County. The Daviess County Sheriff’s Office has issued an arrest warrant for Nestler. Authorities say the victim was able to identify the thief using surveillance images of the bank transactions. Nestler allegedly flew from New York to Nevada and then back to New York to steal the money. According to a separate report by KTTN news radio station, Nestler used a falsified driver’s license under the victim’s identity to steal the funds. The victim reportedly discovered the transactions on June 6th, when she locked her account and filed a dispute of the charges with Bank of America. However, Nestler allegedly was able to once again access the victim’s account on June 9th to withdraw an additional $9,520. Nestler is facing charges of stealing from a financial institution, forgery and identity theft.

2025-07-23T09:15:32,"Billionaire Binance Founder Says ‘FOMO Season Soon’ as Altcoin Index Starts Ticking Up","Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pointed out that CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is starting to climb, predicting that an altcoin rally might be imminent. Key Takeaways: Binance founder CZ says the Altcoin Season Index is ticking up, hinting at a possible FOMO-driven rally. The index has climbed to 51, up from 16 last month, signaling rising momentum toward altcoins. Ethereum and meme coins are leading gains, mirroring past cycles where altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. “Not sure how accurate it is, but it is ticking up. FOMO season soon…” Zhao posted on X, referencing the index that tracks whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The statement comes as Bitcoin’s dominance rate continues to drop, indicating that traders are increasingly focusing on the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoin Season Index Climbs to 51, Up from 16 Last Month The Altcoin Season Index, maintained by CoinMarketCap , currently sits at 51 out of 100, up from 38 last week and just 16 a month ago. A reading above 75 indicates an official “ Altcoin Season, ” where at least 75 of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. While 51 falls short of that threshold, the momentum reflects growing market rotation into non-Bitcoin assets. Historically, these phases follow a predictable pattern: Bitcoin rallies first, lifting overall sentiment and liquidity. Ethereum and other altcoins then pick up, fueled by narrative-driven speculation, new protocol launches, and increased developer activity. In the 2021 altcoin season, for instance, top altcoins posted gains over 170%, compared to Bitcoin’s 2% during the same period. Current data supports that pattern. Ethereum is up 110% over the past 90 days, while meme coins like BONK (+148.7%) and FLOKI (+119.1%) have surged. Even lower-cap projects such as PENGU and M have posted gains exceeding 500%, according to CoinMarketCap’s 90-day performance chart. The methodology behind the index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens and instead focuses on price performance among the top 100 coins listed on CoinMarketCap. The goal is to help investors gauge market sentiment shifts between Bitcoin-dominated periods and broader altcoin rallies. Bitcoin Dominnace Falls Sharply Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market has fallen sharply, dropping 5.8% in just one week to under 61%, its lowest point since March, and the steepest decline since June 2022. The metric had peaked near 66% at the end of last month, according to TradingView. The drop in dominance coincides with a surge in total crypto market capitalization, which has jumped from $3 trillion to around $3.8 trillion over the past three weeks. Altcoins, particularly Ethereum, have led the rally as investors shift focus away from Bitcoin. “Everyone is saying ALTSEASON has started but if you look at indicator they say ~ Not yet,” X user Henry said in a recent post . They added that none of the 30 bull market top indicators have triggered yet, with Bitcoin dominance at 61%, the Altcoin Season Index at 51, and key metrics like Puell, MVRV Z-Score, and Mayer Multiple still in safe territory. Everyone is saying ALTSEASON has started but if you look at indicator they say ~ Not yet. Out of 30 bull market top indicators, not a single one has triggered. • Bitcoin dominance is still high at 61% • Altcoin Season Index is sitting at 51/100 (needs to hit 75+) • Puell,… pic.twitter.com/NU92VlpWZN — Henry (@LordOfAlts) July 21, 2025 The post Billionaire Binance Founder Says ‘FOMO Season Soon’ as Altcoin Index Starts Ticking Up appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/billionaire-binance-founder-says-fomo-season-soon-as-altcoin-index-starts-ticking-up/,"ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|BNB|EXCHANGE","Altcoin News|Adoption|Altcoin|Binance",cryptocompare

2025-07-23T09:12:51,"Bitcoin (BTC) Confirms Trend Break: Will Prices Surge Next?","Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a triangle pattern on Tuesday and price has come back to confirm the breakout on Wednesday. Is it up from here, or can the bears still pull the price back down? $BTC surge coming sooner or later Investor greed is creeping higher as the $BTC price maintains above the $118,000 support level. The king of the cryptocurrencies is likely to power into its next surge higher sooner or later, as institutions pile into an asset, that with gold, is arguably the only sound money haven in an ocean of rapidly devaluing fiat currencies. Confirmation of the breakout? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows how the triangle pattern is evolving slightly in order to accommodate the $BTC price . A breakout did take place on Tuesday, and it looks like the confirmation of this break is occurring. Could the price sink back inside the triangle? Yes, of course, this is always an option, although the higher percentage chance is that a bounce would happen from here. One factor to take into consideration though is that the Stochastic RSI indicators are just on their way back down. This isn’t really conducive to a bounce to the upside, so perhaps the price could continue to slide down the top of the triangle until the bulls are good and ready to send it higher. If the bears do manage to wrest control from the bulls, a fall below $116,200 would be a time to sit up and start taking notice, as this could be the trigger for a rapid collapse to $112,000. $117,000 to $120,000 range has formed Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that a range is now forming after Tuesday’s top, with the top range defined as $120,000, while the bottom sits at around $117,000. The 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) is the blue ascending line. This does suggest the possibility that if there were to be a sudden violent shake out, the price could come down to retest the 50-day SMA, which just might be at that $112,000 level by that time. At the bottom of the chart, the daily Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down nicely and could be expected to hit bottom by the end of this week. This could result in a signal of increased upside price momentum towards the end of the following week. Steeper rise for this bull market over the previous one Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly chart view gives one more of a perspective on just how sharply the $BTC price is rising. Taking the 2021/2022 bull market as a comparison, if one looks at the tilt of the main moving averages (50, 100, 200) and then compares this with how these moving averages are climbing currently, it is noticeable that there is a steeper tilt to all of them this time around. This could be because the last bull market was somewhat curtailed, given the FTX collapse, and the huge amount of leverage that was being utilised. This time around things are different. The US government is squarely behind encouraging Bitcoin and crypto adoption, and institutions are starting to buy Bitcoin for their treasuries. Pensions are also starting to allocate. Bitcoin may be in a short-term holding phase at the moment, but this isn’t likely to last long. Bitcoin is disappearing off of OTC desks (over the counter) rapidly and a resulting supply crunch may be coming. Continuing to hold Bitcoin looks like a wise move.

Yesterday, July 22, Ethereum ETFs experienced one of their largest single-day inflows in two weeks, bringing in $533 million. Ethereum ETF Flow. Source: FarSide Investors In sharp contrast, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $68 million in outflows, a striking reversal that hints at a potential shift in institutional crypto appetite. This marks one of the biggest day-to-day divergences between the two flagship cryptos since spot Ethereum ETFs launched earlier this year. Some traders are now pointing to this move as a possible signal that ‘ altcoin season’ is getting underway. Institutions rush in Fidelity made one of the biggest single-day buys this week, with its Ethereum Fund (FETH) adding 33,788.82 ETH , roughly $124 million, in just one day. The purchase brings Fidelity’s total Ethereum holdings to 629,202 ETH, valued at approximately $2.33 billion at current market prices. But Fidelity isn’t alone in this institutional rush. BlackRock also expanded its Ethereum position, purchasing 27,158.86 ETH valued at nearly $100 million via its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The asset management giant now holds 2.59 million ETH, making it the single-largest institutional holder of Ethereum among ETFs. The scale of institutional interest becomes clear when examining the broader picture. Across all listed Ethereum ETFs, net inflows have surged by 650,468 ETH over the past seven days, with total ETF holdings now surpassing 5.22 million ETH, equivalent to $19.31 billion. Other major funds such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck also recorded substantial weekly inflows. Notably, Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust saw a seven-day net inflow of 60,529 ETH, while Bitwise added 12,758 ETH. Featured image via Shutterstock.

2025-07-23T09:11:25,"Ray Dalio says Trump wants to weaken the dollar while Powell tries to defend it","Ray Dalio says the fight between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is about the value of money, not policy details. “When there is too much debt and borrowing,” Ray said, “the classic way of dealing with it is to push real interest rates down and devalue money.” Trump wants that. Powell doesn’t. That’s the whole fight. Ray explains it simply. Lowering real rates and inflating away debt helps debtors and hurts creditors. “That is what Donald Trump is pushing for and what Jay Powell is defending against.” It’s not new for presidents to want more stimulation. Every politician wants spending, markets up, happy voters. But central bankers are supposed to hold the line, not just give in to what’s popular. Normally, there’s respect for that line. Not now. Trump pushes devaluation while Powell resists it “This argument is more intense,” Ray says, even though debates between government and central banks are routine. Usually, central bankers “lean against the wind.” They try to find a balance between too much easing and too much tightening. Ray lays it out: when times are calm, the president wants happy voters and the central banker wants stable money. When things get rough, the president wants even more money printing, and the central banker starts losing control. That’s what’s happening now. Trump wants a cheaper dollar. Powell is trying to stop that slide. Then the question becomes: what should the Fed be doing? Ray says look at the data. Market indicators? “They are clearly saying that money is now easy and that the economy is not in trouble.” He points to stocks, credit spreads, and real interest rates. “Over the last year, the U.S. stock market was up 14%, is now at its all-time highs, and by most measures is expensive.” That’s not normal. That’s a signal that money is cheap. “The dollar was down 5% against a basket of other major currencies, down 27% against gold, and down 45% against Bitcoin.” Again, this isn’t stability. That’s market confidence fading. Credit spreads? “BAA-rated corporate spreads are now trading around 1% above Treasuries.” That’s historically tight. It means everyone expects money to stay cheap. “Real interest rates are relatively moderate and normal at a bit over 2% at the 10-year level.” That’s low. Not tight enough to defend the dollar. Dalio sees risks rising and the dollar getting weaker Economic indicators aren’t screaming trouble, but they aren’t perfect either. “The unemployment rate is at a relatively low 4.1% and slowly trending higher.” That means jobs are still strong, but weakening. “Tech, especially investments and revenues in AI, is booming while sentiment and real estate are weak.” So, there’s a split; big tech’s flying, but the average American isn’t. Ray adds that “the global economy is relatively weak.” So even if the U.S. is hanging in there, the rest of the world isn’t helping. Looking forward? He says the path is full of risk. “There are great uncertainties and risks related to the debt and trade issues, politics, and geopolitics that all have an inflationary bias.” But at the same time, “there are great technological advances that are deflationary and will tend to increase wealth gaps.” Ray says defending the value of money is a thankless job. “Defending monetary discipline, like defending fiscal discipline, isn’t a popular thing to do because it is de facto telling people that they need to have financial discipline.” Nobody wants to hear that. But the stakes are high. “One man’s debts are another man’s assets.” That’s not theory. That’s your money. If the Fed caves, your savings lose value. And that’s not going to be fixed by speeches. He asks the key question: “Will the value of money be defended?” And his answer? Not likely. “Judging from the lessons of history and current readings, I think that it is clear that the value of money won’t be defended until the classic weak money/inflation problems become intense, and perhaps not even then.” He brings up the 1970-1982 period, where inflation ran out of control and real rates had to be pushed sky high just to stop the bleeding. That’s the kind of pain it takes before monetary tightening is taken seriously. “So, while maybe that tightening will happen sometime in the distant future, it’s virtually certain that it won’t come soon.” That’s Ray’s warning. Don’t expect Powell to slam the brakes unless things totally fall apart. Until then, Ray has an advise take: “One should keep betting on weak money (i.e., the dollar going down, and low and falling real interest rates).” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ray-dalio-trump-powell-controlling-dollar/,"MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS","Economy|USD",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T09:00:31,"Ethereum Demand Shock Will Rock Markets, Bitwise CIO Warns","A sudden surge of institutional and corporate interest in Ethereum (ETH) is setting the stage for what Bitwise Asset Management’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan calls a “structural imbalance” between supply and demand—one that could propel prices well beyond the cryptocurrency’s already‑rapid ascent this year. In a memo circulated to clients on 22 July 2025, Hougan noted that Ether has climbed more than 65 percent in the past month and over 160 percent since April. The rally, he argues, is being driven not by sentiment alone but by a dramatic mismatch between the amount of Ether produced by the network and the quantities now being absorbed by exchange‑traded products (ETPs) and newly formed “ETH treasury” corporations. Ethereum Demand Shock Is Inevitable “Sometimes it really is that simple,” Hougan wrote, echoing his long‑standing thesis that, in the short run, asset prices are dictated primarily by flows. He drew a direct parallel to bitcoin’s explosive performance following the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETPs in January 2024, when “ETPs, corporations, and governments acquired more than 1.5 million bitcoin, while the Bitcoin blockchain produced just over 300,000.” Related Reading: Ethereum To $10,000? Analyst Says ETH Has To Break This Level The same dynamic, he contends, has finally taken hold in the Ether market—only more forcefully. Between 15 May and 20 July, spot Ether ETPs attracted more than $5 billion in net inflows, while a handful of publicly traded companies began stockpiling the token as a primary treasury asset. Among the most aggressive buyers: Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) accumulated 300,657 ETH—about $1.13 billion at current prices—and declared an ambition “of obtaining 5 percent of all ETH supply.” SharpLink Gaming (SBET) purchased 280,706 ETH ($1.06 billion) and disclosed plans to raise an additional $6 billion for future acquisitions. Bit Digital (BTBT) liquidated its bitcoin reserves after raising $170 million, redirecting the proceeds to more than 100,000 ETH (roughly $375 million). The Ether Machine (DYNX) outlined an initial public offering built around a $1.6 billion Ether treasury. In aggregate, ETPs and public companies bought approximately 2.83 million Ether—valued at north of $10 billion—during the nine‑week stretch. Over the same period, the Ethereum network created only about 88,000 ETH in new issuance, a ratio of demand to supply that Hougan calculates at 32 to 1. “No wonder the price of ETH has soared,” he observed. Whether that pressure continues is now the central question for investors. Hougan’s answer is an unequivocal yes. He points out that, even after the recent buying spree, Ether remains under‑owned relative to bitcoin in the ETP market: Ether funds control less than 12 percent of the assets held by bitcoin ETPs, despite ETH’s market capitalisation standing at roughly one‑fifth of BTC’s. “With all the excitement surrounding stablecoins and tokenization—which are primarily built on Ethereum—we think that will change,” he said, predicting billions of dollars in additional inflows “in the next few months.” Related Reading: Tom Lee Predicts $30,000 Per Ethereum As Treasury Frenzy Begins Meanwhile, the economics of listed “crypto treasury” firms appear to be self‑reinforcing. Shares of BMNR and SBET each trade at nearly twice the net value of the Ether they hold, a premium that incentivises management teams to issue equity, raise capital, and purchase still more ETH. “As long as that remains true, you can bet Wall Street firms will funnel money into more ETH purchases,” Hougan wrote. Bitwise projects that ETPs and treasury companies could absorb as much as $20 billion worth of Ether—around 5.33 million coins at present prices—over the coming year. The protocol’s issuance schedule, by contrast, is expected to add only about 800,000 ETH to circulation during the same window, implying a 7‑to‑1 imbalance. “That’s an even higher ratio than we’ve seen for Bitcoin since the spot ETPs launched,” Hougan said. Sceptics often argue that Ether’s long‑term supply is not capped in the way bitcoin’s is, and that its valuation hinges on factors beyond simple scarcity, such as network usage and transaction fees. Hougan does not dispute those points but insists they are secondary in the near term. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand, and right now, there is more demand for ETH than supply,” he concluded. At press time, ETH traded at $3,703.
