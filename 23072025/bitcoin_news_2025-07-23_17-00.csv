Square began onboarding the first sellers, enabling them to accept Lightning Network-powered BTC payments from customers, Owen Jennings, executive officer at Square's parent company Block (XYZ), posted on X on Tuesday . Payments are settled in real-near time using Bitcoin layer-2 Lightning, with Square processing the exchange into fiat. Square plans to make the service available to all merchants using its sales platform by next year. The company piloted the system at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas in May, allowing attendees to make purchases in BTC by scanning a barcode.

This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a strategic realignment. The latest to make headlines is Swedish health-tech firm H100 Group, which has just announced a substantial Bitcoin acquisition , further solidifying its commitment to the leading cryptocurrency. This move signals a growing conviction among diverse industries about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in modern corporate finance. H100 Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Journey H100 Group, a name typically associated with healthcare innovation, has once again demonstrated its forward-thinking approach, this time in the realm of digital finance. The company recently announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 117.93 BTC. This latest purchase significantly increases their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 628.22 BTC. This isn’t a one-off event; it’s a continuation of a well-thought-out strategy. The company had previously secured $1.5 million specifically to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, indicating a deliberate and planned approach to integrating digital assets into its financial framework. This proactive stance by a health-tech firm underscores a broader shift in corporate treasury management, where companies are looking beyond traditional assets to hedge against inflation and secure long-term value. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin reflects a sophisticated understanding of the current economic landscape. With global inflation concerns and the devaluation of fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply asset that can serve as a robust store of value. For H100 Group, this isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic allocation designed to protect and potentially grow shareholder value in an evolving financial ecosystem. Their consistent accumulation demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role as ‘digital gold’ in the 21st century. Why are Companies Embracing Bitcoin Acquisition? H100 Group’s move is part of a larger, compelling narrative. Companies worldwide, from tech giants to traditional enterprises, are increasingly exploring or actively pursuing Bitcoin acquisition . But what exactly is driving this trend? Several key factors contribute to Bitcoin’s appeal as a corporate treasury asset: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against the erosion of purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it cannot be devalued by central banks printing more money. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares many characteristics with traditional precious metals, including scarcity, durability, and divisibility. It provides a reliable means to preserve capital over the long term. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury portfolio offers diversification away from traditional assets like cash, bonds, and equities, which may be subject to different market dynamics and risks. Technological Innovation & Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin aligns companies with cutting-edge financial technology and demonstrates a forward-thinking approach. It positions them to capitalize on the growing digital economy. Increased Institutional Acceptance: With growing regulatory clarity and the entry of major financial institutions into the crypto space, Bitcoin is gaining mainstream acceptance, reducing perceived risks for corporate adoption. Pioneering companies like MicroStrategy, which began its substantial Bitcoin accumulation in 2020, have set a precedent, demonstrating the viability and potential benefits of holding significant Bitcoin reserves. Their success has encouraged others to follow suit, leading to a noticeable shift in corporate treasury strategies. The Health-Tech Perspective: H100 Group’s Vision It might seem unconventional for a health-tech firm to be so deeply invested in Bitcoin, but H100 Group’s actions highlight a broader principle: innovation isn’t confined to a single industry. Health-tech, by its very nature, is about looking forward, embracing new technologies, and finding better solutions for complex problems. This ethos extends to their financial strategy. H100 Group’s consistent Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates a belief that digital assets are not just speculative instruments but foundational elements of the future economy. Their vision likely encompasses a long-term outlook where Bitcoin serves as a robust pillar of their balance sheet, protecting against economic uncertainties and potentially providing significant upside. This strategic foresight positions H100 Group not just as a leader in health technology but also as an innovator in corporate finance, willing to challenge conventional wisdom for the benefit of its stakeholders. It speaks to a corporate culture that values resilience, adaptability, and a proactive approach to navigating global economic shifts. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition While the benefits of corporate Bitcoin acquisition are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks. No investment strategy is without its hurdles, and digital assets introduce a unique set of considerations that companies must meticulously address: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price fluctuations. While it offers significant upside potential, companies must be prepared for periods of substantial downturns. A long-term holding strategy can help mitigate the impact of short-term volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to stay abreast of changing laws and ensure compliance in all jurisdictions where they operate. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent hacks and theft. This often involves specialized custodial solutions, multi-signature wallets, and stringent internal protocols. Accounting Treatment: In many jurisdictions, Bitcoin is treated as an intangible asset for accounting purposes, which can lead to complex impairment charges if its value drops below the purchase price, even if it recovers later. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, some stakeholders or traditional investors might still view Bitcoin as a risky or speculative asset, requiring clear communication from the company regarding its strategic rationale. Companies like H100 Group must employ sophisticated risk management frameworks, engage expert legal and financial advisors, and implement state-of-the-art security protocols to navigate these challenges effectively. Their ability to do so will be key to the success of their Bitcoin strategy. What’s Next for H100 Group and the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition? H100 Group’s latest Bitcoin acquisition reinforces a clear signal: they are committed to this strategy for the long haul. With 628.22 BTC now on their balance sheet, they are among a growing cohort of public and private companies globally that view Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable treasury asset. We can anticipate H100 Group to continue monitoring market conditions and potentially make further acquisitions as part of their ongoing strategy, especially given their stated funding for this purpose. Beyond H100 Group, this trend signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market. As more companies from diverse sectors, not just tech or finance, embrace Bitcoin, it lends further credibility and stability to the asset. This institutional adoption could lead to: Increased Liquidity: More corporate holders mean deeper markets and potentially reduced volatility over time. Broader Acceptance: As more businesses hold Bitcoin, it becomes more normalized, potentially leading to its wider acceptance for payments and other financial activities. Regulatory Progress: Increased corporate interest often spurs regulators to provide clearer guidelines, fostering a more stable environment for digital assets. The coming years will likely see even more companies evaluate and integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies, driven by the desire for inflation protection, asset diversification, and a stake in the future of finance. H100 Group is certainly leading the charge in the health-tech sector. In conclusion, H100 Group’s latest, substantial Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful testament to the growing institutional confidence in digital assets. This Swedish health-tech firm is not only innovating in its core business but also demonstrating foresight in its financial management, positioning itself robustly for the future. Their journey reflects a broader, transformative shift in corporate treasury strategies worldwide, where Bitcoin is increasingly recognized not just as a speculative asset, but as a fundamental component of a resilient and forward-looking balance sheet. As companies continue to navigate economic uncertainties, the strategic accumulation of Bitcoin is becoming a compelling option, solidifying its place in the global financial landscape. H100 Group’s actions serve as a powerful example of this evolving paradigm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is H100 Group? H100 Group is a Swedish health-tech firm.

2025-07-23T14:30:26,"Demand to the ‘Order of Trillions’ Could Be Coming for US Debt, According to Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender – Here’s How","Trillions of dollars could flow into the US Treasury market following the approval of a landmark stablecoin bill, according to Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender. Last week, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar, requiring each token to be fully backed by liquid assets such as cash or short-term US Treasuries. In a new Bloomberg interview, Faulkender explains in detail how the passage of the stablecoin bill into law would translate to massive demand for US debt. “We now have a digital asset that has rules of the road established by Congress for what backs those digital assets. It provides enormous amounts of confidence to not only Americans, but our trading partners around the world, who are then willing to make exchanges, to invoice dollars and then be paid via stablecoins because they know that it is an asset that has a value behind it. Because what is it that backs it? Primarily, it’s going to be T-bills.” Faulkender notes that while wiring money abroad typically takes a day or two to settle, stablecoins can deliver funds in just seconds. “And so it’s going to enormously hasten the timeframe for making payments. It’s more secure, it’s more private, it’s significantly cheaper. And so if indeed this does revolutionize the way that international payments are invoiced and paid, then there should be a flocking to this technology. And if all of that trade therefore is even further denominated in stablecoins, then there’s going to be demand for the underlying asset, which are Treasury securities. We could potentially see on the order of trillions of additional demand.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to a recent announcement, the company is all set to raise $850 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings and support other initiatives. MARA Holdings plans to raise $850 million through a private offering of zero-interest convertible notes due in 2032. These notes can later be converted into cash, MARA stock, or a mix of both. An extra $150 million may also be offered depending on demand. Out of the funds raised, $50 million could go toward buying back some of MARA’s older debt (1% notes due 2026). The rest will be used for buying more Bitcoin, general business needs, and possibly paying down other debts or funding strategic growth. Already holding over 50,000 BTC, MARA is doubling down on its crypto bet. MARA is the second-largest public company holding Bitcoin, just behind Microstrategy, which holds over 600,000 BTC.

2025-07-23T14:18:08,"Analysis Firm Matrixport Warns Bitcoin Investors: ""The Rally in BTC and Altcoins Isn't Over, But Beware the Short Term!""","With only a week left until the highly anticipated FED interest rate decision, cryptocurrency company Matrixport has published its new analysis. At this point, Matrixport stated that cryptocurrency investors should be careful in the short term. Analysts pointed out that open interest and funding rates, especially in Bitcoin futures, are increasing together, and that the two increasing together could cause volatility in the short term. Analysts noted that Bitcoin open interest has increased by $6 billion in the last two weeks, while the annual funding rate has risen to 19 percent. Analysts said this was a sign that investors were aggressively taking long positions, and that this increase occurred alongside a sharp increase in retail crypto transaction volumes in South Korea, jumping from $1 billion to $6 billion. At this point, analysts stated that the significant increase in open position value, especially in Bitcoin futures, could create exaggerated optimism in the market and that there is a high probability that many opened long positions will be liquidated as a result. Although Matrixport expects volatility in the short term, it was stated that August is traditionally a quieter month in financial markets and that liquidity and volatility may decrease in August. Despite the near-term risks, Matrixport said it maintains its bullish outlook for the remainder of 2025 and expects the overall upward trend to continue with a number of key catalysts on the horizon, including the US FOMC meeting scheduled for next week. “Major catalysts are lining up for the post-summer period, and the overall crypto rally is not over yet, and the broader crypto uptrend is still intact.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-23T14:15:18,"Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive $227 Million Market Meltdown","BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive $227 Million Market Meltdown The cryptocurrency market, known for its rapid shifts and dramatic swings, recently witnessed a startling event that sent ripples through trading desks worldwide. In a mere sixty minutes, an astonishing $227 million worth of crypto futures liquidation swept across major exchanges. This hourly figure alone highlights the intense volatility and the high-stakes nature of leveraged trading in digital assets. Extending this view, the past 24 hours saw an even more staggering $524 million worth of futures liquidated . Such significant events are not just numbers; they represent substantial losses for many traders and offer crucial insights into market dynamics. But what exactly is a crypto futures liquidation, and what does an event of this magnitude tell us about the current state of the crypto market? Understanding Crypto Futures Liquidation: What Just Happened? To grasp the gravity of a crypto futures liquidation , it’s essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of futures trading in the cryptocurrency space. A futures contract is essentially an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Traders use these contracts to speculate on future price movements without owning the underlying asset directly. The allure, and often the danger, lies in leverage. Leverage allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, a trader can control $10,000 worth of Bitcoin with just $1,000 of their own money. While this amplifies potential profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, the trader’s equity (margin) decreases. If this equity falls below a certain threshold – known as the maintenance margin – the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for the trader and the exchange. This forced closure is what we call a crypto futures liquidation . The recent event, where $227 million worth of futures were liquidated in just one hour, suggests a sudden and sharp price movement in one direction, catching a large number of leveraged traders off guard. It typically happens when: Sudden Price Swings: An unexpected surge or drop in the price of a major cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) triggers margin calls for many positions simultaneously. High Leverage: Traders using excessive leverage are more susceptible to liquidation, as even small price movements can wipe out their margin. Cascading Effects: Liquidations can trigger further price drops as large positions are force-sold, creating a domino effect that leads to more liquidations. The Immediate Impact: Analyzing the $227 Million Shockwave The rapid $227 million crypto futures liquidation within an hour, followed by the broader $524 million over 24 hours, indicates a period of extreme market volatility and significant directional pressure. Such a large-scale event points to a few key observations: Unsuspecting Traders Caught Off Guard: A substantial number of traders were likely positioned in the wrong direction, perhaps expecting a rally when the market dumped, or vice versa. This suggests a lack of robust risk management strategies among some participants. Dominant Market Direction: The sheer volume of liquidations in a short period usually signifies a strong, sustained move in one direction. For instance, if the majority of liquidated positions were ‘long’ (betting on price increase), it implies a sharp price decline. Conversely, if ‘short’ positions were liquidated, it indicates a sudden price pump. Exacerbated Volatility: Liquidations themselves can intensify market movements. When positions are force-closed, the underlying assets are sold (or bought) on the market, adding to the existing selling (or buying) pressure. This creates a feedback loop, accelerating price changes and leading to more liquidations. This kind of market event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged crypto derivatives trading. It highlights the importance of not only predicting market direction but also understanding the mechanics of how exchanges manage risk and how that impacts individual traders. Why Do Such Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations Occur So Frequently? While the recent crypto futures liquidation event was significant, similar incidents, albeit of varying magnitudes, are not uncommon in the crypto market. Several factors contribute to their frequent occurrence: 1. Unregulated Leverage: Unlike traditional finance, many crypto exchanges offer extremely high leverage options (up to 100x or even more). This allows traders to take on enormous risk with minimal capital, making them highly vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations. 2. 24/7 Market Activity: The crypto market never sleeps. This constant activity means price movements can occur at any time, catching traders off guard, especially those who aren’t actively monitoring their positions or have insufficient stop-loss orders in place. 3. Market Manipulation and Whale Activity: Large holders (whales) can sometimes execute significant trades that trigger rapid price movements. These “whale” movements can intentionally or unintentionally trigger a cascade of liquidations, benefiting those who anticipated the move. 4. Emotional Trading: The highly volatile nature of crypto often leads to emotional decision-making. Traders might over-leverage, fail to set stop-losses, or panic-sell/buy, exacerbating their losses during market downturns or missing opportunities during rallies. 5. Lack of Proper Risk Management: Many retail traders, drawn by the promise of quick riches, often overlook or underestimate the importance of robust risk management strategies. This includes not having a clear exit strategy, inadequate position sizing, and neglecting to use tools like stop-loss orders. Navigating the Turbulence: Strategies for Traders Amidst Crypto Futures Liquidation For both seasoned traders and newcomers, understanding how to navigate periods of intense volatility and avoid becoming a victim of a crypto futures liquidation is paramount. Here are actionable insights and strategies: 1. Master Risk Management: This is arguably the most crucial aspect of trading. Before entering any trade, define your maximum acceptable loss. This includes: Position Sizing: Never allocate more than a small percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your total capital to a single trade. Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order. This automatically closes your position if the price moves against you to a predefined level, limiting your potential losses. Treat it as your safety net. Take-Profit Orders: Similarly, consider setting take-profit orders to secure gains when your target price is reached, preventing potential reversals from eroding your profits. 2. Lower Your Leverage: While high leverage can be tempting, it’s a double-edged sword. Using lower leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) significantly increases your liquidation price, giving your trade more room to breathe during minor market fluctuations. This dramatically reduces your risk of a sudden crypto futures liquidation . 3. Understand Market Structure and Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market trends, support and resistance levels, and overall sentiment. Are major cryptocurrencies consolidating, breaking out, or breaking down? Understanding the context can help you make more informed decisions about your directional bias. 4. Diversify Your Portfolio (Beyond Futures): Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While futures trading can be profitable, consider diversifying your crypto holdings across spot markets, staking, or even different asset classes to mitigate overall portfolio risk. 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Stay updated on market news, technological advancements, and new trading strategies. Learn from both your successes and your failures, and adapt your approach as market conditions change. 6. Avoid Emotional Trading: Develop a trading plan and stick to it. Emotional decisions, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) or panic, often lead to poor outcomes. Take breaks, review your strategy objectively, and don’t chase pumps or dump into panic. The Broader Implications for the Crypto Market Events like the recent crypto futures liquidation of hundreds of millions of dollars have implications beyond individual traders. They can contribute to increased market volatility, sometimes leading to a “flush out” of over-leveraged positions, which can be seen as a market reset. However, repeated large liquidations can also erode investor confidence, attract regulatory scrutiny, and highlight the need for more robust risk management tools and education across the ecosystem. Ultimately, these events underscore the need for a mature and responsible approach to participating in the digital asset space. The recent crypto futures liquidation event, wiping out $227 million in an hour and over half a billion in 24 hours, serves as a powerful testament to the inherent risks and rewards of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a vivid illustration of how quickly fortunes can change, particularly when leverage is involved. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of magnified losses is equally potent. This episode is not merely a statistic; it’s a critical lesson for every participant in the crypto space. It underscores the absolute necessity of rigorous risk management, the prudent use of leverage, and the importance of a well-informed trading strategy. By learning from such events, traders can better prepare themselves for the unpredictable nature of digital asset markets, transforming potential pitfalls into opportunities for growth and resilience. Always remember: in the volatile world of crypto, knowledge and discipline are your most valuable assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto futures liquidation? A1: A crypto futures liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) falls below a certain threshold due to adverse price movements. This is done to prevent the trader from incurring further losses beyond their initial margin. Q2: Why did $227 million worth of futures get liquidated so quickly? A2: Such a rapid and large-scale liquidation typically results from a sudden, sharp price movement in the market (either up or down), catching a large number of highly leveraged traders on the wrong side of the trade. The forced closure of these positions then adds to the market’s momentum, creating a cascading effect. Q3: How can traders avoid crypto futures liquidation? A3: Traders can avoid liquidation by employing strict risk management strategies, including using lower leverage, setting mandatory stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, carefully sizing their positions relative to their total capital, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Q4: Does crypto futures liquidation affect the spot market? A4: Yes, large-scale liquidations in the futures market can influence the spot market. When leveraged positions are closed, the underlying assets are often bought or sold, adding to buying or selling pressure on spot exchanges, which can exacerbate price movements. Q5: Is futures trading safe in crypto? A5: Futures trading in crypto carries significant risks due to high volatility and the availability of extreme leverage. While it offers opportunities for profit, it is not inherently “safe” for inexperienced traders or those who do not practice stringent risk management. It’s crucial to understand the risks before engaging. Q6: What role does leverage play in liquidation events? A6: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. The higher the leverage used, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out a trader’s margin and trigger a liquidation. This makes high-leverage positions extremely vulnerable to market volatility. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-23T14:09:12,"Ether ETFs Extend Inflow Streak Surpasses $8.3B as Demand Outpaces Supply","Spot Ether ETFs continue to attract strong institutional interest, marking 13 consecutive days of net inflows as appetite for Ethereum exposure grows. On Tuesday, these funds recorded a net inflow of $533.87 million, pushing the cumulative net inflows since July 2 to over $8.32 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with a $426.22 million daily net inflow, expanding its assets under management to over $10 billion and solidifying its lead in the Ether ETF space. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $35 million in daily inflows, reflecting continued confidence among investors. Ether ETFs Hit New Milestones The inflow streak saw its highest daily record on July 16, with over $720 million , followed by $602.02 million on July 18, underscoring a wave of institutional buying. Spot Ether ETFs now collectively hold $19.85 billion in assets, representing 4.44% of Ethereum’s market cap. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, noted that the sustained inflows are driven by “falling BTC dominance and growing institutional appetite for ETH exposure,” indicating the trend could persist as liquidity improves and macro conditions remain stable. ETH Demand Surges as Supply Shrinks Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, highlighted that while Ethereum’s market cap is about 19% of Bitcoin’s, Ethereum ETFs currently hold less than 12% of the assets that Bitcoin ETPs manage. He predicts this gap will narrow as more companies add ETH to their balance sheets, projecting demand for an additional $20 billion worth of ETH over the next year—approximately 5.33 million ETH at current prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s network is expected to issue only around 0.8 million ETH over the same period, suggesting that demand could exceed new supply by nearly seven times. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand. And for the time being, there is significantly more demand for ETH than there is new supply. I suspect we go higher,” Hougan said. On-chain data from Lookonchain further revealed that five new wallets withdrew a combined 76,987 ETH (worth $285 million) from Kraken on Wednesday, signaling ongoing accumulation and a declining exchange supply. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $67.93 million on Tuesday, with significant withdrawals from Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB, marking a pause in the strong institutional buying Bitcoin ETFs witnessed earlier in July.

2025-07-23T14:05:19,"Crypto Liquidations Unleash a $113 Million Shockwave in the Market","BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations Unleash a $113 Million Shockwave in the Market In the fast-paced, often unpredictable world of digital assets, moments of extreme volatility can send a genuine shockwave through the market. Recently, the cryptocurrency community witnessed one such event, with a staggering $113 million worth of futures liquidated in just one hour across major exchanges. This sudden flush was part of an even larger picture: a colossal $409 million worth of futures liquidated over the past 24 hours. These numbers aren’t just figures on a screen; they represent real money, real traders, and a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in crypto futures trading. But what exactly are these crypto liquidations , and what do they mean for you and the broader market? Understanding the Mechanics of Crypto Liquidations Before diving deeper into the recent market movements, it’s crucial to understand the core concept of crypto liquidations . Simply put, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a significant loss. This happens because the trader’s margin balance (the collateral they put up for their leveraged trade) falls below a certain threshold required to keep the position open. It’s an automated process designed to prevent a trader’s losses from exceeding their initial margin and to protect the exchange from potential bad debt. Think of it like this: Leverage: You borrow funds from an exchange to amplify your potential returns. If you have 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment controls $10,000 worth of crypto. Margin: Your initial $1,000 is your margin, acting as collateral. Price Movement: If the market moves against your position, your losses start eating into your margin. Margin Call/Liquidation Price: The exchange calculates a ‘liquidation price’. If the asset’s price hits this point, your position is automatically closed to prevent further losses. This mechanism, while a safeguard for exchanges, can be brutal for traders, especially during periods of high volatility. The recent event highlights just how quickly fortunes can turn when trading with leverage. The Recent Shockwave: Numbers Behind the Carnage The numbers from the past 24 hours paint a stark picture of the market’s recent turbulence. A rapid price swing, likely triggered by a significant market event or a cascade of selling pressure, led to a domino effect of liquidations. Here’s a quick breakdown of the reported figures: Timeframe Total Futures Liquidated Impact Past Hour $113 Million Sudden, concentrated losses for highly leveraged positions. Past 24 Hours $409 Million Broader market impact, indicating sustained volatility. These figures indicate that many traders were caught on the wrong side of a rapid price movement, often amplified by high leverage. While specific details about which coins or exchanges saw the most liquidations are not provided in the initial report, it’s typical for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures to account for the largest share of such events due to their high trading volumes and liquidity. Why Do Such Massive Crypto Liquidations Occur? Massive crypto liquidations are not random events; they are typically the culmination of several factors interacting within a volatile market. Understanding these triggers is key to appreciating the risks involved in futures trading: Sudden Price Swings: The most direct cause. A rapid pump or dump in price can quickly push leveraged positions to their liquidation points. High Leverage: While leverage can magnify gains, it equally magnifies losses. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement needed to trigger a liquidation. Many traders, seeking quick profits, often over-leverage, making them extremely vulnerable. Market Sentiment and News: Negative news (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, major hacks, economic downturns) or shifts in market sentiment can lead to panic selling, causing prices to tumble rapidly and trigger liquidations. Whale Activity: Large traders or institutions (‘whales’) can execute massive trades that significantly impact prices, intentionally or unintentionally triggering a cascade of liquidations. Cascading Liquidations: When one set of liquidations occurs, the forced selling can further depress prices, leading to more liquidations, creating a dangerous feedback loop. This ‘liquidation cascade’ can exacerbate market downturns. The recent $113 million hourly flush suggests a particularly sharp, unexpected price movement caught a large number of long or short positions off guard, indicating the market’s inherent sensitivity to sudden shifts. Impact on the Crypto Market: A Ripple Effect? When significant crypto liquidations occur, their effects ripple far beyond the individual traders involved. What kind of impact can we expect to see? Increased Volatility: Liquidations often lead to more price swings as forced selling adds downward pressure, or forced buying (in the case of short liquidations) adds upward pressure. Market Sentiment Shift: Large liquidation events can sow fear and uncertainty among traders, leading to a more cautious or bearish outlook in the short term. Reduced Open Interest: The total value of outstanding derivatives contracts (open interest) often decreases after major liquidations, indicating that leveraged positions have been cleared out. This can sometimes ‘reset’ the market for future moves. Opportunities for Savvy Traders: While devastating for some, these events can present opportunities for experienced traders to enter positions at lower prices or profit from increased volatility. The market’s ability to absorb such shocks and recover is a testament to its resilience, but these events serve as stark reminders of the risks involved. Who Gets Hit Hardest by Crypto Liquidations? While liquidations affect all types of traders, certain groups tend to bear the brunt of these events. Generally, those with the highest leverage and least risk management are most vulnerable. This often includes: New and Inexperienced Traders: Lured by the promise of amplified gains, new traders often use excessive leverage without fully understanding the risks or implementing proper stop-loss strategies. Retail Traders: While institutional players also use leverage, retail traders often have smaller capital bases, making them more susceptible to quick margin calls. Traders with Concentrated Positions: Those who put a large portion of their capital into a single highly leveraged trade are at extreme risk if that trade goes sour. Diversification, even within futures trading, can mitigate some risk. It’s a harsh lesson that the market often teaches: leverage is a double-edged sword, and discipline is paramount. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies to Mitigate Risk from Crypto Liquidations Given the inherent volatility and the potential for rapid crypto liquidations , how can traders protect themselves and navigate these turbulent waters? Here are some actionable insights and strategies: Understand Leverage Thoroughly: Don’t just pick the highest leverage available. Understand what 5x, 10x, or 50x leverage truly means for your liquidation price. Lower leverage equals greater buffer. Always Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is perhaps the most critical tool. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses and preventing liquidation. Set it at a point where you’re comfortable exiting the trade. Manage Your Position Size: Never risk more than a small percentage of your total trading capital on any single trade. Even if you get liquidated, it shouldn’t wipe out your entire portfolio. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Keep an eye on your margin ratio. If it’s getting low, consider adding more collateral to your position to lower your liquidation price and give your trade more breathing room. Diversify Your Portfolio: While primarily for spot trading, the principle applies to futures. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you must trade multiple futures contracts, spread your risk. Stay Informed and Monitor News: Keep up with market news, economic indicators, and regulatory developments that could impact crypto prices. Unexpected news often triggers sharp movements. Practice Risk Management: Develop a trading plan that includes entry and exit strategies, risk-reward ratios, and rules for when to cut losses. Stick to your plan rigorously. Consider Hedging Strategies: More advanced traders might use hedging techniques, such as taking an opposite position in another market or using options, to offset potential losses in their futures positions. Remember, the goal isn’t to avoid all losses (which is impossible), but to manage them effectively so that no single event, like a liquidation, can derail your entire trading journey. Lessons Learned from Past Liquidations This isn’t the first time the crypto market has seen massive crypto liquidations , and it certainly won’t be the last. Past events, such as the ‘Black Thursday’ crash in March 2020 or various periods of significant deleveraging, have repeatedly demonstrated the fragility of over-leveraged markets. Each major liquidation event serves as a harsh but valuable lesson: The Market is Unforgiving: It does not care about your hopes or financial needs. Leverage is a Tool, Not a Toy: It requires respect and careful handling. Risk Management is Non-Negotiable: It’s the difference between surviving a downturn and being wiped out. Those who learn from these cycles often emerge stronger, adopting more disciplined and sustainable trading practices. The Future of Crypto Futures: What’s Next? Despite the dramatic headlines surrounding crypto liquidations , futures trading remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering tools for hedging, speculation, and price discovery. The market continues to mature, with exchanges implementing more robust risk management systems and offering educational resources. As the industry evolves, we may see: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are paying closer attention to derivatives markets, which could lead to stricter rules on leverage limits and investor protection. More Sophisticated Trading Tools: AI and advanced algorithms are increasingly used by traders to manage risk and execute strategies more efficiently. Greater Market Resilience: As the market deepens and more institutional players enter, its ability to absorb large liquidation events without catastrophic collapses may improve. The future will likely involve a balance between the innovation that crypto markets are known for and the necessary safeguards to protect participants. The recent crypto liquidations serve as a potent reminder of the raw power and inherent risks within the digital asset space. While the numbers—$113 million in an hour, $409 million in 24 hours—are startling, they are also invaluable data points for understanding market dynamics. For every liquidation, there’s a lesson in risk management, the importance of understanding leverage, and the need for a disciplined approach to trading. The crypto market is a place of incredible opportunity, but it demands respect for its volatility. By prioritizing sound strategies and continuous learning, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters and potentially thrive, even when the market unleashes its next shockwave. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below a required threshold, typically due to adverse price movements. This mechanism protects both the trader from deeper debt and the exchange from unrecoverable losses. How does leverage contribute to crypto liquidations? Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. While it allows traders to control a larger position with less capital, it also means that smaller adverse price movements can lead to your margin being insufficient to cover potential losses, triggering a liquidation at a specific ‘liquidation price’. Are crypto liquidations always bad for the market? While devastating for the individual traders involved, large liquidation events can sometimes act as a ‘reset’ for the market by clearing out excessive leverage. This can reduce overall market risk in the long term, though they often cause short-term volatility and negative sentiment. What can I do to avoid being liquidated? To avoid crypto liquidations , prioritize risk management: use lower leverage, always set stop-loss orders, manage your position size relative to your total capital, maintain sufficient margin, and stay informed about market conditions. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Which cryptocurrencies are most susceptible to liquidations? Generally, cryptocurrencies with high trading volume and liquidity, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), tend to see the largest liquidation amounts simply because more futures contracts are traded on them. However, any highly volatile altcoin can also experience significant liquidations if large leveraged positions are open. How do major exchanges handle liquidations? Major exchanges use automated liquidation engines that monitor positions in real-time. When a position hits its liquidation price, the engine takes over, often trying to close the position quickly in the market or through an insurance fund mechanism to cover any remaining deficit. They also provide risk parameters and margin requirements to traders. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-23T14:00:49,"SEC Set To Shake Up Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs With In-Kind Approval","The US Securities and Exchange Commission is edging toward a structural makeover of spot‑Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange‑traded funds, after five Cboe BZX‑listed products simultaneously asked to swap their cash‑only creation and redemption model for the in‑kind mechanics long used by commodity and equity ETFs. Filings submitted late on 22 July cover the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (together in SR‑CboeBZX‑2025‑010 Amendment No. 3), WisdomTree’s Bitcoin Fund (SR‑CboeBZX‑2025‑033 Amendment No. 1) and both the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (SR‑CboeBZX‑2025‑023 Amendment No. 1). Each amendment rewrites language inserted in early‑2024 approval orders that had locked the trusts into cash creations and redemptions, substituting the phrase “cash or in‑kind transactions” and adding detailed settlement workflows for direct transfers of Bitcoin or Ether between the trust’s custodian and an authorised participant. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who first spotted the coordinated move, told his followers on X that the quintet of filings is “more positive signs regarding Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs obtaining the ability to do in‑kind creation and redemption… This indicates to me that there is positive movement and likely fine‑tuning happening with the SEC.” Anticipating confusion, he added: “No, this is not going to be for retail or normies to trade in shares of their ETFs for the underlying asset or vice versa. This would only be for the Authorized Participants (think big wall street firms and market makers) This will make current and future crypto ETFs more efficient. But the vast majority of people won’t even see a difference because the products on the market now already trade extremely efficiently. This will treat crypto ETPs the same as other ETPs are treated.” Commenting on a time horizon when retail investors could use the in-kind redemption process, Seyffart added: “Would be cool to see consumers being able to withdraw and deposit actual ETH into the ETF with a certain threshold. I personally think withdrawals like this will eventually happen. But it may be in the distant future. One step at a time. This already exists for some gold ETFs.” Why In-Kind Matters For Bitcoin And Ether ETFs Under the cash model imposed when spot Bitcoin ETPs were finally approved on 10 January 2024, an AP delivers dollars to the fund, which then buys the cryptocurrency in the spot market; redemptions reverse the process. That design solved SEC concerns under Chair Gensler about custody and settlement risk but introduced two frictions: the trust itself must trade in the underlying market, and the resulting order flow can push net asset value away from share price when spot liquidity is thin. In‑kind processing hands those trades back to authorised participants. When creating shares the AP ships Bitcoin or Ether directly to the fund’s cold‑wallet; when redeeming it receives coins instead of cash. The structure is standard in the broader ETF ecosystem and is associated with tighter spreads, smaller primary‑market imbalances and material tax advantages because portfolio securities — or in this case, crypto‑assets — are released “in kind” rather than being sold and realising capital gains inside the fund. The SEC itself notes that ETFs “can be more tax efficient… because ETF shares generally are redeemable ‘in‑kind’. Commodity trusts already employing in‑kind redemptions provide the regulatory template the crypto issuers are invoking. SPDR Gold Shares, for example, lets an authorised participant exchange a 100,000‑share basket for physical bullion, a feature that ultimately allows an individual investor to “take physical possession of the gold backing his or her shares,” albeit through a broker‑facilitated arrangement. By mirroring that language, the Bitcoin and Ether trusts argue they are simply seeking parity with existing commodity ETPs. Operational pressure has also mounted as primary‑market volumes grow. Since launch the eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in 2024 have drawn nearly $55 billion in cumulative net inflows; market‑making desks face the hurdle of sourcing billions of dollars at 4 p.m. every settlement day — then unwinding the crypto exposure after the trust purchases coins. This ties up the balance sheet and widens spreads during volatile sessions. Allowing in‑kind hand‑offs lets desks source or hedge Bitcoin and Ether continuously and deliver the assets straight into the trust’s wallet at T + 0.
