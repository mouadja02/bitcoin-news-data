2025-07-23T11:40:23,"MARA Holdings Unveils Ambitious $850 Million Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy","BitcoinWorld MARA Holdings Unveils Ambitious $850 Million Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy In a move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape, U.S. crypto mining powerhouse MARA Holdings , formerly known as Marathon Digital, has announced a significant strategic shift. The company intends to issue an astounding $850 million in 0% convertible notes. This substantial capital raise is primarily earmarked for the acquisition of more Bitcoin (BTC), alongside repaying $50 million in existing notes and addressing general corporate purposes. This bold financial maneuver by MARA Holdings underscores a growing trend among crypto-native companies to fortify their balance sheets with the very digital asset they help create. Unpacking MARA Holdings ‘ Ambitious $850 Million Strategy The decision by MARA Holdings to issue $850 million in 0% convertible notes is a sophisticated financial play that deserves a closer look. But what exactly are convertible notes, and why are they being offered at a 0% interest rate? What are Convertible Notes? These are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company at a predetermined price or a specified future date. Essentially, they start as debt but have the potential to become equity. The 0% Interest Rate Explained: The lack of interest payments makes these notes particularly attractive to the issuer ( MARA Holdings ). Investors are willing to accept 0% interest because the primary return comes from the potential appreciation of the company’s stock once the notes convert. If the stock price rises significantly, the conversion becomes very profitable. It also signals confidence from the company that its stock price is likely to increase, making conversion a desirable outcome for investors. Allocation of Funds: The $850 million raised by MARA Holdings isn’t just for Bitcoin. The allocation is strategic: A significant portion will go towards purchasing more Bitcoin, directly increasing the company’s BTC holdings. $50 million is allocated to repay existing notes, demonstrating financial prudence and debt management. The remainder is for general corporate purposes, providing flexibility for operational needs, expansion, or other strategic investments. This financial instrument allows MARA Holdings to raise substantial capital without immediate dilution of existing shares, while also betting on the future appreciation of both its stock and Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin? The Strategic Imperative for MARA Holdings For a company whose core business is Bitcoin mining, increasing its direct Bitcoin holdings might seem intuitive, but it’s a strategic decision with multiple layers of benefit. Why would MARA Holdings choose to deploy such a large sum into acquiring more BTC? Holding Bitcoin directly offers several compelling advantages for a mining company: Direct Exposure to Price Appreciation: By holding more BTC, MARA Holdings directly benefits from any increase in Bitcoin’s market price, amplifying potential returns beyond just the profits from mining operations. It transforms a portion of their treasury into a growth asset. Hedging Against Mining Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining can fluctuate significantly with changes in Bitcoin’s price, mining difficulty, and energy costs. A substantial BTC treasury can act as a hedge, providing a stable asset base during periods of lower mining profitability. Strengthening Balance Sheet: For a crypto-native company, a strong Bitcoin treasury can be viewed as a robust asset, signaling financial strength and long-term vision to investors who understand the digital asset space. It’s a strategic asset that aligns with their core mission. Operational Flexibility: A large Bitcoin reserve can provide liquidity for future investments, operational expenses, or even share buybacks, without needing to liquidate mining infrastructure or raise additional capital through traditional means. This move positions MARA Holdings not just as a miner, but as a significant holder and proponent of Bitcoin, intertwining its financial fate even more closely with the digital gold. Navigating the Nuances: Risks and Rewards for MARA Holdings and Investors While the strategy appears ambitious and potentially lucrative, it’s crucial to consider both the opportunities and the inherent risks involved for MARA Holdings and its investors. Potential Rewards: Enhanced Shareholder Value: If Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, and MARA Holdings ‘ stock performs well, the conversion of notes into equity could be highly profitable for noteholders, reflecting positively on the company’s overall valuation. Market Leadership: Increasing its Bitcoin treasury solidifies MARA Holdings ‘ position as a major player in the crypto mining and holding space, potentially attracting more institutional investment and market attention. Future Growth Capital: A stronger balance sheet with significant Bitcoin holdings can provide a foundation for future expansion, whether it’s investing in more efficient mining rigs, exploring new technologies, or even strategic acquisitions. Potential Risks: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The most obvious risk is Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. A significant downturn in BTC’s value could negatively impact the value of MARA Holdings ‘ treasury and potentially deter noteholders from converting, leaving the company with a large debt obligation. Share Dilution: While not immediate, the eventual conversion of these notes into equity will dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. This is a trade-off for the capital raised without interest payments. Market Sentiment: While the news has been largely positive, a shift in broader market sentiment towards crypto or mining companies could impact the perceived value of MARA Holdings ‘ strategy. This move is a calculated risk, betting on the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin and the continued growth of the digital asset economy. The Broader Impact: How MARA Holdings ‘ Move Shapes the Crypto Landscape The actions of a major player like MARA Holdings don’t occur in a vacuum; they send signals throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This $850 million move could have several ripple effects: Precedent for Other Miners: Other publicly traded crypto mining companies might observe MARA Holdings ‘ strategy closely. If successful, it could encourage similar debt-to-Bitcoin acquisition models across the industry, leading to more miners accumulating larger BTC treasuries. Influence on Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics: While $850 million is a significant sum, its impact on Bitcoin’s overall supply and demand dynamics needs to be contextualized. However, a series of large corporate acquisitions could collectively tighten the available supply on exchanges, potentially exerting upward pressure on prices. Validation for Bitcoin as a Corporate Asset: When a major, publicly traded company like MARA Holdings makes such a substantial investment in Bitcoin, it further legitimizes BTC as a viable corporate treasury asset, potentially encouraging more traditional companies to consider similar allocations. Increased Institutional Interest: The sophisticated financing mechanism used by MARA Holdings , combined with a clear Bitcoin accumulation strategy, could attract more traditional institutional investors who are looking for exposure to the digital asset space through publicly traded companies. This strategy by MARA Holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement about the company’s long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value and its role in the evolving financial landscape. Expert Insights and Future Outlook for MARA Holdings Industry analysts and market observers are keenly watching how this strategy unfolds for MARA Holdings . The consensus generally leans towards viewing this as a bullish signal for both the company and the broader Bitcoin market, assuming a positive long-term outlook for BTC. The move highlights a strategic pivot for many mining companies from merely extracting Bitcoin to also actively managing and growing their Bitcoin holdings as a core asset. This dual strategy — mining and holding — could become the standard for successful players in the space. For MARA Holdings , it positions them as a leader willing to innovate in corporate finance to capitalize on digital asset opportunities. Looking ahead, the success of this strategy for MARA Holdings will largely depend on the sustained performance of Bitcoin and the company’s ability to manage its operations efficiently amidst changing market conditions. It sets a fascinating precedent for how crypto-native businesses can leverage diverse financial instruments to achieve their strategic goals. A Deep Dive into the Future of Digital Assets MARA Holdings ‘ audacious move to issue $850 million in 0% convertible notes to significantly boost its Bitcoin treasury is a testament to the growing maturity and innovative spirit within the cryptocurrency industry. This strategy not only provides the company with substantial capital for Bitcoin acquisition and debt repayment but also underscores a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role as a foundational asset. While presenting its own set of risks, particularly related to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and potential shareholder dilution, the benefits of enhanced balance sheet strength, direct exposure to BTC’s appreciation, and a strengthened market position are clear. As MARA Holdings navigates this ambitious path, its journey will undoubtedly serve as a significant case study for other crypto enterprises, shaping the future of corporate finance in the digital asset era. It’s a bold step that highlights the evolving strategies of crypto miners and their increasing integration into mainstream financial practices, all while staying true to their digital asset roots. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are 0% convertible notes and why did MARA Holdings issue them? A1: 0% convertible notes are debt instruments that pay no interest but can be converted into the issuing company’s stock at a predetermined price or date. MARA Holdings issued them to raise significant capital ($850 million) without incurring immediate interest expenses or shareholder dilution. Investors accept 0% interest for the potential profit from converting the notes into shares if the company’s stock price increases. Q2: How will MARA Holdings use the $850 million raised? A2: The funds will primarily be used to purchase more Bitcoin (BTC), significantly increasing MARA Holdings ‘ direct crypto holdings. A portion ($50 million) is also allocated to repay existing notes, and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes, providing operational flexibility. Q3: What are the main benefits for MARA Holdings in acquiring more Bitcoin? A3: Acquiring more Bitcoin offers several benefits, including direct exposure to BTC’s price appreciation, which can amplify returns; acting as a hedge against the volatility of mining profitability; strengthening the company’s balance sheet; and providing operational flexibility for future investments or expenses. Q4: What are the risks associated with this strategy for MARA Holdings? A4: The primary risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, which could negatively impact the value of MARA Holdings ‘ treasury. Additionally, the eventual conversion of these notes into equity will lead to dilution for existing shareholders, and overall market sentiment towards crypto could also affect the strategy’s success. Q5: How might this move by MARA Holdings impact the broader crypto market? A5: This significant investment by MARA Holdings could set a precedent for other crypto mining companies to adopt similar debt-to-Bitcoin acquisition models. It also further validates Bitcoin as a viable corporate treasury asset and could potentially increase institutional interest in publicly traded crypto companies, subtly influencing supply dynamics. Q6: What does this move signify for the future of crypto mining companies? A6: This strategy signifies an evolving trend where crypto mining companies are not just focused on extracting Bitcoin but also on actively managing and growing their Bitcoin holdings as a core asset.

2025-07-23T11:25:23,"Urgent Alert: OKX Delisting Seven Margin Trading Pairs on July 23","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: OKX Delisting Seven Margin Trading Pairs on July 23 In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying updated with exchange announcements is not just important, it’s absolutely critical for every trader. A recent announcement from OKX, one of the leading global cryptocurrency exchanges, has sent ripples across the trading community. Effective July 23, 2024, at 11:00 UTC , OKX will proceed with the significant OKX delisting of seven specific margin trading pairs. This move requires immediate attention from anyone holding or trading these assets on the platform. What’s Happening? A Closer Look at the OKX Delisting OKX officially announced on its website that it will cease support for margin trading on the following seven pairs. This means that users will no longer be able to open new margin positions or maintain existing ones after the specified time. Here’s a clear breakdown: Trading Pair Delisting Date & Time (UTC) RDNT/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 ID/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 AIDOGE/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 XCH/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 CSPR/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 CTC/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 JOE/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 This coordinated OKX delisting of these specific pairs signals a strategic adjustment by the exchange, aiming to optimize its offerings and maintain a robust trading environment. For traders involved with these assets, understanding the implications is the first step towards mitigating potential risks. Why Do Exchanges Delist Trading Pairs? Understanding the Rationale Behind Crypto Delisting The decision by an exchange like OKX to delist certain margin trading pairs is rarely arbitrary. It’s usually a calculated move driven by several factors, all aimed at ensuring the health and integrity of the trading platform. Understanding these reasons can help traders anticipate future delistings and make more informed decisions. Low Liquidity: One of the primary reasons for a crypto delisting is insufficient trading volume and liquidity. Pairs with low liquidity can lead to significant price slippage, making it difficult for traders to enter or exit positions without impacting the market price. Exchanges prefer to allocate resources to more active markets. Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Exchanges must adhere to strict guidelines in various jurisdictions. A token or trading pair might be delisted if it no longer meets regulatory standards or poses a compliance risk. Project Performance and Viability: Exchanges regularly review the performance and development of listed projects. If a project becomes inactive, fails to meet its roadmap goals, or exhibits security vulnerabilities, an exchange might choose to delist its token to protect users. Market Demand and Strategic Focus: Sometimes, delistings are part of a broader strategy to refine the exchange’s offerings. If certain pairs no longer align with the exchange’s market focus or user demand shifts, they might be removed to streamline the platform and enhance efficiency. Security Concerns: Any security vulnerabilities discovered in a project’s underlying blockchain or smart contracts can trigger an immediate delisting to prevent potential hacks or exploits that could harm users. This particular OKX delisting likely stems from a combination of these factors, as the exchange continuously strives to offer a secure and efficient trading experience. Impact on Traders: Navigating the Consequences of Delisted Margin Trading Pairs For traders actively engaged with these seven margin trading pairs , the announcement carries significant implications. It’s not just about closing positions; it’s about understanding the potential financial ramifications and taking proactive steps. Forced Liquidation: If you have open margin positions on any of the delisted pairs, OKX will likely initiate forced liquidation if you do not close them before the deadline. This can occur at unfavorable market prices, leading to unexpected losses. Loss of Trading Opportunity: Traders who rely on these specific pairs for their strategies will need to find alternative assets or exchanges, potentially disrupting their trading plans and requiring new market analysis. Asset Conversion/Withdrawal: While margin trading will cease, users typically retain their spot holdings of these tokens. However, they will need to convert them to other assets or withdraw them from OKX if they wish to continue trading them elsewhere, incurring potential fees and time delays. Market Volatility: Delisting announcements can sometimes trigger increased volatility for the affected assets as traders rush to close positions or move their funds. This can present both risks and limited opportunities for very nimble traders. The key takeaway is that inaction is not an option. Every trader with exposure to these assets must act decisively to manage their risk effectively due to the impending OKX delisting . Actionable Steps: What Should You Do Before the OKX Delisting Deadline? Given the urgency, here are crucial steps every trader should consider taking before July 23, 2024, 11:00 UTC: Review Your Portfolio Immediately: Check your OKX account for any open margin positions, pending orders, or even spot holdings related to RDNT, ID, AIDOGE, XCH, CSPR, CTC, and JOE. Close Margin Positions: It is highly recommended to manually close all your open margin positions on these pairs well before the deadline. Do not wait for forced liquidation, as it may result in greater losses. Withdraw or Convert Affected Assets: If you hold these tokens in your spot wallet, decide whether you want to withdraw them to an external wallet or another exchange, or convert them into other supported cryptocurrencies like USDT or BTC on OKX. Be mindful of withdrawal fees and minimums. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official OKX announcements for any further updates or clarifications regarding the OKX delisting process. Re-evaluate Your Trading Strategy: Use this opportunity to assess your overall trading strategy. Diversification and adapting to market changes are crucial in the volatile crypto space. Proactive management is the best defense against potential losses stemming from this significant change in margin trading pairs on OKX. Navigating the Future: Beyond the OKX Delisting While an OKX delisting can seem disruptive, it’s also a reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Exchanges constantly adapt to market conditions, regulatory pressures, and technological advancements. For traders, this means cultivating resilience and adaptability. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on a single asset or a small set of assets, especially those with lower liquidity, can expose you to higher risks during events like delistings. Understand Exchange Policies: Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of any exchange you use, particularly their policies regarding asset reviews and delistings. Monitor Project Developments: Keep track of the fundamental developments of the projects whose tokens you hold. Strong, active projects are less likely to face delisting due to inactivity or lack of progress. Explore Alternatives: If a specific asset or margin trading pair is crucial to your strategy, research other reputable exchanges where it might still be listed and supported for margin trading. OKX, like other major exchanges, aims to provide a secure and compliant environment. These adjustments, though sometimes inconvenient, are part of maintaining a healthy ecosystem for crypto trading. The upcoming OKX delisting of seven margin trading pairs on July 23 serves as a potent reminder of the importance of vigilance and adaptability in the crypto market. While such events can present challenges, they also underscore the need for robust risk management and proactive portfolio adjustments. By understanding the reasons behind delistings and taking immediate, decisive action, traders can mitigate potential losses and continue to navigate the exciting, albeit sometimes unpredictable, world of digital assets. Stay informed, stay prepared, and always prioritize the security of your investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding the OKX delisting : Q1: What exactly does it mean for OKX to delist a margin trading pair? A1: When OKX delists a margin trading pair, it means that effective from the announced date and time (July 23, 11:00 UTC), users will no longer be able to open new margin positions for that pair. Existing margin positions will also be subject to forced liquidation if not closed manually before the deadline. Q2: Will I lose my tokens if my margin trading pair is delisted? A2: No, you will not lose your tokens. The delisting specifically affects margin trading. Your spot holdings of RDNT, ID, AIDOGE, XCH, CSPR, CTC, and JOE will remain in your OKX spot wallet. However, you will need to either convert them to other supported assets or withdraw them to another wallet/exchange if you wish to trade them further. Q3: Why is OKX delisting these specific pairs? A3: Exchanges typically delist pairs due to factors such as low liquidity, regulatory compliance issues, lack of project development, security concerns, or a strategic decision to optimize their offerings. While OKX hasn’t provided specific reasons for each pair, it’s generally part of their ongoing review to maintain a healthy trading environment. Q4: What should I do if I have open margin positions on these pairs? A4: It is highly recommended to close all your open margin positions on RDNT/USDT, ID/USDT, AIDOGE/USDT, XCH/USDT, CSPR/USDT, CTC/USDT, and JOE/USDT before July 23, 11:00 UTC. Failing to do so may result in forced liquidation at potentially unfavorable prices. Q5: Can I still trade these tokens on OKX after the delisting? A5: You will not be able to trade these specific pairs in margin mode after the delisting. For spot trading, you might be able to convert them to other assets or withdraw them. Always check the latest official announcements from OKX for precise details on continued spot trading support. Found this article helpful?

He attributes this to Solana’s advanced blockchain technology, growing ecosystem, and rising investor interest. If Pal’s prediction holds, Solana’s price could exceed $400 in the coming months, a significant surge from its previous peak. Despite market trends, Solana has shown resilience, maintaining a strong performance with consistent buying pressure.

2025-07-23T11:20:17,"XRP Set to Skyrocket? Analyst Predicts $13 in 6 Weeks","The post XRP Set to Skyrocket? Analyst Predicts $13 in 6 Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is on the move ! In the last 30 days, with a significant rise of 70.9%, XRP has outperformed almost all top cryptos, including the top two cryptos, Bitcoin (15.9%) and Ethereum (62.2%). In the last seven days alone, it has surged by over 16.7%. On July 16, the XRP price broke above the $3 mark for the first time in four months. At one point, on July 18, it touched a yearly peak of $3.6615. Since July 16 alone, the XRP market has jumped 18.17% to $3.4416. Tony “ The Bull” Severino , a respected market analyst, predicts that XRP could hit $13 within the next six weeks. Possible? Why’s this Optimistic about XRP? Severino’s prediction is not pulled from thin air. He points to at least three strong technical indications. Firstly, he highlights that XRP recently broke out of a massive, long-term pattern (that is, a seven-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern), signalling significant upward momentum. Secondly, he points out that a smaller, more recent triangle (that is, a six-month Bull Pennant pattern), also saw a breakout, adding to the bullish signs. Thirdly, as per his Elliot Wave analysis, XRP is right now in the “Wave 5” of its bullish cycle. He argues that Wave 4 saw XRP dip from $3.4 in January 2025 to $1.96 in June 2025. He claims that Wave 5 would push the XRP price significantly higher. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Trader Reveals 14x Gains, Predicts $5 as Next Stop , The Path to $13 for XRP If things evolve as predicted by Severino, the XRP market would hit the $13 market within the next six weeks. His six-week timeline is actually based on XRP’s historic 2017 bull run, where the cryptocurrency peaked six weeks after a similar pattern breakout. What Comes After the $13 XRP Peak? While the immediate future looks bright, Severiono warns that, after potentially hitting $13, XRP might experience a major market correction, possibly forming an ABC corrective pattern as per Elliott Wave Theory. In conclusion, Severino’s analysis paints an exceptionally bullish picture for XRP in the short term, supported by strong technical breakouts and Elliott Wave patterns. However, he also reminds investors that even strong rallies are often followed by corrections. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-23T11:15:09,"South Korea FSS pushes for asset managers to limit crypto ETF exposure","The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) of South Korea has given new orders to local asset managers to limit their exposure to crypto-related firms in their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The directive refers to larger U.S. crypto companies, such as Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR), which are prominently included in several local ETF portfolios. The asset managers have been advised not to place much emphasis on crypto-themed stocks in ETF structure based on some of the guidelines that have been reviewed by local firms. Others, including Korea Investment Management ACE US Stock Bestseller ETF, already hold more than 14% in Coinbase . The KoACT US Nasdaq Growth Company Active ETF includes 13.4% of Coinbase and 13.4% of Strategy. Although the retail phenomenon of crypto investments is increasingly popular in South Korea , the FSS has doubled down on its 2017 position, which prohibits direct holdings, investments, or use of cryptocurrencies as collateral by financial organizations. An FSS official reiterated that although the global opinion would seem to be trending towards the use of digital assets, South Korea needs to follow the currently available guidelines until a wider legal framework is adopted. The announcement was made amid increased tension between regulatory conservatism and the rapidly growing crypto sector in the country. Crypto demand grows as regulators hold back The FSS crackdown comes after South Korea registered a rise in crypto-related investments. More than 18 million citizens trade cryptocurrencies, and several ETFs have become more heavily weighted with digital asset companies listed overseas. Such trends expose the gap between investor demands and regulatory policy. The South Korean ETF market now includes more than 1,000 listed products, whereas the FSS is still worried about the risk of overexposure to crypto stocks. The agency advice identifies ETFs that allocate over 10% of their funds in firms dealing with virtual assets, especially those that use U.S. listings. Market players say that focusing on domestic ETFs is not a level playing field. Investors can still indirectly get exposure to crypto through the U.S.-based ETFs, free from similar restrictions. Some critics argue that local money is being unfairly restricted, hitting competitiveness and damaging passive investment techniques. Conflicting signals as government pursues crypto-friendly measures The FSS directive is opposed to the recent events that seemed promising to the crypto world. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups of South Korea recently suggested lifting controls that did not allow crypto firms to obtain tax incentives and governmental funding. The initiative will identify digital asset companies as venture enterprises. Regulatory interest also shifted to stablecoins , with many South Korean banks in exploratory mode. Others registered trademarks on potential stablecoin products, with the Bank of Korea revealing plans for a consortium of banks to issue a won-pegged stablecoin by 2026. In addition, Parataxis Holdings recently announced that it has established a presence in South Korea and is the first Bitcoin treasury company through its acquisition of biotech company Bridge Biotherapeutics. The $18.5 million purchase is a sign of change with regard to crypto-native treasury management practices.

2025-07-23T11:03:09,"Glassnode Analyst Says ""It's Impossible for Bitcoin to Reach These Levels in 2025!"" Explains What He Expects for the Price After That!","Following a rally in recent weeks, leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) broke a new record, surpassing $123,000. Following a subsequent correction, BTC continues to consolidate below $120,000. While Bitcoin's rise is expected to continue, the price is expected to reach 200,000-250,000 dollars by the end of the year. However, the Glassnode analyst said that Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year. Speaking to the YouTube channel Less Noise More Signal, Glassnode chief analyst James Check stated that the buying pressure and trading volume in Bitcoin are insufficient, and that it is unlikely that the price will reach $200,000 in 2025. “Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year. This is because there is not enough buying pressure and trading volume remains low.” The analyst also noted that Bitcoin still has many obstacles to overcome, warning that a major drop could occur if the price rises without proper support. “There are many thresholds ahead of us, such as $130,000 and $140,000. Without strong and stable support, any rapid price increase could result in an equally sharp decline.” The analyst also stated that he will not take long-term leveraged positions until trading volume increases, adding, “I will not take risks until market stability is achieved.” Finally, emphasizing that Bitcoin will eventually surpass $200,000, the analyst said, “I am confident that Bitcoin will definitely surpass $200,000 in the next five years. I am investing most of my assets in Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Glassnode Analyst Says ""It's Impossible for Bitcoin to Reach These Levels in 2025!""

2025-07-23T11:00:26,"‘Not A Threat’: Wester Union To Explore Stablecoin Integration For Cross-Border Payments","Western Union has joined the stablecoin race following the end of the historic “Crypto Week” and the recent passage of key legislation. The company is reportedly set to tap into digital assets for faster cross-border payments. Western Union Eyes ‘Opportunity To Innovate’ On Monday, Western Union CEO Devin McGranahan said that the company is exploring a path to integrate stablecoins into its services worldwide as interest in the sector continues to grow. In an interview with Bloomberg, McGranahan affirmed that stablecoins aren’t a threat to the company, but “one more opportunity to innovate,” adding that the sector offers three “real” opportunities for Western Union and its customers. According to the CEO, integrating these assets offers a path for faster cross-border payments. It also provides an opportunity for conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoins, particularly in countries where local currency conversions are harder. Additionally, the company could offer stablecoins as a store of value to their customer worldwide. McGranahan detailed that the company is already innovating new settlement processes to “move money quicker and to more easily convert into local currency” in different places, including South America and Africa. Moreover, Western Union is exploring partnerships with infrastructure companies to enable buying and selling these digital assets through their platform and how it could offer stablecoin products in its digital wallets to its customers: We are also exploring other partnerships with people who want on-ramps and off-ramps in different parts of the world and how we could enable Western Union’s funds in and funds out to enable people to purchase and sell Stablecoins. More Companies Prepare Stablecoin Integration McGranahan’s remarks come just days after US President Donald Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law last Friday. The legislation is set to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, allowing tokens like USDT and USDC to fall under the Federal Reserve rules and enable the sector’s growth in the US. Standard Chartered Bank has estimated that the stablecoin market, valued at $268 billion, could expand to $2 trillion by 2028. Similarly, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks forecasted that the sector could reach a $3 trillion valuation in the coming years once legislation was passed. MARA CEO Fred Thiel considers that the US is taking a leadership position globally following the GENIUS Act’s passage, adding that it will be “very helpful for providing trust” to the sector and allowing the market to “move much freer.” Notably, several major US banks, including Bank of America (BofA) and Citibank, are also exploring the sector amid the US regulatory shift. BofA’s CEO, Brian Moynihan, recently confirmed the bank is developing its stablecoin. In January, Moynihan affirmed that the US banking industry was ready to embrace digital asset payments and banks would “come hard” to crypto if the US regulatory landscape allowed it.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/not-a-threat-wester-union-to-explore-stablecoin-integration-for-cross-border-payments/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY","Crypto News|Bank of America|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto payments|GENIUS Act|President Donald Trump|Stablecoin race|stablecoins adoption|stablecoins legislation|US Banks|Western Union",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T11:00:16,"Bitwise Crypto ETF Faces Sudden Pause After Surprise Approval by the SEC","The U.S. SEC has approved, then abruptly paused, the conversion of Bitwise’s crypto index fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), leaving the process in uncertainty as the agency reviews its own decision. On Tuesday, the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets granted accelerated approval for Bitwise’s plan to convert its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) into an ETF, allowing Bitwise to request an early effective registration date. However, on the same day, SEC assistant secretary Sherry Haywood issued a letter stating the “order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise,” indicating the SEC will review the delegated approval internally. Approval and Immediate Suspension Create Uncertainty Bitwise’s fund, which offers diversified exposure to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, filed for conversion to an ETF in November, aiming to transition its index fund into a structure that could attract broader investor participation. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the SEC acted sooner than expected, as a decision was originally due next week, but clarified that the approval had been stayed by “one or multiple commissioners,” preventing immediate conversion. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, described the situation as “bizarre,” drawing parallels to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF, which faced a similar pause after its approval on July 1. Speculation Grows Around SEC Motives The pause has fueled speculation within the industry regarding the SEC’s intentions . Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital speculated that the approval was granted under delegated authority to preempt potential disruptions from Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, the sole Democrat on the panel, or alternatively, to navigate around the statutory 240-day approval timeline. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas suggested the SEC may be delaying conversions while it finalizes generic listing standards for crypto ETFs, anticipating a rollout before October deadlines. The SEC has recently been engaging with fund managers, stock exchanges, and internal teams to streamline ETF approval processes for crypto vehicles, including potentially automating parts of the application process to bypass 19b-4 filings. Additionally, the SEC extended its review timeline on in-kind redemption structures for Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs on July 17, adding to the regulatory complexity surrounding crypto ETF approvals.

2025-07-23T11:00:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $1 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8664 Market Cap $30.66B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.5B Circulating Supply 35.39B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.9035 24-hour Low $0.8569 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.95% 50-day SMA $ 0.660812 14-Day RSI 82.30 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 21/30 (70%) 200-day SMA $ 0.608825 Cardano (ADA) price analysis ADA is in a strong uptrend on the daily chart but shows overbought signals that may trigger a pullback The 4-hour chart indicates weakening momentum with a potential MACD bearish crossover and fading buyer strength Holding above $0.87 could support continued gains while a drop below may lead to short-term consolidation ADA price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano Maintains Bullish Momentum Amid Potential Short-Term Pullback Based on the correct 1-day chart of Cardano (ADA) on July 23, the asset is currently in a strong uptrend but exhibiting signs of overbought conditions. The price is pushing against the upper Bollinger Band, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 75.11, which suggests the asset is now overbought and may soon experience a pullback or sideways consolidation. ADAUSD chart by TradingView The MACD remains bullish, with the MACD line significantly above the signal line, reflecting upward momentum. However, the steep rise in RSI and Bollinger Band expansion indicates that the trend may soon overheat. Traders should watch for a possible cooldown in the near term. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano Faces Cooling Momentum as Short-Term Bulls Lose Steam On the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the recent bullish surge appears to be losing momentum. The price is hovering just below the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that upward pressure may be easing. The MACD is showing signs of a potential bearish crossover, with the MACD line dipping below the signal line, meaning a weakening bullish momentum. ADAUSD chart by TradingView The Balance of Power indicator stands at 0.31, still favoring buyers, but not firmly. If ADA fails to maintain support near $0.87, it may correct further toward the middle Bollinger Band around $0.84. A bounce from that level could reestablish short-term bullish momentum. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.792401 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.835214 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.805962 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.718591 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.660812 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.690761 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.608825 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.714465 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.690996 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.677725 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.678708 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.711233 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.746786 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.722632 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next Based on the combined analysis of the 1-day and 4-hour charts, Cardano (ADA) is currently in an uptrend but approaching a critical point where a pause or pullback is likely. The daily chart shows strong bullish momentum, but the RSI above 75 signals overbought conditions, suggesting that ADA may face selling pressure soon. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart reveals weakening short-term momentum, with the MACD nearing a bearish crossover and the Balance of Power indicating a reduction in buyer strength. If ADA maintains support above $0.87, the uptrend could resume, but failure to hold that level may lead to a consolidation phase. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely unlikely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $2.45. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano was founded in 2015 and went live in 2017. It initially gained investor support and popularity for being affordable and environmentally friendly due to its unique PoS mechanism called Ouroboros. In 2021, Cardano implemented the smart contract feature with the Alonzo update. This update came on the ADA test network and brought the interoperability and scalability that was promised to the users earlier. The ADA price reached its all-time high during the bullish cycle of 2021 when it hit $3.09. However, its price started plummeting at the beginning of September 2021 and reached a low of $0.220 in June 2023. In 2024, Cardano peaked at $0.810 in March before dropping to $0.401 in April due to heavy selling. It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August. After peaking at $0.37 in September and dipping to $0.33 in November, ADA surged to $1.1999 at the start of December, hit a maximum price of $1.3264, and closed the year at $0.8451. Cardano (ADA) started 2025 trading between $1.02-$1.09 in January but declined to $0.9 by month-end, then continued falling through February and March, reaching lows around $0.60. In April, ADA dropped below $0.55 before surging back to $0.7030, then skyrocketed to $0.8 in early May before settling at $0.7599 by month-end. Throughout June 2025, ADA traded between $0.513-$0.705.

Meanwhile, Remittix offers a real‑world PayFi solution by converting cryptocurrency into fiat bank transfers across 30 countries and its presale has secured over $16.7 million at $0.0842 per token presenting a practical alternative to speculative trading. Saylor’s ever‑growing Bitcoin treasury Michael Saylor transformed his software firm into a Bitcoin juggernaut, accumulating 607,000 BTC through coordinated equity sales and debt issuances. Strategy Technology’s balance sheet now features more than $72 billion in Bitcoin holdings, cementing Bitcoin’s narrative as a non‑correlated reserve asset. As Bitcoin price climbed above $118,000 over the past year, Strategy’s stock soared by over 3,500 percent since 2020. On‑chain data reveals that institutional demand surged alongside price momentum, with daily spot volume regularly exceeding $10 billion. Saylor’s approach sets a precedent for other public companies, demonstrating how a disciplined acquisition strategy can align shareholder returns with long‑term asset appreciation. Trump Media’s bold $2B bet Trump Media & Technology Group advanced its transformation into a Bitcoin treasury company by purchasing $2 billion in Bitcoin and allocating an additional $300 million to options on Bitcoin‑related securities. This allocation brings Bitcoin exposure to two‑thirds of the firm’s $3 billion in total assets. CEO Devin Nunes emphasised that this strategy secures financial freedom, mitigates banking discrimination, and integrates with an upcoming utility token across the Truth Social ecosystem. The GENIUS Act’s passage establishes a federal stablecoin framework, enhancing regulatory clarity for Bitcoin and bolstering corporate confidence. Trump Media’s treasury plan highlights a growing trend among enterprises seeking uncorrelated digital assets to diversify risk and preserve capital purchasing power. Why Remittix offers a superior PayFi alternative While corporate treasuries focus on Bitcoin as a store of value, Remittix addresses a complementary need by bridging cryptocurrency and everyday payments.
