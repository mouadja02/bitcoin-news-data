After a shaky start to the year, ETH has posted an impressive recovery—gaining over 150% since April. Crypto analyst VirtualBacon now believes Ethereum is in the early stages of a macro bull run, driven by bullish technical signals, rising ETF inflows, and Ethereum’s dominance in tokenization and stablecoins. Ethereum Price Analysis Analyst highlights Ethereum’s breakout above the 20-week SMA ($2,345.85) and 50-week SMA ($2,679.45)—a strong bullish signal. He notes that past bull runs began under similar conditions, with: Higher lows forming The 50-week SMA acting as support The 20-week SMA curling upward He also points to the $2,600–$2,900 range as a strong support zone for buyers. ETH Is Outperforming Bitcoin In the past month, ETH has gained 62.2%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 15.9%. VirtualBacon also notes the ETH/BTC ratio has broken a 3-year downtrend, signaling that Ethereum may continue to lead the current rally. “As long as ETH/BTC stays above 0.022, Ethereum remains in control,” he says. Ethereum ETF Inflows Point to Institutional Demand Institutional interest is growing fast. Ethereum holdings by companies have jumped from $23 million to $6.6 billion in just three months. According to Coinglass, the Ethereum spot ETF market has seen consistent daily inflows since July 9, including a record $726.6 million on July 16 and $533.8 million just yesterday. While the BTC ETF market cap stands at $153.32 billion, ETH’s ETF market is growing fast at $18.40 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 10 Altcoins Will See 10x Surge Once Ethereum Breaks Its All-Time High , Ethereum Leads in Stablecoins and Tokenization Analyst also points to Ethereum’s leadership in real-world blockchain use cases: 54% of $247B stablecoins are issued on Ethereum 70% of RWA tokenization protocols run on Ethereum or its Layer 2s This includes leading platforms like MakerDAO and Centrifuge, giving Ethereum a clear edge in institutional adoption. Ethereum Price Prediction: Analyst’s Targets According to VirtualBacon: Base case: ETH reaches $6K–$7K by late 2025 Bull case: If BTC hits $200K and ETH outperforms, $16K is possible Long-term target: $10K by mid-2026 Ethereum’s recent rally is fueled by technical strength, ETF inflows, and real-world utility. If these trends hold, ETH could be headed for new all-time highs—and possibly a five-digit price point. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-23T10:45:23,"Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Unveiling a Crucial Local Bottom Signal","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Unveiling a Crucial Local Bottom Signal In the often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, market signals are highly sought after. Every dip, every surge, prompts a flurry of analysis as investors try to decipher the next move. Recently, a fascinating insight has emerged from CryptoQuant, suggesting that the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders might be providing a crucial clue about an impending local bottom for BTC. Could this be the signal many have been waiting for? Let’s dive deep into what this means for the market and your investment strategy. Understanding Bitcoin Short-Term Holders (STHs): Who Are They? Before we dissect the signal, it’s important to understand who we’re talking about. In the crypto space, investors are often categorized by how long they hold their assets: Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are individuals or entities who typically hold their Bitcoin for more than 155 days. They are often seen as conviction investors, less likely to be swayed by short-term price fluctuations. Their movements usually indicate broader market sentiment or macro trends. Short-Term Holders (STHs): Conversely, Bitcoin short-term holders are those who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. These investors are generally more reactive to immediate price movements. They might be traders looking for quick gains, or newer entrants to the market who are less experienced with volatility. Their buying and selling patterns can offer significant insights into immediate market sentiment and potential turning points. The behavior of STHs is particularly interesting because their decisions are often driven by profit-taking or fear of loss in the near term. When a significant portion of these holders starts moving their coins, it can indicate a shift in short-term market dynamics. The CryptoQuant Insight: What Does the Binance Inflow Ratio Tell Us? The recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha brought attention to a specific metric: the Binance inflow ratio of Bitcoin short-term holders . This metric measures the proportion of Bitcoin being deposited onto the Binance exchange by STHs relative to the total inflows. Here’s why this matters: Binance Inflow Ratio: This ratio tracks how much BTC is being sent to Binance, a major exchange, specifically from wallets identified as belonging to STHs. An increase in this ratio suggests that a higher percentage of incoming Bitcoin on Binance originates from these short-term investors. The 0.4 Threshold: Amr Taha highlighted that this ratio recently exceeded 0.4. Historically, this particular level has been associated with local bottoms for BTC. This means that in previous instances where STHs were depositing a significant amount of Bitcoin to Binance (above 40% of total inflows), the market often found a temporary floor shortly thereafter. Why Deposits? STHs typically deposit Bitcoin to exchanges for one primary reason: to sell. Whether they are taking profits after a price pump or cutting losses during a dip, the act of moving funds to an exchange usually precedes a transaction. The core idea here is that if a large number of Bitcoin short-term holders are sending their coins to exchanges, likely to realize profits, it indicates that a significant amount of supply is hitting the market. If the market can absorb this selling pressure without a drastic price collapse, it suggests underlying demand is strong enough to establish a bottom. Why Would STHs Taking Profits Signal a Local Bottom? This might seem counterintuitive at first glance. If people are selling, shouldn’t the price go down? While selling pressure naturally pushes prices lower, the context of STH profit-taking at a specific ratio offers a nuanced perspective: Supply Exhaustion: When a significant number of STHs decide to take profits, it can signal that the short-term profit potential has been largely realized by this group. Once these immediate sellers have exited, the selling pressure from this cohort might temporarily exhaust itself. Absorption by Strong Hands: If the market manages to hold its ground or even bounce after a wave of STH profit-taking, it implies that stronger hands (often long-term holders or new institutional capital) are stepping in to buy up the available supply. This absorption creates a demand floor. Psychological Reset: A period of STH profit-taking can act as a psychological reset for the market. It clears out some of the speculative froth and allows for a more stable base to form before the next upward movement. It’s like a cleansing event that removes weaker hands. Therefore, the increase in Binance inflows from Bitcoin short-term holders , particularly above the 0.4 threshold, isn’t just about selling; it’s about the market’s ability to absorb that selling and potentially turn it into a foundation for recovery. Historical Precedent: Have Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Predicted Bottoms Before? The power of this signal lies in its historical reliability. While no indicator is foolproof, past performance offers valuable context. According to Amr Taha’s analysis, the 0.4 Binance inflow ratio from STHs has consistently marked local bottoms. This suggests a recurring pattern in market behavior: Early 2023 Recovery: While specific data points are proprietary to CryptoQuant, market observers often point to periods following significant corrections where a flush-out of short-term speculative positions precedes a recovery. For instance, after the FTX collapse or during previous bear market troughs, a capitulation phase by short-term holders often paved the way for a rebound. Mid-Cycle Corrections: Even within a bull market, Bitcoin experiences corrections. These mid-cycle dips often see STHs taking profits or cutting losses, and if the market finds support after this, it can signal the end of that particular correction and the resumption of the broader trend. The consistent correlation between this metric and local bottoms lends credibility to the current signal. It implies that the current wave of profit-taking by Bitcoin short-term holders could indeed be setting the stage for a near-term price reversal. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what does this insight mean for you as an investor or trader? While no single indicator guarantees future price movements, this signal from Bitcoin short-term holders offers valuable guidance: Potential Entry Point: For those looking to accumulate BTC or open new long positions, a confirmed local bottom presents an opportune entry point. This signal suggests that the selling pressure from STHs might be nearing its end, potentially reducing downside risk in the immediate future. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you employ a DCA strategy, this could be a signal to consider increasing your regular purchases, as the market might be consolidating before an upward move. Risk Management is Key: Always remember that crypto markets are volatile. While the signal is promising, it’s crucial to manage your risk. Do not over-leverage or invest more than you can afford to lose. Combine with Other Indicators: This STH metric should not be your sole decision-making tool. Combine it with other technical analysis (e.g., RSI, MACD, support/resistance levels) and fundamental analysis (e.g., macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, network developments) for a more comprehensive view. Monitor Follow-Through: Observe if the market indeed bounces and sustains its upward momentum after this signal. A strong follow-through would further validate the local bottom. The insights derived from Bitcoin short-term holders are particularly useful for those with a shorter to medium-term investment horizon, looking to capitalize on market cycles. Challenges and Considerations: Is the Signal Always Accurate? While the CryptoQuant insight is compelling, it’s important to approach it with a balanced perspective. No market indicator is 100% accurate, and several factors can influence the outcome: Market Complexity: The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and unpredictable ‘black swan’ events. A signal based on STH behavior might be overridden by larger forces. Lagging vs. Leading Indicator: While the metric identifies a potential bottom, it often confirms a trend that is already in motion. It’s not a crystal ball for predicting the exact low point. Changing Market Dynamics: The crypto market evolves rapidly. What was historically reliable might become less so as market participants, technologies, and regulations change. Whale Activity: Large institutional or individual holders (whales) can move markets significantly, sometimes overriding the signals from smaller STHs. Therefore, while the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders offers a powerful lens into market sentiment, it should be used as part of a broader analytical framework rather than a standalone prophecy. Conclusion: A Promising Glimmer for Bitcoin’s Short-Term Future The analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha, highlighting the Binance inflow ratio from Bitcoin short-term holders exceeding 0.4, offers a promising glimmer of hope for a potential local bottom in BTC. Historically, this behavior has coincided with periods where the market found its footing after a dip, suggesting that the current wave of profit-taking by STHs might be clearing the path for a near-term recovery. While no indicator is foolproof, this insight provides a valuable perspective for investors navigating the volatile crypto landscape. By understanding the motivations and movements of Bitcoin short-term holders , you can gain a deeper appreciation for market dynamics and potentially make more informed decisions. Always remember to conduct your own research, consider multiple data points, and manage your risk effectively. The journey in crypto is always an adventure, and signals like these help illuminate the path forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “local bottom” in cryptocurrency? A local bottom refers to a temporary low point in an asset’s price within a larger trend. It’s not necessarily the absolute lowest price it will ever reach, but rather a point where selling pressure subsides, and the price finds short-term support before potentially resuming an upward or sideways trend. Q2: How are Bitcoin short-term holders (STHs) different from long-term holders (LTHs)? Bitcoin short-term holders are addresses that have held their BTC for less than 155 days, typically being more reactive to immediate price changes and seeking quick profits. Long-term holders (LTHs) have held their BTC for more than 155 days, often indicating stronger conviction and less susceptibility to short-term market fluctuations. Q3: What is the Binance inflow ratio for Bitcoin short-term holders? This metric measures the proportion of Bitcoin being deposited onto the Binance exchange specifically from wallets identified as belonging to short-term holders. A high ratio indicates that a significant amount of BTC entering Binance for potential sale is coming from these short-term investors. Q4: Why does STH profit-taking potentially signal a local bottom? When Bitcoin short-term holders take profits, it signifies a wave of selling pressure. If the market can absorb this supply without further significant price drops, it suggests that demand is strong enough to establish a price floor. This can indicate that the immediate selling pressure from this cohort is exhausted, paving the way for a potential rebound. Q5: Is this signal from Bitcoin short-term holders a guaranteed indicator? No, no single indicator in the crypto market is guaranteed. While the historical correlation of the 0.4 Binance inflow ratio from STHs with local bottoms is compelling, it should be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis. The market is complex and influenced by many unpredictable factors. Did you find this analysis helpful?

2025-07-23T10:44:44,"ARKB May Provide An Extra Layer Of Security With Bitcoin Cold Storage","Summary ARKB provides investors with full exposure to Bitcoin with the additional feature of Bitcoin cold storage. Bitcoin cold storage can provide an extra layer of security, keeping bitcoin holdings offline in a secured vault. Bitcoin may be supported by new legislation designed to support security and privacy for cryptocurrency. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) is a co-managed fund between Ark Investment Management and 21Shares, designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin. ARKB takes a differentiated approach to its investment strategy. Similar to the CoinShares Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ), ARKB purchases and stores bitcoin in cold storage through a trusted custodian, potentially offering greater protection when compared to traditional brokerage accounts. Bitcoin cold storage is essentially the act of keeping the bitcoin in an offline environment, reducing the risk of being the victim of hacking and theft. Despite the assets being held in an offline environment, ARKB trades in tandem with bitcoin, offering investors indirect exposure to a more secured bitcoin investment strategy. TradingView As of July 21, 2025, ARKB held 50,251 bitcoins valued at $5.9b. Corporate Reports This compares to the fund's assets under management of $5.94b, suggesting that shares may be trading at a slight premium to assets. Seeking Alpha Compared to peer bitcoin ETFs, ARKB has a relatively low management fee of 21 bps, slightly below WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ), Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ), and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), each charging 25bps. Compared to its closest peer, BRRR, ARKB provides substantially more liquidity with $5.94b in assets under management and an average of 2.5mm shares trading hands daily. IBIT exhibits the most volumes traded, with 47mm shares trading hands daily with $86b in assets under management. Despite the substantial trading depth, I do not believe these differences will impact overall liquidity or spreads. Given that the core differentiator between ARKB and peer bitcoin ETFs is that ARKB stores its bitcoin holdings offline, I believe this factor should be left to the investor in determining which bitcoin ETF suits them best. Performance across the bitcoin ETFs is relatively narrow, with a few basis point differences. Seeking Alpha Performance may remain strong for bitcoin given the strong capital inflows across bitcoin ETFs . According to Deutsche Bank, US-listed bitcoin ETFs have collectively gained $35b in inflows year-to-date. Despite the notion that bitcoin can offer investors an alternative investment strategy, bitcoin performance is relatively correlated to the broader market. I suspect that this phenomenon is the result of bitcoin ETFs being included in asset allocation in wealth management, making bitcoin a more commercially available asset that can be invested in, rebalanced, and sold for cash raises. Given these features, I do not believe bitcoin can provide investors with differentiated returns or act as a hedge against the US dollar or the broader market. TradingView On the regulatory front, the decentralized appeal of bitcoin may be shifting with the CLARITY Act , which will give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] a central role in regulating digital commodities and related intermediaries. The GENIUS Act , or Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, was passed and signed into law on July 18, 2025, establishing a framework to accelerate the development of stablecoins. This act could potentially support bitcoin through a less regulated market for stablecoins. Risks Related to ARKB Storing bitcoin in cold storage does come with certain risks. Because the assets are held offline, the assets will be held on a physical device such as a disconnected server or a number of other devices designed to store bitcoin. The bitcoin custodian for ARKB uses a multi-layer security protocol, meaning that the private keys, the cryptographic component that allows users to access bitcoin, are stored offline on hardware that has never been connected to the Internet in a cold storage vault. The only time the hardware will be taken out of the vault is to maintain the trading balance through Coinbase ( COIN ) or trading counterparty. Despite the secured protocol, there are a number of risks that may arise from maintaining a physical bitcoin wallet. Because these devices cannot be backed up, funds may not be recovered if the custodian were to lose access to the hardware wallet or if the wallet were to suffer physical damage or theft. This single point of failure can potentially increase the risk of holding bitcoin in cold storage, leading to a loss of assets in the event of theft or damage. Because hardware devices are disconnected from the Internet, regular updates to software may not be feasible, potentially adding certain risks to hardware failure or cybersecurity threats when connected to engage in transactions. Final Thoughts ARKB can provide investors with a differentiated approach to investing in bitcoin, with the cold storage component adding an extra layer of security or risk. Given that ARKB trades similarly to peer bitcoin ETFs, I do not believe ARKB will offer differentiated returns but rather an extra layer of security that may appeal to certain investors. Given the strong liquidity and general appeal for bitcoin, I am recommending ARKB with a BUY rating with a target allocation of 2-4%. If cold storage isn’t of interest, IBIT will make for an appealing alternative.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803359-arkb-may-provide-an-extra-layer-of-security-with-bitcoin-cold-storage?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|TOKEN SALE","BRRR|IBIT|ARKB",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T10:40:23,"Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Hilbert Group’s Strategic $15.8M Deal with LDA Capital","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Hilbert Group’s Strategic $15.8M Deal with LDA Capital In the dynamic world of digital assets, strategic moves by major players often signal broader market trends. Recently, the digital asset manager Hilbert Group made headlines with a significant financing agreement aimed at bolstering its Bitcoin holdings . This development isn’t just a win for Hilbert Group; it offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving landscape of institutional cryptocurrency adoption and treasury management. It underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset, attracting substantial investment from global financial powerhouses. What is Hilbert Group’s Strategic Move to Boost Bitcoin Holdings ? Digital asset manager Hilbert Group, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency space, has successfully inked a SEK 150 million (approximately $15.8 million) structured financing agreement with LDA Capital, a global investment firm. This isn’t just a simple loan; it’s a sophisticated, long-term partnership designed to give Hilbert Group the flexibility it needs to execute its ambitious Bitcoin holdings treasury strategy. The news, initially shared by @btcNLNico on X, quickly resonated across the crypto community, highlighting the increasing sophistication of capital allocation in the digital asset sector. The core of this agreement is a 36-month, ATM (At-the-Market)-style facility. This unique structure allows Hilbert Group to draw capital flexibly over time, rather than receiving a lump sum upfront. Why is this significant for their Bitcoin holdings ? It means they can strategically acquire more BTC based on market conditions, liquidity needs, and their long-term investment outlook, without the pressure of deploying a large amount of capital all at once. This adaptability is crucial in the often-volatile crypto market, enabling a more measured and potentially more profitable accumulation strategy. Why are Firms Like Hilbert Group Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings ? The decision by Hilbert Group to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings reflects a broader, accelerating trend among corporations and institutional investors. Bitcoin, once viewed with skepticism, is increasingly being recognized as a legitimate, valuable asset for corporate treasuries. But what’s driving this shift? Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is seen by many as a robust hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its capped supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, similar to digital gold. Store of Value: As a decentralized and censorship-resistant asset, Bitcoin offers a unique store of value proposition, independent of traditional financial systems and government policies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially enhancing overall portfolio returns and reducing correlation risk. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, many institutions believe in Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory, driven by increasing adoption, technological advancements, and its network effect. Signaling Confidence: Publicly increasing Bitcoin holdings can also signal a forward-thinking and innovative approach to investors, aligning with the growing digital economy. Companies like MicroStrategy have pioneered this strategy, accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin and demonstrating its viability as a primary treasury asset. Hilbert Group’s move reinforces this narrative, indicating that more firms are moving beyond mere speculation to integrate Bitcoin into their core financial strategies. The Mechanics of the ATM-Style Facility: How Does it Impact Bitcoin Holdings ? Understanding the ‘ATM-style facility’ is key to appreciating the sophistication of Hilbert Group’s financing deal. ‘ATM’ stands for ‘At-the-Market,’ and it’s a type of equity offering where a company can sell new shares of stock directly into the secondary market at prevailing market prices over a period of time. In this case, it’s adapted for financing a treasury strategy. Here’s how it typically works and why it’s beneficial for managing Bitcoin holdings : Flexible Capital Access: Instead of receiving a fixed amount of capital all at once, Hilbert Group can ‘draw down’ funds from LDA Capital as needed over the 36-month period. This means they only take capital when they have a clear use case or see opportune moments to purchase Bitcoin. Market Timing Advantages: This flexibility allows Hilbert Group to time its Bitcoin purchases more effectively. If the BTC price dips, they can draw capital to buy at a lower cost basis. If the price is high, they can pause, avoiding overpaying. This is crucial for optimizing their Bitcoin holdings . Reduced Market Impact: Unlike a large, single capital infusion that might require immediate, large-scale asset purchases (potentially moving the market), an ATM facility allows for gradual acquisitions, minimizing price impact and enabling more efficient execution. Lower Cost of Capital: By aligning capital deployment with market conditions, companies can potentially reduce their overall cost of acquiring assets and manage dilution more effectively if the financing involves equity-linked instruments. This method offers a significant advantage over traditional financing, particularly for assets as volatile as Bitcoin. It provides a strategic lever for accumulation, allowing Hilbert Group to build its Bitcoin holdings thoughtfully and incrementally. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Bitcoin Holdings Strategy While Hilbert Group’s strategic financing deal presents numerous opportunities, it also comes with inherent considerations, typical of any significant financial maneuver in the digital asset space. Key Benefits: Enhanced Capital Access: Provides a robust and flexible funding mechanism for a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy, ensuring capital availability when needed. Strategic Accumulation: The ATM-style facility enables Hilbert Group to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin, potentially reducing overall purchase costs and mitigating risk associated with market timing. Market Confidence: A significant deal with a reputable firm like LDA Capital can instill confidence in Hilbert Group’s financial stability and strategic vision, potentially attracting more investors. Future Growth Potential: Increased Bitcoin holdings position the firm to benefit significantly from Bitcoin’s potential long-term appreciation, strengthening its balance sheet. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile. While the ATM facility allows for flexible buying, significant price drops could still impact the value of their Bitcoin holdings . Execution Risk: Successfully executing an ATM facility requires careful market monitoring and strategic decision-making to optimize purchase timing and minimize costs. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Changes could impact the valuation or operational aspects of significant Bitcoin holdings . Dilution (if equity-linked): If the financing involves equity components, drawing down capital could lead to shareholder dilution, which needs to be managed carefully against the benefits of increased BTC exposure. Hilbert Group’s leadership will undoubtedly weigh these factors carefully, aiming to maximize the benefits while prudently managing the associated risks in their quest to grow their Bitcoin holdings . What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Bitcoin Holdings ? Hilbert Group’s strategic $15.8 million deal with LDA Capital is more than just a corporate financing arrangement; it’s a powerful indicator of the growing maturity and institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. This move signals several key trends for the future of institutional Bitcoin holdings : Increasing Sophistication: The use of an ATM-style facility demonstrates a move beyond simple spot purchases. Institutions are employing complex financial instruments to optimize their exposure to digital assets, reflecting a higher level of comfort and strategic planning. Mainstream Integration: When a global investment firm like LDA Capital, with a history of deploying over $12 billion across various sectors, engages in such a deal, it legitimizes Bitcoin as an investable asset class for a broader audience. It bridges traditional finance with the crypto world. Corporate Treasury Evolution: More companies are likely to follow suit, considering Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a viable component of their corporate treasury strategy, alongside cash and traditional investments. This could lead to a significant reallocation of capital. Demand for Infrastructure: As institutional demand for Bitcoin holdings grows, so too will the need for robust, secure, and compliant infrastructure for custody, trading, and risk management. This will drive innovation and investment in the crypto ecosystem. Market Stability: Increased institutional participation, particularly through long-term strategies like Hilbert Group’s, could contribute to greater market stability and reduced volatility for Bitcoin over time, as large holders tend to be less reactive to short-term price swings. This deal underscores that the institutional embrace of Bitcoin is not a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how corporations view and manage their assets in a rapidly digitizing global economy. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its potential to reshape financial strategies worldwide. In conclusion, Hilbert Group’s groundbreaking $15.8 million financing deal with LDA Capital to bolster its Bitcoin holdings marks a pivotal moment in the institutional adoption of digital assets. This strategic partnership, leveraging a flexible ATM-style facility, exemplifies a sophisticated approach to managing a corporate treasury in the digital age. It not only provides Hilbert Group with the agility to expand its BTC exposure strategically but also serves as a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s growing role as a recognized and sought-after asset class for long-term value creation. As more firms follow suit, this trend promises to further integrate digital assets into the global financial fabric, paving the way for a new era of corporate treasury management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of Hilbert Group’s deal with LDA Capital? The primary purpose of the deal is to fund Hilbert Group’s Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy, allowing the digital asset manager to flexibly draw capital over 36 months to increase its Bitcoin holdings . Q2: What is an ATM-style financing facility? An ATM (At-the-Market) style financing facility is a flexible arrangement that allows a company to draw capital incrementally over a period of time, rather than in a single lump sum. This enables them to time their asset purchases more effectively based on market conditions, which is particularly beneficial for volatile assets like Bitcoin. Q3: Why are more institutional firms looking to increase their Bitcoin holdings ? Institutional firms are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their portfolios for several reasons, including its potential as an inflation hedge, a decentralized store of value, a means of portfolio diversification, and its long-term growth potential in the digital economy. Q4: What are the potential risks for Hilbert Group with this strategy? Key risks include Bitcoin’s inherent market volatility, which could impact the value of their Bitcoin holdings , execution risks associated with timing purchases effectively, and potential regulatory uncertainties in the evolving digital asset landscape. Q5: How does this deal reflect on the broader crypto market? This deal signifies a growing maturity and institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. It suggests that more sophisticated financial instruments are being used for crypto exposure, potentially leading to increased market stability and further integration of digital assets into mainstream finance.

2025-07-23T10:36:58,"SEC Begins Review of SUI ETF Proposal, Analysts Predict Price Surge","The post SEC Begins Review of SUI ETF Proposal, Analysts Predict Price Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. SEC has officially kicked off its review of Canary Capital’s spot SUI ETF , marking a major development in the token’s journey toward broader market exposure. The application has now entered the “institution of proceedings” phase, which is a formal step that puts it on the regulator’s radar after months of delay. This move doesn’t mean approval is guaranteed, but it signals that the SEC is now taking the proposal seriously. And in crypto, timing is everything! ETF Interest Grows – 21Shares Joins the Game Canary isn’t the only one eyeing a SUI ETF. Asset manager 21Shares has also filed its own proposal, partnering directly with the Sui Network to expand institutional access. While both applications are still under review, the back-to-back filings suggest growing confidence around SUI’s potential to enter the ETF space, something few altcoins have managed to do so far. Already in the Big League: Bitwise Adds SUI SUI has also made it into the Bitwise Crypto Index ETF , which is a fund that includes top tokens like Bitcoin , Ethereum, and XRP. Though that ETF hasn’t launched yet, SUI’s inclusion is a strong signal that institutional interest is building fast. Futures Data Points to Bullish Momentum The numbers back it up. According to Glassnode, SUI’s open interest in the futures market has climbed to a record $1.2 billion – making it the sixth-largest crypto by futures OI, just behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and DOGE . Price Levels to Watch: $4.00 Is Key SUI is currently trading near $3.95, holding above its 200-day moving average of $2.73. Its RSI is sitting around 66, a level that suggests strength but still leaves room to climb. Crypto analyst Scient believes SUI is “forming a new base” and could see a fresh move in August. If it clears the $4.00 resistance zone, targets between $4.20 and $5.00 are in play. And if the ETF gains approval, a run toward $5.5 to $6.00 wouldn’t be out of the question. $SUI , I think we are building a base here for the next leg. • 1D trend broken, and we are attempting a flip here above a key Supply/Demand zone. We can go a bit higher from here, but I feel we range for here for the next week or so before making a push toward ATHs in August.… pic.twitter.com/znNB2GTt5i — Scient (@Crypto_Scient) July 22, 2025 What’s Next for SUI? This is a key moment for the Sui ecosystem. With not one but two ETF filings in motion, strong technicals, and rising futures activity, SUI is drawing real attention from both institutions and retail traders. The SEC’s next steps could set the tone for what comes next.

2025-07-23T10:20:05,"Binance BTC Reserves Drop as Unrealized Gains Reach All-Time High","Binance’s unrealized profit on its Bitcoin reserves has reached an all-time high of around 60,000 BTC. The latest data revealed that Binance’s BTC reserves have been on a steady decline since September 2024, from approximately 631,000 BTC to 574,000 BTC, even as the crypto exchange’s unrealized gains on these holdings continue to climb. Bitcoin Reserves Down, Profits Up The reserves, which are primarily used to support Binance’s operational liquidity and BNB Chain operations, have benefited from Bitcoin’s latest price rally. It has pushed up the value of its remaining holdings despite the overall decline in reserve volume. Binance also holds about 16,000 BTC in custodial wallets to back its BTCB token, which ensures sufficient liquidity for tokenized Bitcoin on the BNB Chain. Tracking Binance’s BTC reserves provides insight into long-term market sentiment, as declining reserves often indicate that investors are withdrawing Bitcoin from exchanges. CryptoQuant explained that this suggests stronger conviction among holders. The simultaneous decrease in reserves and increase in unrealized profits highlights the impact of Bitcoin’s price appreciation on Binance’s balance sheet. Crypto Exchanges See Volume Spike Exchange activity across the market accelerated sharply as BTC surged to a new all-time high last week. CryptoQuant noted that the spot trading volumes on centralized platforms rebounded, while futures turnover and aggregate open interest climbed. This was indicative of an influx of fresh capital into derivatives markets amid the rally. Binance, for one, recorded the largest single-day increase in spot trading volume both on the day before and the day after Bitcoin hit its new high. The exchange captured a 52% market share on July 18. Other platforms, including Crypto.com, Coinbase, Bybit, and OKX, also registered high spot trading activity during the period. At the same time, Binance saw the highest growth in futures open interest as traders and investors opened long positions anticipating further gains. Bybit and Gate.io similarly recorded significant increases in their open interest. Going forward, experts believe that Bitcoin is entering a delicate phase as long-term holders begin selling for the first time since early 2024. This profit-taking increases the likelihood of near-term volatility. ETFs and institutional buyers are absorbing the distributed supply, but the sustainability of this demand will determine Bitcoin’s next move. If buyer momentum fades, sharp price drops could trigger broader declines, which could make the market structure vulnerable despite the ongoing bull cycle.

2025-07-23T10:20:00,"To Bitcoin Or Not To Bitcoin? A Corporate Cash Question!","Summary In this post, I will bring together two disparate and very different topics that I have written about in the past. The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business, an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. The second is bitcoin, which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In this post, I will bring together two disparate and very different topics that I have written about in the past. The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business , an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. In my classes and writing on corporate finance, I look at the motives for businesses retaining cash, as well as how much cash is too much cash. The second is bitcoin , which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In fact, I have steered away from saying much about bitcoin in recent years, though I did mention it in my post on alternative investments as a collectible (like gold) that can be added to the choice mix. While there may be little that seemingly connects the two topics (cash and bitcoin), I was drawn to write this post because of a debate that seems to be heating up on whether companies should put some or a large portion of their cash balances into bitcoin, with the success of MicroStrategy, a high-profile beneficiary of this action, driving some of this push. I believe that it is a terrible idea for most companies, and before Bitcoin believers get riled up, my reasoning has absolutely nothing to do with what I think of bitcoin as an investment and more to do with how little I trust corporate managers to time trades right. That said, I do see a small subset of companies, where the holding bitcoin strategy makes sense, as long as there are guardrails on disclosure and governance. Cash in a Going Concern In a world where businesses can raise capital (equity or debt) at fair prices and in a timely manner, there is little need to hold cash, but that is not the world we live in. For a variety of reasons, some internal and some external, companies are often unable or unwilling to raise capital from markets, and with that constraint in place, it is logical to hold cash to meet unforeseen needs. In this section, I will start by laying out the role that cash holdings play in any business, and examine how much cash is held by companies, broken down by groupings (regional, size, industry). A Financial Balance Sheet To understand the place of cash in a business, I will start with a financial balance sheet, a structure for breaking down a business, public or private: On the asset side of the balance sheet, you start with the operating business or businesses that a company is in, with a bifurcation of value into value from investments already made (assets-in-place) and value from investments that the company expects to make in the future (growth assets). The second asset grouping, non-operating assets, includes a range of investments that a company may make, sometimes to augment its core businesses (strategic investments), and sometimes as side investments, and thus include minority holdings in other companies (cross holdings) and even investments in financial assets. Sometimes, as is the case with family group companies, these cross holdings may be a reflection of the company's history as part of the group, with investments in other group companies for either capital or corporate control reasons. The third grouping is for cash and marketable securities, and this is meant specifically for investments that share two common characteristics - they are riskless or close to riskless insofar as holding their value over time and they are liquid in the sense that they can be converted to cash quickly and with no penalty. For most companies, this has meant investing cash in short-term bonds or bills, issued by either governments (assuming that they have little default risk) or by large, safe companies (in the form of commercial paper issued by highly rated firms). Note that there are two sources of capital for any business, debt or equity, and in assessing how levered a firm is, investors look at the proportion of the capital that comes from each: Debt to Equity = Debt/ Equity Debt to Capital = Debt/ (Debt + Equity) In fact, there are many analysts and investors who estimate these debt ratios, using net debt, where they net the cash holdings of a company against the debt, with the rationale, merited or not, that cash can be used to pay down debt. Net Debt to Equity = (Debt-Cash)/ Equity Debt to Capital = (Debt-Cash)/ (Debt + Equity) All of these ratios can be computed using accounting book value numbers for debt and equity or with market value numbers for both. The Motives for holding Cash In my introductory finance classes, there was little discussion of cash holdings in companies, outside of the sessions on working capital. In those sessions, cash was introduced as a lubricant for businesses , necessary for day-to-day operations. Thus, a retail store that had scores of cash customers, it was argued, needed to hold more cash, often in the form of currency, to meet its transactional needs, than a company with corporate suppliers and business customers, with predictable patterns in operations. In fact, there were rules of thumb that were developed on how much cash a company needed to have for its operations. As the world shifts away from cash to digital and online payments, this need for cash has decreased, but clearly not disappeared. The one carve out is the financial services sector, where the nature of the business (banking, trading, brokerage) requires companies in the sector to hold cash and marketable securities as part of their operating businesses. If the only reason for holding cash was to cover operating needs, there would be no way to justify the tens of billions of dollars that many companies hold; Apple alone has often had cash balances that exceeded $200 billion, and the other tech giants are not far behind. For some companies, at least, the rationale for holding far more cash than justified by their operating needs is that it can operate as a shock absorber , something that they can fall back on during periods of crisis or to cover unexpected expenses. That is the reason that cyclical and commodity firms have often offered for holding large cash balances (as a percent of their overall firm value), since a recession or a commodity price downturn can quickly turn profits to losses. Using the corporate life cycle structure can also provide insight into how the motives for holding cash can change as a company ages. For start-ups, that are either pre-revenue or have very low revenues, cash is needed to keep the business operating , since employees have to be paid and expenses covered. Young firms that are money-losing and with large negative cash flows, hold cash to cover future cash flow needs and to fend off the risk of failure. In effect, these firms are using cash as life preservers , where they can make it through periods where external capital (venture capital, in particular) dries up, without having to sell their growth potential at bargain basement prices. As firms start to make money and enter high growth, cash has use as a business scalar , for firms that want to scale up quickly. In mature growth, cash acquires optionality , useful in allowing the business to find new markets for its products or product extensions. Mature firms sometimes hold cash as youth serum , hoping that it can be used to make once-in-a-lifetime investments that may take them back to their growth days, and for declining firms, cash becomes a liquidation manager , allowing for the orderly repayment of debt and sale of assets. There is a final rationale for holding cash that is rooted in corporate governance and the control and power that comes from holding cash. I have long argued that absent pressure from shareholders, managers at most publicly traded firms would choose to return very little of the cash that they generate, since that cash balance not only makes them more sought after (by bankers and consultants who are endlessly inventive about uses that the cash can be put to) but also gives them the power to build corporate empires and create personal legacies. Corporate Cash Holdings Given the multitude of reasons for holding cash, it should come as no surprise that publicly traded companies around the world have significant cash balances. Leading into July 2025, for instance, global non-financial-service firms held almost $11.4 trillion in cash and marketable securities; financial service firms held even more in cash and marketable securities, but those holdings, as we noted earlier, can represent their business needs. Using our earlier breakdown of the asset side of the balance sheet into cash, non-operating and operating assets, this is what non-financial service firms in the aggregate looked like in book value terms (global and just US firms): Note that cash is about 11% of the book value of total assets, in the aggregate, for global firms, and about 9% of the book value of total assets for US firms. Global firms do hold a higher percentage of their value in non-operating assets, but US firms are more active on the acquisition front, explaining why goodwill (which is triggered almost entirely by acquisitions) is greater at US firms. The typical publicly traded firm holds a large cash balance, but there are significant differences in cash holdings, by sector. In the table below, I look at cash as a percent of total assets, a book value measure, as well as cash as a percent of firm value, computed by aggregating market values: As you can see, technology firms, which presumably face more uncertainty about their future, hold far more cash as a percent of book value, but the value that the market attaches to their growth brings down cash as a percent of firm value. Utilities, regulated and often stable businesses, tend to hold the least cash, both in book and market terms. Breaking down the sample by region, I look at cash holdings as a percent of total assets and firms across the globe: The differences across the globe can be explained by a mix of market access , with countries in parts of the world where it can be difficult to access capital (Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa) holding more cash. In addition, and corporate governance , with cash holdings being greater in parts of the world (China, Russia) where shareholders have less power over managers. Given the earlier discussion of how the motives for holding cash can vary across the life cycle, I broke the sample down by age decile, with age measured from the year of founding, and looked at cash holdings, by decile: The results are mixed, with cash holdings as a percent of total assets being higher for the younger half of the sample (the top five deciles) than for the older half, but there is no discernible pattern, when cash is measured as a percent of firm value (market). Put simply, companies across the life cycle hold cash, though with different motives, with the youngest firms holding on to cash as lifesavers (and for survival) and the older firms keeping cash in the hopes that they can use it to rediscover their youth. The Magic of Bitcoin I have been teaching and working with investments now for four decades, and there has been no investment that has received as much attention from both investors and the financial press, relative to its actual value, as has bitcoin. Some of the draw has come from its connections to the digital age, but much of it has come from its rapid rise in price that has made many rich, with intermittent collapses that have made just as many poor. I am a novice when it comes to crypto, and while I have been open about the fact that it is not my investment preference, I understand its draw, especially for younger investors. The Short, Eventful History of Bitcoin The origin story for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) matters since it helps us understand both its appeal and its structure. It was born in November 2008, two months into one of the worst financial crises of the last century, with banks and governments viewed as largely responsible for the mess. Not surprisingly, Bitcoin was built on the presumption that you cannot trust these institutions, and its biggest innovation was the blockchain , designed as a way of crowd-checking transactions and preserving transaction integrity. I have long described Bitcoin as a currency designed by the paranoid for the paranoid, and I have never meant that as a critique, since in the untrustworthy world that we live in, paranoia is a justifiable posture. From its humble beginnings, where only a few (mostly tech geeks) were aware of its existence, Bitcoin has accumulated evangelists, who argue that it is the currency of the future, and speculators who have used its wild price swings to make and lose tens of millions of dollars. In the chart below, I look at the price of bitcoin over the last decade, as its price has increased from less than $400 in September 2014 to more than $110,000 in June 2025: Along the way, Bitcoin has also found some acceptance as a currency, first for illegal activities (drugs on the Silk Road) and then as the currency for countries with failed fiat currencies (like El Salvador), but even Bitcoin advocates will agree that its use in transactions (as the medium of exchange) has not kept pace with its growth as a speculative trade. Pricing Bitcoin In a post in 2017, I divided investments into four groups - assets that generate cash flows (stocks, bonds, private businesses), commoditie s that can be used to produce other goods (oil, iron ore. etc), currencies that act as mediums of exchange and stores of value and collectibles that are priced based on demand and supply: You may disagree with my categorization, and there are shades of gray where an investment can be in more than one grouping. Gold, for instance, is both a collectible of long standing and a commodity that has specific uses, but the former dominates the latter, when it comes to pricing. In the same vein, crypto has a diverse array of players, with a few meeting the asset test and some (like ethereum) having commodity features. The contrast between the different investment classes also allows for a contrast between investing, where you buy (sell) an investment if it is under- (over) valued, and trading, where you buy (sell) an investment if you expect its price to go up (down). The former is a choice, though not a requirement, with an asset (stocks, bonds or private businesses), though there may be others who still trade that asset. With currencies and collectibles, you can only trade, making judgments on price direction, which, in turn, requires assessments of mood and momentum, rather than fundamentals. With bitcoin, this classification allows us to cut through the many distractions that pop up during discussions of its pricing level, since it can be framed either as a currency or a collectible and thus only priced, not valued. Seventeen years into its existence, Bitcoin has struggled on the currency front, and while there are pockets where it has gained acceptance, its design makes it inefficient, and its volatility has impeded its adoption as a medium of exchange. As a collectible, Bitcoin starts with the advantage of scarcity, restricted as it is to 21 million units, but it has not quite measured up, at least so far, when it comes to holding its value (or increasing it) when financial assets are in meltdown mode. In every crisis since 2008, Bitcoin has behaved more like risky stock, falling far more than the average stock, when stocks are down, and rising more, when they recover. I noted this in my posts looking at the performance of investments in both the first quarter of 2020, when COVID laid waste to markets, and in 2022, when inflation ravaged stock and bond markets. That said, it is still early in its life, and it is entirely possible that it may change its behavior as it matures and draws in a wider investor base. The bottom line is that discussions of whether Bitcoin is cheap or expensive are often pointless and sometimes frustrating, since it depends almost entirely on your perspective on how the demand for Bitcoin will shift over time. If you believe that its appeal will fade, and that it will be displaced by other collectibles, perhaps even in the crypto space, you will be in the short-selling camp. If you are convinced that its appeal will not just endure but also reach fresh segments of the market, you are on solid ground in assuming that its price will continue to rise. It behooves both groups to admit that neither has a monopoly on the truth, and this is a disagreement about trading and not an argument about fundamentals. The MicroStrategy Story It is undeniable that one company, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), has done more to advance the corporate holding of Bitcoin than any other, and that has come from four factors: A stock market winner : The company's stock price has surged over the last decade, making it one of the best performing stocks on the US exchanges: It is worth noting that almost all of the outperformance has occurred in this decade, with the winnings concentrated into the last two years. With the rise (increasingly) tied to Bitcoin : Almost all of MicroStrategy’s outperformance has come from its holdings of bitcoin and not from improvements in business operations. That comes through in the graph below, where I look at the prices of MicroStrategy and Bitcoin since 2014: Note that MicroStrategy’s stock price has gone from being slightly negatively correlated with Bitcoin’s price between 2014-2018 to tracking Bitcoin in more recent years. And disconnected from operations : In 2014, MicroStrategy was viewed and priced as a software/services tech company, albeit a small one with promise. In the last decade, its operating numbers have stagnated, with both revenues and gross profits declining, but during the same period, its enterprise value has soared from $1 billion in 2014 to more than $100 billion in July 2025: It is clear now that anyone investing in MicroStrategy at its current market cap (>$100 billion) is making a bitcoin play. With a high-profile ""bitcoin evangelist"" as CEO : MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal and highly visible promoter of bitcoin, and has converted many of his shareholders into fellow-evangelists and convinced at least some of them that he is prescient in detecting price movements. In recent years, he has been public in his plans to issue increasing amounts of stock and using the proceeds to buy more bitcoin. In sum, MicroStrategy is now less a software company and more a Bitcoin SPAC or closed-end fund, where investors are trusting Saylor to make the right trading judgments on when to buy (and sell) bitcoin and hoping to benefit from the profits. The “Put your cash in bitcoin” movement For investors in other publicly traded companies that have struggled delivering value in their operating businesses, MicroStrategy’s success with its bitcoin holdings seems to indicate a lost opportunity, and one that can be remedied by jumping on the bandwagon now. In recent months, even high profile companies, like Microsoft, have seen shareholder proposals pushing them to abandon their conventional practice of holding cash in liquid and close-to-riskless investments and buying Bitcoin instead. Microsoft’s shareholders soundly rejected the proposal, and I will start by arguing that they were right, and that for most companies, investing cash in bitcoin does not make sense, but in the second part, I will carve out the exceptions to this rule. The General Principle: No to Bitcoin As a general rule, I think it is not only a bad idea for most companies to invest their cash in bitcoin, but I would go further and also argue that they should be banned from doing so. Let me hasten to add that I would make this assertion even if I was bullish on Bitcoin, and my argument would apply just as strongly to companies considering moving their cash into gold, Picassos or sports franchises, for five reasons: Bitcoin does not meet the cash motives : Earlier in this post, I noted the reasons why a company holds cash, and, in particular, as a shock absorber, steadying a firm through bad times. Replacing low-volatility cash with high-volatility bitcoin would undercut this objective, analogous to replacing your shock absorbers with pogo sticks. In fact, given the history of moving with stock prices, the value of bitcoin on a company's balance sheet will dip at exactly the times where you would need it most for stability. The argument that bitcoin would have made a lot higher returns for companies than holding cash is a non-starter, since companies should hold cash for safety. Bitcoin can step on your operating business narrative : I have long argued that successful businesses are built around narratives that incorporate their competitive advantages. When companies that are in good businesses put their cash in bitcoin, they risk muddying the waters on two fronts. First, it creates confusion about why a company with a solid business narrative from which it can derive value would seek to make money on a side game. Second, the ebbs and flows of bitcoin can affect financial statements, making it more difficult to connect operating results to story lines. Managers as traders? When companies are given the license to move their cash into bitcoin or other non-operating investments, you are trusting managers to get the timing right, in terms of when to buy and sell these investments. That trust is misplaced, since top managers (CEOs and CFOs) are for the most part terrible traders, often buying at the market highs and selling at lows. Leave it to shareholders : Even if you are unconvinced by the first three reasons, and you are a bitcoin advocate or enthusiast, you will be better served pushing companies that you are a shareholder in, to return their cash to you, to invest in bitcoin, gold or any other investment at your chosen time. Put simply, if you believe that Bitcoin is the place to put your money, why would you trust corporate managers to do it for you? License for abuse : I am a skeptic when it comes to corporate governance, believing that managerial interests are often at odds with what's good for shareholders. Giving managers the permission to trade crypto tokens, bitcoin or other collectibles can open the door for self-dealing and worse. While I am a fan of letting shareholders determine the limits on what managers can or cannot do, I believe that the SEC (and other stock market regulators around the world) may need to become more explicit in their rules on what companies can (and cannot) do with cash. The Carveouts I do believe that there are cases when you, as a shareholder, may be at peace with the company not only investing cash in bitcoin, but doing so actively and aggressively. Here are four of my carveouts to the general rule on bitcoin: The Bitcoin Savant: In my earlier description of MicroStrategy, I argued that shareholders in MicroStrategy have not only gained immensely from its bitcoin holdings, but also trust Michael Saylor to trade bitcoin for them. In short, the perception, rightly or wrongly, is that Saylor is a bitcoin savant, understanding the mood and momentum swings better than the rest of us. Generalizing, if a company has a leader (usually a CEO or CFO) who is viewed as someone who is good at gauging bitcoin price direction, it is possible that shareholders in the company may be willing to grant him or her the license to trade bitcoin on their behalf. This is, of course, not unique to bitcoin, and you can argue that investors in Berkshire Hathaway have paid a premium for its stock, and allowed it leeway to hold and deploy immense amounts of cash because they trusted Warren Buffett to make the right investment judgments. The Bitcoin Business : For some companies, holding bitcoin may be part and parcel of their business operations, less a substitute for cash and more akin to inventory. PayPal and Coinbase , both of which hold large amounts of bitcoin, would fall into this carveout, since both companies have business that requires that holding. The Bitcoin Escape Artist : As some of you may be aware, I noted that Mercado Libre , a Latin American online retail firm, is on my buy list, and it is a company with a fairly substantial bitcoin holding. While part of that holding may relate to the operating needs of their fintech business, it is worth noting that Mercado Libre is an Argentine company, and the Argentine peso has been a perilous currency to hold on to, making bitcoin a viable option for cash holdings. Generalizing, companies in countries with failed currencies may conclude that holding their cash in bitcoin is less risky than holding it in the fiat currencies of the locations they operate in. The Bitcoin Meme : There is a final grouping of companies that I would put in the meme stock category, with AMC ( AMC ) and GameStop ( GME ) heading that list. These companies have operating business models that have broken down or have declining value, but they have become, by design or through accident, trading plays, where the price bears no resemblance to operating fundamentals and is instead driven by mood and momentum. If that is the case, it may make sense for these companies to throw in the towel on operating businesses entirely and instead make themselves even more into trading vehicles by moving into bitcoin, with the increased volatility adding to their ""meme"" allure. Even with these exceptions, though, I think that you need guardrails before signing off on opening the door to letting companies hold bitcoin. Shareholder buy-in : If you are a publicly traded company considering investing some or much of the company's cash in bitcoin, it behooves you to get shareholder approval for that move, since it is shareholder cash that is being deployed. Transparency about Bitcoin transactions/holdings : Once a company invests in bitcoin, it is imperative that there be full and clear disclosure not only on those holdings but also on trading (buying and selling) that occurs. After all, if it is a company's claim that it can time its bitcoin trades better than the average investor, it should reveal the prices at which it bought and sold its bitcoin. Clear mark-to-market rules : If a company invests its cash in bitcoin, I will assume that the value of that bitcoin will be volatile, and accounting rules have to clearly specify how that bitcoin gets marked to market, and where the profits and losses from that marking to market will show up in the financial statements. As bitcoin prices rise to all-time highs, there is the danger that regulators and rule-writers will be lax in their rule-writing, opening the door to corporate scandals in the future. Cui Bono? Bitcoin advocates have been aggressively pushing both institutional investors and companies to include Bitcoin in their investment choices, and it is true that, at least first sight, they will benefit from that inclusion. Expanding the demand for bitcoin, an investment with a fixed supply, will drive the price upwards, and existing bitcoin holders will benefit. In fact, much of the rise of bitcoin since the Trump election in November 2024 can be attributed to the perception that this administration will ease the way for companies and investors to join in the crypto bonanza. For bitcoin holders, increasing institutional and corporate buy-in to bitcoin may seem like an unmixed blessing, but there will be costs that, in the long run, may lead at least some of them to regret this push: Different investor base : Drawing in institutional investors and companies into the bitcoin market will not only change its characteristics, but put traders who may know how to play the market now at a disadvantage, as it shifts dynamics. Here today, gone tomorrow? Bitcoin may be in vogue now, but what will the consequences be if it halves in price over the next six months? Institutions and companies are notoriously ”sheeplike” in their behavior, and what is in vogue today may be abandoned tomorrow. If you believe that bitcoin is volatile now, adding these investors to the mix will put that volatility on steroids. Change asset characteristics : Every investment class that has been securitized and brought into institutional investing has started behaving like a financial asset, moving more with stocks and bonds than it has historically. This happened with real estate in the 1980s and 1990s, with mortgage backed securities and other tradable versions of real estate, making it far more correlated with stock and bonds, and less of a stand-alone asset. If the end game for bitcoin is to make it millennial gold, an alternative or worthy add-on to financial assets, the better course would be to steer away from establishment buy-in and build it up with an alternative investor base, driven by different forces and motives than stock and bond markets.

2025-07-23T10:18:46,"DeepSeek Says Altseason Is Here – These 3 Presales Could Be First to Run","Bitcoin is back on corporate balance sheets. Altcoins are waking up. And DeepSeek’s sentiment models hint at a bullish undercurrent building fast. Trump Media’s $2B Bitcoin bet and Strategy’s latest 6,220 $BTC haul ($739M) are pumping fresh momentum into the market, just as ETF flows and rising altcoin treasuries start pulling dominance away from Bitcoin. DeepSeek’s AI signals, and the on-chain behavior backing them, suggest that early-stage buyers are circling high-upside plays again. With rotation into $ETH, $SOL, and top presale projects gaining steam, this month could set the tone for Q3. Saylor, Trump, and the Altcoin Rotation There’s real capital backing the bullish shift. Strategy’s latest 6,220 $BTC buy puts its total stack at 607,770 $BTC (bigger than most S&P 500 treasuries), now worth over $71 billion. That’s nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s entire supply held by one publicly traded company. What began as a bold treasury experiment now mirrors traditional cash management – except the asset is Bitcoin. Enter Trump Media with a surprise $2 billion $BTC purchase, part of a broader crypto treasury strategy that includes ETF ambitions and an upcoming utility token. Together, these moves mark a narrative pivot: Bitcoin isn’t just a hedge, it’s becoming a reserve asset for politically and financially aligned institutions. DeepSeek’s latest sentiment sweep confirms the shift. Its AI model flagged early signs of altseason, noting $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP as breakout leaders. $BTC dominance is slipping, ETH/BTC is climbing , and Ethereum treasuries are emerging as the next institutional playbook – just like $BTC was in 2020. The Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap recently flipped above 50 for the first time since December. If $BTC consolidates and dominance continues to bleed, alts and low-caps could rip. When rotation hits, the best crypto presales gain a lot of attention. Here are three ones you’ll want on your radar this month: 1. Best Wallet ($BEST) – The Wallet Token Set to Dominate Web3 With over $14.1M already raised, $BEST is quickly becoming the go-to presale for anyone looking to front-run the next wave of retail onboarding. Best Wallet positions itself as the “MetaMask killer”, and it’s not just talk. The app integrates presale discovery, staking, and iGaming rewards into a sleek interface secured by Fireblocks’ battle-tested MPC technology . Holding the $BEST token unlocks reduced gas fees, early access to new projects, and boosted APYs – currently offering 96% staking rewards. As ETH flows toward Layer-2s and the best altcoins gain steam, Best Wallet could become the default gateway for exploring that ecosystem safely. Its Upcoming Tokens feature already lets users access curated presales directly from the wallet, eliminating scam links and fake sites. At $0.025375, the token still sits in a sweet spot for early entry, especially if presales keep outperforming the majors this cycle. Check out our Best Wallet Token price prediction. 2. Snorter Bot ($SNORT) – Meme Utility Built for Telegram Traders If you’re active in meme coin circles, you already know Telegram bots are the new trading frontier. Snorter Bot ($SNORT) taps straight into that momentum, delivering a lightning-fast, meme-branded trading suite that runs natively inside Telegram. With $1.99 million raised so far, $SNORT gives holders access to advanced tools like instant launch sniping, copy trading, and MEV protection – all executed through simple chat commands. No browser. No extensions. Just fast, secure trades from your favorite degen group chat. It supports Solana at launch, with Ethereum and BNB Chain rolling out next. That multi-chain roadmap gives Snorter the reach it needs to scale alongside the best meme coins meta, and it’s already doing it with real utility. The token is priced at $0.0991, and staking rewards hit 179%. That’s big, but it makes sense: you’re not just buying into a meme; you’re getting a premium trading stack that actually works. Learn how to buy Snorter in our step-by-step guide. 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – The AI Protocol With Real Infrastructure While most “AI coins” are just chatbots with logos, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) actually builds the plumbing. It’s already raised $21.8 million+, and the current bonus round gives latecomers one more shot at its presale price of $0.007125. At its core is a fully functional AI Virtual Machine and a novel Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism – where nodes get rewarded for running real AI workloads like model training and inference. That means the network doesn’t just secure itself, it gets smarter as it grows. The protocol also includes a Meme Launchpad, giving it speculative legs, but the tech is what sets it apart. Governance is on-chain, utility is already live, and developers are actively building around its infrastructure.It’s a legit infrastructure play in a sector that’s mostly vaporware. And in this market, that alone makes it stand out. Early-Stage Hype Meets Real-World Momentum From DeepSeek’s altseason signals to billion-dollar Bitcoin buys by Strategy and Trump Media, the macro setup is clear: smart money is moving, and early-stage tokens are heating up fast. Whether it’s AI infrastructure, mobile-crypto wallet s, or Telegram-native trading bots, the presales above blend real utility with viral upside. And that’s exactly the combo that tends to run first when the market turns risk-on. Still, it’s crypto. Timing is tricky. Narratives flip fast. Presales can deliver massive returns, but they also come with real risk. Make sure you’re not just chasing green candles. Always do your own research (DYOR). Crypto markets are volatile and speculative. Never invest more than you’re willing to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-outlook-deepseek-best-presales/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T10:15:56,"Pi Network Price Prediction, If Bitcoin Price Hits $200k","The post Pi Network Price Prediction, If Bitcoin Price Hits $200k appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Bitcoin teases new all-time highs north of $120,000 and a bullish $200,000 target enters mainstream discussion, altcoins face fresh scrutiny. Can young coins like Pi Network’s PI coin ride Bitcoin’s momentum? Or will their destiny hinge on internal developments and network milestones? Let me start with an overview of the current stats. With the global crypto market capitalization hovering at ~$3.93 trillion, and trading volumes nearing $193.74 billion despite a 10.95% decline, sentiment remains elevated. The Fear & Greed Index currently reads 70, indicating investor greed. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index has risen to 56 out of 100, suggesting growing enthusiasm for non-Bitcoin assets. Where Does Pi Stand Today? Pi Coin is currently trading at $0.4631 after a daily decline of 4.69%, despite a 3.98% gain over the past week. Its market capitalization stands at $3.57 billion, while trading volume has dipped sharply to $118.49 million, down 37.73% over the past 24 hours. Over the last month, Pi has retreated by 9.18%, underlining that despite favorable macro conditions, Pi’s price movement may remain restrained without a clear fundamental catalyst from within the project itself. What Does BTC’s MVRV Ratio Have to Say? Bitcoin’s 365-day MVRV ratio currently stands at 23.4%. Historically, a ratio above 50% has often signaled overbought conditions, where investors tend to take profits. The current level, being in the moderate zone, suggests that Bitcoin still has room to climb and is not yet in euphoric territory. This offers a supportive backdrop for the thesis of BTC potentially targeting the $200,000 mark before the end of the cycle, particularly if macro tailwinds and institutional inflows persist. What About Pi Network’s On-Chain Health? For Pi, the most important metric to watch is the unlocked supply ratio. Out of ~7.4 billion tokens migrated to the mainnet, about 2.2 billion Pi are currently unlocked. This means that nearly 30% of the migrated supply is already liquid and subject to market forces. As more users complete KYC and unlock their holdings, and as Pi potentially lists on centralized exchanges, both upside potential and downside volatility could increase significantly. Bitcoin’s Surge: A Rising Tide for Altcoins? Historically, altcoins have benefited from Bitcoin bull runs, particularly when market sentiment becomes excessively optimistic and capital begins to rotate. The current Altcoin Season Index of 56 points to a rising interest in alternative assets. However, Pi Coin’s correlation to BTC remains conditional. Unlike most exchange-traded altcoins, Pi’s price trajectory will hinge more heavily on the success of its open mainnet launch, token unlock schedules. And especially listings on major exchanges. Without these developments, even a Bitcoin surge to $200K might result in only modest Pi price movement. Scenario Pi Coin Price Impact Main Catalysts BTC Rallies Only Modest uplift Market sentiment, liquidity rotation Pi Mainnet/Listing Strong rally possible Exchange access, higher volumes Both Happen Potential >$2.00 surge Mass adoption, full utility unlocked FAQs If Bitcoin hits $200,000, will Pi Coin automatically rally? No, not necessary, as Pi coin’s price gains depend more on mainnet upgrades and major exchange listings than just Bitcoin’s rally. What is the Pi coin price today? The price of 1 Pi at the time of press is $0.4631, with an intraday change of -4.69%. Are we in an ‘altcoin season’ now, and does it favor Pi? The Altcoin Season Index at 56/100 suggests growing altcoin momentum—providing tailwinds, but Pi’s upside is project-dependent.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/pi-network-price-prediction-if-bitcoin-price-hits-200k/,"TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

A similar move happened with Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund. The U.S. SEC has been prioritizing the development of comprehensive guidelines for crypto ETFs. The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets approved the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) for conversion into a spot ETF on July 22.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand, especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

As a result, LINK price has moved past the neckline of a rounded-bottom pattern at $18 and reached $20. For LINK to advance higher, it needs to maintain above $18. If successful, it could retest $24 in July or August. If LINK price fails to hold above $18, the next important support levels are $15 and $13. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) LINK Crypto Price Forecast July 2025 10 18 24 Chainlink Price Analysis 2025 (H1) In 2025, Chainlink price (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in April, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June onwards, the LINK price began to rise higher following the Bitcoin rally. Chainlink Price Forecast 2025 (H2) From the last week of June to July fourth week, it has surged nearly 80% by the fourth week of July. The entire July has optimistic due to several factors internal and external both. Even in July, the Sergey Nazarov mentioned on X that Chainlink standard is getting adopted across multiple financial ecosystems like Westpac and Imperium Markets. With the current bullish ongoing momentum this week, the LINK price has moved past the rounded-bottom pattern’s neckline at $18 in the fourth week of July and reached $20. However, the RSI has exhausted itself and hit 82, which is an overheated stage in overbought territory. The curve shows short-term caution, as it has retreated to 75 when writing with a slight halt in the LINK price rally. This price action suggests short-term caution, as LINK price may fall to $18 support and even consolidate at this level to cool off its exhaustion by entering the 60-65 range in RSI. For the LINK price to advance higher, it needs to sustain itself above $18. If it does, then LINK might retest $24 in July or August. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of even flipping the fixed range high-volume profile level based on the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32. On the contrary, if LINK fails to hold on to $18, then $15 will be important support, followed by $13 next support.

2025-07-23T10:09:01,"Bitcoin News Today: On‑Chain Metrics Hint at Next Wave of Selling Pressure","The post Bitcoin News Today: On‑Chain Metrics Hint at Next Wave of Selling Pressure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is once again showing signs of entering a strong rally, but this time, the signals are coming from its on-chain data rather than just price action. Bitcoin’s hidden supply is waking up again, and it could mean something big for what’s next. Verified CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted fresh signs in Bitcoin’s % Supply Active chart that could tell us where this market is headed next. So, what’s happening? Bitcoin Supply Sharply Increased CryptoQuant’s verified on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. says the share of Bitcoin’s active supply in the past 180 days is starting to rise. When this number goes up, it means coins that were sitting still for months or even years are now moving again. This usually points to more selling or holders spreading out their coins as prices go higher. This could mean the market is getting ready for an early wave of selling, which might help push Bitcoin’s next move past $120,000. The share of coins active over the last 180 days (% Supply Active) sharply increased twice in past macro cycles: first to 20 % when BTC climbed to $70,000 in spring 2024, and then in December 2024 to 18 % upon the first breach of the psychological $100,000 mark. This… pic.twitter.com/krgvTcoxvL — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) July 23, 2025 Key Supply Activity Trends Looking back, we can see that big jumps in supply activity often went hand in hand with big price moves. For example, in spring 2024, Bitcoin climbed to about $70,000, and at the same time, supply activity rose to 20%, showing that many long-term holders were taking profits. A few months later, in December 2024, supply activity rose again to 18% when Bitcoin broke through the key $100,000 mark for the first time. Now, in June 2025, we see the same trend starting but with one big difference. Even though Bitcoin is steady around $100,000, the latest data shows supply activity has only gone up slightly, from negative levels to about +2.4% in the last 30 days. Compared to past cycles, this is still low, a sign that many holders are not yet ready to sell big chunks of their stash. Early Stages of Distribution Meanwhile, Adler points out that this small rise means we are likely still early in this market cycle. If Bitcoin holds strong and pushes above $120,000, the % Supply Active could slowly climb into the 8%–10% range first, then maybe back to the 18%–20% peaks seen in past big rallies. As of now, Bitcoin’s price is around $118,176 , slightly down in the last 24 hours. But with a market cap near $2.35 trillion, the stage looks set for more action ahead.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-news-today-on%e2%80%91chain-metrics-hint-at-next-wave-of-selling-pressure/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-23T10:00:08,"Whales Are Buying This Altcoin Set to Rise 20%, Just as Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes Near $120,000 After New ATH","Bitcoin (BTC)’s recent surge to nearly $120,000 has investors buzzing, marking an exciting new all-time high in the crypto world. This milestone signals renewed confidence among large institutional players, who are now beginning to rotate profits into promising altcoins that promise faster, more explosive growth. While Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui focus on technical upgrades like speed and scalability, the financial upside offered by certain altcoins is capturing more attention from savvy investors. One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform poised to deliver rapid returns that could far outpace slow-moving tech improvements. As whales increase their stakes, MUTM stands out not just for its innovative DeFi protocols but also for its strong presale momentum and well-structured roadmap. Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized around $119,750 as of July 21, 2025, after hitting a new all-time high of $123,153 on July 14, driven by $2.7 billion in weekly ETF inflows, per Reuters. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, holding over 700,000 BTC, led with $1.18 billion in single-day inflows, boosting institutional demand. The CLARITY Act and pro-crypto policies during “Crypto Week” fueled optimism, with X posts noting a 13% monthly gain. A bullish three white soldiers pattern targets $125,000-$136,000 by Q4 2025, per Ledn’s CEO, though an overbought RSI (75) and $445 million in short liquidations suggest a potential dip to $116,500-$117,000. Long-term holder accumulation (250,000 BTC) and rising transactions (364,000 daily) signal sustained momentum, but tariff uncertainties and miner outflows could spark volatility, keeping BTC’s trajectory in a delicate balance. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized lending platform built on a fast Layer-2 network, offering two distinct models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will be able to deposit assets like $28,000 MATIC into a lending pool and earn a projected 13.8% APY—yielding $3,864 in passive income annually. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to put blue-chip tokens such as $2,800 worth of ADA at 70% LTV to instantly borrow $1,960 in USDT, with flexible repayment and no penalties. Meanwhile, the P2P model will support risk-adjusted lending backed by volatile assets like memecoins. Users will negotiate terms directly, unlocking higher yield opportunities with smart contract safeguards. All earnings will be tracked through mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that grow in value automatically, can be transferred, and staked for extra rewards via MUTM buybacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale has attracted tremendous interest, with Phase 5 nearly complete. Out of a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, $12.9 million has been raised, and 90% of tokens allocated in this phase are sold. Over 13,900 holders have secured their positions at the current price of $0.03, just before the next planned price increase to $0.035—a 20% rise. This rapid token uptake illustrates strong market confidence and positions MUTM as one of the hottest altcoins for investors seeking meaningful returns ahead of the token’s full launch. Stablecoin Innovation & mtToken Staking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a steady $1 value. This stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral like ETH, and burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. Governance will actively adjust borrowing interest rates to keep the stablecoin price close to its peg, lowering rates if it trades above $1 and raising them if it dips below. This dynamic rate model works alongside natural arbitrage to maintain price stability. Meanwhile, mtTokens generated in lending pools can be staked in designated smart contracts, enabling holders to earn passive income through MUTM buybacks. This mechanism not only incentivizes long-term holding but also adds an extra layer of security and community engagement to the ecosystem. Roadmap Progress and Future Milestones Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made significant strides since the presale launch. Most of Phase 1, “Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” is complete, including presale initiation, marketing campaigns, giveaway launches, external smart contract audits, token tracking listings, and implementation of an AI-powered helpdesk. Pending items include educational content on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s technology and forming a legal and compliance team. Looking ahead, Phase 2, titled “Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” will focus on core smart contract development, DApp front-end and back-end infrastructure setup, introduction of advanced features, and implementation of robust risk parameters. Both internal and external auditors will conduct regular code reviews to ensure security and efficiency. Additionally, Phase 2 will bring advanced analytics tools for improved platform insights. Phases 3 and 4, “Finalizing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)” and “Delivering Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” respectively, will see beta testing, launch of the demo version, regulatory alignment, and preparation for exchange listings. The live platform launch, token listing on exchanges, bug bounty program activation, and expansion to multiple blockchain networks are also slated for these stages, along with institutional partnership development and ongoing platform enhancements. This structured roadmap lays a clear path toward a fully functional, secure, and scalable DeFi ecosystem. A notable example of early success comes from a trader who swapped 10 ETH for MUTM tokens during Phase 2 at just $0.015 each. With the token set to list at $0.06, this investor currently sits on a 4x paper gain. Looking ahead, if post-launch demand pushes MUTM toward the projected $0.30 target, that same position could grow to a 20x return. This upside is supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming beta launch, which will activate real-world P2P and P2C lending use cases—attracting a wider user base and increasing token demand. CertiK Audit & $100K Giveaway Boost Confidence Security is a top priority for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), evidenced by a thorough CertiK audit combining manual code reviews and static analysis. The platform has earned a strong scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet rating of 77.50, underscoring its robust security protocols. Alongside these assurances, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway with ten $10,000 worth of MUTM token prizes, fueling community enthusiasm. The project’s Twitter following has surpassed 12,000, reflecting an engaged and growing user base ready to support the token’s journey. With approximately 60 million MUTM tokens remaining at $0.03, this is a final opportunity for investors to secure tokens before the upcoming Phase 6 price jump to $0.035. This 20% increase is locked in and offers immediate upside to those who move swiftly. While Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes near historic highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s innovative DeFi approach and strong presale performance position it to be the next altcoin breakout story.
