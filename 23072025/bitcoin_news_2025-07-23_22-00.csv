2025-07-23T19:55:49,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Calls for ‘Internal Review’ of Federal Reserve As Pressure on Jerome Powell Mounts","U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is calling for a review of the central bank’s operations as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure to resign. In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Bessent says that the Federal Reserve is in need of deeper scrutiny as its budget and operations have expanded over the years. Bessent’s comments come as President Donald Trump has said he hopes Powell quits and has also considered attempting to remove him, all while slamming the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates. “The President has said he is not going to fire Chair Powell. I was somewhat surprised that [economist] Mohamed El-Erian came out and said that [Powell should resign]. And what I’ve come out and said is that I believe that it would do Chair Powell a favor, and he would be doing the institution a favor, if he did an internal review, separate monetary policy from everything else. And this is something that [economist and former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury] Larry Summers and I agree on, is this mission creep from the Fed is endangering their independence of monetary policy, all these other things that they’re engaging in could threaten monetary policy. It is a big, sprawling institution. The central budget for the board is up 4x since 2004, and every institution needs to examine themselves.” Bessent also says he’d support Powell overseeing the agency’s review, despite the criticism he’s facing. “It could be a committee. It could be a group. They could invite outside experts in. The Bank of England after the 2022 rate hike shock went back and did a very good examination of what went wrong with monetary policy that brought in outside experts. I think an internal review would be a good start. And if the internal review didn’t look like it was serious, then maybe their could be an external review.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-23T19:55:23,"Interest Rate Cuts: Unlocking Crypto Market Potential in 2024?","BitcoinWorld Interest Rate Cuts: Unlocking Crypto Market Potential in 2024? The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with anticipation, and few topics generate as much discussion as the potential shifts in global monetary policy. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, the whispers of impending interest rate cuts from major economies, particularly the United States, carry significant weight. Why? Because these decisions by central banks can ripple through financial markets, influencing everything from bond yields to the volatile yet exciting realm of digital assets. Understanding these macroeconomic currents is not just for economists; it is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the often-unpredictable tides of the crypto market. What Did U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Say About Interest Rate Cuts? Recently, the financial world turned its attention to a significant statement from a prominent figure: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. According to the widely followed Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X (formerly Twitter), Bessent indicated that the U.S. could realistically anticipate ‘one or two rate cuts’ this year. This declaration, coming from such a high-ranking economic official, is far more than a casual remark; it is a powerful signal that warrants close examination by anyone invested in or considering the crypto market. Secretary Bessent’s insights are particularly relevant because he sits at the heart of U.S. economic policy. His perspective offers a glimpse into the administration’s thinking and expectations regarding the nation’s financial trajectory. When a Treasury Secretary speaks about interest rate cuts , it suggests that the underlying economic conditions—such as inflation trends, employment data, and overall economic growth—are being carefully evaluated, potentially paving the way for a shift in the Federal Reserve’s monetary stance. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, high-level government officials often have access to comprehensive economic data and forecasts that inform their public statements, making Bessent’s comments a key piece of the puzzle for market watchers. Why Do Interest Rate Cuts Matter for the Crypto Market? Understanding the intricate dance between traditional monetary policy and the decentralized world of cryptocurrency is crucial for any investor. Historically, there is an inverse relationship often observed: when interest rate cuts are on the horizon or enacted, riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, tend to become more attractive. But what exactly drives this dynamic? Let’s break down the core mechanisms: Lower Borrowing Costs: When central banks reduce interest rates, the cost of borrowing money for businesses and consumers decreases. This encourages spending and investment, as capital becomes cheaper to acquire. More money flowing through the economy often finds its way into various asset classes, including those perceived as having higher growth potential. Increased Liquidity: Reduced interest rates typically lead to an expansion of the money supply and increased liquidity in the financial system. This abundance of capital seeks returns, and with lower yields on traditional ‘safe’ investments like savings accounts or government bonds, investors are often pushed towards assets that promise higher growth, even if they come with greater risk. Reduced Opportunity Cost: The opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like cryptocurrencies decreases when interest rates are low. If you can earn minimal returns from a bank savings account or a low-yield bond, the allure of potentially significant gains from crypto becomes stronger, making the trade-off more appealing for investors seeking better returns. Valuation of Growth Assets: Many crypto projects, particularly those focused on innovation and future technologies, are considered ‘growth assets.’ In a lower interest rate environment, the present value of future earnings or potential growth for these assets tends to increase. This is because the discount rate used to value future cash flows or potential market share is lower, making their long-term prospects appear more valuable today. These factors collectively create an environment where the perceived risk-reward balance shifts in favor of growth-oriented and volatile assets, making the prospect of interest rate cuts a generally bullish signal for the cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Economic Landscape: What are the Broader Implications of Rate Cuts? While the direct impact on crypto is a major focus for our community, it is vital to zoom out and consider the broader economic implications of interest rate cuts . These decisions are not made in a vacuum; they reflect central banks’ assessment of economic health and their strategies to achieve stability and growth. A rate cut typically signals a desire to stimulate economic activity, combat potential slowdowns, or manage disinflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, operates with a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (i.e., control inflation). When inflation appears to be under control and/or employment figures show signs of softening, the Fed might consider cutting rates to prevent an economic downturn. Such a move can: Boost Consumer Spending: Lower interest rates on loans (mortgages, credit cards) can encourage consumers to spend more, stimulating demand. Encourage Business Investment: Companies find it cheaper to borrow for expansion, research, and development, leading to job creation and economic growth. Impact Traditional Markets: Stock markets often react positively to rate cut expectations as they imply lower borrowing costs for companies and potentially higher corporate profits. Bond yields, conversely, tend to fall. However, the timing and magnitude of these cuts are heavily dependent on incoming economic data. The Fed constantly monitors inflation rates, employment reports, GDP growth, and global economic conditions to make its decisions. The market’s anticipation of these moves can sometimes be as impactful as the actual decisions themselves, leading to periods of heightened volatility as investors adjust their positions. Aspect Potential Impact Explanation Liquidity Increases Lower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, leading to more capital flowing into the broader financial system, including risk assets like crypto. Investor Appetite for Risk Boosts With lower returns on safer investments (like bonds or savings accounts), investors may seek higher yields in more volatile assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Opportunity Cost of Holding Crypto Decreases The relative attractiveness of holding cash or low-yield assets diminishes, making the potential returns from crypto more appealing. Valuation of Growth Assets Positive Many crypto projects are seen as long-duration growth assets. Lower discount rates (due to lower interest rates) can increase their present value. Historical Precedents: How Have Crypto Markets Reacted to Past Rate Cycles? Looking back can often provide valuable insights into what might lie ahead. While the crypto market is relatively young compared to traditional asset classes, we have seen it react to various phases of monetary policy. During periods of aggressive rate hikes, such as those witnessed in 2022, risk assets, including crypto, generally faced significant headwinds. The tightening of monetary policy, aimed at curbing inflation, made borrowing more expensive and reduced overall market liquidity, leading to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment among investors. Conversely, periods of monetary easing or anticipated interest rate cuts have often coincided with renewed investor confidence and upward price momentum. For instance, the bull run seen in late 2020 and 2021 occurred amidst an environment of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing, where central banks were actively injecting liquidity into the financial system. This created a fertile ground for risk assets to flourish, and cryptocurrencies benefited significantly from the surge in liquidity and investor appetite for higher returns. It is important to remember, however, that correlation is not causation. While macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts play a significant role, the crypto market is also influenced by its unique internal dynamics, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and specific project news. Therefore, while historical trends offer a useful framework, they should not be seen as a definitive predictor of future performance. What Are the Potential Challenges and Headwinds to Rate Cuts? While the prospect of interest rate cuts often brings optimism, it is crucial for any discerning investor to consider the potential challenges and headwinds. The path to monetary easing is rarely smooth, and unforeseen factors can always alter the trajectory or diminish the positive impact on risk assets. Inflation Persistence: If inflation proves to be more stubborn than anticipated, or if new inflationary pressures emerge (e.g., from supply chain disruptions or geopolitical events), central banks might delay or reduce the number of planned rate cuts. This could lead to market disappointment and a reassessment of risk assets. Economic Slowdown: Sometimes, interest rate cuts are enacted because the economy is weakening significantly. While cuts aim to stimulate growth, a severe economic downturn could still lead to overall market caution and a ‘flight to safety,’ even in a lower-rate environment. Investors might prioritize capital preservation over speculative gains. Geopolitical Instability: Major global events, such as conflicts or political crises, can overshadow economic policy decisions. Such events can trigger market volatility, disrupt supply chains, and create uncertainty that makes investors hesitant to embrace risk, regardless of interest rate movements. Regulatory Scrutiny in Crypto: The crypto market faces ongoing regulatory developments across the globe. New regulations, enforcement actions, or shifts in government stance could introduce significant headwinds that are independent of macroeconomic policy, affecting market sentiment and adoption. Unexpected Data: The Federal Reserve’s decisions are data-dependent. Any unexpected shifts in key economic indicators—like a sudden surge in unemployment or an unexpected rise in core inflation—could prompt the Fed to adjust its plans for rate cuts, leading to market re-pricing. These factors highlight the complexity of forecasting market movements based solely on monetary policy. A holistic view, incorporating a range of economic, political, and industry-specific considerations, is essential. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Investor Given the evolving economic landscape and the potential for interest rate cuts , how can you best position yourself in the dynamic crypto market? While this is not financial advice, here are some actionable insights to consider as you formulate your strategy: Stay Informed and Adaptable: Continuously monitor official announcements from central banks (especially the Federal Reserve), key economic data releases (inflation, employment), and expert analyses. The market reacts swiftly to new information, so being well-informed allows for quicker adaptation. Understand the Nuances: Recognize that not all cryptocurrencies will react in the same way to macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin, often seen as a ‘digital gold’ or macro asset, might respond differently than smaller altcoins or DeFi tokens. Research specific projects and their fundamentals. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Given crypto’s inherent volatility, even in a favorable macro environment, capital preservation should be a priority. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking profits at predetermined levels. Diversification: Avoid putting all your digital eggs in one basket. Diversifying your crypto portfolio across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens, NFTs) and even traditional assets can help mitigate risk during periods of uncertainty. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making a large lump-sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price fluctuations. DCA can help smooth out volatility and reduce the impact of short-term price swings, making you less susceptible to market timing errors. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific projects rather than getting caught up in daily price movements. Macroeconomic cycles come and go, but foundational technological advancements can drive sustained growth over years. By adopting a disciplined approach and integrating macroeconomic awareness into your investment framework, you can better navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by potential interest rate cuts . The potential for one or two interest rate cuts in 2024, as suggested by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, undoubtedly introduces a fascinating dynamic for the cryptocurrency market. While lower rates could inject fresh liquidity and boost investor appetite for risk, the broader economic context, including inflation, employment data, and geopolitical stability, will continue to shape the narrative. For those navigating the exciting world of digital assets, staying informed, understanding the macroeconomic currents, and adopting a well-thought-out strategy will be paramount. The future remains uncertain, but opportunities often emerge from periods of significant change, making this an exciting time to be involved in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the primary impact of interest rate cuts on financial markets? The primary impact of interest rate cuts is to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper. This encourages consumer spending and business investment, which can lead to increased liquidity in the financial system and often boosts stock markets and other risk assets, as investors seek higher returns than those offered by traditional low-yield savings or bonds. 2. How might interest rate cuts specifically affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Historically, interest rate cuts tend to make riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive. Lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding volatile assets, increase overall market liquidity, and can lead to capital flowing into digital assets in search of higher yields compared to traditional low-return investments. 3. Are interest rate cuts guaranteed this year, according to Scott Bessent? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that ‘one or two rate cuts’ are a realistic expectation for this year. However, this is an expectation based on current economic forecasts, not a guarantee. The Federal Reserve’s decisions are data-dependent and can change based on evolving inflation, employment, and broader economic conditions. 4. What other factors, besides interest rates, influence crypto prices? Besides interest rate cuts and broader macroeconomic trends, crypto prices are influenced by a multitude of factors. These include regulatory developments, technological advancements within blockchain projects, institutional adoption, network upgrades (like Bitcoin halvings or Ethereum’s Merge), market sentiment, geopolitical events, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of individual cryptocurrencies. 5. Should I change my crypto investment strategy based on potential rate cuts? While potential interest rate cuts can be a positive macroeconomic tailwind for crypto, it is generally advisable to maintain a well-researched and disciplined investment strategy rather than making drastic changes based solely on a single factor. Consider diversifying your portfolio, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term speculation. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. 6. What is the Federal Reserve’s role in setting interest rates? The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is the central bank of the United States and is responsible for setting the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates throughout the economy. Its decisions are guided by a dual mandate: to achieve maximum sustainable employment and to maintain stable prices (control inflation). The Fed uses interest rates as a key tool to manage economic growth and stability. Did you find this deep dive into interest rate cuts and their potential impact on crypto insightful?

Fraudsters Stole $97 Million in Crypto Scheme, New Press Release Shows According to the July 23 press release , U.S. officials are looking to forfeit $7.1 million, just a sliver of the $97 million stolen by a handful of crypto fraudsters between June 22 and July 24. U.S. commences civil action to forfeit $7.1 million in cryptocurrency tied to oil and gas storage fraud scheme – Crypto seized from wallets tied to Russian and Nigerian IP addresses https://t.co/LoCQb0yC06 — WDWAnews (@WDWAnews) July 22, 2025 Recovered in December 2024, the illicit funds were laundered as part of a complex oil tank rental scheme involving Newcastle, Washington resident Geoffrey K. Auyeung. “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Miller. “Federal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.” Crypto Fraudster Faces Up to 200 Years Behind Bars Indicted in August 2024, Auyeung and his unnamed co-conspirators allegedly convinced unwitting victims to move their funds into escrow accounts based in Europe and Texas in order to generate “significant profits” from renting out oil tanks there. Once victims sent their money, the crypto fraudsters stopped responding and shuffled the funds to crypto accounts in Russia and Nigeria—one of which had ties to a terrorist organization. “The money was quickly moved to one or more of at least 81 different accounts at financial institutions, moved offshore, or moved to one or more of at least 19 different cryptocurrency accounts, where it was used for the purchase of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Tether, USD Coin, and Ethereum,” the press release states. Auyeung faces a maximum of 200 years behind bars if convicted for the international crypto fraud , though sentencing varies per jurisdiction.

Related Reading: Too Pricey? Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now The surge came after a 5% increase over the last 24 hours and a 13% gain in the last week, taking BNB’s market capitalization to over $110 billion. Currently, it ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Spike In Volume And Derivatives Trading Volume trading around BNB has increased strongly. According to Coinglass data, daily volume rose over 40% to over $3 billion. Derivatives volume surged 31% to $2.18 billion, while open interest in BNB futures increased 19% to $1.23 billion. These represent an expanding tide of speculation and demand for the asset, perhaps fueled by fresh money flowing into the market. A good deal of this movement seems to be riding on bullish momentum forming around BNB’s recent price action. The token has been in an uptrend for weeks now, and this breakout above its previous highs indicates buyers are remaining bullish, even as there are indications that the market is heating up. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is also well into overbought conditions at 87.50. When the RSI crosses above 70, it generally means that a pullback may be imminent. Nevertheless, the uptrend is still in place. BNB is well above its 20-day simple moving average of $704. Price is higher with good volume, and this is a combination that is commonly used to confirm trend strength. Nano Labs Buys $90 Million Worth Of BNB Institutional buying could be propelling the rally. On July 22, China-founded Web3 infrastructure company Nano Labs Ltd announced it had added 120,000 BNB tokens to its holdings—worth around $90 million. According to the company, it bought over-the-counter at an average cost of $707 per BNB. Nano Labs stated that it views BNB as a strategic reserve asset and will continue to add to its holdings. It also stated that it will invest in companies that are dedicated to the BNB ecosystem. Such a long-term commitment brings an element of confidence for retail investors tracking the token’s movements closely. All the hype aside, there are beginning to appear some warning signs. BNB is now trading above the top Bollinger Band, an indication that the token may be getting stretched.

2025-07-23T19:25:46,"Spot Ethereum ETFs saw $533.9 million in inflows, the 3rd largest single-day gain","US spot Ethereum ETFs pulled in around $533.9 million in daily inflows, the 3rd largest single‑day gain since these products began trading. The figures point to rising interest in ether from investors. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the way with $426.2 million worth of inflows. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust added $72.6 million, while Fidelity’s ether ETF brought in $35 million. The total ranks just behind the value of $726.7 million from the previous Wednesday and the $602 million seen last Thursday. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, pointed to a drop in bitcoin dominance and steady macro conditions for support of ether’s gains. “ETH’s momentum looks set to sustain in the mid‑term as long as these factors hold,” Liu said. Nick Ruck, from LVRG Research, noted that institutions appear to be turning bullish on Ethereum. He said the record‑high inflows into spot ether ETFs offer “a second opportunity for investors who missed out on Bitcoin’s historic rise,” as part of their reserve strategies for digital assets. Companies are starting to add ether to their balance sheets under new treasury plans. For instance, SharpLink Gaming has already shifted the focus to building up its ether holdings after outlining its Eth treasury strategy earlier in May. By contrast, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw net outflows of $67.9 million on Tuesday. The previous day, investors had pulled $131.3 million from these funds, indicating a shift away from bitcoin. “We’re seeing a familiar rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum,” – Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto. “Bitcoin has rallied significantly this year, and for investors who feel they’ve ‘missed’ the BTC trade or are looking for the next opportunity, Ethereum is becoming the natural next step.” Ethereum’s recent rally comes from a surge in structural demand In a July 22 memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan described what he called a “demand shock” for ether. He wrote that since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have bought approximately 2.83 million ETH, worth about $10 billion. That is about 32x the number of ETH minted by the network over the same period. Hougan said that over the past month alone, ether has jumped over 65%, and since April, the price has climbed over 160%. He argued that this rise is driven by the imbalance between fresh demand and new supply, rather than changing market sentiment. Since US spot BTC ETFs began trading at the start of last year, funds on Wall Street, public companies including Trump Media and Strategy, and some governments have added over 1.5 million Bitcoins to their reserves, compared with only 300,000 newly minted coins. This roughly 5 to 1 demand advantage helped push bitcoin’s price up about 155%, making it the highest performer in this time. “Five times more demand than supply. Sometimes it really is that simple,” Hougan wrote. Ethereum’s early rally run did not see strong demand In the first ten months after spot ETH ETFs launched in the mid of 2024, these funds bought just 660k coins with roughly $2.5 billion in net new money, while public companies added only small amounts, and the network issued about 543,000 ETH. As a result, ether trailed behind bitcoin’s performance over that stretch. Then, spot ETH products ramped up their purchases in mid-May. They have since bought over $5 billion worth of ether, while companies such as SharpLink Gaming, Bit Digital, BitMine Immersion, and The Ether Machine, revealed large‑scale treasury plans. These companies purchased around 2.83 million Ethereum, a move that likely helped the token break above $3,800. Looking ahead, Hougan forecasted that ETFs along with corporate treasuries may purchase $20 billion worth of Ethereum over 2025. That would be around 5.33 million tokens. At the same time, the network would only issue around 800,000 Ethereum in this time frame. He mentioned that investors remain underexposed to Ethereum in comparison with bitcoin but also expects that to change as stablecoin and tokenization trends grow. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand, and right now, there is more demand for ETH than supply,” Hougan wrote. “As a result, I think we’re heading higher.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-23T19:05:34,"Ethereum Dips Below $3,600 After Trump Tariff Remarks, But ETH/BTC Ratio Hits Multi-Week High","Ethereum faced a sharp pullback Wednesday as former President Donald Trump’s tariff comments rattled risk markets. In a press briefing, Trump said he’d only ease tariffs if foreign markets opened wider to U.S. goods—a hardline stance that sent shockwaves across global assets. Ethereum reacted fast. The price slipped below $3,600 , falling to $3,590 —its lowest in days, according to CoinMarketCap . But beneath the surface, a deeper shift is underway. At the same time ETH/USD slid, the ETH/BTC ratio quietly hit its highest level in weeks —climbing above 0.031 , up from 0.022 just a month ago. That’s a 40%+ move in 30 days, underscoring Ethereum’s strength relative to Bitcoin. The Dual Drivers for Ethereum: Institutions and ETFs This relative ETH strength isn’t a fluke. Two forces are fueling it: Institutional buying : Funds and large players continue locking in Ethereum positions. ETF inflows : July has seen record weekly inflows into Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds. Assets under management are swelling, signaling surging investor appetite. Smart contract usage, DeFi traction, and staking demand all add tailwinds. Confidence is rebuilding—and the ETH/BTC ratio tells that story clearly. Since its five-year low near 0.018 in April—matching March 2020 crash levels—the ETH/BTC ratio has now rebounded more than 70% . Bulls point to the 0.02 level as a new long-term support floor. The ETH/BTC ratio has grown over 40% in the past month, climbing to ~0.031 from as low as ~0.022 on June 23. This gain roughly matches Ethereum’s 60%+ price rally over the last 30 days, fueled by growing institutional interest and massive #Ethereum ETF inflows in July. pic.twitter.com/WpnTXf1RoG — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 23, 2025 Altseason Rumblings Grow As Ethereum gains ground on Bitcoin, traders are beginning to whisper the “A” word again— altseason . Historically, when ETH outperforms BTC, smaller-cap coins tend to follow. Decentralized exchange volumes have ticked higher. Open interest in ETH perpetuals has surged. Funding rates have flipped positive on major platforms. Even with today’s dip, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain firm: Daily Transactions : 1.2M+ Staked ETH : Over 10 million Gas Usage : Spiking across DeFi protocols Macro Uncertainty Lingers Still, macro clouds haven’t cleared. With key U.S. inflation data due this week, the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates elevated. That could pressure all risk assets, crypto included. Trump’s tariff tone just added another layer of uncertainty. Some see it as noise. Others view it as a reminder: U.S. policy remains volatile—and so does the market.

2025-07-23T19:00:51,"Analyst: Next Is $7 Once XRP Clears This Rigid Hurdle","XRP is once again in the spotlight as analysts turn attention to a critical price level that could define its next major move. After staging a strong recovery in 2025 and recently surpassing its previous all-time high, a r ecent flash crash has sent its price to $3.20 region. According to chart analyst XRPunkie on X, the digital asset is consolidating just beneath a long-term resistance trendline, one that has historically served as a major obstacle for upward momentum. XRP Stalls Below a Key Technical Barrier The chart the analyst shared before the flash crash shows XRP trading at around $3.47, just shy of a major diagonal resistance that forms the upper boundary of an ascending channel dating back to 2017. This trendline, marked by a yellow arrow in the chart, is acting as a ceiling, similar to how the $3.50 zone capped XRP’s explosive rally during the 2017–2018 bull run. Despite multiple attempts, the price has yet to close decisively above this level, suggesting the presence of significant selling pressure. Interestingly $XRP met with some resistance at the $3.50 range for a while. Looking at this chart, apparently its hanging just below the first resistance trendline (yellow arrow). Once we clear it, the next resistance is around $7-$9 (blue arrow). Is XRP gonna to get there soon? https://t.co/chGGhwWC8X pic.twitter.com/ZyqfSADm6t — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 23, 2025 What makes this area even more crucial is its psychological significance. The $3.50 level represents a long-standing benchmark in XRP’s history. Its inability to break above this range decisively during previous cycles signals that bulls must muster greater strength before a larger move can unfold. Breakout Could Ignite Rally Toward $7–$9 XRPunkie’s analysis suggests that once this resistance is cleared, the next major target lies in the $7 to $9 range . The chart highlights this zone with a blue arrow, aligned with the Fibonacci 1.272 and 1.414 extension levels, approximately $9.11 and $15.04, respectively. These Fibonacci levels are widely used by technical analysts to project potential price expansions following breakout moves. The setup implies a scenario where XRP, after breaking through the current barrier, could experience a rapid rally fueled by technical momentum and renewed market interest. Historical price action also supports this view, as similar breakouts in previous cycles have led to vertical moves.

Bitcoin remains strong above $117,000, institutional interest in crypto continues to rise, and Ripple’s ecosystem is expanding, particularly with the rollout of RLUSD, its stablecoin aimed at unlocking real-world utility for the XRP Ledger. On-chain metrics are also encouraging. Active wallet growth, rising transaction volumes, and increased developer activity all point toward strengthening fundamentals for XRP. This on-chain support helps validate the idea that price appreciation could be sustainable if resistance is flipped into support.
