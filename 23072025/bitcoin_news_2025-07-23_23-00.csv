2025-07-23T20:58:08,"Sleeping Bitcoins Are Waking Up and Entering Circulation: What Does This Mean? What Can We Expect?","In his latest analysis of Bitcoin's supply dynamics, cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler noted that the market is still in the early stages of the macrocycle. According to Adler, the return of Bitcoins, which have been dormant for a long time, to circulation provides striking signals on the supply side, but the majority of investors are not in a rush to sell. Adler recalled two significant increases in supply volatility in past macrocycles: First, when Bitcoin rose to $70,000 in the spring of 2024, the percentage of coins activated within 180 days reached 20%. The second increase reached 18% in December 2024, when Bitcoin first surpassed the psychological threshold of $100,000. These movements indicated that long-dormant assets, known as ‚Äúsleeper coins,‚Äù were being mobilized and redistributed into the market. Adler noted that supply activity began to rise again after Bitcoin reached $100,000 again in June 2025, noting that this rate has shifted from negative territory to positive by 2.4% in the last 30 days. However, the fact that this increase is lower than past peaks suggests that there is still a significant ‚Äúbullish buffer‚Äù in the market and that supply pressure remains limited, according to Adler. Related News: Watch Out: Jim Cramer Spoke About Bitcoin and Ethereum! Will it be Inverse Cramer Again? Adler made the following assessment in his statement: Essentially, a significant portion of investors are not yet ready to sell. Supply only began to revive at the start of the new rally. As the price consolidates above $120,000, the 30-day active supply ratio will first rise to the 8-10% range, then rise again to 18-20%. Once these levels are reached, the final distribution phase will begin. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-23T20:46:38,"XRP Price Prediction: XRP Sets New ATH, But Fans Are Still Furious ‚Äì How Quickly Could XRP Hit $20 From Here?","Loyal supporters of XRP (XRP) are furious about the token‚Äôs slow journey to make a new all-time high after years of legal battles that made Ripple the Cinderella of the crypto world. For some, the XRP Army‚Äôs passion favors a bullish XRP price prediction . In a conversation with the crypto-focused magazine Decrypt, a handful of members of the so-called XRP Army shared their thoughts about the current state of the token and the journey they have all gone through. ‚ÄúSeven years of waiting for progress because [of] stupid left-wing politics in our way through the SEC. Do you understand?‚Äù commented MackAttackXRP, a prominent XRP fan whose X account is followed by more than 87,000 users. Meanwhile, another fan called John Squire said: ‚ÄúThe anger in the XRP community is mostly directed at the SEC, for artificially holding back the asset with a lawsuit that hurt retail investors the most.‚Äù Don‚Äôt celebrate anything until $XRP hits $1000, we wouldn‚Äôt want anyone getting upset. ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) July 23, 2025 Now that a new pro-crypto administration has taken over and a new Chairman has been appointed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), members of the XRP Army members believe that the token will play catch up to deliver the significant gains that other assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) have during this 7-year period. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Retreat a Bit Before Its Next Big Move Looking at XRP‚Äôs 4-hour chart, we can see that the latest rally has hit a ceiling once it got to $3.65. Selling pressure has been high at that point as early buyers probably started to take some profits off the table. The 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems poised to make a bearish crossover below the 21-day EMA, which favors a near-term correction. Any declines at this point may be considered a great opportunity to buy XRP at a lower price as the token‚Äôs long-term prospects are as promising as ever. Can XRP hit $20? It is definitely a possibility but not an easy feat. It would mean that the asset‚Äôs market value will rise to $1 trillion ‚Äì still not as valuable as Bitcoin but it would involve flipping Ethereum (ETH). In the meantime, the best crypto presales like Token6900 (T6900) offer significant upside potential in the short term as investors look for the most promising projects whose value could 10x in the next few months. Token6900 (T6900) is The Purest Meme Coin Out There ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why Token6900 (T6900) leverages the success of SPX6900 (SPX) but adds a touch of 2000s nostalgia to the mix. This token is a meme coin in its purest form ‚Äì no road map, no use case, no promises. It is everything that Wall Street isn‚Äôt. T6900 is hard capped at $5 million, meaning that early buyers will be the ones to profit the most from its surge. Since its presale event kicked off a few weeks ago, it has already raised more than $1 million to follow the footsteps of its predecessor. To buy $T6900 at its discounted presale price of $0.006675, head to the Token6900 website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

However, the agency later issued a stay order halting the launch pending further internal review. Regulator Issues Second Reversal This Month A July 22 filing shows that the SEC had granted an ‚Äúaccelerated approval‚Äù for Bitwise‚Äôs proposal to convert its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). In what Bloomberg ETF analyst Nate Geraci referred to as a ‚Äúbizarre situation,‚Äù the regulator then later put the action on hold. ‚ÄúThis letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission‚Äôs Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the Commission will review the delegated action,‚Äù read the document. Notably, it marks the second time this month that the financial watchdog has intervened to block such a request. The SEC also stopped the launch of Grayscale‚Äôs mixed crypto ETF. That product had received initial approval from the Division of Trading and Markets, but was later stayed by the Commission under the same provisions. These back-to-back reversals have gotten criticism from analysts. In a Tuesday X post, Geraci insisted , ‚ÄúBoth of these should be allowed to convert/uplist ASAP.‚Äù The ETF was set to trade on NYSE Arca as a ‚ÄúTrust Unit‚Äù and includes a mix of top cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), SUI, Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC). However, until the order is lifted, BITW shares will remain available only over-the-counter. Under Rule 431, the SEC can independently review any decision its staff makes under delegated authority. Once invoked, the regulator automatically suspends the decision until it determines whether to uphold, amend, or reverse it. Further, there isn‚Äôt a required timeline for this process. Bitwise currently manages approximately $5.79‚ÄØbillion in assets across its 12 crypto ETFs. The firm‚Äôs largest product is its spot Bitcoin ETF, which accounts for roughly $4.79 billion in AUM, while its Ethereum product holds an additional $431 million. Experts Weigh In Scott Johnsson, general partner at Van Buren Capital, and Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart shared their views on X regarding the SEC‚Äôs decision to stop these investment products from going live. Johnsson suggested that the agency may have approved the conversion with the knowledge that Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who has been critical of crypto, would later intervene, or that the timing was aligned with the deadlines of both proposals. ‚ÄúBoth explanations are the kind of funny business that shouldn‚Äôt really be happening under Atkins,‚Äù he wrote. Seyffart agreed, suggesting the SEC was probably stalling for time as it worked on finalizing its generic listing standards due by October 2025.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana‚Äôs price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform‚Äôs continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana‚Äôs innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $187 (-3%) Market Cap $105.45 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $10.73 Billion Circulating Supply 538.04 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $201 24-hour Low $185 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $153.91 200-Day SMA $163.72 Price Prediction $412.15¬†(118.42%) F & G Index 34.79¬†(fear) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 14-Day RSI 83.82 Solana price analysis: SOL faces bearish pressure toward $185 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows rapid decline to $185. Resistance for SOL is at $200 Support for SOL/USD is at $185 The price analysis of Solana for July 23 shows that SOL failed to climb past 200, resulting in a rapid crash back to the $185 level. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL faces strong bearish pressure Solana despite crossing past the $180 resistance found it difficult to cross past $200 as the bullish momentum was stretched thin. The technical suggested a trend correction that resulted in the rapid decline observed today. Currently the price has fallen to $187 but is yet to find a support at the level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 63.53, showing that the retracement has put the trend back in the healthy zone but shows room for further volatility across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line declines rapidly, suggesting rising bearish pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market as SOL falls back to $185. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish momentum continues to challenge buyers The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady rise as the bulls aimed to hold above the $200 price level. However, the recent crash suggests a retracement back to the $180 region suggesting consolidation at the level. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at -1.64, with the indicator showing rising bearish momentum with recent candles. This suggests that SOL is yet to find a support at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) fell to 44.34, indicating that Solana still has room for further movement in the downwards direction across the short term and SOL needs to defend the $180 level.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour charts indicates minor resistance around $203. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $185, SOL can be expected to fall to $180, a key level that needs to be defended for the bullish rally to continue towards $240. However, if the price falls below the $175 level, SOL may fall to the $168 mark. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability and speed, boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana, despite crossing past the $180 resistance, found it difficult to cross past $200 as the bullish momentum was stretched thin. The technicals suggested a trend correction that resulted in the rapid decline observed today. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of $331.81. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset‚Äôs adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential roi due to its high scalability, low transaction costs, robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana‚Äôs forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth¬†with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-07-23T20:05:09,"Bitcoin whales are being spooked to move coins with dust transactions containing threatening messages","The recent price records for BTC coincided with a wave of old whales moving their coins. Some suggested this may be a drive to take profits, but there may be another reason, as more old whales are dusted with transactions containing warning messages. There may be one common reason as to why old whales are moving their coins. After years of holding, some of the largest holders transferred their coins. The most notable case was of one user moving 80,000 BTC from several wallets. The reason may be hiding behind the spread of messages, which are considered a specific scam using the op return function of Bitcoin transactions. Investigators, however, noted that many old whale wallets received dust amounts of BTC with a pseudo-legal message attached to the transaction. The targeted addresses were not specifically chosen, except by one common thread ‚Äì a high balance and old wallets from the early years of the network. Dust messages reach BTC lost in landfill One on-chain investigator noted the pseudo-legal messages reached a notorious BTC wallet. The stash belonged to James Howells, known for trashing a hard drive containing 8,000 BTC. Since the address is widely known and the coins are considered lost, the legal claim to the BTC in Howell‚Äôs wallet is meaningless. Just realized that the person who sent notices to the 80,000 BTC that moved earlier this month has also been targeting several other dormant addresses, including the one belonging to James Howells, the guy who lost his hard drive in the landfill. This pretty much puts the hack‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Sani | TimechainIndex.com (@SaniExp) July 23, 2025 This also suggests that the whale that moved 80,000 BTC may have acted out of caution, despite the fact that BTC cannot be claimed legally and used for its purpose without control over the private keys. Unfortunately, even a legal claim would not be able to salvage Howells‚Äô coins. The wallet has been pelted with messages and even an ultimatum to prove that the coins are not forfeited. The wallet of James Howells, containing 8,000 BTC, has been given a deadline to prove the coins are not abandoned. The BTC sit in an old hard drive, buried under layers of trash in a landfill. | Source: Mempool.space Howells has been given a deadline until September 30 to prove ownership. One of the messages even read ‚Äòwe have taken possession of this wallet and its contents‚Äô. Unless the sender managed to unearth the hard drive and revive the old wallet, the message remained meaningless. There is currently no explicit list of addresses that received the fake legal claims through op_return. Other old whales may also have moved their coins as a precaution or to shift them to a new address format. Newer whales that bought at a more favorable price did not receive the legal notes. Recently, three wallets linked to the same entity moved 10,606 BTC, potentially having a medium-term strategy. BTC whales have already taken profits A total of 14.7M BTC are held in wallets aged 155 days or over. Most of the older whales have moved their coins and realized profits during the earlier BTC bull rallies. Since 2023, the percentage of coins held for more than one year has been sliding slowly. Overall, ancient cohorts of over 7 years rarely move their coins. Newer whales have a double strategy of holding some of the BTC, while using a portion for short-term trading. The newest class of corporate and institutional buyers has diverging approaches to announcing their wallets. Some are showing proof of public reserves, while others try to keep their wallets a secret to avoid exposure and eventual attacks.

In his YouTube video, Deutscher noted that, contrary to the popular altcoin season index, the current market situation signals a positive period for altcoins. According to the analyst, approximately 70% of the top 50 altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin on a monthly basis. Deutscher suggested that Bitcoin's dominance falling below a key support level for the first time since November 2024 has led to a shift in market momentum. He noted that the primary driver behind this shift is growing positive sentiment toward Ethereum. He argued that ETH ETFs, new regulatory frameworks, and institutional interest are boosting Ethereum, providing the necessary ‚Äúfirepower‚Äù for a broader altcoin market rally.

2025-07-23T20:00:41,"Ripple Won‚Äôt Dump Its XRP Escrow Holdings: Lawyer Reveals Why It‚Äôs Actually Good For Price","Legal expert Bill Morgan has commented on accusations that Ripple would dump its XRP escrow holdings at some point. He explained why that won‚Äôt happen and noted how the escrow strategy is good for the altcoin‚Äôs price. Ripple‚Äôs Escrow Will Buttress XRP Price Not Deflate It In an X post , Bill Morgan noted that even the SEC recognized that Ripple‚Äôs escrow was intended to buttress the XRP price and not deflate it. He added that even the Commission considered this to be one of the factors that would give investors an expectation of profit from the crypto firm‚Äôs efforts. The legal then remarked that this is just one of the points that clearly debunks the ‚Äòdump theory‚Äô around Ripple‚Äôs escrow . His response was in reply to a crypto community member who criticized XRP holders who think that the escrow is good for their holdings. He then indicated that the crypto firm would at some point dump its holdings on these investors. Meanwhile, Bill Morgan had earlier noted how there hasn‚Äôt been a stark difference between Ripple‚Äôs escrowed funds in 2017 and now. He revealed that the crypto firm had 55 billion XRP in escrow in late 2017 while it now has 35 billion in escrow. Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP monthly. As such, these escrowed funds should have reduced drastically since 2017. However, Ripple typically relocks a significant portion of these coins following the monthly unlocks, which explains why the crypto firm‚Äôs holdings haven‚Äôt flooded the market. Notably, the firm uses these coins for its on-demand liquidity (ODL) services. As such, the coins that are left unlocked are in demand, which also provides a boost for the XRP price. Ripple is also looking to expand its operations, which could further boost the altcoin‚Äôs adoption. Reason For the Escrow ‚ÄòDump Theory‚Äô In response to the accusations against Ripple, Bill Morgan suggested that many of these crypto community members have been simply sidelined on the recent XRP price rally . As such, he believes this is why they are trying to spread Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). In an X post , he asked a particular critic if they missed out on XRP when it was still trading at $0.20. Indeed, the XRP price had traded around this level in 2023 and remained stuck in the $0.50 range for most of 2024 before finally taking off in the last quarter of the year, recording a rally of over 500%. The altcoin has continued this run this year and last week rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.65. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.50, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-wont-dump-its-xrp-escrow/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY","Ripple|Altcoin|and Doubt|Bill Morgan|Coinmarketcap|escrow|fear|fud|ODL|On-Demand Liquidity|ripple|ripple news|Uncertainty|US SEC|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-23T20:00:19,"Report from Danish X Space: XRP Holders Belong in Prison","A firestorm has erupted on X following a controversial statement allegedly made during a recent ‚ÄúCoffee and Danish‚Äù Space, where a speaker reportedly said that ‚ÄúXRP people should be born in prison and have to prove their way out.‚Äù The remark was highlighted in a widely shared post by parody account Guardy, stirring outrage across the XRP community and reigniting tensions between XRP supporters and Bitcoin maximalists. A Statement That Crossed the Line? The comment marks one of the more extreme examples of tribalism within the crypto space. According to Guardy‚Äôs post, which referenced the now-infamous Space, the speaker questioned the legitimacy of XRP holders and suggested they were inherently untrustworthy. On record. #XRP people belong in prison! From the Danish space. pic.twitter.com/B3MQIU4QUN ‚Äî Guardy (PARODY?) (@GLigh7) July 22, 2025 While Guardy‚Äôs account is tagged as ‚Äúparody,‚Äù the tone and phrasing sparked immediate backlash . The strong reaction from the XRP community indicates just how sensitive and deeply polarized crypto discourse has become. XRP Community Reacts Swiftly XRP enthusiasts wasted no time responding to the alleged insult. Saul, while responding, stated, ‚Äú My biggest issue is how little sense the statement makes. It‚Äôs offensively nonsensical. XRP holders should be born in prison? What? How? One only becomes an active investor much later in life‚Äù. This was widely seen as a criticism of those who refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, particularly XRP, which has long been the target of maximalist disdain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The response from Justin Tomlin ‚Äì Imagine being such a hater that you‚Äôre willing to throw babies in prison over a digital asset‚Ä¶SMFH ‚Äì also pointed to a deeper frustration within the XRP community: the inability to have rational, informed discussions when one side is unwilling to recognize the technological or institutional relevance of anything outside of Bitcoin. A Deeper Divide: Bitcoin Maximalists vs. XRP Supporters The controversy underscores a broader, long-standing conflict between Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin is the only legitimate cryptocurrency, and supporters of projects like XRP, which offer faster, more energy-efficient solutions tailored for cross-border payments. Bitcoin has come under increasing scrutiny for its high energy consumption and scalability issues, while XRP‚Äôs value proposition lies in its speed, negligible transaction costs, and eco-friendly infrastructure. This has led to more institutional support for XRP, fueling resentment in corners of the Bitcoin community where decentralization purity tests remain the standard. XRP‚Äôs Meteoric Rise Adds Fuel to the Fire Since the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, XRP has surged by over 600%, bolstered by Ripple‚Äôs legal victories, the expansion of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, and increased adoption in financial corridors across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. As XRP gains ground, some interpret the pushback from Bitcoin maximalists as a defensive reaction to its growing credibility and influence. The uproar caused by the comment speaks volumes about the current state of crypto culture, and the divide it exposed is all too real. Parody or not, Guardy‚Äôs post tapped into an uncomfortable truth: tribalism still dominates much of the digital asset conversation.

2025-07-23T20:00:00,"Best Crypto to Buy Now: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers What Bitcoin Did in 2010 ‚Äì Life-Changing Returns","Everyone in crypto dreams of catching the next big wave. Bitcoin did it in 2010. Ethereum followed. Now, whispers across the space suggest Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) might just be the one writing the next millionaire chapter. This is not a drill. The momentum behind Bitcoin Solaris is climbing fast. Crypto insiders are watching closely. The technology, the presale, and the explosive growth potential are aligning in a way the market has not seen in years. If 2010 gave us Bitcoin‚Äôs riches, 2025 looks ready to make history again with Bitcoin Solaris. Why Bitcoin Solaris Feels Like Bitcoin in 2010 Back in 2010, Bitcoin felt like a gamble. Few could imagine it would create millionaires or reshape finance forever. Fast forward to today, and history might just be repeating itself with Bitcoin Solaris. The difference? This time, it is happening faster, with clearer tech, and with far more scalability built from the start. Bitcoin Solaris offers the kind of opportunity early Bitcoin buyers wish they could find again. This is not about waiting a decade for adoption. BTC-S is already building its infrastructure, community, and listings to hit the ground running. With mobile-first mining, blazing-fast transaction speeds, and a hybrid consensus securing the network, it is poised to deliver returns that could make 2025 feel like 2010 all over again.

A Presale Gathering Massive Attention The Bitcoin Solaris presale is entering its most critical phase. With only less than 2 weeks left and phase 12 fully underway, BTC-S is priced at $12 right now. Next phase? $13. Launch price? $20. The math here is hard to ignore. That is a potential 150% return just from securing tokens early. Over $7.7M+ raised so far. Over 15,800 unique users on board.
