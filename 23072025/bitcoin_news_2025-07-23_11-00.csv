2025-07-23T08:57:07,"Unexpected Explosion from Altcoin Awaiting Delisting! Rising Over 200%!","While the ups and downs in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins continue, one altcoin attracted attention with its big rise. At this point, the altcoin named Strike (STRIKE), which will be delisted on Upbit and Bithumb, increased despite waiting to be delisted. Accordingly, STRIKE gained 240% in value in the last two days. South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges Upbit and Bithumb announced that they will delist the STRIKE token on August 21, 2023, citing liquidity and regulatory concerns. While the delist announcement usually brings large drops in the prices of the relevant altcoins, the opposite happened for STRIKE. This situation was described as similar to a ‚Äústock market exit wave,‚Äù where the price rises before the delisting. Therefore, experts advised investors to be cautious about the STRIKE price. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Unexpected Explosion from Altcoin Awaiting Delisting!

According to the Seattle US Attorney‚Äôs Office, the money was seized by Homeland Security in December 2024, and is part of a much larger fraud that allegedly collected $97 million from investors between June 2022 and July 2024. Victims were told their money would go into oil tank storage facilities ‚Äì an investment that promised big returns. But once they sent funds, the people behind the scheme simply stopped responding. ‚ÄúThe co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,‚Äù said Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller. Funds Moved Through Russia, Nigeria, and Binance The fraud quickly turned into a global money-laundering operation . Prosecutors say victims‚Äô money was used to buy Bitcoin (BTC) , Tether (USDT) , USDC, and Ether (ETH) , and then moved through accounts connected to people in Russia and Nigeria. A large part of the stolen crypto was reportedly sent to Binance , the world‚Äôs biggest crypto exchange. One person, Geoffrey Auyeung, has already been indicted. He was charged in August 2024 for receiving most of the stolen funds and converting them into crypto. At the time of his arrest, US officials also seized $2.3 million from his bank accounts. The U.S. government is setting its sights on $7.1M in crypto, clawed back from an oil and gas investment scam. Even in the digital age, old-school scams find their new playgrounds. Always vet before you bet! #CryptoCrackdown #InvestmentScam ‚Äî Shaco AI (@Shaco_Ai) July 23, 2025 $17.9 Million Already Tracked, More Expected So far, prosecutors have identified $17.9 million in losses, but expect more victims to come forward. If the court approves the $7.1 million seizure, the total amount recovered would rise to $9.4 million, which will go toward reimbursing verified victims. Part of a Larger Crackdown Not an isolated case, actually. In recent weeks, US and international authorities have stepped up action against crypto-related fraud: OmegaPro promoters were charged in a $650 million scam. Ex-rugby player Shane Donovan Moore was sentenced for a $900,000 Ponzi scheme. In Hong Kong , police arrested four people linked to a $382,000 investor fraud. The suspected ringleader fled overseas. The US oil scam shows how easily crypto can be misused across borders but it also shows that global enforcement is catching up fast.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-could-seize-7-1m-in-crypto-from-global-oil-investment-scam/,"COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|BNB|BTC|BUSINESS","News",cryptocompare

In contrast, several altcoins have posted impressive gains over the past day, including BNB, which shot up to a new all-time high of $800. BTC Stalls at $120k After peaking beyond $123,000, the primary cryptocurrency dumped by over seven grand within a day and bottomed at just under $116,000 last week. The bulls halted the freefall at this point and didn‚Äôt allow another breakdown to take place. Just the opposite, BTC started to recover some ground and jumped to $121,000 by the end of the business week. However, it couldn‚Äôt breach that level, and despite its few attempts, each rejection resulted in a price slip to around $117,000. Following a quiet weekend, BTC jumped toward $120,000 twice on Monday and Wednesday morning, but the scenario repeated once again as profit-taking went wild . The latest rejection occurred earlier today, which drove bitcoin south to under $119,000 as of now. Consequently, bitcoin‚Äôs market cap has stalled at $2.360 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken another hit and is down to 59% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView BNB Charts New ATH The big news from the top 10 alts is BNB‚Äôs surge past $800 as the asset painted a new all-time high. This represented a 300% surge from the October 2023 lows when it dropped to $200. Elsewhere, ETH has neared $3,700 once again after a 2% daily increase, while XRP has defended the $3.45 level following a similar daily jump. SOL is close to $200 again, while XLM has added 5% of value. Even more impressive gains come from APT, ONDO, and TAO, which have all jumped by more than 7% daily. Nevertheless, the top performers are FLR and PENGU as both have shot up by more than 20% since yesterday. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has increased by over $40 billion in a day and is up to $4 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-23T08:29:24,"Chart Decoder Series: VWAP ‚Äì The Market‚Äôs Truth Detector","Welcome back to the Chart Decoder Series, where we break down the tools that separate casual traders from the pros. You‚Äôve already mastered trend identification (SMA/EMA) , momentum shifts (MACD) , overbought/oversold zones (RSI) , volatility extremes (Bollinger Bands) , and r eversal timing (Stochastic) . Now it‚Äôs time for VWAP, the indicator that cuts through the noise and tells you one simple thing: Are you overpaying? What is VWAP? VWAP stands for Volume Weighted Average Price. It shows you the average price that everyone paid today, but gives more weight to prices where lots of trading happened. If Bitcoin had a quick spike to $110,000 but only a few people bought there, while most of the day it traded around $105,000 with significant buying and selling, VWAP will be much closer to $105,000. The calculation is simple in concept: Take every trade throughout the day Multiply price √ó volume for each trade Add them all up and divide by total volume What you get is the ‚Äútrue‚Äù average price that reflects where most of the money actually changed hands. How to Read VWAP: Above VWAP = Paying More Than Most. When the price is above VWAP, you‚Äôre paying more than what most people paid today (weighted by how much they bought). This could mean: Lots of people are buying right now, driving the price up You might be buying when the price is temporarily high The price might come back down to where most people bought Below VWAP = Getting a Better Deal. When the price is below VWAP, you‚Äôre getting a better price than what most people paid today. This often means: More people are selling than buying, pushing the price down You might be getting a good deal compared to earlier buyers The price might bounce back up to where most people bought At VWAP = Paying the Average. When price trades right at VWAP, you‚Äôre paying exactly what the average person paid today, based on all the buying and selling that happened. Big traders use VWAP to benchmark their trades. This is why VWAP often acts as support or resistance ‚Äì institutional algorithms are programmed to defend these levels. Real Example: BTC/USD on Bitfinex Price: $118,940 VWAP: $118,502 Bitcoin is trading above VWAP by about $438, which puts us in mild premium territory. Trading above VWAP typically signals bullish momentum. It means that the average buyer in this session is in profit, a strong indicator that demand is currently outweighing supply. However, the premium isn‚Äôt excessive, suggesting the move is still measured rather than euphoric. A few dynamics might be at play: Buyers are in control , but not aggressively so. It‚Äôs a sign of healthy, steady accumulation. VWAP may act as dynamic support . Should the price retrace, the VWAP line around $118,502 could be a level where buyers step back in. No clear discount is present at the moment. Traders looking for bargain entries may want to wait for a potential retest of VWAP. In short, Bitcoin is currently in a balanced but bullish posture , and traders may want to watch how price behaves around VWAP to gauge whether this move has more legs ‚Äî or if it‚Äôs time for a breather. VWAP + Other Indicators: The Power Combo VWAP works even better when combined with other tools: VWAP + RSI : If price is above VWAP and RSI is showing overbought, that‚Äôs a strong signal you might be buying at a temporary peak. VWAP + Volume: When price approaches VWAP with increasing volume, it often signals a significant level. Big players might be defending or testing this ‚Äúfair value‚Äù line. VWAP + Support/Resistance: VWAP often acts as dynamic support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends. It‚Äôs like a moving floor or ceiling based on where the real trading happened. Looking at our BTC example: With price below VWAP at $111,080 vs $111,321, if we see strong buying volume as BTC approaches VWAP from below, that could signal institutional interest in defending the ‚Äúfair value‚Äù line. Bonus Read: VWAP + RSI Power Combo Price: $118,940 VWAP: $118,502 RSI: 66.11 This indicates Bitcoin is in bullish momentum but approaching overbought territory (RSI above 70 is typically considered overbought) This setup is particularly interesting: While the technical indicators are clearly bullish, the RSI‚Äôs proximity to overbought territory suggests that traders should remain alert for potential pullbacks or consolidation periods. The VWAP level at $118,502 could serve as an important support zone if the price does decide to retrace from current levels. Overall, this combination of price action above VWAP paired with healthy RSI momentum creates a bullish environment for Bitcoin, though the approaching overbought conditions suggest that any upside moves should be monitored carefully for signs of momentum exhaustion. Pro Tips for Using VWAP: 1. VWAP Resets Daily Unlike moving averages that look back a set number of periods, VWAP resets at the start of each trading day. This makes it perfect for day trading and short-term decisions. 2. Don‚Äôt Fight Strong VWAP Trends If the price is consistently above VWAP with strong volume, that‚Äôs often a sign of genuine strength. The market is saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre willing to pay premium prices.‚Äù 3. VWAP Touches Are Golden When price dips down to touch VWAP and bounces, it‚Äôs often an excellent entry point. The market is testing fair value and finding buyers. 4. Watch for VWAP Breaks If price has been above VWAP all day then suddenly breaks below with volume, it might signal a shift in sentiment. The ‚Äúfair value‚Äù line has been breached. 5. Use Multiple Timeframes Daily VWAP: Shows you the big picture fair value Hourly VWAP: Helps with precise entry/exit timing Weekly VWAP: Gives you the longer-term institutional perspective VWAP Limitations: What You Need to Know While VWAP is a powerful tool, understanding its limitations is crucial: Volume Dependency: VWAP needs healthy trading volume to be meaningful. In low-volume markets or during off-hours, it may not accurately reflect true fair value. Lagging Nature: During extreme volatility, VWAP can lag behind price movements, potentially giving outdated information when you need it most. Short-Term Focus: VWAP resets daily, making it primarily useful for intraday trading rather than long-term investment decisions. Not Predictive : VWAP shows what happened, not what will happen. Don‚Äôt assume the price will always return to VWAP. Sometimes breakouts are genuine and sustained.
