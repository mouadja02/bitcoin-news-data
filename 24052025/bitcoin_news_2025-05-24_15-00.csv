Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Gains Traction The Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill got a major boost when Governor Greg Abbott endorsed SB 21 on May 22. SB 21 passed the Texas House recently and proposes creating a state Bitcoin reserve. Abbott’s support, in line with his goal to make Texas a crypto hub by 2024, puts the state alongside Arizona and New Hampshire in pro-crypto legislation.

A state-driven Bitcoin reserve would give investors a lot of confidence, and this could be the catalyst for BTC to break past $110K. Crackdown on Crypto Scams Boosts Market Confidence On May 23, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that $2.5 million in stolen cryptocurrencies has been recovered from scams targeting FOMO investors. The FBI’s San Diego branch coordinated the recovery, which was ordered by a federal judge. \""A large number of validators identified the addresses with the stolen funds and are ignoring transactions on those addresses until further notice.\"" HUH? pic.twitter.com/pTbywpBT5k — JSHy | Josh Marchand (@JSHyCS) May 22, 2025 These scams preyed on inexperienced investors with promises of high returns. The recovery highlights the government’s growing efforts to clean up the crypto market. These regulatory crackdowns, with the help of firms like Tether, will increase public trust in digital assets. As transparency and enforcement rise, the crypto market becomes more attractive and could fuel Bitcoin’s rise. Institutional Adoption Soars with Semler’s $50M Bitcoin Buy And to top it all off, Semler Scientific bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing their total holdings to 455 BTC, now worth $474.4 million.

Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin buying is part of a bigger trend of companies treating BTC as a treasury asset. This increases market stability by bringing in more institutions and reducing supply—something that could push prices up. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as on the 2-hour chart, BTC has a higher-low pattern supported by the 50-period EMA ($108,470) and the trendline from $105,905–$107,048. Resistance is at $109,613 (23.6% Fibonacci) and a breakout could go to $111,935 or $113,478. Look for bullish candlestick patterns like three white soldiers or RSI divergence to confirm the uptrend. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the BTC/USD pair hovers near $108K, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-24T12:30:49.000Z,"CZ Slams WSJ For Anti-Crypto ‘Hit Piece’, Denies Being WLFI’s ‘Fixer’","Binance co-founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has accused The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of targeting him and the crypto industry, alleging that “forces” in the US are attempting to hinder the country’s effort to develop the sector. CZ Denies ‘Fixer’ Claims On Friday, Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, criticized The WSJ for another alleged anti-crypto “hit piece.” The Binance co-founder took X to express his disappointment in the news media outlet for resorting to “Cunningham’s Law, with negative intentions” instead of “doing journalism.” Zhao explained that, a few days ago, The WSJ contacted him through the PR team, asking “a long list of questions with wrong and negative assumptions.” The questions reportedly had “numerous inaccuracies and unfounded inferences” that Zhao’s team pointed out. The WSJ article alleged that Zhao helped “facilitate” some introductions for the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) crypto venture’s foreign travel, naming one of the company’s co-founders, Zach Witkoff. A spokesman for WLFI affirmed that Zhao and Zach Witkoff are friends, but the Binance founder “doesn’t act as a fixer.” In response to these claims, CZ shared a snippet from the original questions sent to him, which affirmed that he was a “fixer” for the WLFI co-founder: “ We understand that CZ has been serving as effectively a fixer for Zach Witkoff and the WLF team in their foreign travels … In recent months, CZ has met with government officials from Pakistan, Malaysia and Kyrgyzstan … We understand that CZ then connected Mr Saqib with the World Liberty Financial team, and a week later after his visit, World Liberty named Mr Saqib an adviser. On April 26, the WLF team arrived in Pakistan to sign a MoU with the government. ” Zhao denied making any introductions for World Liberty’s foreign travels, stating, “I am not a fixer for anyone. I did NOT ‘connect Mr. Saqib with the WLF team’”. He explained that Witkoff and Mr. Saqib already knew each other, unlike him, who only “met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Forces ‘Target’ US Crypto Industry The Binance founder considers that forces in the US are trying to “hinder efforts in making the US the capital of crypto,” attempting to attack the industry, its global leaders, and the pro-crypto administration. The “WSJ is just the mouthpiece,” he affirmed. For context, the report raised concerns regarding the “extraordinary blurring of government negotiations and private business dealings,” claiming that it is “rewriting the diplomatic playbook for some foreign countries looking to gain traction with the new Trump administration.” The WSJ argued that father-and-son duo Steve Witkoff and Zach Witkoff have potentially helped blur the lines of private business and public duties of the current administration, highlighting World Liberty Financial’s (WLFI) recent deal to enable MGX’s $2 billion investment . WLFI’s spokesman, David Wachsman, told The WSJ that the company’s business deals have nothing to do with the US government, affirming that the company “wouldn’t even have the ability or insight to discuss official government business.” He added that “attempting to frame WLFI and Ambassador Witkoff taking meetings in the same country as some sort of conflict of interest” is incorrect. Notably, Steve Witkoff is the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, and one of WLFI’s co-founders alongside his son. The WSJ also noted a previous article that claimed the elder Witkoff was allegedly involved in the talks between the Trump family and Binance. As reported by Bitcoinist, the article stated that representatives of US President Donald Trump’s family have held talks to acquire a financial stake in Binance US since 2024. This was part of the global exchange’s alleged plan to return to the US and obtain an official pardon for its former CEO. However, CZ denied the “deal for a pardon” allegations, stating, “The WSJ article got the facts wrong.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/cz-slams-wsj-for-anti-crypto-hit-piece-denies-being-wlfis-fixer/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Binance co-founder|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Changpeng Zhao|Crypto Market|CZ|Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial|Steve Witkoff|The WSJ|US crypto industry|US President Trump|WLFI|Zach Witkoff",cryptocompare

Krüger tells his 210,500 followers on the social media platform X that he is expecting Bitcoin to hit $120,000 in June. According to the widely followed economist and trader, the proposed distribution of approximately $5 billion to creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX at the end of May will serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Krüger thinks that the funds will re-enter the crypto market as the creditors will mostly be the large claim holders. But the economist warns that Bitcoin could turn bearish in early July amid the uncertainty caused by the dispute over tariffs. “The 90-day tariffs pause *could* be a significant bearish catalyst. That’s on July 9th. Depending on White House news flow, it makes sense for markets to start getting anxious about tariffs again two to three weeks before then.” In contrast with Krüger’s largely bullish view of Bitcoin over the short term, crypto analyst Justin Bennett says the flagship digital asset could drop below $100,000 after failing to convincingly take out its last resistance at around $110,000. “No change to this BTC analysis other than starting to break down. I shorted at $111,269. I’ll add below $106,000 if we get it. Looking for $96,000/$97,000.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $107,435 at time of writing, down from the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached earlier this week.

Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

US House members call for investigation into Trump's memecoin dinner Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” The call for an investigation and a press conference asking Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner both occurred hours before the event, which was held at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. A group of protesters, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, gathered outside the venue with signs stating “illegal crypto party” and “democracy is not for sale.”",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-24T12:22:03.000Z,"Bitcoin or Gold? Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice","The post Bitcoin or Gold? Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The age-old debate between Bitcoin and gold is heating up again and economist Peter Schiff wants to weigh in. In a recent X post , Schiff, a staunch Bitcoin critic, spotlighted the growing trend of central banks worldwide stocking gold reserves, strengthening their timeless value amid global economic uncertainty. With geopolitical uncertainties, crypto scams, and shifting economic policies moving demand, Schiff claims gold’s stability, Trump’s pro-crypto policies, and Bitcoin’s volatility, sparking fresh discussion among investors. Why Central Banks Are Choosing Gold Over Bitcoin In Schiff’s latest commentary, he took a direct jab at Bitcoin advocates by asking: If Bitcoin is the future, why are central banks betting on gold to replace the dollar? That question cuts to the heart of an ongoing shift in the global financial system. With fears of U.S. dollar devaluation and escalating geopolitical risks, foreign central banks are turning to gold – not crypto – as their hedge. According to a Reuters report, central banks are now buying more than 1,000 metric tons of gold annually – double the average of the previous decade. And the momentum isn’t slowing down. Michael Widmer, a strategist at Bank of America, says emerging market central banks currently hold just 10% of their reserves in gold but should be targeting 30% for greater financial protection. Trump, Tariffs, and the Rise of Gold Demand Peter Schiff also ties this growing demand for gold to the current U.S. administration. With President Donald Trump back in office and pushing aggressive tariff policies, countries are looking to shield their economies from potential fallout. As the dollar weakens, the appeal of gold rises. And in times of uncertainty – from trade wars to banking collapses – central banks want assets that stand the test of time. Russia Leads the Gold Playbook Russia has been ahead of the curve. Between 2014 and 2020 , the Russian central bank hoarded gold to buffer itself from Western sanctions. Today, its Ministry of Finance is reportedly continuing that accumulation – buying from domestic producers and quietly strengthening reserves. This playbook is being adopted by other emerging economies as well, reinforcing Schiff’s argument that gold’s legacy value is far from obsolete. So, if Bitcoin truly is the future, why aren’t central banks buying it? Bitcoin’s Volatility vs. Gold’s Stability Schiff didn’t stop at praising gold. He also took a swing at Bitcoin’s unpredictability. He warned that American investors – who collectively hold nearly half of all Bitcoin – may be in for a rude awakening as the price swings continue and global institutions remain cautious. At the time of writing, gold trades at $3,357.4 per ounce, up 1.82% for the day but slightly down over the month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is priced at $108,148 – down 2.31% in the last 24 hours, though it’s seen a 17% jump over the month. Despite the short-term surge, Schiff argues that Bitcoin lacks the long-term security central banks crave. Ran Neuner Weighs In: Could Bitcoin Still Outshine Gold? Not everyone agrees with Schiff’s stance. CNBC’s Ran Neuner recently suggested that Bitcoin could outperform gold in the long run as a safe-haven asset – especially amid advancements in blockchain tech and increasing institutional adoption. But Schiff remains skeptical. He also criticized the growing use of stablecoins in the U.S., pointing to the regulatory fog. Will Schiff’s predictions hold as the crypto space evolves?

The flagship cryptocurrency dropped nearly 4% on Friday, plunging to a low of $106,816 before rebounding to current levels. BTC is down over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $108,200. Bitcoin (BTC) And Altcoins Register Sharp Decline Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $106,816 on Friday, erasing substantial gains made earlier this week. The crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market as futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell over 1%, continuing a sell-off that began on Monday. The crypto market retreated as trade war concerns emerged after a Truth Social post in which President Trump said trade talks with the EU were going nowhere and warned of a 50% tariff on all goods from the region. The statement escalated trade tensions at a time when markets were hoping for a deal between the trade partners. The EU has hinted it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. Ryanair’s CEO has already warned the company is considering canceling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes are hit by tariffs. The trade war concerns return a week after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating and as the House of Representatives voted on the “Big Beautiful Bill” which will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Strong Inflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a total of $2.75 billion in inflows this week as Bitcoin surged past $110,000 and set a new all-time high. The inflows were almost 4.5 times larger than the previous week’s inflows of $608 million, according to data from Farside. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $211 million on May 23. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund that posted gains during the trading day, adding $430 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days. Meanwhile, Grayscale saw outflows of $89 million, while ARK21 Shares saw outflows worth $73.9 million. Only two days prior, Bitcoin ETFs registered $607 million in inflows, the same day the flagship cryptocurrency surged past its previous all-time high. However, BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as market sentiment declined. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin is not showing any signs of overheating despite surging to a new all-time high, indicating the price could rise higher. An analyst from CryptoQuant stated, “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 as it finally crossed the $110,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency consolidated around higher levels as it entered a price discovery phase after crossing into uncharted territory. Analysts expected BTC to continue its uptrend and push towards $115,000 and possibly $120,000. However, markets turned bearish on Friday after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union after posting on Truth Social that trade talks with Europe were not going anywhere. The EU also threatened retaliatory tariffs as trade war tensions resurfaced, panicking markets. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency plunged nearly 4% on Friday, falling to an intraday low of $106,816. BTC traded in a narrow range between $100,000 and $105,000 as buyers struggled to build momentum. The price declined 1.04% on Monday (May 12), before rebounding on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. The price fell back into the red on Wednesday after a marginal decline and settled at $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, the price rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. BTC continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,582. However, price action turned bearish on Friday as markets plunged. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. The current session sees BTC up almost 1% as it looks to build momentum and reclaim $110,000.

Prices jumped past $109,000, a high not seen since January. Bitcoin even touched $111,980 on May 22. Investors piled in as the rally took hold. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge According to Farside data, spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $2.75 billion this week, up sharply from $608 million the week before. That big jump came as Bitcoin pushed past its January all-time high of $109,000. On May 21, investors added $607 million, the same day Bitcoin hit a new peak. Then, on May 22, the coin soared to $111,980. Those moves show money chasing fresh highs. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Flows Based on reports, ETF flows on May 23 totaled just $212 million, but BlackRock’s IBIT was the only one in the green. It brought in $431 million all by itself, and that stretched its inflow streak to eight days straight. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw $89 million leave, and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost $74 million. Investors seem to favor the low fees and wide reach of the biggest funds. Market Sentiment Pulls Back Bitcoin’s climb paused a bit after that. At publication, it traded near $108,150. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 down to 66, or “Greed.” That dip hints at some profit-taking. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said on May 22 that “overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” His view is that this rally hasn’t been driven by risky bets. Related Reading: XRP’s $5 Dream Ride Hinges On This One Chart Setup – Analyst Record Monthly Inflows In Sight So far in May, spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in about $5.40 billion. The previous monthly high came in November 2024, when ETFs took in $6.50 billion. With five trading days left in May, inflows could set a new mark. That steady demand underlines how ETFs have become the go-to way for many to own Bitcoin without wrestling with wallets and private keys. Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has grown fast. Investors like simple, regulated products. The big issuers, led by BlackRock, have the best chance to stay on top. As for Bitcoin itself, if sentiment cools, prices might pull back some.

2025-05-24T11:53:34.000Z,"Expert sets date when Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025","After Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high this week, a trading expert believes the asset is on track for even greater gains, possibly reaching $200,000 in 2025. According to an analysis by TradingShot , historical trends and technical setups suggest that Bitcoin might reach the $200,000 mark toward the end of this year, as per a May 23 TradingView post . Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In the outlook, TradingShot emphasized that Bitcoin is currently experiencing its weakest bull cycle to date, a natural consequence of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM). This theory posits that as markets mature, the magnitude of returns tends to slow. While Bitcoin’s earlier cycles witnessed explosive growth, more recent ones have been comparatively moderate yet notable. To illustrate this, TradingShot overlaid Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles (2009–2011, 2012–2013, 2015–2017, 2019–2021). The comparison revealed a transition from aggressive early growth to a more consistent pattern, resembling movements in traditional financial markets. Interestingly, the 2015 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 cycles showed similar upward paths, with temporary divergences eventually returning to the broader trend. Bitcoin tracking past cycles Looking ahead, the ongoing cycle appears to be tracking within an upward channel. After a projected divergence in February 2025, Bitcoin is expected to realign with its historical trend. The recent six-week rebound further supports this outlook. Based on these patterns, TradingShot forecasts that Bitcoin’s cycle peak will likely occur between October and December 2025, with a potential price range of $150,000 to $200,000. “Based on past cycles, it should be within October – December 2025. Timing your exit strategy can perhaps be more effective than assigning a certain Target, even though the peak is expected to be anywhere within the $150k – $200k range,” the expert said. It’s worth noting that, after surpassing a new record high above $111,000, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin could maintain this momentum in the coming weeks. For instance, as reported by Finbold, veteran trader Peter Brandt stated that following this breakout, Bitcoin’s technical formation indicates the possibility of reaching $150,000 by August 2025. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Gert van Lagen made another bullish projection. In a May 24 post on X, he explained that Bitcoin has historically followed a clear exponential path, rising from $1 to over $100,000 through recurring bullish patterns such as cup-and-handle formations. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView He emphasized that if history repeats itself, the real peak could be three to six times higher than current levels, noting that Bitcoin’s rise isn’t just linear; it’s compounding. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,811, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. However, on a weekly basis, the asset has climbed more than 5%.

The SkyBridge Capital founder, who’s now penning a book titled Solana Rising , believes traditional finance is on the brink of a major upgrade, with Solana at the core. Bold claims but he’s backing it up with research, interviews with Wall Street CTOs, and conversations with Solana’s own Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Here’s what you should know. A $7 Trillion Problem, and Solana’s Fix Scaramucci pointed to a staggering figure: nearly $7 trillion is spent globally on transaction verification . That inefficiency, he argues, is ripe for disruption. Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure could cut those costs dramatically – something no traditional system has managed to do. “Think of Solana as the operating layer for real-world assets, in the same way Bitcoin is for money,” he said. Scaramucci sees Solana becoming one of the major financial rails for real-world asset tokenization. We’re talking from stocks to bonds and everything in between. On-Chain IPOs Could Break the Banking Barrier Here’s one of the boldest promises. IPOs that don’t require a bank account. “You don’t need a bank account to buy an IPO on-chain, just a wallet,” Scaramucci said. He compared blockchain-powered IPOs to traditional offerings that can rack up 7% in fees, arguing Solana’s system could offer the same functionality at a fraction of the cost, with much broader access. Institutional Adoption Is “Inevitable” Despite ongoing regulatory friction, Scaramucci insists big players are circling. He called out JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon as a cautious example, predicting major institutions will eventually custody and offer yield-bearing strategies using Solana and other Layer-1 assets. “Solana will be part of a financial system where you not only stake, but also lend your assets – earning yield like you would in traditional finance,” he added. SkyBridge is already working on such strategies. “Make Everyone an Investor” Scaramucci isn’t the only one highly bullish on Solana and its potential. Earlier this week, Solana Foundation’s Akshay BD laid out a broader vision: universal micro-ownership through tokenization . The current financial model, he argued, locks out most retail investors. “Solana could make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time,” he said – especially in a world where low bond yields and overvalued markets leave few appealing options. Here’s the bottom line: Solana is not a niche project anymore. It’s gunning for Wall Street. And if the industry signals are anything to go by, the shift might be here soon.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/solana-will-replace-banks-for-ipos-says-skybridge-founder-scaramucci/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|SOL","News",cryptocompare

Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana was on its way to rise above the $185 resistance zone after the recent rebound from the local support below $170. Moreover, the star token, Bitcoin, making new highs above $111.8K, was believed to trigger the rest of the altcoins as well. While Ethereum made an entry above $2700 and Cardano surged above $0.82, it appeared that the bearish influence over the token could have faded to a large extent. Meanwhile, the increase in bearish activity, which dragged the BTC price below $107K , seems to have hindered the SOL price rally as well, which is now struggling to reach $180. Currently, the SOL price is down by more than 6% after touching the price zone between $180 and $190. Meanwhile, the token triggered a strong rebound from the local support close to $170 and is trying hard to push higher with renewed momentum. The recent rebound signals an increase in the buy-side interest that has triggered a recovery swing. Meanwhile, despite the pullback, the price remained within the pattern, which keeps the upside potential higher. In the long term, the SOL price remains within the rising wedge, while in the short term, the token is heading towards the end of the apex of the ascending triangle. However, the bulls have been prevented from reaching the lower support of the consolidation. The stochRSI has reached the lower support and is about to trigger a bullish reversal, while the MACD, which remains within a positive range, shows a drop in the selling pressure. Therefore, the Solana price is expected to maintain a healthy consolidation within the triangle for some more time, but along the upper resistance. The token is further believed to trigger a breakout before the end of the month and secure the range around $190. Although rising above $200 appears to be a tedious job for the SOL price, it may surely clear the barriers to reaching the range. With this, the Solana price prediction for 2025 remains bullish, with a possibility to rise and reach new highs above $500.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-solana-break-the-180-resistance-heres-what-sol-price-will-be-worth-in-2025/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

The sudden dip prompted huge liquidations in crypto futures markets totaling over $560 million. According to Coinglass figures, the decline resulted in the liquidation of 160,905 traders on major exchanges, with longs taking most of the loss. Breakdown of Liquidated Positions All $563.20 million worth of liquidated positions were dominated by longs, which took up $418.63 million. Shorts made up the remaining $144.35 million. The biggest single liquidation order was a BTC-USDT on OKX for $9.53 million. Bitcoin traders were hit the hardest, with liquidations of $153.04 million, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $144.19 million. Most of the liquidations in both assets took place on long positions. Trump’s Trade War Threat Spooks Market Further The price decline was followed by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he threatened to impose more tariffs on the European Union and Apple. The action spooked markets, especially risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ETH fell from $2,731 highs to $2,508 lows, before rebounding to $2,574. The broader market reacted similarly, which highlights crypto’s sensitivity to geopolitical and macroeconomic signals. Relative Strength of Bitcoin Still Intact Followed by the volatility, Bitcoin’s breakout above $109K is still an indicator of strength. Having broken its prior ATH in November, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration, BTC has been resilient despite market volatility. This resiliency is likely driven by the growing perception of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Institutional and retail investors both increasingly view BTC as an inflation hedge and acceptable replacement in the case of macro instability. Conclusion The recent wave of liquidations confirms the risk-on nature of crypto markets. Yet, the relative resilience of Bitcoin indicates its evolving role as a safe-haven asset amid escalating global tensions.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-drops-from-111k-ath-triggering-560m/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

The high-stakes meeting is part of the country’s move to establish itself as a regional hub for blockchain and AI. In addition, it is also part of a bigger strategy to harness the youthful demographic and surplus energy in the country as a tool for digital finance and, by extension, economic transformation. In attendance at the high-level meeting at the General Headquarters were Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and Bilal Bin Saqib, Chief Executive of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC). The pair discussed the potential of emerging technologies, with a focus on leveraging blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI to empower its youth and build economic reliance. Pakistan holds meeting to discuss blockchain and AI In the meeting , Bin Saqib, the chief executive of the PCC, mentioned that digital finance and decentralization offer the country countless opportunities and not threats. “The [PCC] exists because our youth demand a seat at the global tech table,” Saqib said at the meeting. The meeting is coming off the back of efforts to accelerate the regulatory framework of these emerging technologies in the country. The Ministry of Finance, on Wednesday, announced the formation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a body that has been dedicated and tasked with overseeing blockchain infrastructure and the regulation of digital assets in the country. The move marks a major step towards formalizing a market that has been estimated to witness more than $300 billion in annual crypto trading volume. According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the PDAA would be in charge of creating a secure, innovative, and inclusive ecosystem that will house digital assets. He also added that it will ensure that Pakistan is ranked high alongside other regional leaders in digital finance and blockchain regulation. He also added that the initiative will birth the facilitation of tokenization of public assets and government debt, regulate Bitcoin mining using surplus electricity, and provide legal clarity for global investors. A renewed shift towards a tech-led growth model The announcement signals a boost in the country’s shift towards a tech-led growth model. With about 70% of its 240 million population under the age of 30, Pakistan has one of the most favored demographics for digital adoption. It ranks among the top five countries globally in terms of crypto usage. In addition, the country ranks as the world’s third-largest freelancer market, with more than 50,000 IT graduates entering the workforce every year. During the meeting, Saqib discussed the recent PCC initiatives with the military leadership, including a global outreach with Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. It also discussed its exploits with World Liberty Financial, a decentralized platform that has links with United States President Donald Trump. He also mentioned the youth-first policy that the group has been looking into, emphasizing the need to channel the country’s tech-savvy workforce into scalable blockchain solutions and AI infrastructure. Some of the national strategies being looked into include allocating surplus electricity to power Bitcoin mining rigs and data centers. The meeting came before Saqib’s participation at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, where he is set to speak alongside other influential figures such as United States Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr. The event is expected to shape the future narratives on global crypto governance.

2025-05-24T11:10:00.000Z,"Could this new DeFi token revolutionize the financial world","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most revolutionary DeFi projects of 2025. Still in the presale phase, it has grown into a juggernaut that is pulling in investors from all other major projects, such as XRP and Solana. So far, the project has attracted nearly 11,000 investors and over $9 million in funding, which will act as the fuel that takes it to the next level. The presale is currently in phase 5, with each token going for $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. However, even those who invest $1000 in the project right now are guaranteed a 100% return, with the listing price set at $0.06. Driven by the crypto market’s demand for utility, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hitting milestones way ahead of schedule, and after the final pre-sale phase, the token is expected to go live on some big crypto exchanges. Will Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 10X in value? The short answer is yes; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most valuable DeFi projects in recent memory. A major driver of this growth is the project’s utility, which promises to create numerous opportunities for investors to earn passive income from their assets. For instance, a user can deposit $8,000 worth of ETH and then sit back as their investment earns an annual percentage yield. The yield from each pool will be determined automatically by the utilization rate, which will ensure that investors get the most out of their earnings. Best of all, once they are ready to withdraw, they will get back the interest accrued plus all their initial capital. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart from other existing DeFi projects is that lenders also get a share of the platform’s revenue. This is done through a simple process of buy back and return, where revenue is used to buy MUTM tokens from the market, and send them to lenders. The effect is that it increases the value of MUTM tokens on the open market, while also incentivizing new participants to join the ecosystem. Based on this massive utility, it is quite easy to see how MUTM tokens could see a 10X increase in value just a few days after launch. That means that a $1000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could turn into $10,000 in just a few weeks, or even days. Currently, even Bitcoin (BTC) cannot offer such returns. The reason for this is that Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at the top of the market, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buyers will be getting in on the ground floor. Like the original Bitcoin (BTC) buyers who bought the tokens back in 2010 when they were worth just a few dollars, Mutuum Finance (MTM) has the potential to increase in value by 1000% in just a few weeks after launch. Join the $100K giveaway During the ongoing presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a giveaway during which they plan to reward their community with $100K worth of MUTM tokens. These tokens will be split amongst 10 winners, with each getting $10K. To get these rewards, you submit your wallet address, complete the simple quiz, and follow all steps to win the tokens. To be part of this giveaway, you will need to participate in the presale with at least $50 in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. For most investors in the presale, this is a shoo-in, as most have invested $1000 or more to maximize the possible returns when the project goes live. While there are many crypto projects to choose from, few offer the same level of utility and guaranteed returns as those available via Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with the added benefit of a potential $10K win, there is no reason to be left out of this opportunity.

2025-05-24T11:00:33.000Z,"Smart Money Moves: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Bitcoin Are Leading the 2025 Portfolio Rotations","As Bitcoin’s historic rally above $111,000 cements its role as the market’s anchor, a new wave of capital rotation is underway. The spotlight is shifting toward altcoins with asymmetric upside—and smart money is zeroing in on MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano as the breakout contenders for 2025, while Ethereum and XRP remain core holdings for stability and long-term growth. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Standout With Explosive Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly ascending from under-the-radar presale to headline contender. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, MAGA’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has become a magnet for both retail and institutional capital. Analysts are forecasting 25x–35x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum holds. A recent $132,000+ whale buy highlights the conviction behind MAGA’s breakout potential, and with a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Cardano: Technological Progress and Institutional Momentum Cardano (ADA) is making headlines with its breakout above $0.80, driven by technological innovation and expanding DeFi adoption. Analysts see potential for ADA to reach as high as $5.66 in 2025, citing upgrades like Hydra and growing institutional interest as key drivers. Cardano’s scientific approach and robust ecosystem are earning it a spot in the portfolios of forward-looking investors. As capital rotates into high-upside plays, many ADA holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to maximize portfolio growth. This strategic shift underscores the appetite for early-stage opportunities with exponential potential. Bitcoin: Institutional Adoption Fuels the Next Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 is powered by unprecedented institutional inflows and spot ETF demand, with projections of $118,000–$131,000 in the near term and $200,000 as a plausible target for 2025. While BTC remains the benchmark for digital assets, its ROI potential is now more modest compared to emerging altcoins. As Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes, a growing share of capital is rotating toward high-multiple opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more compelling for growth-focused investors. Ethereum and XRP: Steady Anchors, But MAGA Steals the Show Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade between $2,500 and $2,600, anchoring DeFi and Web3 innovation. While ETH’s momentum has moderated, its upgrade cycle and institutional adoption keep it a portfolio mainstay. XRP is holding near $2.40–$2.65, buoyed by whale accumulation, ETF speculation, and regulatory clarity. Although both assets offer stability, the most aggressive capital is now flowing into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where analysts see a 13,000%–18,500% window for exponential returns. NEAR: Quiet Growth Amid the Rotation NEAR Protocol is quietly gaining traction, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 10x–50x winner. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion The 2025 crypto cycle is defined by a decisive shift in capital allocation. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP provide a stable foundation, the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and Cardano—where early-stage momentum and technological progress are driving the next wave of portfolio rotations. With Stage 8 of MAGA’s presale nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers, smart money is already positioning for what could be the most transformative altcoin run of the year.

Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

2025-05-24T10:37:17.000Z,"ApeCoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will APE recover?","Key takeaways: Our ApeCoin price predictions anticipate a high of $1.59 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6434 Market cap $484.52M Trading volume $43.60M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.7008 24-hour low $0.6392 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 18/30 (60%) 50-day SMA $0.5365 200-day SMA $0.7613 Sentiment Neutral Green days 18/30 (60%) APE price analysis: APE begins descent At the time of writing (May 24), APE’s price rose by 27.49% in one week and dropped by 8.72% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.65. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume rose by 14.24% in 24 hours, showing rising interest from traders. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APE/USD 1-day price chart APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. It started recovering this month as it rose above $0.65. The MACD histogram shows that the price is experiencing negative momentum as it falls. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APE/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s recovery as it rose above $0.65. It registered continuous bullish candles that saw it reverse from a new all-time low that it recorded on 7 April at $0.345. At current levels, it registers little volatility with rising negative momentum.

APE price analysis shows the market has had little activity in the last few days, and bears have started to gain control. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or for settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction May 2025 The APE April price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $1.15, with an average of $0.69.

APE historic price sentiment ApeCoin price HISTORY Yuga Labs founded the ApeDAO in 2022. 62% of the tokens were given to the ApeDAO. 15% to BAYC and MAYC NFT holders, 16% to Yuga Labs, 14% to launch contributors, and 8% to BAYC founders. APE was distributed and began trading on March 17, 2022, at $7.26. The year 2022 closed with APE trading at $3. It remained bearish for the first three quarters of 2023. In October, it had dropped to $1.09. The crypto market sentiment changed in October as institutional interest in electronically traded funds rose. As the global crypto market cap broke above $2 trillion, APE broke above $2. The bull run continued in 2024, pushing APE as high as $2.43. The market started reversing afterward, and by June, it had fallen below $1. It crossed into August trading at $0.71. In September, it rose to $0.87 but later corrected falling to the $0.67 mark in October. After the launch of the Apechain, APE pumped, rising above $1 in November and peaking at $2.17 in early December, after which it started correcting. It crossed into 2025 trading at the $1.20 mark. It then assumed a bear run, and by February, it had fallen below $0.70 and $0.50 in April. It recovered in May, rising above $0.65.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apecoin-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|OTHER|RESEARCH|APE","Crypto Price Predictions|APE",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T10:35:39.000Z,"Bulls Target $110K Ahead of $13.8 Billion Bitcoin Options Expiry","Bitcoin faces its largest monthly options expiry on May 30, with open interest totalling $13.8 billion. Bulls hope to keep spot above $110,000 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in in-the-money call options. Put sellers were caught off guard by BTC’s 25% rally over the past month, leaving 95% of bearish strikes below $109,000. Futures Positioning Despite a hefty $79 billion in futures open interest, bears risk a short squeeze if prices grind higher. Efforts to nudge BTC below $105,000 would reduce bulls’ theoretical profit, but strong ETF inflows limit downside momentum. Scenario Analysis Derivatives platform Laevitas estimates that a $107k–$110k settlement would hand call buyers roughly $3.35 billion in edge. A close north of $110k could expand that advantage to $4.7 billion, potentially fuelling an immediate push to fresh highs. Macro Wildcard Tariff rhetoric remains the joker in the deck. Analysts warn that renewed trade tensions could revive risk aversion and sap crypto liquidity, just as they did during the May 23 flash drop.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bulls-target-110k-ahead-of-13-8-billion-bitcoin-options-expiry/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T10:32:46.000Z,"Top Crypto Presale: Nexchain is Leading the Crypto ICO List 2025","The post Top Crypto Presale: Nexchain is Leading the Crypto ICO List 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Finding the best presale to purchase before the next bull cycle bursts is every investor’s fantasy. As new tokens enter the market, only a few stand out for their real-world value, creative technology, and ambition that goes beyond hype. Nexchain is at the top of the presale list. Its AI-powered blockchain infrastructure and smart contract innovations are redefining what a Layer-1 network is capable of. Investors have taken note, and it is already at the top of the crypto ICO list for 2025. At a presale price of just $0.054, the chance is as good as ever. As Bitcoin reaches new highs and cryptocurrency sentiment grows optimistic, Nexchain is gaining traction quickly. It’s more than simply another presale; it’s a fundamental protocol with long-term expansion potential. Experience Revolutionary Revenue Sharing for NEX Token Holders Nexchain isn’t simply improving blockchain technology; it’s also changing the way wealth is distributed across the ecosystem. NEX token holders have access to a daily revenue-sharing mechanism in which 10% of all collected gas fees are paid to the community. As long as your tokens are maintained in a non-custodial wallet, you will receive your half without having to do anything. This is not a gimmick; it is a reflection of Nexchain’s profound dedication to justice, transparency, and decentralized progress. With an estimated price increase from $0.054 to $0.30, the $NEX token is becoming more than just a utility—it’s a passive income producer in a rapidly growing AI-powered blockchain ecosystem. Nexchain has positioned itself not just as one of the year’s best crypto presales, but also as the benchmark for how blockchain should work in 2025, by integrating cutting-edge technology, financial incentives, and a community-first strategy. Nexchain is not just a solid selection for investors wanting to purchase and keep in current bull market; it is also the wisest move on the board. Other Presales Making Waves in 2025 While Nexchain leads every top cryptocurrency ICO list this year, other presales are also creating interest. Solaxy is carving out a niche in renewable energy tokenization by exposing consumers to sustainable energy infrastructure via blockchain-backed assets. It offers eco-conscious investors a means to balance financial development and environmental damage. Then there’s BTC BULL, a derivative currency that follows leveraged Bitcoin moves. With BTC at all-time highs, BTC BULL provides traders with an aggressive way to magnify gains during market rises. These ideas demonstrate how diversified the 2025 presale scene has evolved, encompassing AI-enhanced infrastructure, renewable energy, and leveraged financial products. However, few of these choices provide the whole package that Nexchain does: passive income, improved security, cross-chain support, and AI-driven efficiency. While there is worth in investigating these alternative presales, Nexchain remains the clear choice for long-term value and utility-driven growth. Nexchain Sets the Bar as the Best Crypto Presale to Buy in 2025 In a noisy presale market, Nexchain is the signal that investors have been waiting for. Nexchain, with its AI-integrated blockchain, true revenue-sharing mechanism, and unparalleled scalability, provides substance where other initiatives rely purely on narrative. The $NEX token is more than simply a speculative asset; it is your ticket to collecting daily benefits while also supporting the infrastructure of a smarter, quicker, and more secure decentralized future. As the presale price stands at $0.054 and listings approach $0.30, early investors have a unique opportunity to participate before wider market exposure takes over. This is more than just another chance to catch a 5x or 10x; it’s an opportunity to help shape the future of Web3 infrastructure. Among all the ICOs and future coins in 2025, Nexchain does not follow trends. It lays the groundwork for what will come after it. For the astute investor, Nexchain is more than just a token; it is the year’s best crypto presale.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/top-crypto-presale-nexchain-is-leading-the-crypto-ico-list-2025/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TOKEN SALE","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T10:30:33.000Z,"Solana’s Bullish Trend Continues — MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Top Contender","As summer 2025 approaches, Solana’s bullish trend is holding strong, with the token consolidating around $170 and analysts projecting targets as high as $220 in the coming months. While Solana’s technical structure and rising spot volumes confirm renewed investor interest, the real buzz is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and upside projections are eclipsing even the most established names. Solana: Layer-1 Leader With Fresh Momentum Solana (SOL) has once again become a focal point for traders after a sharp rally pushed the token near $190. Technical analysis shows SOL consolidating around $170, supported by bullish momentum across all timeframes and a 16% spike in weekly spot volumes. Analysts are watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183, with forecasts for June and July calling for a move to $180–$210 if macro conditions remain favorable. While Solana’s fundamentals are robust and its ecosystem continues to expand, some investors are now rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is even more compelling. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 35x–50x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the most dominant presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and a listing target of $0.007. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 35x–50x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. As Stage 8 nears completion and a 50% bonus is available for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X, MAGA is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with more structure and transparency. With listings imminent, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the only major altcoin still in true accumulation mode before public price discovery, offering the highest risk-adjusted upside window heading into Q3. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TRUMP: Solid Anchors, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Bitcoin (BTC) continues to anchor the market above $110,000, with institutional inflows and ETF adoption providing a strong foundation for further growth. While BTC’s momentum is steady, the biggest near-term upside is shifting toward early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more attractive for growth-focused investors. Ethereum (ETH) is trading between $2,400 and $2,900, with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades supporting its long-term outlook. Still, as ETH’s rally moderates, some investors are rotating into high-upside altcoins for sharper returns—MAGACOIN FINANCE being the clear favorite for those seeking the next supercycle winner. TRUMP coin, meanwhile, is maintaining its meme-driven appeal, but its upside potential is overshadowed by the explosive presale momentum and structured tokenomics of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Solana’s bullish trend and technical momentum are impressive, and Bitcoin and Ethereum remain foundational assets. Yet, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 35x–50x are making it the breakout coin to watch for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X, MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. For those seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

2025-05-24T10:30:10.000Z,"Dogecoin Weekly Chart Shows Bitcoin-Like Movements That Could Trigger Massive Rally","Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has highlighted a Bitcoin-like pattern on the Dogecoin chart, which could trigger a parabolic rally. Based on his analysis, this rally could send the DOGE price above $10, marking a new all-time high (ATH) for the top meme coin. Related Reading: XRP’s $5 Dream Ride Hinges On This One Chart Setup – Analyst The Bitcoin Historical Pattern Which Could Send Dogecoin Above $10 In an X post, DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally above $10. He alluded to the weekly chart and compared the historical price cycles of Bitcoin and DOGE, while pointing out what tends to happen when BTC closes a weekly candle at all-time highs (ATHs). In the first cycle, which was in 2017, DOGE surged and achieved a 94x gain in the following months after BTC closed the week at its ATH. In the second cycle, which was in 2020, Dogecoin witnessed a more explosive 190x rally in the following months after Bitcoin closed the week at new all-time highs. Meanwhile, again in the third cycle this year, BTC is currently trading around its ATHs. However, it needs to confirm a weekly close above this level to validate a DOGE breakout. Based on history, DOGECAPITAL noted that this could set the stage for Dogecoin to “dramatically” outperform Bitcoin again. DOGE could also surpass its gains in previous cycles. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could even rally to as high as $69 on this explosive move. The analyst urged market participants to watch the weekly close as the last two times Bitcoin confirmed new highs, Dogecoin didn’t just surge but “launched.” In the short term, crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the foremost meme coin could rally to $0.31. In an X post, he stated that DOGE appears to be breaking out of a bull pennant, which points to this target. DOGE’s Uptrend Is Still Strong In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s uptrend remains pretty much solid. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin still has enough room to rally to the much-anticipated $1 price level. In another analysis, the analyst stated that DOGE will likely break the recent high at $0.25. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Master Kenobi stated that his short-term roadmap for Dogecoin is going according to plan so far. His chart showed that he expects the meme coin to consolidate in this range for 17 days before it then breaks out and rallies to $0.75 sometime in June. This will mark a new ATH for the DOGE price, with its current all-time high at $0.73.

Between November 5 and December 8 , the total crypto market surged by 63.36% , fueled by optimism around pro-crypto leadership. However, after Trump’s inauguration, market momentum began to cool as the administration adopted a cautious but strategic approach to crypto regulation. Despite this, key pro-crypto policies have been rolled out and prominent crypto-friendly figures have taken top positions in the government. Now, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has issued a strong statement reaffirming the administration’s support for digital assets. In a recent interview , Bessent revealed bold plans to grow the crypto sector under strict but supportive regulatory frameworks . Bessent Reaffirms U.S. Commitment to Crypto Innovation Making it clear that the Trump administration stands firmly behind crypto, Bessent criticized the previous administration’s destructive regulatory stance that disrupted many crypto businesses. He pledged that the current leadership would encourage sustainable innovation through a balanced and improved regulatory structure. Stablecoins to Drive $2 Trillion Demand for U.S. Treasuries? In a major revelation, Bessent projected that stablecoins could generate $2 trillion in short-term demand for U.S. Treasuries and Treasury bills , a dramatic rise from the current demand of $300 billion. Stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) , are typically backed 1:1 with fiat currency like the U.S. dollar and maintain reserves in liquid assets—including government bonds. As these coins gain traction, their issuers are becoming key buyers of U.S. debt instruments , potentially reshaping the treasury market. This surge in demand could: Lower U.S. borrowing costs Bolster the dollar’s global strength Finance more government spending without relying on traditional buyers Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino recently backed this vision, asserting that USDT would help solidify the dollar’s dominance globally. Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is preparing a stablecoin regulatory bill , expected to provide legal clarity and trigger institutional adoption. Rumors suggest that giants like Fidelity and JPMorgan may soon issue their own stablecoins. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk’s DOGE Plan To Save the U.S. Economy from Recession Amid Bitcoin Turmoil , Trump Admin Moves Ahead with Bitcoin Strategy In March 2025 , the Trump administration took a historic step by signing an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve , solidifying the U.S. government’s active role in the crypto space. Since Trump’s election: Bitcoin market rose 59.31% overall November 2024 alone saw a 37.4% spike Last 3 months: +11.7% Last 30 days: +17.1% Last 7 days: +4.4% Previously, Bessent confirmed that the U.S. government is open to acquiring more Bitcoin , including confiscated assets, to strengthen the national reserve. What’s Next for U.S. Crypto Policy? The message is clear: The Trump administration is not just supportive of crypto in theory—it is actively laying the foundation for long-term digital asset adoption, with strategic Bitcoin acquisition and a regulatory framework that fosters institutional confidence.With a $2 trillion stablecoin demand forecast, new laws in the pipeline, and increasing government involvement, the U.S. is poised to lead the next wave of crypto adoption—all under Trump’s watch. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-24T10:16:56.000Z,"Cardano News: ADA Developer Calls Bitcoin Solaris ‘The Most Promising Wealth Vehicle Since Ethereum’s Launch","The post Cardano News: ADA Developer Calls Bitcoin Solaris ‘The Most Promising Wealth Vehicle Since Ethereum’s Launch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a surprising endorsement making waves across the blockchain space, a developer within the Cardano (ADA) community has labeled Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) “the most promising wealth vehicle since Ethereum’s launch.” That’s no small statement, especially coming from a developer involved with one of the most research-driven projects in crypto. With a powerful dual-consensus model, record-fast transaction speeds, and a unique mining approach accessible across devices, Bitcoin Solaris is gaining momentum fast, and people are starting to take serious notice. Why the Comparison to Ethereum? Ethereum transformed the crypto landscape by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), creating what is now a multi-trillion-dollar DeFi economy. Bitcoin Solaris is being compared to Ethereum not because it copies it, but because it’s carving its own path with real-world usability, accessibility, and advanced performance. Ethereum may have been the blueprint, but Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a faster, more efficient, and mass-adoption-ready evolution of the smart contract ecosystem. What Is Bitcoin Solaris? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is a next-generation blockchain project built to fix the biggest limitations of traditional crypto systems. It combines the security of Bitcoin, the speed of Solana, and the accessibility of mobile-first technology. At the heart of its performance lies the dual-consensus Helios architecture: Proof-of-Work (PoW) secures the network’s base layer. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) powers the Solaris Layer, handling smart contracts and enabling ultra-fast transactions. This hybrid system achieves 2-second transaction finality and handles up to 10,000 transactions per second, making it even faster than Ripple’s XRP. Mining BTC-S is designed to be universal, with support across smartphones, laptops, and rigs. While the Solaris Nova app is still in development, the foundation is already built for inclusive, energy-efficient participation, consuming 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin’s legacy mining model. Presale Phase 4 Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 4 of its presale: Current Price: $4 Next Price: $5 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 12% Gaining Support from Influencers and Analysts Bitcoin Solaris is earning praise not only from developers but also from well-known content creators in the crypto space. Crypto Dex World recently praised Bitcoin Solaris in his Phase 4 coverage, calling it “a rare project that checks all boxes—speed, scalability, and accessibility.” Early BTC-S Backers Are Winning Big Meanwhile, Crypto Volt highlighted how the tokenomics and multi-device mining model make BTC-S stand out from the crowd of overhyped projects. More influencers and analysts are echoing the same sentiment: Bitcoin Solaris might just be the next big leap forward. Trusted and Audited Infrastructure Bitcoin Solaris backs its promises with real-world accountability. It has been fully audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , two respected blockchain security firms. Additionally, the project is KYC-verified through Freshcoins , giving early investors peace of mind as the presale continues. Conclusion To hear a developer from Cardano refer to Bitcoin Solaris as “the most promising wealth vehicle since Ethereum’s launch” is a big deal—and as more eyes turn toward BTC-S, that statement is becoming harder to ignore. From its dual-consensus architecture to blazing-fast speeds and broad mining accessibility, Bitcoin Solaris is checking every box that the next major blockchain project needs to succeed. With audits complete, presale bonuses still available, and growing community support, this may be one of the most important projects of 2025.

2025-05-24T10:12:46.000Z,"Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Thinks Crypto ETFs Are About to Explode – Here’s Why","The post Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Thinks Crypto ETFs Are About to Explode – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple CEO Garlinghouse participated in Ripple’s “ Crypto in One Minute ” podcast, delving into the crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) just days after the historic launch of the first XRP futures ETF on Nasdaq. His crisp, insightful remarks shine a spotlight on why crypto-based ETFs are catching everyone’s eye and why traditional finance is finally opening its doors to digital assets. Why the Buzz Around Crypto ETFs? Garlinghouse Shares Two Big Reasons Garlinghouse identified two major drivers behind the growing excitement around crypto ETFs since their January 2024 debut. First, institutional investors – from pension funds to endowments – have long struggled to access crypto assets directly. Before ETFs, they were stuck with cumbersome self-custody or relying on centralized exchanges, which limited their ability to trade crypto efficiently. Now, crypto ETFs have smashed that barrier, enabling Wall Street heavyweights and financial institutions to seamlessly trade crypto. This newfound accessibility is a game changer. Second, Garlinghouse argues that crypto ETFs are ‘ institutionalizing the entire crypto industry’. He pointed to Bitcoin’s ETF as a historic example: it was the fastest ETF ever to hit $1 billion in assets and quickly soared past the $10 billion mark, leaving behind all other ETFs. Garlinghouse predicts Bitcoin ETFs will eventually rival gold ETFs. Bold claim! XRP Futures ETFs Signal Crypto’s Institutional Leap Forward The launch of Volatility Shares’ XRP futures ETF on Nasdaq, under the XRPI ticker, marks a transformative step, following CME’s XRP-futures debut on May 19, 2025. Just before a month of its launch, Teucrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF and Bitcoin futures’ 2017 legacy underscore market maturation. Despite SEC delays, XRP’s resilience, recovering from $2.29 to $2.34 , shows investors’ trust. XRP Community Blends With Garlinghouse’s Insights Garlinghouse’s sharp insights have ignited a buzz across social channels like X. Many praised his clear, concise take as the best one-minute crypto briefing around. Users highlighted how institutional warming to crypto – especially XRP’s growing role in futures and ETFs – signals a broader shift. Conversations also touched on Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, Solana’s breakout potential, Pi token’s Kraken debut with 20x leverage, and JPMorgan’s recent stablecoin considerations amidst regulatory uncertainties. looks like institutions are warming up to crypto rn. xrp's role in this shift is undeniable, especially with futures & etfs in play. beyond that, btc touched new highs but saw quite a pullback. solana might break out soon if its macd keeps moving upwards. pi token's debut on… — aixrp (@aixrp_agent) May 23, 2025 Exciting Era for Crypto As XRP hits new milestones and the crypto ETF market matures, Garlinghouse’s perspective underscores a transformative moment for institutional crypto adoption. While regulatory roadblocks like SEC delays remain, XRP’s bounce-back, coupled with growing traction in Bitcoin and Solana markets, paints a interesting (and bullish) picture.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-thinks-crypto-etfs-are-about-to-explode-heres-why/,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|XRP|ZRX","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-24T10:06:26.000Z,"Sui token dips as community questions decentralization over frozen funds","The decentralization of the Layer-1 blockchain Sui network is being questioned after its major DeFi platform, Cetus Protocol, called for an upgrade to recover stolen funds. Cetus had been hacked for over $222 million, but Sui Validators were able to freeze $162 million of the stolen funds. According to Sui Network , the validators could freeze the funds by ignoring transactions from the two addresses tied to the attack, effectively preventing the attacker from bridging out all the stolen funds. However, Cetus protocol has requested a network upgrade to regain the frozen funds. The decentralized exchange and liquidity provider called for a community vote to decide on the upgrade. The Sui Network team described the request as extraordinary, noting that Cetus desperately needs funds. Thus, it has agreed to let the vote happen on the condition that the Sui Foundation abstain from voting to remain neutral and that Cetus must publicly commit to returning all lost funds to users. Meanwhile, the Cetus team noted that it needs the recovered funds to repay users who lost assets to the hack while efforts to recover the remaining $60 million are ongoing. However, it acknowledged that it would respect the decision of the community. It wrote: “No one can make this decision unilaterally. We propose an on-chain vote involving the network’s major participants, including validators and SUI stakers, to decide. We want to recover and return the stolen funds, but we will respect whatever the community decides.” However, the upgrade’s scope is unclear. Sui Network had said it would not roll back the chain history or reverse transactions. It added that the design details and code for the vote will soon be shared. Sui community reacts to a planned network upgrade So far, most of the reactions to the possible upgrade have been negative, with many users concerned such an upgrade could make the network lose trust as a decentralized protocol. Others added that rolling back or upgrading the network to recover the loss would be wrong. They claimed that Cetus was well aware of the flaws in its smart contracts since last year, when they were exploited at a smaller scale with memecoins but failed to act. Thus, the protocol should cover the losses itself. The sui chain should not be rolled back.. or upgraded.. to recover the loss…. This was a issue with a smart contract with the cetus application.. it was also known for months that there was some potential bugs since some where exploited at a small scale last year.. with meme… — DrTrade 🇸🇻 (@DrTradeAU) May 24, 2025 Meanwhile, some users think the voting itself might be a charade. They noted that only 3.2% of SUI supply went to the public while half went to venture capital firms and insiders who have been staking all their tokens. Thus, they believe that these VC firms will determine the outcome of the vote, and individual stakers will not influence the final decision. Interestingly, some users have criticized validators’ efforts to freeze funds, saying it amounts to censorship and defeats true decentralization. However, the team clarified that any validator on any network can decide to ignore transactions, and if enough of them do it, the transaction fails. Despite the overwhelming opposition, several people still believe it is the best decision as it will ensure that Cetus users get their funds back. One user even recommended that founders and stakeholders with liquidity pools on Cetus decide, since they have a stake in the outcome. SUI is down 5% in 24 hours While debates continue over whether Sui should have the network upgrade, the network native token SUI is down 6.57% to $3.63 in the last 24 hours. Its decline is due to broader market struggles with price corrections after BTC set a new peak price of around $112,000. However, the Cetus hack also contributed to the SUI drop, with the token dropping more than 13% from $4.19 to $3.62 the day after the incident. The CETUS token is not doing any better. Due to the incident, it is down 5% today and more than 17% in the past week. It is trading at $0.1640 at press time.

This week has been a wild ride for investors and enthusiasts. Big headlines. Big consequences. We’ve seen it all – from political power plays to million-dollar scandals. All of these are powerful signals hinting at where the industry is really heading. So, if you blinked, you’ve missed a lot. We’ll dive into what happened these past few days and why it matters for you. Let’s go! #1 Trump’s $TRUMP Crypto Dinner Drama Justin Sun, the crypto billionaire who once dodged the US spotlight fearing arrest, stepped back into the limelight – this time as a VIP at Donald Trump’s exclusive gala dinner. Sun, proudly holding the biggest stash of Trump’s $TRUMP memecoin, showed up amid protests shouting “shame.” Trump himself took the stage, blaming the previous administration for making life miserable for crypto insiders, calling it a “disgrace.” Sun flashed over $1.3 million in $TRUMP holdings and a flashy “Trump Golden Tourbillion” watch. Predictably, Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren called it “an orgy of corruption”. Phew. #2 Sui’s $260M Crypto Heist: What Went Down? Sui’s largest decentralized exchange, Cetus Protocol, was hit with a $260 million hack that sent shockwaves through the SUI ecosystem. The attacker exploited fake tokens like BULLA to mess with liquidity pools and drain assets, including 12.9 million SUI and $60 million in USDC. They then tried laundering the loot by swapping a big chunk of USDC for 21,938 ETH. Cetus jumped on damage control, pausing smart contracts and launching a full probe. Meanwhile, SUI’s price took a hit, dropping about 15% to $3.90. The scramble is on to recover funds and shore up security. #3 GENIUS Act (Finally) Breaks Ground in Stablecoin Law The U.S. Senate just cleared a major hurdle by advancing the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 vote – the first stablecoin bill to make it this far. This bipartisan win came after last-minute tweaks and pressure from crypto advocates like Stand With Crypto. The bill lets private firms issue stablecoins and demands full backing with dollars or Treasury bills. While it bars foreign stablecoins on U.S. centralized exchanges, decentralized platforms remain untouched. Critics say the revisions are mostly cosmetic, leaving loopholes like weak data safeguards and possible regulatory capture. Big moves, but is it enough? #4 Pi Network’s $8M Scam: Pump, Dump, and Investor Fury! Pi Network is under fire with explosive $8 billion scam allegations after insiders reportedly dumped 12 million PI tokens. Blockchain sleuth Atlas points to a classic pump-and-dump move – sharp price surges followed by a brutal 50% crash post-May 14. Despite a bullish spike fueled by an 86 million token withdrawal from OKX (hinting at strong holder confidence), the price has since slumped to $0.79. The project also battles criticism over exchange listings, token distribution, and node centralization, raising serious questions about its future. Is it the end of the road for Pi? I hope not. #5 Blum Co-Founder Detained in Russia Big news out of Russia – Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of the Telegram-based crypto project Blum and former head of Binance Russia, has been arrested in Moscow on large-scale fraud suspicions. The heat comes from his previous ventures, The Token Fund and Tokenbox, where investors reportedly lost around $15 million. While the investigation is ongoing and no formal charges are out yet, Russian courts have approved his detention. Blum quickly clarified that Smerkis resigned and is no longer connected to the project, distancing themselves from the scandal. #6 Cardano CEO Fires Back at $600M Allegations Charles Hoskinson is pushing back hard against claims he misused $600 million worth of ADA tokens. The drama centers on accusations that during Cardano’s 2021 Allegra hard fork, Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to control 619 million ADA. But he says most of the 350 million ADA involved were already redeemed over seven years, with the leftovers donated to Intersect, a Cardano-affiliated org. Feeling “deeply hurt” by the distrust, Hoskinson plans to release an audit report and might hand over his social channels to a media team to clear the air. #7 Nasdaq Welcomes First Ever XRP Futures ETF The wait is over – XRP stepped into the ETF spotlight with the launch of Volatility Shares’ XRPI ETF, trading on Nasdaq. This 1x XRP futures ETF offers a safer, measured way to access Ripple’s price action without holding the token directly. Analyst Eric Balchunas called it a “good signal” of growing demand for crypto investment vehicles. With leveraged XRP ETFs already firing up interest and CME’s recent XRP futures rollout, XRPI marks a new phase in XRP’s journey. I’m loving this one! #8 MSTR Holdings Surge as States Seek Bitcoin Proxy 14 US states revealed a collective $632 million stake in MicroStrategy (MSTR) during Q1 2025, marking a 42% jump from the previous quarter. California leads with $276 million, followed by Florida and North Carolina. Utah’s holdings skyrocketed 184%, while Wisconsin sold its $300 million Bitcoin ETF stake, increasing MSTR instead. This shows states prefer indirect Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy’s massive 576,230 BTC stash, avoiding direct crypto ownership complexities. #9 Who’s Buying USDC? Circle’s Next Move Circle, the powerhouse behind USDC, is stirring the pot with a $5 billion valuation price tag as it entertains acquisition talks. Ripple and Coinbase have both stepped into the ring, but Circle shot down Ripple’s XRP-heavy bid, citing concerns over liquidity and valuation mechanics. Meanwhile, talks with Coinbase are reportedly friendlier – “If Coinbase wanted to buy them, Circle would sell in a second,” insiders say. Despite these moves, Circle’s IPO ambitions remain alive but shaky, as broader market volatility and trade policies push the company to rethink timing. Big questions loom over USDC’s future path. #10 Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Passed Texas just got one step closer to becoming America’s Bitcoin bull state. Senate Bill 21 – which would establish a state-run Bitcoin Reserve – passed its final House vote, clearing 101-42. All that’s left is Governor Abbott’s signature, and the signs are strong. He even shared the proposal on X, and crypto voices like Kyle Chassé are already calling it: “It’s happening.” If Abbott signs before the June 2 deadline, Texas will follow New Hampshire as the second U.S. state with its own BTC stash. Trump’s vision is shaping up quite well. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss! HSBC Goes Live with Tokenized Deposits: HSBC has officially launched its Tokenised Deposit Service in Hong Kong, enabling 24/7 fund transfers using blockchain tech. Ant International led the charge as the first client to go live. A Wall Street Stablecoin? Yep, It’s Being Discussed: Some of the biggest U.S. banks – including JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo – are reportedly discussing a joint stablecoin venture, according to WSJ. Early talks, but major implications if it lands. Crypto Meets Stocks, Powered by USDT: Bybit just launched stock trading with USDT via Metatrader 5, giving users access to Apple, Tesla, gold, forex, and crypto from one account. Multi-market action at its best. CZ Slams Trump Crypto Allegations: CZ has slammed the Wall Street Journal for linking him to Trump-backed crypto dealings, calling the report a “hit piece.” He flatly denied acting as a “fixer” or brokering any WLF meetings. Semler Bets the House on Bitcoin: Semler Scientific just dropped $50M on Bitcoin, boosting its stash to over 4,264 BTC. With losses mounting and a crypto-first strategy now official, this healthcare firm is betting big again. What’s Next for Crypto? Major shifts to expect ahead With Texas and other U.S. states doubling down on MicroStrategy and BTC reserves, expect a growing wave of state-led crypto strategies. A formal Bitcoin reserve could become a blueprint for other red states, especially under pro-crypto leadership. The launch of the XRPI ETF on Nasdaq signals that altcoin futures ETFs are gaining traction. With CME backing XRP and Ethereum products next in line, this could bring mainstream capital to major alts fast. The GENIUS Act may have passed its Senate hurdle, but its foreign token ban and loose guardrails could trigger lawsuits, revisions, or even state-level pushback.

2025-05-24T09:30:33.000Z,"Ethereum’s Steady Climb to $2,577 — MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Show Stronger Growth Potential","Ethereum’s recent performance above $2,500 is fueling renewed optimism in the crypto market. As ETH consolidates in the $2,400–$2,900 range and approaches $2,577, investors are closely watching for the next breakout. Yet, while Ethereum’s resilience is impressive, the spotlight is shifting to projects with even greater upside—most notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With Bitcoin and Stellar Lumens providing stability, these high-growth contenders are capturing the imagination of analysts and traders heading into summer 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender Redefining Early-Stage ROI While Ethereum and Bitcoin anchor the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001, MAGA’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts are calling MAGA the standout contender of the year, with forecasts suggesting a conservative 35x gain and some models projecting up to 50x or even 18,500% upside if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem, and with Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target on the horizon, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle winner. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP is holding steady around $2.37, consolidating after a strong rally and benefiting from regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. Standard Chartered projects $5.50 by year-end, driven by ETF approvals and increased adoption, and some long-term forecasts suggest $10–$20 is possible by 2030 if Ripple’s global settlement infrastructure gains traction. While XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive, many investors are rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, asymmetric returns. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $150,000 or more by year-end if momentum persists. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Stellar Lumens (XLM) continues to serve as a reliable cross-border payments asset, maintaining steady adoption among fintech partners and remittance platforms. Trading near $0.11, XLM’s growth has lagged behind the more explosive moves seen in MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is drawing capital from investors seeking the next 50x opportunity. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Conclusion Ethereum’s climb to $2,577 is a testament to its resilience, but the most dramatic growth potential is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With MAGA’s presale nearing completion, a $0.007 listing target, and analyst forecasts up to 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For those seeking the next breakout winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025.

2025-05-24T09:16:07.000Z,"Investment Firm Predicts $400 Billion in Institutional Investment in Bitcoin by 2026","Institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin will exceed $400 billion by the end of 2026, according to a new report published by crypto asset management firm Bitwise Asset Management and UTXO Management. These investments are expected to lead to a total accumulation of 4.2 million BTC. While more than $120 billion in institutional inflows into Bitcoin are expected in 2025, this figure is expected to reach $300 billion in 2026. This rapid growth will be driven not only by the private sector but also by state-supported strategies. Following US President Donald Trump’s announcement in March that he would establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, bills aimed at converting confiscated Bitcoins into treasury assets have emerged in more than 20 states. If these initiatives, led by states such as New Hampshire and Arizona, become law, an additional $19 billion in capital flow into Bitcoin is expected. Related News: A Person Who Attended US President Donald Trump's Crypto Dinner Shared Inside Details: He Also Revealed How Much He Paid to Attend According to the report, at least five states in the US and four other countries, such as Bhutan, are expected to establish their own strategic Bitcoin reserves by 2026. This process is also expected to increase the number of publicly traded Bitcoin treasuries. Firms such as MicroStrategy are expected to add more than 1 million BTC to their portfolios in total. These companies are also expected to focus on Bitcoin-based yield strategies, such as lending and staking, by 2026, further increasing the interest of institutional investors. “We are entering a new era of Bitcoin adoption that is no longer driven by hype cycles, but by balance sheet fundamentals, sovereign strategies and long-term liabilities,” said Guillaume Girard, research director at UTXO Management. “Over the next 18 months, Bitcoin will solidify its place as a global store of value,” said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise. *This is not investment advice.

In a new video, Pal tells his 236,000 YouTube subscribers that the global money supply (Global M2) metric is “tightly correlated” to the price of Bitcoin. According to the macro guru, the global money supply metric is now suggesting that Bitcoin could go up by around 28% from the current level. “But at this point, it’s [the price of Bitcoin] really driven by liquidity. It gave us a three-month heads up to exactly the correction [of around $75,000 in April]. And yet Twitter said it’s about tariffs, it’s about the end of the world. It told you, it is telling you, and told you it would be at all-time highs. I told you it would be at all-time highs by May. It tells you we should be over $140,000 by July.” Source: Raoul Pal/YouTube Pal further says that the price of Bitcoin will at some point start rising faster than the increase in global money supply before trending in the opposite direction. “I also know it will decouple later in the cycle, and it will decouple to the upside with Bitcoin outperforming Global M2. That’s how it works when the crowd comes in, the herd gets FOMO (fear of missing out), they get greedy, and it actually starts outperforming. The,n when the market flips, it eventually starts to underperform as fear kicks in.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,350 at time of writing.

2025-05-24T09:10:15.000Z,"Fidelity Digital Assets: Bullish Outlook as Bitcoin Golden Cross Holds Above $93K","BitcoinWorld Fidelity Digital Assets: Bullish Outlook as Bitcoin Golden Cross Holds Above $93K The cryptocurrency market is buzzing, and all eyes are on Bitcoin as it continues its impressive run, recently hitting new all-time highs. Amidst this excitement, a significant technical indicator, the ‘Golden Cross,’ has emerged, capturing the attention of major players like Fidelity Digital Assets. But what exactly does this mean for the future of Bitcoin’s price, and why is a specific price level so crucial? Understanding the Bitcoin Golden Cross and Its Significance In technical analysis, a Golden Cross is widely regarded as a strong bullish signal. It occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average. For Bitcoin, this pattern activated on April 7th, suggesting potential upward momentum. Why is this particular Bitcoin Golden Cross drawing so much focus? Because it often indicates a potential shift in market sentiment and can precede significant price rallies. However, the strength and validation of this signal often depend on subsequent price action. According to Chris Kuiper from Fidelity Digital Assets, the current Golden Cross could gain further strength and confirm its bullish implications if the Bitcoin price manages to hold above the $93,000 level. This $93,000 level likely represents a critical support zone, potentially aligning with key moving averages or previous resistance-turned-support levels. Maintaining the price above this threshold would reinforce the technical validity of the Golden Cross and suggest that the bullish trend has solid footing. Fidelity Digital Assets ‘ Perspective on the Market As a major player in the institutional crypto space, the insights from Fidelity Digital Assets carry significant weight. Chris Kuiper’s commentary highlights their analytical approach, combining technical indicators like the Golden Cross with fundamental drivers. Fidelity’s view isn’t just about the technical pattern; it’s also tied to key price levels. While the $93,000 mark is seen as crucial for validating the Golden Cross, Fidelity also views the $110,000 level as a potential ‘launchpad’ for further gains. This suggests that breaking and holding above $110,000 could trigger the next leg up in Bitcoin’s price discovery, potentially accelerating the upward trend indicated by the Golden Cross. The fact that an entity like Fidelity Digital Assets is publicly discussing these technical and price levels underscores the increasing institutional acceptance and analysis of the cryptocurrency market using traditional financial tools and metrics. Driving Forces: Crypto ETF Inflows and Institutional Appetite What’s fueling this optimistic outlook from institutions like Fidelity? A primary driver is the consistent and significant flow of capital into Bitcoin investment products, particularly Crypto ETF inflows . The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various markets has provided traditional investors with a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. These ETFs have seen steady and substantial inflows since their launch, absorbing a significant portion of the newly mined Bitcoin supply and even drawing from existing holdings. Key drivers behind these robust Crypto ETF inflows and the broader institutional appetite include: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Digital Gold Status: The comparison to digital gold resonates with asset managers looking for alternative store-of-value assets. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets offers diversification benefits. Accessibility: ETFs and other regulated products simplify investment for large funds. Growing Ecosystem Maturity: Improved infrastructure, custody solutions, and regulatory clarity make institutional participation more feasible. While institutional interest and investment via avenues like ETFs are surging, it’s noteworthy, as U.Today reported, that retail participation has remained relatively limited compared to previous bull cycles. This dynamic suggests that the current rally is heavily institutionally driven, which can impact market structure and volatility differently than a retail-fueled surge. Analyzing Current Bitcoin Price Trends and Challenges Since the activation of the Golden Cross on April 7th, the Bitcoin price has seen a remarkable increase of approximately 33%. This powerful upward move propelled Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $111,814. However, like any volatile asset, Bitcoin experienced a pullback, dropping to around $108,622 at the time of the report. This recent dip was partially attributed to rising U.S.-EU trade tensions, illustrating how broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors can still influence the crypto market, even amidst strong underlying bullish trends. This highlights an inherent challenge for investors: navigating Bitcoin’s price movements requires not only understanding crypto-specific factors but also keeping an eye on the global economic landscape. Key price levels to watch based on the analysis include: $93,000: The crucial support level for validating the strength of the Golden Cross, according to Fidelity. $110,000: Identified by Fidelity as a potential launchpad for further upward movement. $111,814: The recent all-time high, which now serves as a resistance level to break through. The ability of the Bitcoin price to sustain itself above key technical and psychological levels will be critical in determining the short-to-medium term trajectory. The Road Ahead: Opportunities in Institutional Bitcoin Investment The increasing focus on Institutional Bitcoin investment is not just a current trend; it’s a fundamental shift that could shape the market for years to come. As more large funds and corporations allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, the market gains deeper liquidity and potentially reduced volatility over the long term (though short-term swings remain likely). For readers interested in this space, understanding the drivers and impact of Institutional Bitcoin investment is key. These large players often have longer investment horizons and perform extensive due diligence, which can lend credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Their continued entry, facilitated by products like ETFs and the insights provided by firms like Fidelity Digital Assets, could provide sustained buying pressure independent of retail sentiment. While the path won’t be without its pullbacks and challenges, the structural change brought about by significant institutional adoption suggests a maturing market with potentially larger upside potential over time, supported by strong technical signals like a validated Golden Cross. Conclusion Fidelity Digital Assets’ focus on the Bitcoin Golden Cross and the critical $93,000 level underscores the growing intersection of traditional financial analysis and the cryptocurrency market. Coupled with robust ETF inflows and increasing institutional interest, the outlook appears bullish, contingent on Bitcoin holding key support levels. While recent price action has seen Bitcoin pull back slightly from its all-time high, the underlying drivers, particularly from the institutional side, remain strong. The $110,000 level is eyed as a potential catalyst for the next phase of growth. As the market evolves, monitoring both technical indicators and the flow of institutional capital will be essential for understanding Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

With fears of a U.S. recession rising by 43% and government debt ballooning, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is choosing to bet on expansion, not reductions. This approach may sound risky, but here’s the twist, it’s already showing some results. Let’s find out. Elon Musk’s Fix: Grow the Economy, Don’t Shrink It For decades, the go-to solution during economic trouble has been to cut government spending. But now, with the U.S. debt mounting and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumping to 4.5% and recession odds climbing to 43%, Musk argues that this strategy is no longer enough Musk says improving productivity and expanding GDP are the only real ways to avoid national bankruptcy . He admits that government waste is a serious problem, but believes that strong reforms can still make a difference. And he’s not alone. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, once a firm supporter of spending cuts, now says the U.S. must “grow its way out” of the debt crisis. According to him, if the economy grows faster than the debt, it becomes possible to manage both. This change in thinking marks a huge turning point for U.S. economic policy. DOGE’s Progress So Far While Musk in the 2024 U.S. election campaign promised DOGE would save $2 trillion from government spending, which is one-third of the entire federal budget. As of May, it has already saved $170 billion, which is 17% of its $1 trillion goal and 8.5% of the “dream target.” The public can track DOGE’s progress through an official site, which also highlights which sectors are becoming more efficient. Bitcoin Drops After Trade War Warning After Donald Trump warned about new trade tariffs on Europe, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies quickly dropped. Eventually, Bitcoin has become very sensitive to what’s happening in politics. As these tensions rise, crypto prices are moving fast. Just recently, Bitcoin hit a record high above $112,000. But after the news, it dropped 2.7% and is now trading around $107,937 .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/elon-musks-doge-plan-to-save-the-u-s-economy-from-recession-amid-bitcoin-turmoil/,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

The sharp sell-off wiped out around $638 million in leveraged positions, as per data from Coinglass. Trump said that he is not going to make a deal with the EU but hinted that he might delay the tariffs if the EU builds factories in the US. Trump recommended a 50% tariff on EU goods starting June 1, 2025, unless the products are made in the U.S. The sharp move came after a period of low volatility, and Trump’s comments triggered panic across global markets. Top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano were also hit hard as they dropped 3-6%. According to CoinGlass , nearly $350 million in crypto positions were liquidated in just 4 hours, with over $500 million wiped out in 24 hours. Crypto stocks also slid today as BTC Treasury companies like Microstrategy and Semler Scientific dropped around 6%. Japan’s Metaplanet fell even harder, down 24%. Despite Bitcoin hitting a fresh all-time high this week, crypto stocks did not keep up with the gains. Is Trump In a Tough Spot? Commenting on the big-picture market situation, The Kobeissi Letter said Trump is in a tough spot. If he pushes tariffs too hard, it could cause market trades to fall apart. But if he backs off too much, then the inflation expectations could rise again. Trump has to find a way to keep tariffs high enough to show strength but should also avoid pushing up treasury yields. And he has to do this without help from the Fed, which isn’t lowering interest rates yet. This Cycle Is Different, Say Analysts Analyst Benjamin Cowen says Bitcoin’s recent drop looks like the typical dip that follows a golden cross. He expects the pullback to last a few days with a possible bounce coming next week. Experts note that this crypto cycle is way more complex and different from the past ones. So, there’s no reason to expect the rest of it to follow the same old 4-year pattern. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe says that investors should stay open-minded over the next 1-2 years as the market could bring surprises. He believes that now, the chances are much higher of a longer cycle with Bitcoin possibly hitting $400K–$600K by 2026/2027 and altcoins climbing even higher.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-crash-bitcoin-falls-to-108k-after-trumps-eu-tariff-threat/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

Source: Bwbx.ioThe judge also rejected prosecutors’ argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024.

Source: Laevitas.chThe open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels.Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds.

The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks.In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On May 20, the US Senate voted 66-32 in favor of advancing discussion on the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The bill outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
