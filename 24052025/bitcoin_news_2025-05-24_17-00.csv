2025-05-24T14:50:09.000Z,"Bitcoin Sets a New Record, But Beware: No Record Yet in Non-Dollar Currency Pairs – Analyst Says There Is Room for Upside – Here Are the Details","Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson noted that while Bitcoin has reached an all-time high in US dollar terms, other currencies have yet to reach that level. In his statement on his social media account, Wedson stated that the BTC/USD parity, which has the highest trading volume against the dollar, broke the record, but said that the same was not the case for other fiat currencies. According to Wedson, in order for Bitcoin to break records against other major currencies, it needs to rise at the following rates: 10.3 percent against the euro 11.5 percent against the British pound 11 percent against the Swiss franc 10 percent against Japanese yen 8 percent against the South Korean won 5 percent against the Canadian dollar 29 percent against the Russian ruble 8 percent against the Brazilian real Related News: A Person Who Attended US President Donald Trump's Crypto Dinner Shared Inside Details: He Also Revealed How Much He Paid to Attend Wedson noted that these differences clearly demonstrate the impact of exchange rates on the cryptocurrency market. “Looking beyond the dollar, we see that there is still significant room for upside. But this also indicates that new resistance levels may be formed,” he said. Wedson also pointed out some advantages that most investors are not aware of: “Bitcoin pairs traded with currencies such as the euro and ruble may offer higher statistical asymmetry compared to the dollar pair. However, this is not talked about much in the market.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-24T14:42:11.000Z,"Analysts Forecast Institutions Will Own 20% of Bitcoin Supply by 2026","According to a Thursday report from crypto investment firm Bitwise, institutional investors are on track to hold a staggering 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 4.2 million BTC, by the end of 2026 . This projection highlights a new chapter in Bitcoin’s adoption story, driven not by retail enthusiasm or tech innovation but by strategic financial decisions from governments, corporations, and wealth managers. Bitwise’s estimates peg the cumulative institutional inflows into Bitcoin at $120 billion in 2025 and another $300 billion in 2026, assuming a benchmark BTC price of $100,000. These inflows would bring the institutional share of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin supply to more than 20%. “We’re entering an era where Bitcoin isn’t just an investment—it’s becoming a balance-sheet imperative,” said Bitwise analysts. “From nation-states to Wall Street wirehouses, everyone is eyeing Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” Notably, the report breaks down institutional buyers into five key groups: nation-states, public companies, U.S. states, wealth management platforms, and sovereign wealth funds. According to the firm, the U.S. government already leads the pack with 198,000 BTC in federal custody. If new legislation like the BITCOIN Act is passed, the analyst projects that that number could climb by 200,000 BTC annually for the next five years. Corporations, too, are accelerating adoption. Public companies hold over 600,000 BTC, and Bitwise expects that number to nearly double by 2026. One notable newcomer, Twenty-One, a Bitcoin-native public company backed by Tether and SoftBank, is launching with over 42,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Bitwise credits recent accounting rule changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the corporate sector as a major tailwind. These rules allow companies to mark Bitcoin holdings at fair market value, incentivizing broader adoption. Wealth management firms, long considered sleeping giants, are also awakening. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and other firms managing a combined $60 trillion in assets are beginning to greenlight Bitcoin ETFs. If even 0.5% of that wealth shifts into BTC, that alone would account for over 3 million coins, which is roughly 14% of the total supply. Perhaps most striking is the momentum behind sovereign adoption. Central banks facing inflation and geopolitical instability are increasingly eyeing Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Bitwise report models a scenario where even 5% of global gold reserves are converted into Bitcoin, resulting in 1.6 million BTC moving to state treasuries. At the state level, more than a dozen U.S. states are exploring Bitcoin reserve strategies. Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire have already passed legislation, and others like Ohio and North Carolina are considering similar moves. If the Bitwise forecasts are correct, Bitcoin’s supply dynamics will be permanently altered, setting the stage for heightened scarcity and potentially explosive price movement. “These aren’t short-term trades,” Bitwise concluded. “Institutions accumulating Bitcoin today are preparing for a world where it becomes a global reserve standard.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/analysts-forecast-institutions-will-own-20-of-bitcoin-supply-by-2026/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T14:37:01.000Z,"President Trump Declares U.S. Crypto Dominance, Vows to Keep Leading in Bitcoin","In a bold declaration at an exclusive crypto-themed gala this week, President Donald Trump proclaimed the United States the global leader in digital assets, vowing to cement the nation’s dominance in Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency sector. The event, held at Trump National Golf Club in Loudoun County, served as a celebration for top investors in the meme-based $TRUMP coin and a statement of policy direction. “The U.S.A. is DOMINATING in Crypto, Bitcoin, etc., and we are going to keep it that way!” the president posted on Truth Social hours before attending the event on May 23. Addressing a high-profile crowd of crypto investors, including TRON founder Justin Sun, who reportedly invested over $1.3 million in TRUMP, President Trump praised attendees as “pioneers” of the new digital economy. Despite the event’s prestige and luxury, several guests expressed disappointment over the president’s lack of substantial interaction. “He just gave a few remarks and left,” one VIP attendee commented, noting that hopes for a Q&A or deeper engagement were unmet, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The gala, attended by roughly 220 guests, including 25 top wallet holders who received special access at a VIP cocktail hour, has drawn criticism from ethics watchdogs and congressional Democrats. Concerns were raised over potential conflicts of interest, influence peddling, and donor transparency. Critics argue that events like these could provide wealthy crypto figures with outsized access to the president, potentially shaping policy to benefit their interests. Responding to the backlash, the White House insisted that Trump’s financial assets are managed in a blind trust and that he remains compliant with all conflict-of-interest laws. A spokesperson emphasized that the administration’s commitment is rooted in innovation, not favoritism, highlighting recent initiatives such as creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader national digital asset stockpile. The administration claims these steps are part of a larger push to ensure that the U.S. remains at the forefront of the rapidly evolving digital financial system. Supporters argue that Trump’s policies mark a long-awaited shift in federal attitude toward crypto, moving from skepticism to aggressive support. However, the president’s show of confidence in crypto leadership came on the same day markets were shaken by geopolitical tensions. Trump’s threat to impose 50% tariffs on EU imports triggered a wave of volatility in global financial markets, with European stocks dropping sharply and Bitcoin falling from its new all-time high of $111,340. The move also raised concerns over how U.S. protectionist policies might influence the delicate balance of risk appetite in crypto markets. BTC traded at $108,252 at press time, reflecting a 2.63% drop in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/president-trump-declares-u-s-crypto-dominance-vows-to-keep-leading-in-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T14:30:28.000Z,"437,329 Americans Hit by Massive Data Breach – Customer’s Names, Addresses, Social Security Numbers, Medical Records and More at Risk","A large private healthcare system in the US has been breached, leaking the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Americans. According to a bulletin from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, which reports breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 people or more, the Missouri-based healthcare company Ascension has been hit by a “hacking/IT” incident. Ascension says 437,329 people are affected, and a letter that’s being sent to clients says the firm “inadvertently disclosed information” to a former third-party business partner, and the information was most likely stolen due a software vulnerability. Ascenion says an investigation determined that its clients’ names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender, and Social Security numbers (SSN), as well as clinical information related to inpatient visits, such as place of service, physician name, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and billing codes, medical record numbers, and insurance company name, may have all been exposed, depending on the individual. The company has not addressed whether the compromised information had been used by bad actors. However, in the governent’s alert, the Ascension hack was reported to have affected 437,329 victims. For now, Ascension is offering its clients two years of complimentary identity monitoring services, and urges vigilance against fraud. “We regret any inconvenience this incident may cause and are providing you with information about steps you can take to help protect your information.

2025-05-24T14:28:35.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Drew $2.75 Billion Weekly as BTC Price Corrected to $107,000","US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $2.75 billion in net inflows over May 23, marking a 4.5× jump from the $608 million recorded the week prior. This is the first uninterrupted streak of daily ETF inflows in four weeks and highlights renewed institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ETFs Weekly Inflows Surge 4.5× According to Farside Investors data, between May 17 and May 23, spot Bitcoin ETFs amassed $2.75 billion—up sharply from $608 million the previous week. The spike coincided with Bitcoin’s climb above its January all-time high of $109,000 on May 21 and a fresh peak of $111,970 on May 22 . ETF inflows have historically tracked broader market momentum, and this week’s inflows suggest growing confidence in Bitcoin’s near-term outlook. On May 23 alone, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $211.7 million in net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out, adding $430.8 million and extending its consecutive inflow streak to eight days. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw $89.2 million in outflows, while ARK 21Shares’ ARKB shed $73.9 million. The performance gap underscores a rotation toward cheaper fee structures and broader issuer choice within the ETF space. Through May 23, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have gathered approximately $5.39 billion in monthly inflows. With five trading days remaining, they are poised to surpass November 2024’s record $6.49 billion monthly total. A new monthly high would further cement ETFs as a primary conduit for institutional capital into Bitcoin. Bitcoin traded around $108,141 at the close of May 23, down from the $111,970 all-time high two days earlier. Over the same period, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 66 (“Greed”) from 78 (“Extreme Greed”), pointing to a mild cooling in market exuberance amid heavy inflows. Meanwhile, spot exchange volume mirrored ETF flows, with 24-hour volumes exceeding $50 billion on key venues. ETF Flows vs. Traditional Markets The inflows into Bitcoin ETFs occurred alongside weakness in U.S. equities. On May 22, the S&P 500 fell 0.7% amid rising Treasury yields, even as Bitcoin peaked. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s decoupling from stocks during this bout of volatility underscores its maturing status as a portfolio diversifier. Analysts highlight that ETF inflows could drive a structural shift in Bitcoin’s liquidity profile by shifting demand from spot to regulated vehicles. Key catalysts include U.S. macro releases, particularly the May CPI report due May 13 and the Federal Reserve’s subsequent policy signals. Regulatory developments, such as potential SEC approvals for additional Bitcoin ETFs, may also steer fund flows.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etf-drew-2-75-billion-weekly-as-btc-price-corrected-to-107000/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin ETF|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T14:25:54.000Z,"Solana Price Prediction: SOL Rose to $176.40— Can This L1 Outperform as ETH and BTC Gain Ground?","Solana (SOL) is at $176.40, with $4.86 billion in trading volume and $91.78 billion in market cap. While Ethereum and Bitcoin go up, Solana’s Layer 1 is quietly building momentum with new DeFi innovations and a good price structure. Now the question is can SOL ride this wave and outperform its big brothers? Jupiter Lend Drives Solana’s DeFi Growth Jupiter, a major decentralized exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain, has launched Jupiter Lend, a lending protocol announced during the Solana Accelerate conference. Unlike traditional asset-collateralized platforms, Jupiter Lend has an 90% debt-to-asset ratio, allowing users to borrow more with less assets. This is designed to attract both retail and institutional players looking for efficient capital management. Features: One-click deposits and a “vault protocol” for easy borrowing Low fees of 0.1% Integration with Fluid , bringing Ethereum expertise to Solana’s ecosystem Jupiter has about 95% of Solana’s DEX aggregator volume, so it’s a big player. After the launch, JUP surged 12%. Analysts think this will boost Solana’s transaction volume and its position in DeFi. Kraken’s xStocks Expands Use Cases of Solana Kraken has launched xStocks , tokenized versions of Apple, Tesla, Nvidia and other major global equities, all tradable on the Solana blockchain. https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1925558402849112228 This is for international investors, especially in Europe, Asia and Latin America, to access US stocks through tokenized assets backed by real-world securities. Advantages: 24/7 trading on a blockchain known for speed and low fees Real-world asset backing via partnerships with Backed Finance Liquidity options to redeem for cash or use as collateral in DeFi strategies This puts Solana as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto, and attracts global traders looking for flexible, 24/7 access to both markets. Solana Technical Analysis – Bullish Bias In Play Solana price prediction remains bullish as on the 2-hour chart, SOL is consolidating in an ascending channel, making higher highs and higher lows—a sign of a strong uptrend. The 50-period EMA at $175.42 and the trendline at $173.06 are strong buy zones. Candlestick patterns show spinning tops, meaning indecision, but the recent bullish engulfing candle means buying is back. Technicals: Break above $181.57 and it’s $187.64 and $192.98 MACD crossover could mean momentum turns bullish Risk management : pullbacks to $173.06 are buys with stops below $165.50 For new and experienced traders, this is a clear opportunity to ride Solana’s breakout if momentum aligns with ETH and BTC. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the SOL/USD pair hovers near $176.40, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

It recently crossed the $111K level, and experts are issuing bullish predictions, expecting it to climb even higher. What’s really driving the surge? Let’s find out. Bitcoin To Reach $125K By Q2 Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high is just the beginning, says Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit . If the current trend continues, he predicts Bitcoin could reach $125K by the end of Q2 . He pointed to three key drivers behind the rally- “We’re seeing a unique convergence of factors—regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic shifts—that are accelerating mainstream adoption”. The consistent capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs show that institutional investors are embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. And Bitcoin’s inverse correlation to the dollar is further boosting its role as digital gold, Jan said. With Bitcoin holding strong above $110K, Bybit’s $125K target by quarter’s end shows rising confidence in BTC as a key player in the future of global finance. Jan also highlighted the recently introduced GENIUS Act and said that having clear rules like this helps build trust and create the infrastructure needed for broader adoption. Cautious Outlook for Altcoins While he was bullish on Bitcoin, he was a bit cautious on altcoins. He noted that while Ethereum and other top coins may follow Bitcoin, high interest rates and global uncertainty might stop smaller tokens from rising as much. Analyst Scott Melker also predicts Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by the end of 2025, driven by strong institutional demand and a stable market. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped considerably and its ties with trad-fi could drive the next big rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 24 May, 2025 , Bitcoin Is Undervalued, Says Adam Back Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is highly undervalued and could soar to $500,000–$1 million per coin in this market cycle. He was surprised at Bitcoin’s current price level despite the rise in institutional interest and breakthroughs. He thinks that the price still does not reflect the bullish momentum building behind Bitcoin. Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick predicts Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by 2025 and soar to $500,000 by 2029, driven by a shift away from U.S. assets. Meanwhile, Bernstein forecasts Bitcoin reaching $200,000 in the current bull run. Bitcoin has slipped 4% today to $107,200 while the broader market and stocks also pulled back as President Trump threatened a 50% tariff on all EU goods. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-24T13:56:21.000Z,"DOGE, XRP Slump While Bitcoin Slips Under $109,000 Amid President Trump’s New Tariffs On EU, Apple","Before President Trump reignited what had been cooling trade tensions, Bitcoin blasted through $111,000 yesterday, setting a new all-time high. But the President’s threat of new tariffs against the EU and Apple sparked a retreat to near $108,000 today. Renewed Trade War Fears Rattle Crypto Prices Bitcoin quickly reversed after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting next month. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin nosedived 2.2% to hit $108,319 lows before rebounding slightly to $108,438 at press time, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” Trump also threatened Apple, the $3 trillion iPhone maker, stating that iPhones sold in America must be built domestically or face a 25% tariff. The ultimatum to Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared aimed at the tech giant’s extensive overseas manufacturing footprint. Bitcoin’s pullback came less than 24 hours after it smashed a new all-time high of $111,980, exceeding the previous record of nearly $109K set in January. The Bitcoin price had been on a tear following its increasing correlation with gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, and growing concerns about Japan’s and the US’s fiscal health. Moreover, increased corporate and institutional allocation, including frequent BTC buys by publicly traded companies like Strategy and MARA Holdings, alongside positive inflows into US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, further strengthens Bitcoin’s market position. Bitcoin’s recent correction reflects cautious sentiment among traders. The crypto market’s knee-jerk reaction implies that cryptocurrencies remain sensitive to macroeconomic and political developments. “$BTC There’s the break from the compression with a push from Trump. Markets worldwide obviously not liking the news,” widely-followed crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades opined in a post on X. “Will have to see where this settles today and how BTC ends up performing relative to equities now the trade uncertainty is back.” Ether (ETH) and other major altcoins were sliding, too. ETH has lost 2.9% of its value since yesterday and is currently trading for just above $2,562. XRP has fallen 2.5% over the last 24 hours and is currently trading for $2.37. Meanwhile, the leading meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) was down 2.1% during the same period, changing hands at $0.2360 as of publication time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/doge-xrp-slump-while-bitcoin-slips-under-109000-amid-president-trumps-new-tariffs-on-eu-apple/,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T13:52:46.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy as Bitcoin’s Largest-Ever Options Expiry Set to Push the King Crypto over $110K","Bitcoin is headed towards its largest option expiry of 2025 at around $13.8B on May 30. Just a week earlier, the OG crypto crossed its previous high of $109K and made a new all-time high. However, over the past week, the prices have corrected by around 3%, meaning $BTC is now trading at around $108K . The battle between the bulls and the bears has gotten intense, and we expect a great tussle between the two to keep $BTC prices above $109K. In this article, we’ll provide a complete breakdown of the current Bitcoin option expiry scenario. We’ll also suggest the best crypto to buy now to benefit from $BTC’s potential rally. $109K Is a Crucial Level for $BTC Option data shows that the $109K level is the most crucial level for Bitcoin option traders. Out of the total options, $6.5B are put options. However, 95% of put options are below $109K. So, if $BTC stays above this level, 95% of these options will expire worthless, meaning they’ll lead to a loss for bears. Short sellers were already caught off guard by Bitcoin’s 25% rally in the last 30 days. Conversely, there are around $3.8B worth of call options up to $109K. This means that bulls will earn massive profit if $BTC holds above this level. Institutional data shows that there was a net flow of $1.9B Bitcoin ETFs between May 20 and May 22. This proves that corporations are still buying BTC above $105K. The only hope for bears at this point is a macroeconomic shock or news that could see Bitcoin tumble to a certain extent. It’s worth noting that there’s also an open interest of $79B in the Bitcoin futures market with a lot of short positions. This indicates that bears are trying their best to ensure Bitcoin doesn’t sustain the $109K mark come May 30. That said, the bulls seem to be more in control of the markets as of now. Here’s a table to help you understand. BTC Expiry Price Calls Puts Net Between $102K and $105K $2.75B $0.9B $1.85B – Call Side Between $105K and $107K $3.3B $0.65B $2.65B – Call Side Between $107K and $110K $3.7B $0.35B $3.35B – Call Side Between $110K and $114K $4.8B $0.12B $4.70B – Call Side As you can see, under all four scenarios, it is the bulls that ultimately benefit. The higher Bitcoin goes from here, the more profit bulls take home. With just seven days left in the month, one can expect a bit of volatility in the Bitcoin market. However, the bias is largely green, with experts having already predicted that $BTC might cross $200K by the end of the year. If you want to ride this potentially once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, here are some top altcoins you can invest in right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) stands out from other Bitcoin-inspired altcoins because it’s the only one offering free $BTC airdrops to its token holders. It’s the best crypto to invest in if you want to make the most of Bitcoin’s upcoming rally without having to shell out an eye-watering sum to invest in Bitcoin itself, which is currently priced at over $108K. Every time Bitcoin pushes through a new landmark, such as $150K, $200K, or $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders will automatically receive their share of free $BTC. It’s worth noting, though, that you must store your purchased $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . Additionally, the project will also follow a deflationary approach, meaning a part of the total token supply will be shaved off at regular intervals – every time Bitcoin’s price rises by $25K, to be precise. A continuously decreasing token supply will ensure the demand continues to increase, which will ultimately boost the token’s trading volume and price. To join the ‘Bull Army,’ buy $BTCBULL today . Luckily for you, the project is still in presale ($6.2M+ raised), meaning you can grab it for a low price of $0.002525. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever L2 on Solana with $40M in Presale Funding Solaxy ($SOLX) is one of the best crypto presales on the market today, and for good reason. After all, it’s set out to resolve Solana’s congestion and scalability issues. After the successful launches of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, Solana saw an unprecedented increase in investor activity. This overwhelmed the otherwise meme coin-friendly blockchain, resulting in failed transactions. Solaxy, however, will solve this by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. It will offload a huge chunk of the transactions from Solana’s mainnet onto a sidechain, thereby reducing the burden on Solana and cranking up its efficiency. Moreover, the L2 will also execute transactions in batches – rather than one by one – which will improve Solana’s affordability, as the fees required per transaction will go down. With Solana set to take center stage in the rapidly growing DeFi landscape, Solaxy is going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this movement. Don’t miss out on possibly the next crypto to explode and buy Solaxy now for just $0.001734. Hurry up, though, because the presale ends in around three weeks, following which $SOLX will be live on all major exchanges. Our Solaxy price prediction suggests that the token could explode 11,500% and reach $0.20 by 2030. 3. Trump Dinner ($DINNER) – Donald Trump’s Historic ‘Crypto Dinner’ Has a Meme Coin $DINNER is the newest addition to the list of Trump-inspired meme coins that have taken the market by storm. As the name suggests, Trump Dinner is based on Donald Trump’s unprecedented move to invite the top holders of the $TRUMP meme coin for an exclusive dinner gala . As per the announcement on the OFFICIAL TRUMP website, the top 220 holders of $TRUMP will be invited to Donald Trump’s private Virginia golf club. The ‘crypto dinner,’ which has raised both appreciation and scrutiny from the crowd, is scheduled for tonight, i.e., May 24. So, in the lead-up to it, $DINNER, a new meme coin based on the event, has painted the town red (green). $DINNER launched just a couple of days ago and has already gained over 180,000%. It’s up close to 1,000% in the past 24 hours and shows no signs of stopping until, at least, a few days after the dinner. That’s because, according to the aforementioned announcement, the top 25 $TRUMP holders will be invited to a ‘special tour’ and ‘private VIP reception with the President.’ DYOR Before Investing in the Best Crypto to Buy Despite $BTC’s confidence-inspiring form, it’s worth remembering that the crypto market is rife with volatile news events and, therefore, uncertainty. Invest carefully and ideally only an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, kindly do your own research.

The company acquired an additional 455 BTC — its third-largest purchase since adopting a Bitcoin standard roughly one year ago. Semler Buys Millions More In Bitcoin According to the May 23 8-K filing, Semler Scientific spent $50 million on 455 BTC between May 13 and May 22, 2025, at an average purchase price of $109,801 per coin. The company bought the Bitcoin using proceeds from its $500 million at-the-market offering program. The company has issued 3,003,488 shares under its April 15 $500 million ATM program, raking in $114.8 million. Semler now holds a total of 4,264 BTC, valued at roughly $474.4 million. It bought the BTC for an aggregate of $390 million at an average cost basis of $91,471. The medical device company has been aggressively purchasing Bitcoin since last year, mirroring the playbook pioneered by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its Chairman and renowned Bitcoin supporter, Michael Saylor. Semler’s BTC Yield has jumped to 25.8% in 2025. BTC yield, a performance indicator popularized by Saylor and Strategy, refers to the ratio of a company’s Bitcoin holdings and its assumed diluted shares outstanding. At 4,264 BTC, the company’s Bitcoin treasury ranks 13th in size among publicly traded companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Corporate Treasury Boom Software intelligence company Strategy started buying BTC in 2020 at the behest of former CEO Michael Saylor. Since then, the company has amassed a 576,230 BTC stash, worth approximately $62 million at current prices. There are now over 70 firms that have incorporated a Bitcoin treasury, with Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Bitfinex, and Tether recently announcing the forthcoming launch of a $3.6 billion Bitcoin venture, Twenty One. Other companies, including Japanese investment firm Metaplanet , have also followed in Strategy’s footsteps and continue stacking the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/healthcare-tech-firm-semler-scientific-increases-bitcoin-bag-to-4264-btc-with-latest-purchase/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T13:45:38.000Z,"Why BTC Bull Token Is a Must-Watch in the Bitcoin Bull Market","The Bitcoin bull market is back in full swing, and experts are predicting big things for the cryptocurrency in the coming months. Bitcoin could be headed towards a potential $125K by the end of Q2, as mentioned by Bybit’s Head of Derivatives, Shunyet Jan. As Bitcoin prices rise, so do the opportunities for investors to capitalize on the bullish trend. One such opportunity is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , which is positioned to benefit directly from Bitcoin’s upcoming rally. As the market heats up, $BTCBULL offers a unique way for investors to tap into the Bitcoin surge with amplified potential. If you’re looking for a way to leverage the bull market, $BTCBULL might be the token to watch. Bitcoin’s Bull Market: What You Need to Know Bitcoin’s market is experiencing significant growth, with promising trends pointing to an even brighter future.Recent reports show that short-term traders have already realized $11.6B in profits, as Bitcoin’s price consolidates after a strong run. Many experts believe that this pause in price action is simply a breather before Bitcoin embarks on its next major rally. Analysts from ByBit are now forecasting that Bitcoin could surge to $125K by the end of Q2, driven by factors like growing institutional interest, increasing adoption, and a broader favorable market environment. This optimistic outlook is further bolstered by Bitcoin’s historical behavior during bull runs, where increased demand and market confidence push prices to new heights. With Bitcoin showing signs of strength and the global crypto market continuing to mature, there’s a solid foundation for further growth. As bullish momentum builds, many are looking to capitalize on this wave by investing in new crypto projects that stand to benefit from Bitcoin’s continued rise. What is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL)? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme-powered, community-driven cryptocurrency designed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s monumental rise. This innovative token rewards holders with real Bitcoin every time Bitcoin hits key price milestones, such as $150K, or $200K. But only if you buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . Unlike traditional meme coins that offer no tangible benefit, $BTCBULL directly links its value to Bitcoin’s growth. Additionally, as Bitcoin reaches important price points, like $125K, $175K, and $225K, $BTCBULL undergoes token burns, permanently reducing supply and increasing scarcity. This mechanism can boost the token’s value, rewarding holders over time. $BTCBULL is the first Bitcoin-themed meme coin that combines fun with real financial benefits, making it an attractive option for investors looking to gain from Bitcoin’s rise without needing to own an entire Bitcoin. Thanks to its partnership with Best Wallet, $BTCBULL holders can buy the token on Ethereum and receive $BTC rewards directly into their wallets – no need for complex Bitcoin wallets or BRC-20 transactions. Why Should You Invest in $BTCBULL? $BTCBULL presents a unique opportunity to profit from Bitcoin’s upcoming bull market. With a current price of just $0.00253 and $6.2M raised in its crypto presale , the token is positioned for significant growth. Experts predict that by the end of 2025, $BTCBULL could reach as high as $0.06467 – an increase of over 2,400% from its current value. If you stake 100K $BTCBULL tokens at today’s price, you’d be looking at an investment of just $253. With a 15% APY, you’d have 115K tokens after one year. At a conservative forecast price of $0.0302 in 2025, your tokens would be worth $3,473 – a potential profit of $3,220. And at the upper end of the forecast, $BTCBULL could reach $0.06467, bringing your investment to $7,456. This combination of Bitcoin rewards, staking opportunities, and token burns makes $BTCBULL an excellent choice for investors looking to maximize gains during Bitcoin’s bull run. Your Best Bet in the Bitcoin Bull Market The Bitcoin bull market offers incredible opportunities, and BTC Bull Token is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this. As Bitcoin rises, BTC Bull Token rewards holders with real Bitcoin, providing an additional layer of profit. The token’s deflationary model, with token burns at key price milestones, increases scarcity and potential value. With a low entry price and substantial growth potential, it’s an excellent way to amplify your gains during the Bitcoin surge.

2025-05-24T13:40:00.000Z,"Hidden DeFi altcoin trading at $0.03 could be your biggest winner in this bull cycle","Many top crypto analysts believe that the market is drawing closer to one of the biggest bull cycles in recent memory. They believe that this bull cycle could push the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to $250k, and achieve a new market cap for the overall crypto industry. The question on most investors’ minds right now is how they can maximize possible returns in this cycle. One of the best strategies has always been to invest in tokens with a low entry point and that show potential for great utility. Thus far, that category falls squarely on one DeFi altcoin that you may not have heard of until now – Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly rising One reason why you may not have heard of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) yet is that this innovative project is still in the presale phase. However, those with a keen eye in the crypto world have already identified it as a potential candidate for massive gains in this bull cycle. A major reason for the hype surrounding the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is the unique lending structure that it utilizes. The project uses a unique approach to decentralized lending, where lenders can earn an annual percentage yield while maintaining full utility of their assets. Until now, most DeFi lending platforms only allow users to lock up their assets for a defined period, while losing all potential utility of those assets. With Mutuum Finance (MUTM). That model is erased, thanks to the use of an innovative technology called mtTokens. A deep dive into mtTokens The mtTokens are designed to the on-chain representation of a lender’s deposit into the liquidity pools. When a user deposits $5000 worth of ETH for instance, they will receive mtETH tokens, which correspond to the share of their deposit in the pool. Additionally, these mtTokens accumulate value in real time that corresponds to the principal amount they deposited, as well as the interest they accrue. Since these tokens are built on the ERC-20 token standard, they can be moved to third party protocols, and even sold on secondary markets. A holding of mtTokens is essentially a representation of your fractional ownership in the lending pool. Over time, the value that can be redeemed from this pool increases based on the pool’s utilization. The entire process is controlled by smart contracts, which ensures it is verifiable, boosting transparency and confidence in the ecosystem. This process ensures that users do not need to actively compound their gains. It ensures that every incremental increase in your asset, and interests is recorded on-chain. The result is that holders can easily monitor their portfolio, or transfer their deposit positions across more beneficial lending scenarios within the ecosystem. Boosting liquidity through a stablecoin A chronic challenge that many DeFi protocols run into is that they often run into liquidity crunches. To deal with this challenge, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will create a stablecoin, which is designed to boost liquidity without the need for a dedicated asset pool. Borrowers can lock in eligible collateral in excess of the nominal value of the stablecoin to mint new tokens on demand. The overcollateralization helps to deal with another common challenge called de-pegging. It comes with numerous mechanisms that ensure the price is always stabilized at $1, mainly through their use of arbitrage. The stablecoin offers a huge advantage for borrowers, in that it allows them to unlock the full potential of their assets, without having to sell the underlying asset. Due to the volatile nature of crypto, these underlying assets could potentially appreciate over time. Dividend payments on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dividend payments is a concept reserved mainly for the legacy financial system until now. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a buyback and distribute mechanism, similar to dividend payments has been implemented. Once the protocol goes live, stakers will receive part of the fees collected from various activities on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project will have a leaderboard, with the biggest stakers getting huge bonus rewards for their effort to support the system’s health. Join the future with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating the future of finance, and you have a rare opportunity to join this revolution while it is still on the ground floor. With a current presale price of $0.03, it offers a lucrative entry point. In the next phase, the price is set to rise by 16.67%, which would have a slight impact on your potential profitability. With investors already eyeing 100% from the current price of $0.03 to the listing price of $0.06, getting in now guarantees you can double your investment in just a few weeks.

2025-05-24T13:35:25.000Z,"Bitcoin Realized Profits At Normal Levels —  BTC Upward Run To Continue?","Bitcoin has had an interesting run so far in 2025, embarking on exciting upside rallies and enduring deep corrections in the space of a few months. The latest upward movement suggests the return of interest and confidence in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. After surpassing its previous all-time high price this week, the Bitcoin price has printed a new high of $111,814 — reached on Thursday, May 22. A fresh all-time-high price is often followed by a major correction, as investors are typically inclined to take profits. However, recent on-chain revelation suggests this Bitcoin bull run might be here to stay — and maybe for a longer period than expected. Analyst Says Realized Profits Yet To Signal Market Top In a May 23 post on social media platform X, on-chain crypto analyst Darkfost revealed that the net realized profits by Bitcoin investors remain normal for a bull phase. The relevant indicator backing this assertion is the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which measures the net profit or loss (in USD) of all coins spent on the network over a specific timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Smashes Past $111K, But Are Traders About to Dump? This on-chain metric is calculated by finding the difference between the realized profit and realized loss of crypto investors. Positive values from the metric indicate that coins are being spent at a higher price than they were acquired, resulting in a net profit. On the other hand, negative values indicate that coins are being spent at prices lower than they were bought, resulting in a net loss. Neutral values simply suggest that coins are being spent close to their acquisition price. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, realized profits are currently at a high level of about 104,000 BTC (a rough equivalent of $11 billion). The analyst, however, pointed out that while this figure is substantial, it still falls short of the 350,000 BTC threshold level (a level which has historically signaled potential tops and preceded major correctional movements of Bitcoin). Darkfost inferred from the highlighted data that the net realized profit for a Bitcoin bull phase is currently at a normal level. The analyst noted the necessity of profit-taking in a bull market, implicitly preaching against fear amongst investors. Darkfost said about profit-taking: It’s what keeps investors engaged in the market and helps sustain the bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $108,360, reflecting a more than 2% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-24T13:34:00.000Z,"Bitcoin ETFs boast inflows as IBIT closes the gap with GLD","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, had another strong week as inflows surged to a record level. Investors added $2.7 billion to Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs, the biggest weekly increase since April when they added $3.06 billion. These funds have now had inflows for six consecutive weeks, bringing the cumulative inflows since inception to $44.53 billion. They all hold $131 billion in assets, equivalent to 6.24% of Bitcoin’s valuation. Bitcoin ETF inflows | Source: SoSoValue The iShares Bitcoin ETF, whose ticker symbol is IBIT, has had cumulative inflows of $48 billion and now hold over $71 billion in assets. It is followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $21 billion, and Grayscale’s $21.7 billion. The other big funds are from Ark Invest, BitWise, and VanEck.

Interestingly, IBIT, 16 months old, is catching up to the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which has been around since 2004. The GLD ETF has had $4.9 billion in inflows this year, bringing its total assets to $100 billion. As such, if the trend continues, it means that the IBIT ETF will flip GLD in the next few months or years. Bitcoin ETFs may also pass their gold counterparts in the coming years. According to the World Gold Council, the global assets under management of gold ETFs have jumped to over $345 billion as the price rallies. Bitcoin has been in a strong uptrend this year. On Wednesday, it jumped to a record high of nearly $112,000. On Friday, it retreated to $107,500 after President Donald Trump threatened a 50% tariff on European goods and a 25% levy on Apple’s products. Analysts remain optimistic that the Bitcoin price has more room to go, as the supply and demand dynamics help it. Demand from ETFs and corporates continues rising, while supply on exchanges keeps falling. Mining difficulty also increases, lowering the number of coins coming to the market. Ark Invest analysts predict that BTC’s price will jump to $2.4 million by the end of the decade, while Standard Chartered sees it hitting $200,000 this year.

2025-05-24T13:22:53.000Z,"ChatGPT Sets Cardano (ADA) Price for June 1, 2025","Bitcoin recently crossed $110,000 for the first time, and the crypto world is excited as altcoins are expected to follow this notable surge. As of May 24, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.76, marking a decline of over 7% in the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term volatility, the community is eager to see how high it can climb by the beginning of June. For insight into ADA’s potential trajectory, we consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT for a prediction of ADA’s price by June 1, 2025, setting a target range of $0.72 to $0.82. Current Price Trend and Outlook Cardano (ADA) has recently traded in a relatively narrow band between $0.7 and $0.83 over the past month. According to ChatGPT, the coin is “in a sideways-to-slightly-bullish pattern with no major breakout yet.” This reflects a market lacking strong momentum but showing resilience above its lower support levels. In the absence of a decisive trend, ADA appears to be consolidating. This price behavior suggests that investors are waiting for clearer signals, potentially from Bitcoin’s price movements or broader economic developments. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios While the baseline projection remains at $0.72 to $0.82, ChatGPT outlines potential deviations under different conditions. Bullish Case: ChatGPT stated that if altcoins rally in response to Bitcoin’s growth with strong trading volume, ADA could reach between $0.85 and $0.90. Bearish Case: If negative sentiment intensifies due to macroeconomic factors such as regulatory developments or interest rate changes, ADA could fall to a range of $0.65 and $0.68. Market Sentiment and Broader Conditions ChatGPT noted that the general sentiment across the cryptocurrency market is “cautiously optimistic heading into the summer.” With Bitcoin dominance remaining high, altcoins like Cardano tend to move more slowly in response to bullish momentum. As a result, ADA is expected to “continue slowly climbing unless there’s a sharp macro shift.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 ChatGPT also noted that no significant upgrades or releases are expected within the Cardano ecosystem before June 1 that could cause rapid growth. Potential Bullish Catalysts Historically, years following Bitcoin halvings have been favorable for altcoins. The last halving occurred in April 2024, setting the stage for potential growth in 2025. However, the AI-powered chatbot emphasizes that June may still be preparatory. Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson is also working to expand the network by collaborating with Bitcoin and XRP . If these partnerships pay off, the asset could experience significant growth. Cardano has also made significant strides in 2025, and despite its lack of momentum over the past few months, these upgrades and changes could soon start contributing to its growth.

2025-05-24T13:22:19.000Z,"Calls to ban cash in war on drugs stirs cash-loving France","A minister’s proposal to ban cash as a crime-curbing measure has reignited public debate in France on the future of paper money and metal coins, still widely used in the country. The official himself admitted it will take some time and effort to convince French citizens to abandon their tangible money, as there is currently no political consensus on the matter. French minister claims banning cash will help fight drug crime Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin has sparked discussions in France by suggesting that ending cash will improve results in combating narcotics distribution. Use of bank cards and payment apps has been growing in the country, but as the politician recognized, cash is still important for his compatriots. Darmanin pitched the idea during an appearance at the Senate, the upper house of parliament, on Thursday. His move rekindled debate on the fate of cash in the French Republic, a member of the European Union and its single currency area, the eurozone. Quoted by La Tribune, he stated: “How do we stop drugs from spreading in our neighborhoods? There’s a fairly simple measure: banning cash will prevent the establishment of drug dealing points.” The topic has been a subject of frequent rumors and disinformation campaigns on social media, the French weekly noted in an article, which also emphasized that “access to cash is a sensitive social issue” and “eliminating it would require political consensus and societal support.” A number of European governments have been trying to reduce its use, including the current one in Spain, where demand for cash spiked amid last month’s catastrophic power outage that disrupted electronic payments and took ATMs out of service. Gérald Darmanin: \""Je l'ai dit (…) à ceux qui m'interrogent pour savoir comment on arrête la drogue dans nos quartiers. Une mesure assez simple : la fin de l'argent liquide empêchera les points de deal\"" #BFM2 pic.twitter.com/jBjvGMi4KZ — BFMTV (@BFMTV) May 22, 2025 Cash is still quite popular in France, where people are often using paper money for everyday purchases, prompting the Bank of France to acknowledge in February that “a very large majority of French people continue to value cash and recognize its many benefits.” Despite card payments overtaking cash transactions in France for the first time last year, the European Central Bank’s survey on consumer payment habits, published in December 2024, also showed that cash still accounts for 43% of all French payments. No consensus on ending paper money yet Speaking in the studio of the French broadcaster RTL on Friday, Gérald Darmanin took a step back for the sake of being “realistic.” Asked to comment on his proposal to fight drug crime by prohibiting physical money, he conceded that authorities “don’t have the political means” to do that right now. That would “obviously require a long discussion with the French people,” said Darmanin, a former minister of the interior. “It is a public debate that should undoubtedly be raised in a presidential campaign, for example,” he elaborated. The withdrawal of all cash from circulation in France, leading producer of banknotes and coins in the eurozone, would represent a massive logistical challenge comparable to the introduction of the euro a quarter century ago, La Tribune pointed out. It will also threaten jobs at Banque de France’s paper mill, printing works and minting facility. Europeans still searching for alternatives to cash Besides card payments, mobile transactions in France have been growing as well, with their share increasing from 1% in 2019 to 6% of payments last year. However, both of these alternatives raise questions about French and European sovereignty as payment providers, like Visa or Apple Pay, are all American. The ECB has been promoting its upcoming digital euro currency as an answer to such questions – a sovereign European coin that should allegedly complement, not substitute cash. But the project has caused other concerns , including fears about privacy, which the monetary authority has tried to address . Despite growing distrust in digital technology, the “elimination of cash” is “definitely on people’s minds,” the French crypto news outlet Journal du Coin insisted in a post, while suggesting that blockchain may be the answer and poking the government official: “Mr. Darmanin, what’s your opinion on Bitcoin?” Cryptocurrencies “will become increasingly important,” the minister of justice said in his remarks for French media, as if he had anticipated that question. But they are more “traceable,” he also noted, adding fuel to the ongoing debate in France.

2025-05-24T13:20:12.000Z,"Ripple CEO Discusses Game-Changing Potential That Could Make XRP Take Over SWIFT in Worldwide Transactions","In a compelling update shared by Ripple Pundit on X, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse spotlighted XRP’s revolutionary potential in transforming global transactions. Garlinghouse emphasized that XRP, the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger, offers a breakthrough solution for the long-standing inefficiencies plaguing international payments, especially compared to the entrenched SWIFT system . His remarks underline XRP’s growing prominence and suggest a future where XRP could surpass SWIFT as the dominant cross-border settlement mechanism. CEO of Ripple Discusses the Game-Changing Potential of $XRP to Take Over SWIFT in Worldwide Transactions 1/4 Check Thread pic.twitter.com/rhpsngRzgG — Ripple Pundit (@RipplePundit) May 23, 2025 Breaking Free from Pre-Funded Accounts Traditionally, global banks relying on SWIFT must maintain pre-funded accounts — known as nostro and vostro accounts — in multiple countries to ensure liquidity for cross-border transactions. This practice locks up billions of dollars in dormant funds worldwide, creating complexity, inefficiency, and increased costs. Garlinghouse noted that Ripple’s solution, utilizing XRP, provides instant liquidity, removing the need for pre-funded reserves. This innovation means institutions can instantly access the funds they need for international transfers without cumbersome pre-arrangements. Compared to SWIFT transactions that can take days to settle and clear, XRP transactions finalize in mere seconds , fundamentally reshaping the speed at which money moves globally. According to Garlinghouse, this efficiency leap places XRP far ahead of SWIFT and Bitcoin, which, despite its fame, struggles with slower transaction speeds and high energy consumption. Real-World Adoption and Institutional Trust Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s vision is no longer just theoretical ; XRP is already used in live environments by financial institutions worldwide. Banks and payment providers are leveraging Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, powered by XRP, to bridge cross-border payments without intermediaries. This real-world traction has fueled growing confidence among XRP holders, institutional partners, and market analysts who believe that Ripple’s approach is uniquely positioned to challenge SWIFT’s long-standing monopoly over international finance. Significantly, Garlinghouse revealed in the accompanying video clip that Ripple is collaborating with several central banks globally. While only some of these partnerships have been publicly disclosed, Ripple is actively involved in testing and experimentation phases, enabling central banks to issue their Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on the XRP Ledger. This development places Ripple at the heart of the emerging CBDC movement, further strengthening its potential to become the backbone of future global payments infrastructure. Sustainability and User Simplicity One of the most compelling aspects of XRP, especially for institutional adoption, is its superior energy efficiency compared to other digital assets like Bitcoin. As global regulators and financial institutions increasingly prioritize sustainability, XRP’s low-energy consensus mechanism offers a decisive edge. Moreover, Ripple’s infrastructure is designed so that users, including banks and payment platforms, do not need to hold or manage cryptocurrency directly. Instead, the technology operates seamlessly in the background, automatically conducting XRP transactions to facilitate liquidity and settlement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This simplicity removes a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. This aligns well with the operational needs of large financial institutions, which often hesitate to deal directly with crypto assets due to regulatory and custodial concerns. By handling the complexity under the hood, Ripple makes it easier for institutions to tap into the benefits of blockchain without overhauling their existing systems or assuming unnecessary risks. A Strong Case to Challenge SWIFT’s Dominance While SWIFT has been the backbone of international banking for decades, the emergence of blockchain technology and digital assets like XRP has exposed its limitations. Garlinghouse’s vision for Ripple is not merely to coexist alongside SWIFT but to provide a fundamentally superior alternative , a faster, cheaper, greener, and more flexible option. With banks increasingly leveraging XRP for liquidity and integrating CBDCs on the XRP Ledger, Ripple is poised to revolutionize the global payments landscape. Ripple Pundit’s report underscores the growing momentum behind Ripple’s ambitions, reflecting the broader confidence within the XRP community and beyond. As the financial sector and regulators pursue digital innovation, Ripple’s technology is well-positioned to transform cross-border payments and challenge SWIFT’s long-standing dominance. With real-world utility, institutional trust, energy efficiency, and seamless integration, XRP may hold the keys to the future of global finance — a future where cross-border payments are instant, cost-effective, and universally accessible. If Ripple’s vision materializes as Garlinghouse envisions, XRP could become the core engine driving the next generation of international money movement.

2025-05-24T13:16:57.000Z,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Hits $2,550 Alongside Bitcoin Surge — Is Their Price Connection Getting Stronger?","Ethereum is at $2,556, up 0.56% in the last 24 hours with a trading volume of $17.6 billion as it rides Bitcoin’s coattails in a volatile market. As the price action follows Bitcoin’s up move, questions arise if they are getting more correlated and if Ethereum will break out. Regulatory Clarity Brings Institutional Confidence Hester Peirce, head of the SEC’s Crypto Working Group , clarified this week that node operation, validation, and software services in Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) systems are not securities activities. This directly addresses institutional concerns over staking and regulatory risk. Her statement marks a shift from past SEC actions, such as the 2023 Kraken case that limited centralized staking services. It’s seen as an opening for U.S. institutions to increase participation in staking protocols. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) has welcomed this clarification, highlighting increased confidence in the regulatory environment. For Ethereum, the largest PoS network, this signals potential growth in staking, liquidity, and network resilience. With a $308.6 billion market cap and 9.02% market share, Ethereum stands to benefit from rising institutional engagement. Ethereum Technical Analysis Point to Breakout Ethereum price prediction seems bullish as 2 hour chart is showing a higher lows pattern from the $2,272 pivot, so the bullish momentum is sustained. Price is hovering around the 50 period EMA at $2,571—a key technical level. A close above this level, especially with a bullish MACD crossover could trigger a move to $2,737 and $2,849 resistance zones. Trendline Support : The ascending trendline is acting as dynamic support in pullbacks. Candlestick Patterns : Spinning tops at $2,523 mean market is indecisive, while bullish engulfing candles mean upward momentum. Key Levels to Watch : Break above $2,626 could push ETH higher, while downside pivots are at $2,523 and $2,500 for risk management. MACD : MACD is neutral with slight bearish bias. A green crossover would be bullish. Look for classic bullish patterns like three white soldiers or RSI divergence on lower timeframes to confirm the breakout. Conclusion: Next Leg Up for Ethereum? Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s price action so correlation is tightening due to broader market and regulatory clarity. With institutional confidence rising and technicals pointing to a breakout, ETH could go to $2,737 and $2,849 soon. But traders should watch support levels and confirm momentum before going long. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the ETH/USD pair hovers near $2,550, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-24T13:13:00.000Z,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $2.75B Weekly Inflows as BTC Hits New Highs","Key Takeaways: Spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in $2.75 billion this week, nearly 4.5x the prior week’s inflows. Institutional players, led by BlackRock’s IBIT and firms like Strategy, are driving the rally while retail participation remains muted. Despite record inflows and price gains, on-chain metrics suggest Bitcoin’s current run is not yet overheated. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a surge in demand, pulling in $2.75 billion in inflows this week as Bitcoin broke past its January all-time high of $109,000 and touched a new peak of $111,970. The figure represents a nearly 4.5x increase over the previous week’s $608 million inflow, according to data from Farside. On May 23 alone, ETFs attracted $211.7 million in net inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leading the pack by adding $430.8 million—marking its eighth straight day of net gains. BlackRock Continues to Dominate ETF Inflows While BlackRock continues to dominate ETF inflows, Grayscale’s GBTC shed $89.2 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $73.9 million in outflows. This spike in inflows comes amid heightened Bitcoin activity. On May 21, the same day Bitcoin crossed $109,000, ETFs saw $607.1 million in inflows. The upward momentum pushed Bitcoin to a new all-time high the next day, though the price has since experienced a mild pullback. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall sentiment, dropped from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 to 66 in the past 24 hours, reflecting more cautious market behavior despite record prices. Notably, May could break the monthly ETF inflow record of $6.49 billion set in November 2024. With five trading days left, spot Bitcoin ETFs have already drawn $5.39 billion. Analysts remain optimistic. On-chain data suggests the rally is not yet overheated. CryptoQuant’s Crypto Dan noted that funding rates and short-term capital inflows remain low, and profit-taking from short-term investors is minimal — signs that BTC’s upward trajectory may have more room to run. Bitcoin Hits All-Time High – Still Not Overheated “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate & short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, & profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/kqyzFSwzfd — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 22, 2025 Institutions Take the Wheel in Bitcoin Rally The current bull market is being driven primarily by institutional capital rather than the wave of individual buyers seen in past cycles, according to a recent report from Matrixport. “This rally is unfolding largely without retail participation,” analysts wrote. “Instead of the usual buzz and euphoria, there’s a noticeable absence of retail momentum.” Matrixport said there has been a clear shift in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. In previous bull runs, individual investors often led the charge, with social media hype and FOMO fueling rapid price gains. But this time, large institutions, motivated by Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation, are steering the market. “We’re witnessing a steady and quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters, miners, and exchanges to a new class of investors, primarily corporations,” the report noted. Among those leading the institutional push is Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, 204 institutions currently hold BTC, with more than half being public companies. In just the last month, 11 new firms added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Strategy recently announced a plan to raise $2.1 billion through Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, with proceeds potentially going toward further BTC acquisitions.

Crypto ETFs offer Wall Street institutions direct access to crypto, simplifying trading. XRP’s future ETFs and Bitcoin ETF success show increasing institutional crypto adoption. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, recently spoke on the “Crypto in One Minute” podcast about the benefits of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This event takes place only a few days after the first XRP futures ETF made its launch on the Nasdaq exchange.

Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill Gains Traction The Texas Bitcoin Reserve Bill got a major boost when Governor Greg Abbott endorsed SB 21 on May 22. SB 21 passed the Texas House recently and proposes creating a state Bitcoin reserve. Abbott’s support, in line with his goal to make Texas a crypto hub by 2024, puts the state alongside Arizona and New Hampshire in pro-crypto legislation. Texas is positioning #Bitcoin as a state-level strategic asset. Governor Greg Abbott signals support for a bill to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/C7pvktZ66K — TFTC (@TFTC21) May 23, 2025 Meanwhile, Congress has yet to pass national Bitcoin reserve measures, despite a prior executive order under former President Trump. A state-driven Bitcoin reserve would give investors a lot of confidence, and this could be the catalyst for BTC to break past $110K. Crackdown on Crypto Scams Boosts Market Confidence On May 23, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that $2.5 million in stolen cryptocurrencies has been recovered from scams targeting FOMO investors. The FBI’s San Diego branch coordinated the recovery, which was ordered by a federal judge. \""A large number of validators identified the addresses with the stolen funds and are ignoring transactions on those addresses until further notice.\"" HUH? pic.twitter.com/pTbywpBT5k — JSHy | Josh Marchand (@JSHyCS) May 22, 2025 These scams preyed on inexperienced investors with promises of high returns. The recovery highlights the government’s growing efforts to clean up the crypto market. These regulatory crackdowns, with the help of firms like Tether, will increase public trust in digital assets. As transparency and enforcement rise, the crypto market becomes more attractive and could fuel Bitcoin’s rise. Institutional Adoption Soars with Semler’s $50M Bitcoin Buy And to top it all off, Semler Scientific bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing their total holdings to 455 BTC, now worth $474.4 million. BULLISH: Semler Scientific acquired 174 #Bitcoin worth $17.8M, yielding 22.2% $BTC returns YTD, now holding a total of 3,808 $BTC . pic.twitter.com/AHOlUk7INK — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 14, 2025 The company’s stock dropped 1.36% after the announcement, but has gained 53% since they started buying Bitcoin in May 2024, despite quarterly revenue declines of 44%. Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin buying is part of a bigger trend of companies treating BTC as a treasury asset. This increases market stability by bringing in more institutions and reducing supply—something that could push prices up. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as on the 2-hour chart, BTC has a higher-low pattern supported by the 50-period EMA ($108,470) and the trendline from $105,905–$107,048. Resistance is at $109,613 (23.6% Fibonacci) and a breakout could go to $111,935 or $113,478. Look for bullish candlestick patterns like three white soldiers or RSI divergence to confirm the uptrend. BTC Bull Token Nears $7.14M Cap as 71% Staking Yield Fuels FOMO As the BTC/USD pair hovers near $108K, attention is rapidly turning to high-upside altcoins — and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is stealing the spotlight. With $6.17 million raised out of its $7.14 million cap, momentum is accelerating as the next presale price jump closes in fast. What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique rewards model — token holders receive Bitcoin airdrops directly tied to BTC’s price rallies. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more BTC gets distributed — with presale buyers receiving priority rewards over post-launch DEX investors. Key Stats: USDT Raised: $6,221,583.95 / $7,136,435 Token Price: $0.002525 Staking Pool: 1.47B BTCBULL Yield: ~71% APY Built-in scarcity adds even more firepower: every time Bitcoin rises by $50K, BTC Bull triggers a token burn, reducing supply and increasing upside potential for long-term holders. Meanwhile, staking is turning heads. BTCBULL offers a whopping ~71% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.47B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield — with full liquidity.

2025-05-24T12:50:00.000Z,"Top two crypto projects to watch in May 2025: Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)","May 2025 has been an exciting month for crypto investors, with Bitcoin (BTC) breaking past the $105K mark at one point. Many of the top crypto coins are already rallying, which creates the perfect conditions to identify the next major winner before it takes off. Thus far, crypto enthusiasts have settled on two promising projects, which are Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano’s (ADA) rise Cardano (ADA) has been around for a few years now, which speaks to its quality as a DeFi project. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will incorporate all the legacy features developed by the project with the latest breakthroughs in DeFi for a truly unique ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising the stakes in the crypto world, and the crypto sector is eagerly awaiting its launch. Additionally, this new project offers prospective buyers the rare opportunity to be part of a truly innovative platform at just a few cents per token. The rise of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTRM) has been quietly innovating in the background, and is now ready to emerge as top contender for the DeFi throne. This project offers both massive growth potential, and great utility for its users. The project is currently in phase 5 of its presale, and has managed to raise over $9,2 million, from over 11,000 buyers. This phase of the presale is less than 24 hours old, and over 2% of the tokens designated for it have already been snapped up by eager investors. In the next phase, the token price will rise to $0.035, and gradually keep rising until the listing price of $0.06. With such a high demand for the token, there is no doubt that keeping a close eye on it is in your best interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) marks a major turning point for DeFi lending In every technology devised through all of time, the one aspect that leads to mass adoption is innovation. Here, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project excels. What sets it apart is the implementation of a dual lending mechanism in a hybrid ecosystem where lenders and investors can participate without interference from third parties. All transactions are governed by smart contracts, which ensure safe and automated passive income opportunities. The first of these two mechanisms is peer-to-peer (P2P). Under this mechanism, lenders interact directly with a borrower, with a focus on more volatile assets like the PEPE meme coin. The lender can set their own yield terms, and other parameters like the due date. In the second mechanism, called peer-to-contract (P2C), lenders deposit assets in a smart contract, where they collectively supply liquidity to borrowers. These borrowers can access overcollateralized loans at a rate set by market forces. For instance, as pool utilization rises, so does the interest rate. The rise motivates more lenders to deposit assets, while at the same time keeping borrowers from taking up more loans. The positive feedback loop ensures long-term stability in yields for stakers. Lenders who place their assets in pools via P2C are awarded mtTokens. For instance, if they deposit $1,500 worth of DAI, they would receive mtDAI tokens of a corresponding value. Additionally these mtTokens value will dynamically rise based on the interest accrued within the liquidity pool. Users can also use these mtTokens as collateral to borrow other assets, and they can withdraw the principal plus interest by depositing these tokens in the corresponding pool. Built-In scalability and cost control To overcome the common challenge of runaway costs on layer 2 (L2), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to deal with the main cause of the issue, which is calldata. Their solution is both simple and elegant; they simply compress all the needed information into one byte-encoding string to reduce on-chain storage, thus cutting transaction costs. They may also implement specialized contract logic that ensures transactions are efficient and affordable. Through these innovations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to offer a fast, cost effective user experience on L2 chains, which is in line with its goal of mass scalability, and accessibility for all ecosystem participants. Using dividends to fuel growth Another unique aspect of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer rewards to its stakers, which is akin to dividends. These rewards will be in the form of fees from various functions within the ecosystem, which are used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to stakers. This is double edged innovation, which serves to incentivize more stakers to join the ecosystem, while pushing up the price of MUTM tokens. Join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) future The best part about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is that prices are still at the ground floor. In the current phase 5, tokens are on sale for just $0.03, with the price set to rise to $0.035 in the upcoming phase 6. Joining now could be a great opportunity to be a participant, and not simply a spectator, in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Krüger tells his 210,500 followers on the social media platform X that he is expecting Bitcoin to hit $120,000 in June. According to the widely followed economist and trader, the proposed distribution of approximately $5 billion to creditors of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX at the end of May will serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Krüger thinks that the funds will re-enter the crypto market as the creditors will mostly be the large claim holders. But the economist warns that Bitcoin could turn bearish in early July amid the uncertainty caused by the dispute over tariffs. “The 90-day tariffs pause *could* be a significant bearish catalyst. That’s on July 9th. Depending on White House news flow, it makes sense for markets to start getting anxious about tariffs again two to three weeks before then.” In contrast with Krüger’s largely bullish view of Bitcoin over the short term, crypto analyst Justin Bennett says the flagship digital asset could drop below $100,000 after failing to convincingly take out its last resistance at around $110,000. “No change to this BTC analysis other than starting to break down. I shorted at $111,269. I’ll add below $106,000 if we get it. Looking for $96,000/$97,000.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading at $107,435 at time of writing, down from the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached earlier this week.

Judge overturns fraud convictions in Mango Markets exploit case A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets. On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets. The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case. Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

The $2.75 billion inflow total was nearly 4.5 times larger than the spot Bitcoin ETF’s previous week’s $608 million in inflows, according to Farside data. On May 23, the final day of the trading week, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $211.7 million in inflows. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund to post gains in the trading day, adding $430.8 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days. Grayscale’s GBTC led outflows with $89.2 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $73.9 million. US House members call for investigation into Trump's memecoin dinner Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” The call for an investigation and a press conference asking Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner both occurred hours before the event, which was held at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. A group of protesters, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, gathered outside the venue with signs stating “illegal crypto party” and “democracy is not for sale.”",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-24T12:22:03.000Z,"Bitcoin or Gold? Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice","The post Bitcoin or Gold? Schiff Says Central Banks Have Made Their Choice appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The age-old debate between Bitcoin and gold is heating up again and economist Peter Schiff wants to weigh in. In a recent X post , Schiff, a staunch Bitcoin critic, spotlighted the growing trend of central banks worldwide stocking gold reserves, strengthening their timeless value amid global economic uncertainty. With geopolitical uncertainties , crypto scams, and shifting economic policies moving demand, Schiff claims gold’s stability, Trump’s pro-crypto policies , and Bitcoin’s volatility, sparking fresh discussion among investors. Why Central Banks Are Choosing Gold Over Bitcoin In Schiff’s latest commentary, he took a direct jab at Bitcoin advocates by asking: If Bitcoin is the future, why are central banks betting on gold to replace the dollar? That question cuts to the heart of an ongoing shift in the global financial system. With fears of U.S. dollar devaluation and escalating geopolitical risks, foreign central banks are turning to gold – not crypto – as their hedge. According to a Reuters report, central banks are now buying more than 1,000 metric tons of gold annually – double the average of the previous decade. And the momentum isn’t slowing down. Michael Widmer, a strategist at Bank of America, says emerging market central banks currently hold just 10% of their reserves in gold but should be targeting 30% for greater financial protection. Trump, Tariffs, and the Rise of Gold Demand Peter Schiff also ties this growing demand for gold to the current U.S. administration. With President Donald Trump back in office and pushing aggressive tariff policies, countries are looking to shield their economies from potential fallout. As the dollar weakens, the appeal of gold rises. And in times of uncertainty – from trade wars to banking collapses – central banks want assets that stand the test of time. Russia Leads the Gold Playbook Russia has been ahead of the curve. Between 2014 and 2020 , the Russian central bank hoarded gold to buffer itself from Western sanctions. Today, its Ministry of Finance is reportedly continuing that accumulation – buying from domestic producers and quietly strengthening reserves. This playbook is being adopted by other emerging economies as well, reinforcing Schiff’s argument that gold’s legacy value is far from obsolete. So, if Bitcoin truly is the future, why aren’t central banks buying it? .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Ripple and XRP Could Be the Backbone of The G20’s Financial Plan? , Bitcoin’s Volatility vs. Gold’s Stability Schiff didn’t stop at praising gold. He also took a swing at Bitcoin’s unpredictability. He warned that American investors – who collectively hold nearly half of all Bitcoin – may be in for a rude awakening as the price swings continue and global institutions remain cautious. At the time of writing, gold trades at $3,357.4 per ounce, up 1.82% for the day but slightly down over the month. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is priced at $108,148 – down 2.31% in the last 24 hours, though it’s seen a 17% jump over the month. Despite the short-term surge, Schiff argues that Bitcoin lacks the long-term security central banks crave. Ran Neuner Weighs In: Could Bitcoin Still Outshine Gold? Not everyone agrees with Schiff’s stance. CNBC’s Ran Neuner recently suggested that Bitcoin could outperform gold in the long run as a safe-haven asset – especially amid advancements in blockchain tech and increasing institutional adoption. But Schiff remains skeptical. He also criticized the growing use of stablecoins in the U.S., pointing to the regulatory fog. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180. The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether ( ETH ) and Sui ( SUI ) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin ( BTC ), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC. Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion , holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for $60 million, securing a $1.5 million profit. James Wynn’s Bitcoin long bet.

Ether also dropped to as low as $2,504 while memecoins were hit even harder. Data from HypurrScan shows that Wynn has suffered more than $29 million in losses over the past day alone.

2025-05-24T12:08:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips As Trump Revives Trade War Threats","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened an imminent 50% tariff on all EU imports and a 25% levy on all imported Apple iPhones. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped nearly 4% on Friday, plunging to a low of $106,816 before rebounding to current levels. BTC is down over 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $108,200. Bitcoin (BTC) And Altcoins Register Sharp Decline Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $106,816 on Friday, erasing substantial gains made earlier this week. The crash coincided with the sell-off in the stock market as futures tied to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 fell over 1%, continuing a sell-off that began on Monday. The crypto market retreated as trade war concerns emerged after a Truth Social post in which President Trump said trade talks with the EU were going nowhere and warned of a 50% tariff on all goods from the region. The statement escalated trade tensions at a time when markets were hoping for a deal between the trade partners. The EU has hinted it will respond by hiking tariffs on US goods, including Boeing jets. Ryanair’s CEO has already warned the company is considering canceling a $33 billion order from Boeing and switching to Airbus if Boeing planes are hit by tariffs. The trade war concerns return a week after Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating and as the House of Representatives voted on the “Big Beautiful Bill” which will increase US debt by over $3.8 trillion in a decade. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Strong Inflows US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a total of $2.75 billion in inflows this week as Bitcoin surged past $110,000 and set a new all-time high. The inflows were almost 4.5 times larger than the previous week’s inflows of $608 million, according to data from Farside. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $211 million on May 23. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund that posted gains during the trading day, adding $430 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days. Meanwhile, Grayscale saw outflows of $89 million, while ARK21 Shares saw outflows worth $73.9 million. Only two days prior, Bitcoin ETFs registered $607 million in inflows, the same day the flagship cryptocurrency surged past its previous all-time high. However, BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as market sentiment declined. Meanwhile, analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin is not showing any signs of overheating despite surging to a new all-time high, indicating the price could rise higher. An analyst from CryptoQuant stated, “Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 as it finally crossed the $110,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency consolidated around higher levels as it entered a price discovery phase after crossing into uncharted territory. Analysts expected BTC to continue its uptrend and push towards $115,000 and possibly $120,000. However, markets turned bearish on Friday after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union after posting on Truth Social that trade talks with Europe were not going anywhere. The EU also threatened retaliatory tariffs as trade war tensions resurfaced, panicking markets. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency plunged nearly 4% on Friday, falling to an intraday low of $106,816. BTC traded in a narrow range between $100,000 and $105,000 as buyers struggled to build momentum. The price declined 1.04% on Monday (May 12), before rebounding on Tuesday, rising 1.36% to $104,123. The price fell back into the red on Wednesday after a marginal decline and settled at $103,568. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $101,459 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $103,816. Price action turned bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $103,235. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, facing considerable selling pressure. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 before recovering to settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. Despite the negative start to the week, the price rebounded on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. BTC continued to push higher on Wednesday, rising 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,582. However, price action turned bearish on Friday as markets plunged. As a result, BTC fell nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $107,356. The current session sees BTC up almost 1% as it looks to build momentum and reclaim $110,000.

Prices jumped past $109,000, a high not seen since January. Bitcoin even touched $111,980 on May 22. Investors piled in as the rally took hold. Related Reading: Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge According to Farside data, spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $2.75 billion this week, up sharply from $608 million the week before. That big jump came as Bitcoin pushed past its January all-time high of $109,000. On May 21, investors added $607 million, the same day Bitcoin hit a new peak. Then, on May 22, the coin soared to $111,980. Those moves show money chasing fresh highs. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Flows Based on reports, ETF flows on May 23 totaled just $212 million, but BlackRock’s IBIT was the only one in the green. It brought in $431 million all by itself, and that stretched its inflow streak to eight days straight. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw $89 million leave, and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost $74 million. Investors seem to favor the low fees and wide reach of the biggest funds. Market Sentiment Pulls Back Bitcoin’s climb paused a bit after that. At publication, it traded near $108,150. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 down to 66, or “Greed.” That dip hints at some profit-taking. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said on May 22 that “overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” His view is that this rally hasn’t been driven by risky bets. Related Reading: XRP’s $5 Dream Ride Hinges On This One Chart Setup – Analyst Record Monthly Inflows In Sight So far in May, spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in about $5.40 billion.

That steady demand underlines how ETFs have become the go-to way for many to own Bitcoin without wrestling with wallets and private keys. Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has grown fast. Investors like simple, regulated products. The big issuers, led by BlackRock, have the best chance to stay on top. As for Bitcoin itself, if sentiment cools, prices might pull back some.

2025-05-24T11:53:34.000Z,"Expert sets date when Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025","After Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high this week, a trading expert believes the asset is on track for even greater gains, possibly reaching $200,000 in 2025. According to an analysis by TradingShot , historical trends and technical setups suggest that Bitcoin might reach the $200,000 mark toward the end of this year, as per a May 23 TradingView post . Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In the outlook, TradingShot emphasized that Bitcoin is currently experiencing its weakest bull cycle to date, a natural consequence of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM). This theory posits that as markets mature, the magnitude of returns tends to slow. While Bitcoin’s earlier cycles witnessed explosive growth, more recent ones have been comparatively moderate yet notable. To illustrate this, TradingShot overlaid Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles (2009–2011, 2012–2013, 2015–2017, 2019–2021). The comparison revealed a transition from aggressive early growth to a more consistent pattern, resembling movements in traditional financial markets. Interestingly, the 2015 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 cycles showed similar upward paths, with temporary divergences eventually returning to the broader trend. Bitcoin tracking past cycles Looking ahead, the ongoing cycle appears to be tracking within an upward channel. After a projected divergence in February 2025, Bitcoin is expected to realign with its historical trend. The recent six-week rebound further supports this outlook. Based on these patterns, TradingShot forecasts that Bitcoin’s cycle peak will likely occur between October and December 2025, with a potential price range of $150,000 to $200,000. “Based on past cycles, it should be within October – December 2025. Timing your exit strategy can perhaps be more effective than assigning a certain Target, even though the peak is expected to be anywhere within the $150k – $200k range,” the expert said. It’s worth noting that, after surpassing a new record high above $111,000, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin could maintain this momentum in the coming weeks. For instance, as reported by Finbold, veteran trader Peter Brandt stated that following this breakout, Bitcoin’s technical formation indicates the possibility of reaching $150,000 by August 2025. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Gert van Lagen made another bullish projection. In a May 24 post on X, he explained that Bitcoin has historically followed a clear exponential path, rising from $1 to over $100,000 through recurring bullish patterns such as cup-and-handle formations. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView He emphasized that if history repeats itself, the real peak could be three to six times higher than current levels, noting that Bitcoin’s rise isn’t just linear; it’s compounding. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,811, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. However, on a weekly basis, the asset has climbed more than 5%.

The current price stands well above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ), reaffirming a strong upward trend.

2025-05-24T11:43:03.000Z,"Solana Will Replace Banks for IPOs, Says SkyBridge Founder Scaramucci","The post Solana Will Replace Banks for IPOs, Says SkyBridge Founder Scaramucci appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At the Solana Accelerate 2025 conference , Anthony Scaramucci made one thing clear: Don’t treat Solana like just another blockchain; it’s gearing up to be the backbone of global finance. The SkyBridge Capital founder, who’s now penning a book titled Solana Rising , believes traditional finance is on the brink of a major upgrade, with Solana at the core. Bold claims but he’s backing it up with research, interviews with Wall Street CTOs, and conversations with Solana’s own Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. Here’s what you should know. A $7 Trillion Problem, and Solana’s Fix Scaramucci pointed to a staggering figure: nearly $7 trillion is spent globally on transaction verification . That inefficiency, he argues, is ripe for disruption. Solana’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure could cut those costs dramatically – something no traditional system has managed to do. “Think of Solana as the operating layer for real-world assets, in the same way Bitcoin is for money,” he said. Scaramucci sees Solana becoming one of the major financial rails for real-world asset tokenization. We’re talking from stocks to bonds and everything in between. On-Chain IPOs Could Break the Banking Barrier Here’s one of the boldest promises. IPOs that don’t require a bank account. “You don’t need a bank account to buy an IPO on-chain, just a wallet,” Scaramucci said. He compared blockchain-powered IPOs to traditional offerings that can rack up 7% in fees, arguing Solana’s system could offer the same functionality at a fraction of the cost, with much broader access. Institutional Adoption Is “Inevitable” Despite ongoing regulatory friction, Scaramucci insists big players are circling. He called out JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon as a cautious example, predicting major institutions will eventually custody and offer yield-bearing strategies using Solana and other Layer-1 assets. “Solana will be part of a financial system where you not only stake, but also lend your assets – earning yield like you would in traditional finance,” he added. SkyBridge is already working on such strategies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 24 May, 2025 , “Make Everyone an Investor” Scaramucci isn’t the only one highly bullish on Solana and its potential. Earlier this week, Solana Foundation’s Akshay BD laid out a broader vision: universal micro-ownership through tokenization . The current financial model, he argued, locks out most retail investors. “Solana could make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time,” he said – especially in a world where low bond yields and overvalued markets leave few appealing options. Here’s the bottom line: Solana is not a niche project anymore. It’s gunning for Wall Street. And if the industry signals are anything to go by, the shift might be here soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-24T11:31:59.000Z,"Can Solana Break the $180 Resistance? Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025!","The post Can Solana Break the $180 Resistance? Here’s What SOL Price Will Be Worth in 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana was on its way to rise above the $185 resistance zone after the recent rebound from the local support below $170. Moreover, the star token, Bitcoin, making new highs above $111.8K, was believed to trigger the rest of the altcoins as well. While Ethereum made an entry above $2700 and Cardano surged above $0.82, it appeared that the bearish influence over the token could have faded to a large extent. Meanwhile, the increase in bearish activity, which dragged the BTC price below $107K , seems to have hindered the SOL price rally as well, which is now struggling to reach $180. Currently, the SOL price is down by more than 6% after touching the price zone between $180 and $190. Meanwhile, the token triggered a strong rebound from the local support close to $170 and is trying hard to push higher with renewed momentum. The recent rebound signals an increase in the buy-side interest that has triggered a recovery swing. Meanwhile, despite the pullback, the price remained within the pattern, which keeps the upside potential higher. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Forecast 2025: Can It Rebound After Recent Dip and SEC Delays? , In the long term, the SOL price remains within the rising wedge, while in the short term, the token is heading towards the end of the apex of the ascending triangle. However, the bulls have been prevented from reaching the lower support of the consolidation. The stochRSI has reached the lower support and is about to trigger a bullish reversal, while the MACD , which remains within a positive range, shows a drop in the selling pressure. Therefore, the Solana price is expected to maintain a healthy consolidation within the triangle for some more time, but along the upper resistance. The token is further believed to trigger a breakout before the end of the month and secure the range around $190. Although rising above $200 appears to be a tedious job for the SOL price, it may surely clear the barriers to reaching the range. With this, the Solana price prediction for 2025 remains bullish, with a possibility to rise and reach new highs above $500. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The sudden dip prompted huge liquidations in crypto futures markets totaling over $560 million. According to Coinglass figures, the decline resulted in the liquidation of 160,905 traders on major exchanges, with longs taking most of the loss. Breakdown of Liquidated Positions All $563.20 million worth of liquidated positions were dominated by longs, which took up $418.63 million. Shorts made up the remaining $144.35 million. The biggest single liquidation order was a BTC-USDT on OKX for $9.53 million. Bitcoin traders were hit the hardest, with liquidations of $153.04 million, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $144.19 million. Most of the liquidations in both assets took place on long positions. Trump’s Trade War Threat Spooks Market Further The price decline was followed by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, in which he threatened to impose more tariffs on the European Union and Apple. The action spooked markets, especially risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ETH fell from $2,731 highs to $2,508 lows, before rebounding to $2,574. The broader market reacted similarly, which highlights crypto’s sensitivity to geopolitical and macroeconomic signals. Relative Strength of Bitcoin Still Intact Followed by the volatility, Bitcoin’s breakout above $109K is still an indicator of strength. Having broken its prior ATH in November, coinciding with Trump’s inauguration, BTC has been resilient despite market volatility. This resiliency is likely driven by the growing perception of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Institutional and retail investors both increasingly view BTC as an inflation hedge and acceptable replacement in the case of macro instability. Conclusion The recent wave of liquidations confirms the risk-on nature of crypto markets. Yet, the relative resilience of Bitcoin indicates its evolving role as a safe-haven asset amid escalating global tensions.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-drops-from-111k-ath-triggering-560m/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T11:20:02.000Z,"Pakistan hosts high-stakes meeting to discuss blockchain and AI","Pakistan hosted a high-stakes meeting to discuss blockchain technology and artificial intelligence as the country continues to make moves to regulate its crypto industry. The high-stakes meeting is part of the country’s move to establish itself as a regional hub for blockchain and AI. In addition, it is also part of a bigger strategy to harness the youthful demographic and surplus energy in the country as a tool for digital finance and, by extension, economic transformation. In attendance at the high-level meeting at the General Headquarters were Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and Bilal Bin Saqib, Chief Executive of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC). The pair discussed the potential of emerging technologies, with a focus on leveraging blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI to empower its youth and build economic reliance. Pakistan holds meeting to discuss blockchain and AI In the meeting , Bin Saqib, the chief executive of the PCC, mentioned that digital finance and decentralization offer the country countless opportunities and not threats. “The [PCC] exists because our youth demand a seat at the global tech table,” Saqib said at the meeting. The meeting is coming off the back of efforts to accelerate the regulatory framework of these emerging technologies in the country. The Ministry of Finance, on Wednesday, announced the formation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), a body that has been dedicated and tasked with overseeing blockchain infrastructure and the regulation of digital assets in the country. The move marks a major step towards formalizing a market that has been estimated to witness more than $300 billion in annual crypto trading volume. According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the PDAA would be in charge of creating a secure, innovative, and inclusive ecosystem that will house digital assets. He also added that it will ensure that Pakistan is ranked high alongside other regional leaders in digital finance and blockchain regulation. He also added that the initiative will birth the facilitation of tokenization of public assets and government debt, regulate Bitcoin mining using surplus electricity, and provide legal clarity for global investors. A renewed shift towards a tech-led growth model The announcement signals a boost in the country’s shift towards a tech-led growth model. With about 70% of its 240 million population under the age of 30, Pakistan has one of the most favored demographics for digital adoption. It ranks among the top five countries globally in terms of crypto usage. In addition, the country ranks as the world’s third-largest freelancer market, with more than 50,000 IT graduates entering the workforce every year. During the meeting, Saqib discussed the recent PCC initiatives with the military leadership, including a global outreach with Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. It also discussed its exploits with World Liberty Financial, a decentralized platform that has links with United States President Donald Trump. He also mentioned the youth-first policy that the group has been looking into, emphasizing the need to channel the country’s tech-savvy workforce into scalable blockchain solutions and AI infrastructure. Some of the national strategies being looked into include allocating surplus electricity to power Bitcoin mining rigs and data centers. The meeting came before Saqib’s participation at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, where he is set to speak alongside other influential figures such as United States Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr. The event is expected to shape the future narratives on global crypto governance.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico.

The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership.

Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”May 22 letter to DOJ official calling for investigation into Trump memecoin dinner.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On May 20, the US Senate voted 66-32 in favor of advancing discussion on the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The bill outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March.

It’s an increase of 30% since the start of May as derivatives speculators load up on leverage in anticipation of higher Bitcoin prices.Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.Total Bitcoin futures OI. Source: CoinglassWhen OI surges, it indicates massive leveraged positions are built up in the market, with lots of traders holding large positions with borrowed money. If Bitcoin’s price moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated, and the flushout can create selling pressure on Bitcoin, which can cause a rapid drop in prices and high volatility.However, analysts suggest the surge in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which have seen more than $2.5 billion this week, can counter some of that extended leverage.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s MersingerBitcoin options markets show a similar pattern with open interest over $1.5 billion at the $110,000 and $120,000 strike prices on the Deribit exchange.

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-22T13:39:15.000Z,"Exponential currency debasement: ‘You don’t own enough crypto, NFTs’","Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.
