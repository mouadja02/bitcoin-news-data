2025-05-24T04:30:52.000Z,"Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says","According to a recent analysis from popular XRP commentator BarriC, the token’s current price makes it a tempting buy. He pointed to the fact that XRP sits at about $2.35 right now. That price is low compared with where he thinks it will go. He told followers to pick up as much as they can while the chance is there. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight XRP Trading Below $3 XRP has climbed about 350% over the past year. That beat gains in some of the top altcoins in the market today. Yet many still see the move as slow. At $2.39 per coin, that view is easy to understand. Even so, BarriC calls anything under $3 a bargain. Predictions For A Rally Based on examination from his Twitter thread, BarriC expects XRP to hit $10 first. He then sees it pushing to $20 in the months ahead. Those moves would set a new high during what he calls the next alt season. If those figures come true, buyers who got in under $3 would see roughly a seven-fold gain at the $20 mark. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 … But Possible Correction Ahead BarriC also warned of a pullback after a big rise. He thinks XRP could drop by about 50% once it reaches $20. That would put it back in the $5–$10 range. He sees that dip as a fresh chance to buy in. Even then, $5 is still higher than today’s $2.39. Long Term Vision For XRP Looking past the next cycle, BarriC outlined a bold scenario. He believes banks and big payment firms will use XRP for daily money transfers. In that case, demand could send the price all the way to $1,000 within 10 years. When banks start using $XRP We will know because of the insane price per $XRP We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 Per #XRP The fact that we can still accumulate $XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilising $XRP …. YET Once that day comes Once banks and… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 3, 2025 To reach that level, XRP’s market cap would top $58 trillion. That would put it on par with major pieces of the global money system. Technical Signals And Short-Term Outlook Technical indicators point to a possible drop to around $2.21 by June 22, 2025, which would be a -9.20% change from now. The current sentiment gauge reads Bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index sits at 0. Over the past 30 days, XRP had 13 out of 30 green days and showed about 5.10% price swings. Those numbers hint at mixed views. Some traders see room to run. Others expect more choppy action before the next big move.

If those start to speed up, we could see more buzz around XRP’s real-world uses. Until then, buying under $3 could look smart—or it could stay quiet for a while. Either way, investors will have to decide how much risk they want for the chance at a big payout in the years to come.

The platform ends yield-generating services, opting for a 1:1 bitcoin custody system to reduce client risk. The change responds to rising BTC loan demand and regulatory pressure, distancing from altcoins and risky lending. On May 23, 2025, crypto lender Ledn confirmed it will stop supporting Ethereum (ETH) and shift entirely to a bitcoin-only lending model. The move takes effect on July 1, 2025, and comes as part of a broader strategy to simplify services and minimize risk. Ledn stated that it will no longer use client assets to generate yield. Instead, it will adopt a full custody model. This approach means users’ bitcoin will either remain in direct custody or with trusted custody partners, removing intermediaries and lending loops from the process. The decision reflects Ledn’s response to rising competition in the BTC-backed loan sector. It also signals the company’s commitment to reduce client exposure to lending risks that led to past collapses in the crypto lending space.

2025-05-24T04:00:37.000Z,"XRP Price Is Now Targeting $4 After Reversal From ‘Buy Zone’","The XRP price is showing renewed bullish momentum after decisively reversing from a key buy zone. While the cryptocurrency finds its footing within its present bullish setup, a crypto analyst has forecasted that the altcoin is now targeting a new all-time high , with technical indicators pointing toward the potential rise to $4. XRP Price Eyes $4 Following Bullish Reversal The XRP price action , which has been building a bullish structure since dipping into the discounted range around $0.85 to $1.00, is now showing signs of a trend continuation that could take it beyond the $3 psychological resistance and up to the $4 mark. According to an analysis report by crypto analytics team, ‘Setupsfx_’ on TradingView, XRP has undergone a strong reversal from a critical buy zone — an area marked by historical demand, strong low wick rejections, and institutional order blocks. Notably, the analytical team presented a detailed chart, highlighting a clean structure aligned with Smart Money Concepts (SMC), including accumulation, Break of Structure (BOS), and liquidity hunts that preceded the current upward move. Based on the analysis, the altcoin showed a textbook reversal from a buy zone, which previously acted as a magnet for buy-side liquidity catalyzed by recent bullish momentum. The chart shows multiple confirmations of strength, including a clean Change of Character (CHoCH) and higher highs forming after the recent bottom. There is also a three-point trendline rejection and an Imbalance zone (IMB) being respected as the price goes up, adding further technical confirmation to XRP’s bullish case . With XRP currently trading slightly above $2.4 and consolidating after its initial rally , Setupsfx_ indicates that the market may enter a secondary accumulation phase before targeting the first major level at $3.00. Should bullish momentum and volume continue, a clean break above the $3.00 resistance could send prices above $3.7 and toward the $4 target in the coming weeks. During this time, the TradingView analytical team highlights that the broader crypto market will likely remain significantly volatile . Nevertheless, they maintain a strong bullish stance on XRP’s outlook, expecting a 66.6% increase to a new ATH soon. Analyst Reveals When To Buy While projecting an XRP price rally to $4, Setupsfx_ provided traders with detailed strategic guidance on how to capitalize on the anticipated bullish scenario. His chart analysis highlights optimal entry points, recommended stop losses, and clearly defined buy zones. The TradingView analytical team pinpoints an entry point around $1.6 and a stop loss just above $1.4 to manage downside risks. Notably, the team has also identified ideal buy areas between $2.40 and $2.43. According to the chart, this range may serve as a higher entry point if the altcoin sustains its momentum toward the projected $4 target.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-now-targeting-4/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|BOS|Break of Structure|Change of Character|CHoCH|IMB|Setupsfx|Smart Money Concept|SMC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-05-24T03:40:26.000Z,"Smart Money Moves: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, and Bitcoin Are Leading the 2025 Portfolio Rotations","As the crypto landscape shifts into summer 2025, seasoned investors are rotating their portfolios to capture the next wave of exponential growth. Cardano’s surge and Bitcoin’s stability are drawing headlines, but the real buzz is around MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin that’s outpacing even the most established names. With Solana, XRP, and SUI consolidating, analysts are calling MAGA the leading early-stage play as Q3 approaches. Cardano: Academic Partnerships Fuel a Bullish Run Cardano (ADA) has broken past $0.82, powered by a series of global academic collaborations and real-world blockchain integrations. The network’s commitment to research and education is paying off, with analysts forecasting ADA could reach $0.90–$1.00 by early summer. While Cardano’s fundamentals and ecosystem expansion are earning it long-term credibility, some investors are looking to amplify returns by rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Presale and 35x Upside Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is dominating the 2025 presale cycle, with over $8 million raised and Stage 8 nearly full. The project’s scarcity-driven tokenomics—capped at 100 billion tokens, 45% allocated to presale, and audited by HashEx—are fueling unprecedented demand. Analysts are projecting 25x–35x returns as conservative, with some models suggesting up to 18,500% upside if momentum continues. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code MAGA50X , MAGA is being positioned as the rare ground-floor opportunity before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. Unlike fleeting meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding a wave of real investor confidence, strategic rollout, and viral political energy—making it the top allocation for smart money heading into Q3. Bitcoin: Macro Strength and Capital Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s anchor, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. While Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. As retail investors take profits, smart capital is increasingly rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early-stage entry points offer the kind of asymmetric potential that built fortunes in previous cycles. Solana, XRP, and SUI: Solid, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is consolidating near $170, with technicals hinting at a breakout above $175. XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, holding steady after a 300% rally since late 2024. SUI is gaining traction with network upgrades and developer activity, but its price action remains subdued compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital rotates out of consolidating assets and into high-upside plays, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next breakout. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Cardano’s academic partnerships and Bitcoin’s resilience are impressive, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 35x are making it the breakout coin to watch for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using MAGA50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

2025-05-24T03:40:22.000Z,"Censorship on the Rise Amid AI Adoption","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post AI (artificial intelligence) creates an ethical crisis of algorithmic censorship. By glossing over this problem, we risk allowing governments and corporations to control the global conversation. Both AI technology and industry have gone parabolic. Its censorship potential becomes greater every day. Every one to two years since 2010, the computational power of training AI systems has increased by a factor of 10, making the threat of censorship and control of public discourse more real than ever. Corporations worldwide ranked privacy and data governance as their top AI risks, while censorship didn’t register on their radar. AI – which can process millions of data points in seconds – can censor through various means, including content moderation and control of information. LLMs (large language models) and content recommendations can filter, suppress or mass share information at scale. In 2023, Freedom House highlighted that AI is enhancing state-led censorship. In China, the CAC (Cyberspace Administration) has incorporated censorship strategy into generative AI tools, requiring chatbots to support “core socialist values” and block content the communist party wants to censor. Chinese AI models, such as DeepSeek’s R1, already censor topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre, in order to spread state narratives. “To protect the free and open internet, democratic policymakers – working side by side with civil society experts from around the world – should establish strong human rights–based standards for both state and non-state actors that develop or deploy AI tools,” concludes Freedom House. In 2021, UC San Diego found that AI algorithms trained on censored datasets, such as China’s Baidu Baike, which associates the keyword ‘democracy’ with ‘chaos.’ Models trained on uncensored sources associated ‘democracy’ with ‘stability.’ In 2023, Freedom House’s ‘Freedom on the Net’ report found that global internet freedom fell for the 13th consecutive year. It attributed a large part of the decline to AI. Twenty-two countries have laws in place requiring social media companies to employ automated systems for content moderation, which could be used to suppress debate and demonstrations. Myanmar’s military junta, for instance, used AI to monitor Telegram groups and detain dissidents and carry out death sentences based on their posts. The same happened in Iran. Additionally, in Belarus and Nicaragua, governments sentenced individuals to draconian prison terms for their online speech. Freedom House found that no fewer than 47 governments used comments to sway online conversations towards their preferred narratives. It found that in the past year, new technology was used in at least 16 countries to sow the seeds of doubt, smear opponents or influence public debate. At least 21 countries require digital platforms to use machine learning to delete political, social and religious speech. A 2023 Reuters report warned that AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation could “undermine public trust in democratic processes,” empowering regimes that seek to tighten control over information. In the 2024 US presidential elections, AI-generated images falsely implying Taylor Swift endorsed Donald Trump demonstrated that AI is already manipulating public opinion. China offers the most prominent example of AI-driven censorship. A leaked dataset analyzed by TechCrunch in 2025 revealed a sophisticated AI system designed to censor topics like pollution scandals, labor disputes and Taiwan political issues. Unlike traditional keyword-based filtering, this system uses LLMs to evaluate context and flag political satire. Researcher Xiao Qiang noted that such systems “significantly improve the efficiency and granularity of state-led information control.” A 2024 House Judiciary Committee report accused the NSF (National Science Foundation) of funding AI tools to combat ‘misinformation’ on Covid-19 and the 2020 election. The report found that the NSF funded AI-based censorship and propaganda tools. “In the name of combating alleged misinformation regarding Covid-19 and the 2020 election, NSF has been issuing multi-million-dollar grants to university and non-profit research teams,” reads the report. “The purpose of these taxpayer-funded projects is to develop AI-powered censorship and propaganda tools that can be used by governments and Big Tech to shape public opinion by restricting certain viewpoints or promoting others.” A 2025 WIRED report discovered that DeepSeek’s R1 model includes censorship filters at both the application and training levels, resulting in blocks on sensitive topics. In 2025, a Pew Research Center survey found that 83% of US adults were concerned about AI-driven misinformation, with many showing concerns about its free speech implications. Pew interviewed AI experts, who said that AI training data can unintentionally reinforce existing power structures. Addressing AI-driven censorship A 2025 HKS Misinformation Review called for better reporting to reduce fear-driven calls for censorship. The survey found that 38.8% of Americans are somewhat concerned, and 44.6% are highly concerned, about AI’s role in spreading misinformation during the 2024 US presidential election, while 9.5% held no concerns, and 7.1% were unaware of the issue altogether. Creating an open-source AI ecosystem is of the utmost importance. This means companies disclose training dataset sources and biases. Governments should create AI regulatory frameworks prioritizing free expression. If we want a human future, instead of an AI-managed technocratic dystopia, the AI industry and consumers need to build up the courage to tackle censorship.

2025-05-24T03:30:59.000Z,"Stealth Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead: Fidelity Says Do Not Blink","Fidelity Digital Assets chose a single post on X to frame its latest research note: “Bitcoin is up ~63 % from its 2024 halving price with 27 % of this halving epoch completed. While past epochs saw triple-digit rallies, a new story may be unfolding: one of rising maturity, deeper adoption, and network resilience.” The tweet landed minutes after the firm released “2024 Bitcoin Halving: One Year Later,” authored by senior analyst Daniel Gray, who contends that the apparent lull in price action masks “a strengthening foundation.” Fidelity Flags Bitcoin’s Silent Surge “Bitcoin presents a nuanced narrative a year after its fourth halving, with signs pointing toward consolidation, network resilience, and growing institutional adoption,” Gray writes, adding that structural indicators “suggest a strengthening foundation.” While previous cycles delivered triple- and even quadruple-digit percentage gains by this stage, Gray argues the softer trajectory signals maturation: “History suggests that we would be well into the bull run at this point in the fifth epoch — but this cycle may be unfolding more cautiously.” From a market-share perspective the data are unequivocal. “Bitcoin’s market dominance excluding stablecoins has risen to just over 72.4% as of 11 May, a new eight-year high,” Gray notes, pointing out that Ether and Solana have surrendered ground even as “fragmentation on the long tail of assets has failed to produce a clear alternative leader.” Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals On-chain security metrics tell a similar story: “Bitcoin’s daily hash-rate rose above one zetta hash per second twice in April, reflecting continued investment in mining infrastructure despite a 60 percent collapse in hash price since the halving,” he observes. Spot-market behaviour has begun to echo those fundamentals. Bitcoin printed a record intraday high of $109,486 on 21 May before extending above $111,000 on so-called Pizza Day, holding near $110,600 at press time. The move has been underwritten by renewed demand from US spot ETFs, which drew $934.8 million of net subscriptions yesterday, May 22— the heaviest single-day haul in almost four weeks. Derivatives activity mirrors the trend: aggregate futures open interest reached a record $80 billion on May 23, up roughly 30% since the start of the month, according to CoinGlass data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $111,867 All-Time High—Here’s What’s Driving The Surge Meanwhile, funding rates in most crypto exchanges are at the baseline or below it. “This is the least euphoric new all-time highs in the history of Bitcoin,” crypto analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) wrote via X. Gray cautions that investors should focus less on headline returns and more on the architecture taking shape beneath them. “Although returns have been more measured compared to previous cycles, structural metrics suggest a strengthening foundation. Overall, it appears Bitcoin is potentially maturing—something investors may find more notable than short-term price movement,” he writes. His closing assessment is blunt: “One year post-halving, Bitcoin’s price performance may seem muted, but its fundamentals appear stronger than ever … this may be a cycle that redefines Bitcoin’s role in a modern portfolio.” In other words, Fidelity’s message for would-be spectators is as clear as its headline: do not blink. At press time, BTC traded at $109,563.

Yet, as established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Polkadot trade in tighter ranges, the spotlight is shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE—a presale altcoin whose momentum and upside projections are eclipsing even the most established names. As Q3 2025 approaches, smart money is increasingly positioning for the next breakout, and MAGA is emerging as the top candidate for exponential gains. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, But Capital Is Rotating Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold its ground above $110,000, with institutional inflows and ETF adoption providing a strong foundation for further growth. Analysts forecast a potential surge to $116,000–$137,000 in the coming weeks, but as BTC’s momentum steadies, capital is rotating into altcoins with higher-multiple potential. Early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now drawing aggressive capital rotation, as investors look to maximize returns in the next phase of the bull cycle. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Powerhouse With 12,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly outpacing the competition, with Stage 8 now live and over $8 million raised. The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative—has made it the #1 altcoin entry for ROI-focused buyers in 2025. Analysts are projecting up to 40x returns from current entry levels, with some models suggesting a path to 12,000%–18,500% upside if momentum continues. A recent $132,000+ whale buy marks the largest single early-stage investment of the year, underscoring the conviction behind MAGA’s explosive setup. With a $0.007 listing target on the horizon and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using promo code PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next supercycle winner. Each stage is filling rapidly, and as visibility grows, MAGA is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery. XRP: Bullish Momentum, But Limited Multiples XRP is trading between $2.36 and $2.65, having surged over 300% since late 2024 on the back of regulatory clarity and institutional partnerships. While technicals and ecosystem developments remain bullish, short-term momentum has slowed as XRP consolidates below recent highs. Analysts now project a breakout above $3.40 could push XRP toward $4.50–$7.50 by summer, but for now, the asset is in a holding pattern as the market awaits the next catalyst. Many traders seeking sharper upside are now looking to early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for more dramatic returns. Polkadot: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Polkadot (DOT) is holding steady around $7.50, with ongoing development and ecosystem expansion. While DOT remains a dependable hold for long-term investors, its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As traders seek sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for those chasing the next 40x winner. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Solana’s approach to $190 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum and analyst forecasts up to 12,000%–18,500% upside are keeping it firmly in the spotlight. With Stage 8 nearly full, a $0.007 listing target, and a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGA offers a rare chance to secure ground-floor exposure before listings ignite the next wave of price discovery.

The index lying between these two cutoffs implies a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Bitcoin From Pizza Day Era Still On The Move, Glassnode Reveals Besides these three main zones, there are also two ‘extreme’ regions called the extreme greed (above 75) and extreme fear (below 25). At present, the market sentiment is inside the former of the two, according to the latest value of the Fear & Greed Index. Historically, the extreme sentiments have held much significance for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as they have been where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning that an overly bullish atmosphere makes tops likely and an excess of despair bottoms. Some traders exploit this fact in order to time their buy and sell moves. This trading technique is popularly known as contrarian investing. Warren Buffet’s famous quote sums up the core idea: “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” With the Bitcoin sentiment now making a return into the extreme greed region, it’s possible that followers of this philosophy may be starting to look toward the exit. That said, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of ‘just’ 78 at the moment. For comparison, the December top occurred at around 87 and the January one at 84. Earlier in the rally, the metric even hit a much higher peak of 94 in November. As such, it’s possible that the current market may not be quite that overheated in terms of sentiment just yet, assuming demand from the investors doesn’t let off. It only remains to be seen, though, how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would evolve under this extreme greed. Speaking of demand, whales have just made a significant amount of withdrawals from the Binance platform, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The indicator displayed in the chart is the “Exchange Netflow,” which tells us about the net amount of Bitcoin that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with a centralized exchange, which, in this case, is Binance. Clearly, the Binance Exchange Netflow has observed a large negative value, implying that the investors have shifted a notable amount of coins out of the exchange. More specifically, net outflows for the platform have stood at 2,190 BTC or about $237 million. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out Of Bull Pennant—What’s The Target?

2025-05-24T01:40:45.000Z,"XRP Climbs to $2.45 — Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE May Be the Real 50x Play of 2025","As XRP breaks through the $2.45 barrier, the crypto market is buzzing with renewed optimism. Yet, amid the excitement around established tokens, a quiet revolution is unfolding: MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the dark horse of 2025, with analysts projecting returns that could dwarf even the most bullish XRP forecasts. While Hedera and Bitcoin round out the picture with steady gains, it’s MAGA’s presale momentum and scarcity-driven model that are capturing the imagination of forward-thinking investors. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Contender That’s Redefining Early-Stage ROI While XRP is making headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly stealing the show. With over $8 million raised and a presale price still under $0.001, analysts are calling MAGA the breakout contender of 2025. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling unprecedented demand from both retail and institutional investors. What sets MAGA apart is its potential for outsized returns: forecasts suggest a conservative 35x gain, with some models projecting up to 50x or more if current momentum continues. A recent 72.95 ETH whale buy—worth over $130,000—highlights the conviction behind this early-stage gem. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target nears, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to allocation for those seeking the next crypto supercycle. XRP: Breaking Barriers and Building Momentum XRP’s recent surge to $2.45 marks a significant milestone, driven by a confluence of regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and technical strength. Analysts are eyeing a move toward $2.65–$2.85 in the short term, with some optimistic models even targeting $3.40 if bullish sentiment holds. The resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit and the launch of CME futures have removed major overhangs, setting the stage for further institutional adoption and ecosystem expansion. Despite these bullish signals, XRP’s upside is seen as steady rather than explosive—making it a core holding for those seeking stability, but not necessarily the next crypto moonshot. Hedera: Quiet Strength and Consolidation Hedera (HBAR) is holding steady near $0.21, consolidating after a strong rally earlier in May. While HBAR’s technicals remain bullish, its near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts project a range of $0.19–$0.78 for 2025, with steady growth expected as the network expands its real-world use cases. For investors seeking stability, HBAR is a dependable hold—but for those chasing the next 50x, MAGA is the clear standout. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unshakable Confidence Bitcoin continues to anchor the crypto market, trading above $110,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors. Analysts forecast a possible run to $120,000–$140,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. Bitcoin’s macro strength provides a stable backdrop for altcoin surges, but its massive market cap means the days of 50x gains are likely behind it. For those seeking exponential returns, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are the new frontier. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP’s climb to $2.45 is a testament to its resilience and institutional appeal, but the real action is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With analysts projecting up to 50x returns and a presale that’s drawing unprecedented demand, MAGA is quickly becoming the breakout contender of 2025. Hedera and Bitcoin offer stability and steady growth, but for those seeking the next crypto moonshot, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the name on every smart investor’s radar.

2025-05-24T00:40:44.000Z,"Whale Accumulation Intensifies: MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and Solana Are the Top Targets","A striking shift is underway across the crypto landscape as whales—the market’s most influential players—are making bold, calculated moves. While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are rapidly emerging as favored destinations for smart capital. With XRP and TRON also seeing notable inflows, the current cycle is defined by a flight to quality and momentum, as investors position for the next wave of outsized returns. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Magnet Drawing Major Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the standout presale of 2025, with whale wallets quietly amassing large positions ahead of the project’s public debut. The presale has already surpassed $8 million, and analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even higher upside if momentum continues. The project’s capped supply, audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation—both from retail and institutional investors. Notably, even holders of XRP and Aptos are rotating profits into MAGA, eager to capitalize on what could be the most explosive early-stage opportunity of the year. As Stage 8 nears completion and the $0.007 listing approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as a rare ground-floor entry for those seeking transformative gains. Bitcoin: Whales Double Down as Retail Exits Bitcoin is experiencing a dramatic redistribution of holdings, with whales and institutions quietly accumulating while retail investors take profits. Between mid-April and mid-May, large holders increased their BTC positions by over 83,000 coins, signaling robust confidence in the market’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin’s price currently hovers above $100,000, and analysts forecast a possible surge toward $115,000–$140,000 in the near term. The options market is even more bullish, with bets on BTC reaching $200,000 by year-end. This silent accumulation by whales and institutions underscores Bitcoin’s enduring appeal as a core holding, while also highlighting the growing appetite for high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana: Whale Buys Signal Unshakable Confidence Solana is another top target for whale accumulation, with large investors withdrawing over 145,000 SOL (worth $21.8 million) from exchanges in recent weeks. On-chain data reveals that two wallets—likely controlled by the same entity—have scooped up more than 250,000 SOL (valued at $60 million) in the past month. This aggressive buying is a clear vote of confidence in Solana’s technical strength, DeFi ecosystem, and long-term growth prospects. Analysts are targeting the $200 level as a near-term milestone, with forecasts suggesting further upside as institutional adoption accelerates. Solana’s robust fundamentals and expanding developer activity make it a standout among Layer-1 platforms, drawing both speculative and long-term capital. XRP and TRON: Steady Accumulation, But MAGA Steals the Show XRP continues to attract whale attention, with over 880 million tokens accumulated in May alone as regulatory clarity and institutional adoption fuel optimism. Analysts project a move toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bullish scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if sentiment remains strong. TRON, meanwhile, is seeing steady accumulation and remains a reliable hold for those seeking stable returns. However, neither XRP nor TRON can match the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly becoming the go-to allocation for whales seeking the next crypto supercycle. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Whale accumulation is intensifying across the crypto market, with MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and Solana emerging as the top targets for smart capital. MAGA’s presale is drawing unprecedented interest, Bitcoin’s macro strength is unshaken, and Solana’s technicals are signaling further upside. As the window for early entry narrows, these tokens are setting the tone for the next phase of crypto growth—offering investors a rare chance to ride the wave of outsized returns.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days. May 30 Bitcoin options open interest, USD. Source: Laevitas.ch The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry. Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels. Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.ch Among the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price. Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price decline If Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches. The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions . Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions. Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust. Ultimately, bears’ main hope lies in a weaker macroeconomic environment, which could increase risk aversion and reduce demand for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls aim for $110,000 by May 30 Below are four likely scenarios based on current price trends. These outcomes estimate theoretical profits based on open interest imbalances and do not account for complex strategies. Between $102k and $105k: $2.75 billion in calls (buy) vs. $900 million in puts (sell). The net result favors the call instruments by $1.85 billion. Between $105k and $107k: $3.3 billion calls vs. $650 million puts, favoring calls by $2.65 billion. Between $107k and $110k: $3.7 billion calls vs. $350 million puts, favoring calls by $3.35 billion. Between $110k and $114k: $4.8 billion calls vs. $120 million puts, favoring calls by $4.7 billion. Bulls can maximize their gains by driving BTC above $110,000, which could help set a new all-time high.

2025-05-24T00:00:50.000Z,"Trump’s Tariff Policies Unlikely to Increase US Manufacturing Jobs in the ‘Foreseeable Future’: Wells Fargo Analysts","Economists at the banking giant Wells Fargo think the Trump Administration’s tariff policies are unlikely to reshore a significant number of manufacturing jobs in the US for the “foreseeable future.” Sarah House, Nicole Cervi and Aubrey Woessner argue in a new analysis that higher prices and policy uncertainty could impact US firms’ capability to expand payroll. “As downstream industries face higher costs, they must decide whether to absorb them and accept lower margins, pass them onto customers via higher selling prices or a combination of the two. Neither avenue is supportive of employment growth.” The economists say that reshoring manufacturing jobs would likely take “many years and come at high cost.” “US labor costs are a hurdle. Labor cost differentials with the rest of the world require US manufacturing firms to be highly capital-intensive to compete in a global marketplace. Thus, an expansion in manufacturing employment would require significant capital investment. In order for manufacturing employment to return to its historic peak, we estimate at a minimum $2.9 trillion in net new capital investment is required. While sizable, we view this estimate as a lower-bound. The build out of new of capacity would likely unfold over multiple years, with further increases in capital intensity and inflation requiring a higher amount.” The Wells Fargo analysts also note that lower fertility rates and a recent reduction in immigration could negatively impact working-age population growth.

2025-05-23T23:59:08.000Z,"$500 to $1M? MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Are Leading the Political Crypto Surge","A new era is dawning in the crypto world, where political narratives and market momentum are converging to create extraordinary opportunities. While Bitcoin remains the bedrock of digital finance, MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP are surging ahead as the vanguard of a political crypto movement. With Solana and Aptos also in the mix, early investors are positioning for what could be the most lucrative cycle yet—where a modest $500 investment might just pave the way to a million-dollar windfall. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Political Meme Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is not just another meme token; it’s a cultural force driving the 2025 political memecoin boom. Unlike fleeting trends that fade as quickly as they rise, MAGA stands out by combining a compelling political identity with real market traction and community engagement. The project’s presale has already attracted thousands of buyers and raised millions, with analysts projecting 25x–35x returns for those who enter before the $0.007 listing. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its ability to sustain attention and volume—turning viral energy into lasting momentum. Built-in upside mechanics, a scarcity-focused supply, and a grassroots-driven community are fueling organic demand and real transaction activity. As traders migrate from established coins like XRP and SHIBA, MAGA is rapidly becoming the go-to destination for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin: The Foundation of the Crypto Revolution Bitcoin continues to anchor the market, trading above $100,000 and drawing record inflows from institutional investors and ETFs. Analysts forecast a possible run to $116,000–$137,000 in the near term, with some bold projections even targeting $200,000 by year-end. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, its strength provides a stable backdrop for the explosive growth of political and narrative-driven altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum XRP is riding a wave of optimism, buoyed by regulatory breakthroughs, ETF speculation, and strong technical momentum. Currently trading above $2.30, XRP has surged more than 300% since late 2024 and is now poised for further gains. Analysts project a move to $2.80–$3.40 by June, with some scenarios even eyeing $5.50 by year-end if adoption accelerates. With pending ETF proposals and growing institutional interest, XRP is positioned for a supply shock that could drive prices to new highs. The combination of regulatory clarity, real-world utility, and political tailwinds makes XRP a core holding for those betting on the next phase of crypto adoption. Solana and Aptos: Technical Strength in a Shifting Market Solana remains a top Layer-1 contender, with robust DeFi activity and developer engagement supporting its price near $170. Aptos, meanwhile, is gaining traction with network upgrades and expanding partnerships. Both tokens offer strong fundamentals, but for investors seeking the highest upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is where the real action lies. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion The political crypto surge is here, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP are leading the charge. With MAGA’s presale offering unprecedented early-stage potential, Bitcoin’s macro strength, and XRP’s bullish setup, the stage is set for a transformative cycle.

2025-05-23T23:40:42.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Path to $200K: MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana Positioned for Significant Gains","As Bitcoin charts a course toward $200,000, the broader crypto market is experiencing a surge of optimism and capital rotation. While BTC’s ascent captures headlines, savvy investors are increasingly directing attention toward altcoins with explosive growth potential—notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana. With XRP and Ethereum also posting strong technicals, the stage is set for a dynamic period of gains across the digital asset landscape. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon With 25x–35x Potential While Bitcoin’s trajectory is impressive, the most aggressive capital is flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is rapidly establishing itself as 2025’s leading presale opportunity. With over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion, analysts are projecting returns of 25x–35x, with some models suggesting even greater upside if momentum persists. The project’s capped supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation by both retail and institutional investors. As each stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGA is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with enhanced transparency and scarcity-driven tokenomics. Bitcoin: The Macro Beacon With Unprecedented Momentum Bitcoin has recently shattered records, trading above $111,000 amid a wave of institutional inflows, corporate adoption, and robust ETF demand. Analysts now suggest that a sustained rally could propel BTC to $200,000 by year-end, driven by a combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, reduced supply post-halving, and global liquidity expansion. The options market reflects this bullish outlook, with traders placing bets on BTC reaching $300,000 by June. As Bitcoin solidifies its role as digital gold, the market’s risk appetite is broadening—opening the door for high-upside altcoin plays. Solana: Technical Breakout and Ecosystem Growth Solana is another standout, with its price consolidating between $158 and $175 as it builds momentum for the next leg higher. Analysts are eyeing a breakout above $175, which could open the door to a retest of $183 and beyond. Long-term forecasts suggest SOL could reach $240–$270 later in 2025, supported by robust DeFi activity, developer engagement, and whale accumulation. As Solana’s ecosystem matures, the network is attracting both institutional attention and speculative capital, making it a top pick for those seeking significant gains alongside Bitcoin. XRP and Ethereum: Strong Fundamentals and Upside Catalysts XRP is trading above $2.30, buoyed by legal clarity, the launch of CME futures, and ongoing ETF speculation. Analysts forecast a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the near term, with some optimistic scenarios targeting $5.50 by year-end if bullish momentum persists. Ethereum, meanwhile, remains the backbone of DeFi and Web3, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 with bullish technicals and ongoing upgrades. Some analysts project ETH could reach $6,700 by year-end if institutional adoption and network improvements continue to accelerate. While both XRP and ETH offer stability and long-term value, the most aggressive capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper upside. Near Protocol: Building Momentum for the Next Cycle Near Protocol (NEAR) is quietly building momentum, trading near $2.93 and showing strong technicals and developer activity. Analysts expect NEAR to stabilize at current levels before pushing higher in 2026, with long-term forecasts suggesting significant growth as the network’s scalability and ecosystem attract more users. While NEAR is a dependable hold, the most dramatic returns are currently being sought in presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion Bitcoin’s journey toward $200,000 is igniting market-wide confidence, but the real action is unfolding in high-upside altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana are positioned for significant gains, with MAGA’s presale momentum and Solana’s technical strength drawing both retail and institutional capital. XRP and Ethereum remain core holdings, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender of 2025. As Bitcoin leads the charge, the window for early entry into the next crypto supercycle is closing fast.

2025-05-23T23:30:50.000Z,"Bitcoin Buyers Regain Control – Spot CVD Flashes Bullish Shift Above $110,000","As Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 on Binance crypto exchange yesterday, technical data suggests that the latest BTC rally is being dominated by buyers. If this trend continues, BTC may see further price appreciation in the near term. Buyers Regain Control Of Bitcoin Spot Market According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by crypto analyst ibrahimcosar, buyers appear to be dominating the BTC spot market. The analyst observed that the Bitcoin Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has shifted back into green territory. For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD measures the difference between taker buy and taker sell volumes on spot exchanges over time. A rising Spot Taker CVD indicates that aggressive buyers are dominating the market, signalling potential bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rises 3.4% As Small Investors Return To The Market – New ATH Soon? BTC Spot Taker CVD turning green is signficant. Most notably, it means buy orders have regained dominance after an extended period in which sell orders led the market. A higher volume of buy orders over time suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum may persist. As shown in the chart shared by ibrahimcosar, the CVD remained mostly red for the majority of Q1 2025 – indicating strong selling pressure. This selling behavior aligned with BTC’s price action, which saw the asset fall from its previous ATH in January to a low of around $76,000 in April. The fact that BTC’s Spot Taker CVD has turned green while the asset is setting fresh ATHs makes this trend especially noteworthy. It indicates that buyers are willing to accumulate BTC even at historically high prices, likely in anticipation of continued upside. That said, recent price action might temporarily interrupt BTC’s momentum. In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that BTC could soon break down from its current range of $110,400 to $111,100. A Different Kind Of Rally Typically, BTC hitting a new ATH is usually met with wider market euphoria, leading to a sharp price decline that catches most investors off-guard. However, experts opine that the current rally is different from previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk suggests that new and short-term BTC investors are sitting on substantial unrealized profits, and not showing any signs of panic selling amid the cryptocurrency’s price surge to new highs. Similarly, whale reaction to BTC’s bullish price trajectory has been mixed. While new whales have been taking major profits during the ongoing rally, old whales have resisted selling their holdings, showing minimal selling activity. Finally, the neutral funding rates in the BTC futures market reinforce the idea that the current rally is more organic and less driven by speculation than those in the past. At press time, BTC trades at $108,553, down 2.6% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-23T23:20:25.000Z,"Analysts on High Alert: MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum Poised for a 10,000% Surge","The digital asset landscape is buzzing with anticipation as 2025 unfolds, with industry experts circling a trio of cryptocurrencies primed for extraordinary growth. While Bitcoin and Litecoin continue to anchor the market, all eyes are now on MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum—each presenting compelling reasons to believe that a staggering 10,000% return could be within reach for early adopters. Among these, MAGACOIN PRESALE’s presale is rapidly becoming the focal point for those seeking the next crypto phenomenon. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Sensation With Monumental Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is electrifying the crypto sphere as its presale approaches a critical juncture, having already surpassed $8 million in contributions. With each stage filling faster than the last and the entry price still under $0.001, market forecasters are signaling a potential windfall of 10,000% or more for those who position themselves early. The project’s limited supply of 100 billion tokens, combined with rigorous security audits and a politically charged narrative, is sparking a frenzy of both retail and institutional interest. As the countdown to the $0.007 listing ticks on, MAGA is emerging as a once-in-a-cycle chance for exponential returns—a prospect that is drawing comparisons to the meteoric rises of other viral tokens, but with enhanced transparency and strategic tokenomics. XRP: Surging Confidence and Institutional Tailwinds XRP is riding a wave of renewed optimism, currently priced above $2.30 and bolstered by regulatory victories and the introduction of CME futures. Market strategists anticipate a climb toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, with some bold outlooks even eyeing $4.50 if current trends persist. The resolution of Ripple’s legal battles and the green light for institutional participation have cleared the path for broader adoption. While XRP’s trajectory is undeniably positive, the allure of early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—where the runway for explosive gains remains wide open—is proving irresistible to forward-thinking investors. Ethereum: Robust Tech and Expanding Horizons Ethereum continues to stand as a pillar of innovation, trading robustly between $2,400 and $2,900 amidst ongoing network enhancements and growing institutional engagement. Despite market fluctuations, ETH’s technical foundation remains sound, with analysts projecting a move toward $3,000 and potentially beyond as upgrades and adoption accelerate. Some visionary forecasts even hint at a five-figure future, though such a leap would require a seismic shift in market dynamics. While Ethereum offers a stable and proven platform, the most ambitious capital is gravitating toward high-growth presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the promise of outsized returns is impossible to ignore. Bitcoin and Litecoin: Steady Hands in a Volatile Market Bitcoin maintains its dominance, trading above $100,000 and attracting unprecedented institutional inflows. Analysts suggest that a push toward $120,000 or higher is plausible if bullish sentiment endures. Litecoin, meanwhile, remains a reliable presence, offering stability and liquidity in a market often defined by turbulence. Yet, as savvy investors pivot toward higher-reward opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale is emerging as the destination of choice for those aiming to ride the next wave of crypto wealth creation. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE Closing Thoughts Analysts are unanimous in highlighting the extraordinary potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Ethereum as the market gears up for a possible 10,000% rally. With MAGA’s presale nearing its final stages, a fixed $0.007 listing price, and a community growing by the day, the project is commanding attention as the standout early-stage play of 2025. For those seeking to capitalize on the next major crypto breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the clear frontrunner.

2025-05-23T22:40:00.000Z,"Onchain privacy is a necessity in the age of AI — Shielded CEO","Blockchain privacy tools such as zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs will become increasingly necessary to protect online user data in the age of artificial intelligence, according to Eran Barak, CEO of Shielded Technologies, the developer behind the Midnight privacy chain. In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents. Hackers targeting centralized entities have a \""massive\"" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that ZK-proofs, a way of verifying onchain data without revealing it, solve this problem: \""Blockchain is going to improve cybersecurity around the world, because, for a hacker to get to actual data, they need to hack individual wallets, but their ROI would be one record instead of millions — not worth it. They are going to go elsewhere.\"" Privacy solutions have become a major focus for many Web3 developers, as the need to shield metadata from AI algorithms grows and large institutions demand privacy tools to protect sensitive data as a prerequisite to bringing their business operations onchain. Midnight generates shielded assets that provide users with onchain privacy while maintaining compliance.

2025-05-23T22:30:49.000Z,"OpenAI Jony Ive Partnership: Bold Leap for AI Devices","BitcoinWorld OpenAI Jony Ive Partnership: Bold Leap for AI Devices The world of technology is constantly evolving, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the rapid advancements of Artificial Intelligence. For those plugged into the crypto and blockchain space, staying ahead of the curve on frontier tech like AI is crucial, as these innovations often shape future digital economies and investment opportunities. A major development just hit the wires: OpenAI Jony Ive are joining forces in a monumental deal that signals a bold new direction for AI. OpenAI Jony Ive: A $6.5 Billion Bet on the Future In a move that sent ripples through the tech industry, OpenAI has acquired io, the secretive device startup co-founded by legendary designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This wasn’t a small cash purchase; it was a staggering $6.5 billion all-equity deal, representing OpenAI’s largest acquisition to date. The core of the deal brings Ive, the design genius behind iconic Apple products like the iPhone, iMac, and iPod, into the OpenAI fold. Through his creative firm, LoveFrom, Ive will now lead design and creative efforts for OpenAI. The clear objective behind this massive investment and high-profile partnership? To take AI beyond the screen and spearhead the creation of a new generation of AI consumer devices . This isn’t just about software anymore; it’s about building tangible products that integrate AI seamlessly into our daily lives, potentially creating entirely new markets and user experiences. Sam Altman OpenAI and the ‘AI iPhone’ Vision The narrative surrounding the Sam Altman OpenAI and Jony Ive partnership is unmistakable: OpenAI is positioning itself to replicate the kind of paradigm-shifting impact Apple had with the iPhone. Sam Altman is being framed as the visionary, akin to Steve Jobs, while Jony Ive is the design maestro tasked with making that vision a tangible, desirable reality. The staged photos of the duo circulating on social media only reinforced this carefully crafted message. The goal is clear: take the revolutionary impact of the iPhone launch and apply it to artificial intelligence, creating devices that redefine how we interact with technology. This focus on AI consumer devices highlights a strategic shift. While much of the AI conversation has centered on large language models, generative AI, and software applications, the next frontier is integrating this intelligence into hardware that users interact with directly, intuitively, and constantly. Think wearables, ambient computing, or entirely new form factors we haven’t even imagined yet. Ive’s expertise in human-centric design and creating beloved products is precisely what OpenAI needs to translate powerful AI models into accessible and appealing devices. Contrasting Strategies: OpenAI’s Bold Move vs. Google AI Strategy This aggressive push by OpenAI, securing a design legend and betting billions on hardware, starkly contrasts with how other tech giants are approaching the AI race, particularly the perceived Google AI strategy . While Google has been a pioneer in AI research and continues to integrate AI into its vast suite of services (as seen with their AI-powered search upgrades demonstrated at Google I/O), OpenAI’s move with Ive suggests a focus on creating disruptive, standalone AI hardware products from the ground up. This isn’t just about enhancing existing products; it’s about building entirely new ones. The recent Google I/O event, as discussed on Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast, showcased Google’s advancements, including the return of concepts like Google Glass (albeit in a different context) and developer reactions to AI search. However, OpenAI’s partnership with Ive positions them not just as a leader in AI models, but as a potential leader in the future of AI hardware design, directly challenging established players in the consumer device space. The Promise of AI Innovation Beyond the Screen The potential for AI innovation driven by this partnership is immense. Jony Ive’s design philosophy has always been about simplifying technology and making it feel intuitive and magical. Applying this approach to AI could result in devices that are not just smart, but truly enhance human capabilities and interactions without the need for traditional screens or interfaces. Imagine AI companions integrated into wearables that provide real-time information, context-aware assistance, or seamless control over your environment, all designed with the elegance and usability Ive is known for. The implications for the broader tech ecosystem, including areas relevant to cryptocurrency and Web3, are significant. As AI becomes more embedded in physical devices, it could drive new forms of data ownership, decentralized AI processing, or novel incentive structures that intersect with blockchain technology. The infrastructure required to support billions of AI-powered devices will also present opportunities and challenges for decentralized networks. Beyond the OpenAI and Google news, the Equity podcast also delved into other notable tech stories, including: Insights from Google I/O, touching upon developer sentiment regarding AI tools and the potential resurgence of concepts like Google Glass. Updates on Luminar, the lidar startup, navigating layoffs, CEO changes, and fundraising efforts. A look at 23andMe’s new direction and the potential uses of its vast DNA data repository under new ownership. These diverse topics highlight the dynamic and interconnected nature of the current technology landscape, where advancements in one area, like AI, can have ripple effects across multiple industries. Conclusion: A New Era for AI Devices The partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive is far more than just a high-profile acquisition; it’s a strategic declaration that OpenAI is serious about bringing AI into the physical world through thoughtfully designed consumer devices. By combining cutting-edge AI research with unparalleled design expertise, they are aiming for nothing less than creating the next foundational technology platform, much like the personal computer and the smartphone before it. This move sets the stage for an exciting era of AI consumer devices that could fundamentally change how we live and interact with technology, pushing the boundaries of AI innovation and potentially opening up new frontiers for the digital economy.

2025-05-23T22:20:52.000Z,"US Treasury Signals ‘Massive’ Deals: What It Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Treasury Signals ‘Massive’ Deals: What It Means for Crypto The world of finance is often driven by anticipation, and recent comments from a key figure within the US Treasury have certainly stirred the pot. According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the market can expect several large deals to be announced in the coming weeks. This kind of statement from such a high-level official is significant and warrants attention, particularly for those navigating the complex waters of the financial markets, including the cryptocurrency space. Who is Scott Bessent and Why Does His Word Matter for Market Impact? Scott Bessent serves as the Secretary of the US Treasury , a pivotal role in the United States government. The Treasury Department is responsible for managing the nation’s finances, including tax collection, currency production, and managing government accounts and public debt. More broadly, the Treasury plays a crucial role in shaping economic policy, implementing sanctions, and overseeing financial regulations. Therefore, any forward-looking statements from the Treasury Secretary carry considerable weight and can provide insights into the government’s economic priorities and upcoming actions. When Secretary Bessent speaks of expecting “several large deals ,” he is likely referring to significant transactions or initiatives that could have broad economic implications. These might involve: Major mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that require regulatory review or government facilitation. Significant government contracts or infrastructure projects. International financial agreements or trade deals. Potential regulatory changes or enforcement actions impacting major industries. Large-scale bond issuances or debt management strategies. The specific nature of these deals remains undisclosed, adding an element of mystery and prompting speculation across various sectors. What Kind of Large Deals Could the US Treasury Be Signaling? While Secretary Bessent’s statement is concise, the term “large deals” from the perspective of the US Treasury can encompass a wide range of possibilities, each with distinct potential outcomes. Understanding the potential scope helps us gauge the possible market impact . Consider these possibilities: 1. Infrastructure and Public Works: The government often facilitates or funds massive infrastructure projects. Announcements here could involve billions in spending on roads, bridges, energy grids, or digital infrastructure. Such deals stimulate specific industries and can have a ripple effect on employment and economic growth. 2. Regulatory Actions and Policy Shifts: The Treasury is involved in financial regulation. A “large deal” might not be a transaction but a significant policy shift or a major enforcement action against a large financial institution or industry. These can reshape competitive landscapes and introduce new compliance burdens or opportunities. 3. International Financial Agreements: In a globalized economy, the US Treasury is constantly engaged in discussions and agreements with other nations regarding trade, currency stability, sanctions, and international debt. Major deals here could impact global markets, currency exchange rates, and international capital flows. 4. Strategic Industry Support or Divestiture: Occasionally, the government might be involved in supporting or divesting from strategically important industries or assets. This could involve anything from energy sector support to the sale of government-held stakes in certain entities. 5. Debt and Fiscal Management: While perhaps less a “deal” in the traditional sense, major announcements regarding US debt management, bond issuance strategies, or significant fiscal policy changes could be framed as large financial undertakings by the Treasury. The ambiguity allows for broad interpretation, which is why market participants are keenly awaiting further details. The timing, described as “coming weeks,” suggests these announcements are imminent rather than distant. How Could These US Treasury Announcements Create Market Impact, Especially for Crypto? At first glance, news about US Treasury deals might seem unrelated to the world of cryptocurrency. However, the traditional financial system and the crypto market are increasingly interconnected. Major macroeconomic events and significant developments in traditional finance inevitably have a ripple effect on digital assets. Here’s how Secretary Bessent’s anticipated announcements could create market impact for crypto: 1. Overall Market Sentiment: Large, positive economic deals (e.g., significant infrastructure spending, favorable international agreements) can boost overall market confidence and risk appetite. When traditional markets are bullish, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, announcements perceived negatively (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, unfavorable economic outlooks) could lead to a flight to safety, potentially causing sell-offs in crypto. 2. Liquidity and Capital Flows: Major deals often involve significant movements of capital. Increased economic activity or investment stemming from these deals could increase overall liquidity in the financial system. While not directly flowing into crypto, higher liquidity generally creates a more favorable environment for asset prices across the board. 3. Inflation and Economic Outlook: Depending on the nature of the deals, they could influence expectations about inflation, economic growth, or interest rates. For instance, large government spending could be seen as inflationary, which has historically been a narrative that benefits scarce assets like Bitcoin. Announcements signaling economic strength might reduce the appeal of safe havens but increase confidence in growth assets. 4. Regulatory Environment: If any of the “large deals” involve new financial regulations or the enforcement of existing ones, this could directly impact the cryptocurrency industry. Increased regulatory clarity (or uncertainty) is a major factor influencing institutional adoption and market stability for crypto. 5. US Dollar Strength: Treasury actions and major economic deals can influence the strength of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in USD and seen by some as alternative stores of value. It’s crucial for those following crypto news to pay close attention to these developments from the US Treasury . While the connection might not always be direct, the macroeconomic environment shaped by these announcements is a powerful force influencing investment decisions globally. What Should Crypto Investors Do Ahead of These Large Deals? Given the potential for significant market impact stemming from the anticipated large deals announced by the US Treasury , how should crypto investors prepare? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on traditional financial news outlets and official US Treasury announcements in the coming weeks. Understand the details of the deals as they are revealed, not just the headlines. Assess Potential Implications: Once details emerge, try to analyze how the specific nature of the deals could affect the broader economy, inflation expectations, regulatory landscape, and overall market sentiment. Consider both positive and negative potential outcomes. Review Your Portfolio: Think about how different scenarios resulting from the announcements might affect your current crypto holdings. Are you heavily invested in assets sensitive to regulatory changes? Or perhaps assets seen as hedges against inflation? Manage Risk: Volatility can increase around major economic announcements. Ensure your portfolio is adequately diversified and that you are not overexposed to sudden market shifts. Consider setting stop-loss orders or taking other risk management measures if you trade actively. Avoid Panic Reactions: Initial market reactions can sometimes be overblown or based on incomplete information. Take time to understand the full picture before making significant changes to your investment strategy based solely on the immediate news reaction. The comments from Scott Bessent serve as a heads-up that significant financial news is on the horizon. Proactive preparation and informed analysis will be key to navigating the potential market movements that follow. Potential Benefits and Challenges for Crypto from Treasury Announcements Let’s quickly summarize the potential upside and downside for the crypto market based on the type and reaction to these anticipated large deals : Potential Benefit Scenarios Potential Challenge Scenarios Deals boost overall economic confidence and risk appetite. Deals signal tighter regulation impacting crypto directly or indirectly. Deals involve significant stimulus perceived as inflationary. Deals lead to a stronger USD, potentially pressuring crypto prices. Deals create new infrastructure or tech opportunities beneficial to blockchain. Deals reveal negative economic outlook or increased fiscal instability. Deals improve international financial stability. Market reacts negatively to the specifics of the announced deals. Increased liquidity flows broadly benefit asset markets. Capital flows are directed away from risk assets towards traditional safe havens. This table illustrates that the impact is not predetermined and will depend entirely on the specifics of what Scott Bessent and the US Treasury announce. Conclusion: Staying Alert in a Connected Financial World Scott Bessent ‘s statement about expecting several large deals in the coming weeks is a clear signal that significant economic activity is anticipated at the highest levels of the US Treasury . While the details remain under wraps, the potential for these announcements to create notable market impact across various sectors, including the increasingly integrated world of cryptocurrency, is undeniable. For anyone tracking crypto news , this serves as a reminder that macroeconomics plays a vital role in the performance of digital assets. Staying informed about these developments, understanding their potential implications, and managing risk are essential steps in navigating the markets during periods of significant government announcements. The coming weeks promise to be interesting, so keep your eyes peeled for news from the US Treasury .

2025-05-23T22:20:41.000Z,"Major Rotation in Play: Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum Traders Are Swapping Into MAGACOIN FINANCE","With Bitcoin’s rally showing signs of exhaustion and Solana consolidating near resistance, a significant shift is underway in the crypto markets. Traders and whales from Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum communities are reallocating capital into high-momentum alternatives—most notably, MAGACOIN FINANCE. As the market transitions into Q3, the narrative is clear: smart capital is leaving overextended majors for early-stage projects with breakout setups, meme traction, and clear accumulation signals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the center of this strategic rotation. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Renewed Optimism XRP is holding firm around $2.35 after bouncing from recent lows, with bullish divergence emerging across multiple technical timeframes. Whale accumulation wallets have steadily increased, suggesting that larger players are quietly building positions. The conclusion of Ripple’s SEC case and improved on-chain metrics have made XRP a strong candidate for Q3 rotation flows. As developers continue to build financial tools on its fast, low-cost settlement network, sentiment is improving. While analysts are eyeing a push toward $2.80–$3.40 in the coming weeks, many long-time XRP holders are now diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper upside as the altcoin cycle heats up. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the go-to speculative play for traders rotating out of Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. What began as a niche meme coin is now dominating early-stage Telegram groups and discussion threads, thanks to its timely political branding and viral community-driven momentum. The project’s deflationary model, capped 100 billion supply, and alignment with election narratives have made MAGA a favorite for those chasing asymmetric upside. Whale activity is surging, with a recent 72.95 ETH buy ($133,743) marking the largest early-stage purchase of 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full and a $0.007 listing target, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a true accumulation phase, and analysts now call it the last major 50x opportunity of the cycle. As retail and institutional capital flows in, MAGA is poised for breakout price discovery before listings hit the public charts. Solana, SUI, and Ethereum: Capital Rotation Underway Solana (SOL) remains resilient above $170, but faces near-term exhaustion as price action cools. Some traders are reallocating profits into more volatile tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is more attractive. SUI is gaining attention after recent network upgrades and rising developer interest, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a long-term accumulation target. ETH’s Layer-2 activity and validator growth keep it foundational, but for short-term explosive returns, many investors are now selectively rotating into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin: From All-Time Highs to Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin’s surge past $111,000 has been fueled by institutional demand and bullish technicals, with analysts forecasting potential highs of $125,000–$150,000 in 2025. However, as BTC stabilizes, the options market and on-chain data show traders increasingly shifting focus to altcoins for higher multiples. This rotation is driving new volume and volatility into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is now seen as the high-conviction play for those seeking exponential upside in the current cycle. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion The current market is witnessing a major rotation as Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum traders move capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. With whale accumulation at record highs, a $0.007 listing target, and the largest single early-stage buy of 2025 already on the books, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the breakout candidate for Q3. As the window for early entry closes, analysts agree: MAGA is set to lead the next wave of crypto gains, making it the top altcoin to watch as capital rotates out of overextended majors.

According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million. Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day. Semler Scientific share price.

Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance. Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations. Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin.

2025-05-23T22:18:11.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, US lawmakers have urged the Justice Department to investigate President Donald Trump's crypto dinner. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has pushed back reports linking him to World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Summer Mersinger suggested that crypto perpetual futures could soon be introduced in US markets. US House members call for investigation into Trump's memecoin dinner Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.” In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.” The call for an investigation and a press conference asking Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner both occurred hours before the event, which was held at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington, DC. A group of protesters, joined by Senator Jeff Merkley, gathered outside the venue with signs stating “illegal crypto party” and “democracy is not for sale.” CZ refutes claims in latest WSJ article on Trump-linked crypto dealings Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pushed back against a report in The Wall Street Journal, calling it a “hit piece” filled with inaccuracies and negative assumptions. In an X post, Zhao criticized the publication’s portrayal of his alleged involvement with World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by a business entity affiliated with US President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company. Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official. “I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng Zhao Crypto perp futures coming “very soon” to US: CFTC’s Mersinger Outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger said on May 22 that the regulator could greenlight crypto perpetual futures contracts “very soon.” “We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she told Bloomberg TV, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.” Summer Mersinger on Bloomberg TV. Source: YouTube Crypto perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate, often with high leverage, on the price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning it and can be held indefinitely. Mersinger, who will leave the CFTC at the end of May to join the crypto lobby group the Blockchain Association as CEO, said having crypto derivatives trading and regulated in the US would be a “really good thing for these markets and would be really beneficial to the industry broadly.”",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T22:15:50.000Z,"Ethereum-Based Meme Coins PEPE and FPPE To Rally 15,400% With Bitcoin Price Set To Reach $150,000","As the Bitcoin price breaks past previous resistance zones and blazes its way toward an all-time high of $150,000, Ethereum-based meme coins like PEPE and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are charting their own explosive paths, with demand surging and momentum building. The Bitcoin price historic rally is igniting significant interest in these Ethereum (ETH) meme coins, and this surge has caught the attention of savvy investors and Ethereum (ETH) whales, who are on the hunt for exponential gains. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The New School Meme Coin Leader In a market saturated with short-lived hype, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as a technological outlier. The meme coin is fusing artificial intelligence with meme culture to build a uniquely powerful ecosystem. Analysts are projecting a 15,400% price rally for Ethereum-based meme coins, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is expected to achieve this feat following its presale that raised a stunning $900,000 in its first 72 hours. An extraordinary leap from its starting price of just $0.0000002 could turn a modest $1,000 investment into a staggering $155,000. These predictions are based on this project’s sound fundamentals and aggressive expansion, with multi-chain deployment to Binance Smart Chain and Polygon on the roadmap, setting the meme coin for future price surges. What makes this AI coin even more attractive is its robust tokenomics model. Designed like Bitcoin’s (BTC) halving model, the meme coin’s auto-burn mechanism removes 1% of the supply, permanently increasing scarcity. Another 3% is redistributed to token holders, allowing passive income generation for holders who will not rush to dump their tokens. Unique AI Agents For Community Engagement FloppyPepe (FPPE) introduces advanced AI agents such as FloppyAI , an interactive bot designed to deliver live crypto analysis based on real-time price action, macro sentiment, and global events. Creators are flocking to its Meme-o-Matic tool, a personalized meme-generation engine that turns text, video, or images into viral-ready content. For video creators, FloppyX enables dynamic content creation through automated pipelines. This level of utility is unprecedented among Ethereum (ETH) meme coins and positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the forefront of the AI crypto sector. Even more compelling for investors, this token is built without tax on transactions, offering relief in a gas-fee-heavy Ethereum (ETH) landscape. With Ethereum (ETH) gas fees notoriously volatile, investors seeking frictionless interactions are porting to FloppyPepe (FPPE) and taking advantage of an 80% bonus with code “FLOPPY80,” a powerful incentive that’s drawn both retail and institutional interest into the project’s growing liquidity. Pepe (PEPE): The Original Sparks Pepe (PEPE) remains one of the most talked-about Ethereum (ETH) meme coins in the space. With its viral community and iconic frog branding, Pepe (PEPE) has proven that meme coins can dominate investor sentiment. According to a popular X account, Pepe (PEPE) is preparing for a major breakout . But while Pepe (PEPE) paved the way, its growth trajectory is dependent on fan support and constant hype. Pepe’s (PEPE) run isn’t over in the Ethereum meme coins arena. However, investors who missed the early Pepe (PEPE) breakout now have a second chance to ride a smarter, more rewarding wave with FloppyPepe (FPPE). Bitcoin (BTC): The Anchor That Lifts All Boats Bitcoin price’s unprecedented rise toward the $150,000 mark is a bullish signal for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Whenever the Bitcoin price leads the charge, altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and meme coins, tend to benefit most from the trickle-down liquidity of a full-blown Bitcoin bull market. With just a 2% increase , the Bitcoin price becomes the gateway, but it’s the altcoins that generate the highest ROI. And within that category, Ethereum-based meme coins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) are perfectly positioned for the spotlight, set to replicate the Bitcoin price bullish trajectory. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Should Be In Every Crypto Portfolio In 2025 The surging Bitcoin price momentum has created a perfect storm for a breakout token like FloppyPepe (FPPE) . With zero transaction taxes, hyper-engaged AI tools, and a tokenomics model that encourages long-term holding, the meme coin offers pure value. Early backers are already securing massive positions thanks to the FLOPPY80 bonus code. The window to get in on FloppyPepe (FPPE) before it dominates the Ethereum (ETH) meme coin landscape is closing fast. Now is the best chance to position for 2025’s biggest crypto breakout.

In a new filing with the state government of Massachusetts, Chase says an employee accessed its systems “without business justification” on November 5th of 2024.

Due to various reporting requirements, it is not known whether that same employee stole data from customers in other states at time of publishing. Chase says the employee has been fired and fraudulent transactions have been reimbursed. Meanwhile, a separate new filing in Massachusetts shows TD Bank has uncovered a similar incident affecting several customers in the state. “We recently discovered that in November 2024, an employee accessed your information without a legitimate business purpose. We believe this was the cause of the fraudulent activity on your account(s).” TD Bank says the personal information that may have been exposed includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, addresses, account numbers, social security numbers and transactional data.

2025-05-23T21:30:38.000Z,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Flashes Major Strength — Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP May Be Lagging Behind","A quiet but powerful rotation is underway across the crypto landscape. While Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP have long been the heavyweights of the market, a new contender is emerging with remarkable momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 of its presale nears completion and whale accumulation intensifies, analysts say this stealth accumulation phase could be the start of a major breakout for MAGA—one that retail investors can’t afford to overlook. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the most-watched early-stage altcoin of 2025. With over $8 million raised, a fixed listing target of $0.007, and a scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply, MAGA’s blend of political branding and Hashex-audited contracts is fueling a surge of strategic accumulation. Whale wallets previously focused on Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP are now locking in positions ahead of listings, with some analyst models forecasting 25x–35x returns—and projections as high as 20,000% if current momentum continues. Early buyers can still claim a 50% bonus by using the promo code PATRIOT50X , making now the prime window for entry before the next wave of price discovery. As capital moves in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as the top asymmetric bet for Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Anchor, But Capital Is Rotating Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s foundation, trading above $105,000 as institutional inflows continue to pour in. However, with whale wallets diversifying and profits being rotated into high-upside altcoins, BTC’s role is shifting from explosive growth engine to macro anchor. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. This strategic shift is positioning MAGA as a leading candidate for outsized returns as the cycle progresses. Cardano and XRP: Whales Rebalance for Higher Upside Cardano (ADA) is holding around $0.85, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. While ADA developers are delivering new milestones, whale movements show a clear trend: high-net investors are reallocating into smaller, pre-exchange tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside. XRP, trading at $2.36, is also seeing whales diversify as legal clarity and futures launches fuel renewed interest, but limited short-term catalysts are driving capital toward emerging high-ROI alternatives like MAGA. This rebalancing underscores the market’s hunger for early-stage momentum and asymmetric returns. Solana and Cosmos: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is holding strong above $170, with robust DeFi activity and developer engagement, while Cosmos (ATOM) continues to build quietly in the background. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s disciplined rollout, transparent tokenomics, and clear roadmap are making it the breakout favorite for those chasing the next big crypto move. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion The stealth accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by whales from Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP is a signal retail investors can’t ignore. As capital shifts from large caps and recently pumped tokens, MAGA is emerging as the top asymmetric play for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , and a locked-in $0.007 listing price, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most promising early-stage opportunity of the year. If current momentum continues, MAGA could deliver exponential returns—and early movers are already making that bet.

In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections. Related: Ukraine strategic Bitcoin reserve bill reportedly in final stages On May 6, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte was the first to sign a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs later approved a law allowing the state to claim ownership of unclaimed crypto.

As of March 11, the bill has been referred to the Senate Banking Committee, and it was unclear if or when the chamber would consider a vote. The Senate will likely first move forward with debate on a bill to regulate payment stablecoins, the GENIUS Act, with some lawmakers anticipating a vote by Memorial Day, May 26.

2025-05-23T21:20:59.000Z,"Kalshi Revolutionizes Access: Seamless Crypto Deposits Now Live","BitcoinWorld Kalshi Revolutionizes Access: Seamless Crypto Deposits Now Live Are you involved in the world of cryptocurrency and looking for new ways to engage with your digital assets? Get ready for some exciting news! A significant development is unfolding in the prediction market space that directly impacts how you might use your crypto. What Exactly is Kalshi and Why Does it Matter? Before we dive into the big announcement, let’s quickly touch upon what Kalshi is. Imagine a platform where you can trade on the outcome of future events. Not stock prices or commodities, but real-world occurrences like ‘Will the US GDP grow by X% this quarter?’ or ‘Will a specific weather event happen?’. That’s the essence of Kalshi – it’s a regulated prediction market platform based in the United States. Prediction markets are fascinating because they allow people to bet (or trade) on the probability of events. The price of a contract on Kalshi reflects the market’s collective belief about the likelihood of that event occurring. They are often seen as a unique way to gauge public sentiment or even hedge against certain risks. Why does Kalshi matter? As a regulated entity, it brings a level of legitimacy and accessibility to prediction markets that wasn’t widely available before, especially in the US. It operates within a defined legal framework, making it distinct from some more decentralized or less regulated alternatives. The Big Reveal: Kalshi Adds Crypto Deposits The core news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, is that Kalshi has officially introduced support for crypto deposits . This means users now have an alternative method to fund their accounts beyond traditional methods like bank transfers or credit cards. This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a significant bridge being built between the traditional financial world, where platforms like Kalshi operate, and the rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. For years, accessing platforms like this often required navigating conventional banking rails, which can sometimes be slow or restrictive for those whose wealth is primarily in digital assets. By integrating crypto deposit functionality, Kalshi is opening its doors wider to the cryptocurrency community, acknowledging the increasing prevalence and utility of digital currencies as a form of value and payment. How Does Supporting Crypto Deposits Benefit Users? Adding the ability to deposit crypto brings several tangible benefits to users interested in participating in the Kalshi prediction market: Increased Accessibility: For individuals holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, this provides a direct path to fund their Kalshi accounts without needing to first convert crypto to fiat currency through an exchange and then transfer it to their bank. Potential Speed: Depending on the specific cryptocurrency and network supported, crypto deposits can sometimes be faster than traditional bank transfers, especially international ones. Alternative Funding Source: It diversifies the funding options available, offering flexibility to users who may prefer using their digital assets. Lower Fees (Potentially): While network fees exist for crypto transactions, they might be more favorable than certain traditional payment processing fees, depending on the amount and method. Seamless Experience: For crypto-native users, funding directly from a wallet creates a more integrated and familiar experience. How to Deposit Crypto on Kalshi (Likely Process) While specific steps can vary slightly depending on Kalshi’s implementation, the general process to deposit crypto on a platform like this typically involves the following: Navigate to the Deposit Section: Log in to your Kalshi account and find the section dedicated to depositing funds. Select Cryptocurrency: Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit from the list of supported options (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, etc.). Kalshi will likely support major, stable cryptocurrencies first. Generate Deposit Address: The platform will generate a unique deposit address for that specific cryptocurrency and potentially specify the required network (e.g., ERC-20 for Ethereum/USDC, BTC network for Bitcoin). It is crucial to use the correct network. Send Funds from Your Wallet: Open your external cryptocurrency wallet (hardware wallet, software wallet, or exchange wallet) and initiate a transfer to the generated Kalshi deposit address. Confirm Transaction: The transaction will need to be confirmed on the blockchain. This can take varying amounts of time depending on the network congestion and the specific cryptocurrency. Funds Appear in Kalshi Account: Once confirmed, the deposited crypto amount (or its equivalent value, likely converted to USD internally by Kalshi) will appear in your Kalshi account balance, ready for trading on the prediction market . Users should always double-check the deposit address and network before sending funds, as sending crypto to the wrong address or network can result in permanent loss of funds. What Does This Mean for the Prediction Market Landscape? The integration of crypto deposits by a regulated platform like Kalshi is a significant indicator of the growing convergence between traditional finance and the crypto world. It signals that mainstream platforms are increasingly recognizing the need to accommodate users who hold digital assets. For the prediction market sector specifically, this move could attract a new demographic of users who were previously hesitant or found it inconvenient to use traditional funding methods. It could potentially increase liquidity and participation in the markets offered on Kalshi, leading to more robust price discovery on various event outcomes. This also sets a precedent. As one regulated platform successfully integrates crypto, others in similar or adjacent spaces might follow suit, further blurring the lines between centralized, regulated platforms and decentralized, crypto-native applications. Challenges and Considerations While exciting, the integration of cryptocurrency deposits isn’t without potential challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory environment for both prediction markets and cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in the US. Kalshi operates under specific regulations, but the interaction with crypto could introduce new complexities. Price Volatility: If users deposit volatile cryptocurrencies, the value of their deposit in fiat terms (which is likely how account balances on Kalshi are tracked for trading) can fluctuate significantly before it’s used. Kalshi may opt to support primarily stablecoins to mitigate this. Security Risks: While Kalshi will implement security measures, the act of transferring crypto from a user’s wallet carries inherent risks related to user error (wrong address/network) or wallet security. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto deposits adds operational complexity for Kalshi, including handling various cryptocurrencies, networks, and compliance requirements related to digital assets. Despite these challenges, the benefits of tapping into the vast cryptocurrency user base seem to outweigh the hurdles for Kalshi. The Broader Trend: Crypto Meets Mainstream Finance Kalshi adding the ability to deposit crypto is part of a larger, undeniable trend. We are seeing increasing integration points between the crypto ecosystem and traditional financial services.

2025-05-23T21:10:01.000Z,"DOJ Crypto Seizure: US Government Files to Confiscate Astonishing $24M From Qakbot Developer","BitcoinWorld DOJ Crypto Seizure: US Government Files to Confiscate Astonishing $24M From Qakbot Developer In a significant move highlighting the ongoing battle against cybercrime and the illicit use of digital assets, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated proceedings for a major DOJ crypto seizure . This action targets a Russian national accused of being a key figure behind the notorious Qakbot malware, aiming to confiscate millions in cryptocurrency. What Prompted This Significant DOJ Crypto Seizure? The U.S. DOJ filed a civil forfeiture complaint seeking to seize more than $24 million worth of cryptocurrency. The target of this action is Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, identified as a developer of the potent Qakbot malware . According to reports, Gallyamov is alleged to have played a crucial role in the operation of Qakbot, a sophisticated threat responsible for widespread global ransomware attacks and other malicious activities. This isn’t the first time Qakbot has been in the crosshairs of international law enforcement. Known for its ability to infect systems, steal financial information, and deploy ransomware, Qakbot has been a persistent and costly threat for individuals and organizations worldwide. The scale of its operation is staggering, having reportedly infected hundreds of thousands of computers globally over its lifespan. Breaking Down the Seized Assets: A Closer Look at the DOJ Crypto Seizure The assets subject to forfeiture in this DOJ crypto seizure case are substantial and diverse, reflecting the types of digital currencies often favored by cybercriminals for various reasons, including perceived anonymity and ease of transfer across borders. The seized assets include: Approximately 170 Bitcoins (BTC) Over $4 million in various stablecoins At current market prices, the value of 170 BTC alone can fluctuate significantly, but combined with the stablecoins, the total value exceeds $24 million, making it a noteworthy seizure in the context of combating crypto crime . Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, might seem counterintuitive for criminals seeking to hide funds. However, they are often used for temporary storage or transfer due to their stable value compared to volatile assets like Bitcoin, making them practical for moving large sums without price risk. The Allegations: Qakbot Malware and Ransomware Crypto Rustam Gallyamov is accused of developing and utilizing the Qakbot malware in connection with global ransomware campaigns. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom, typically demanded in cryptocurrency, is paid. Qakbot has served as a crucial tool in the ransomware ecosystem, often acting as an initial infection vector or a delivery mechanism for more potent ransomware strains. The use of ransomware crypto payments has become a significant challenge for law enforcement. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a decentralized way to transfer value, the public nature of blockchain ledgers also provides investigators with potential avenues for tracing funds. This duality presents both challenges and opportunities in tracking down cybercriminals. The civil forfeiture complaint alleges that the seized crypto assets represent proceeds traceable to the Qakbot malware scheme and were used to facilitate illegal activities. This legal maneuver allows the government to target assets linked to crime, even if criminal charges against an individual are pending or difficult to pursue in certain jurisdictions. How Does Law Enforcement Track and Seize Crypto in Cases of Crypto Crime? Tracking and seizing cryptocurrency used in criminal activities is a complex process that has evolved significantly. Law enforcement agencies, including the DOJ and FBI, have developed specialized units and techniques to follow the money on the blockchain. This involves: Blockchain Analytics: Using sophisticated software tools to analyze transactions on public blockchains, identifying the flow of funds from known illicit addresses to others. Exchange Cooperation: Working with cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, often requiring them to provide information about users and transactions linked to suspicious activity. International Collaboration: Partnering with law enforcement agencies in other countries to trace transactions and apprehend suspects across borders. Identifying Wallets: Linking specific cryptocurrency wallet addresses to individuals or groups through various investigative methods. While privacy-enhancing technologies exist, the transparency of many major blockchains, particularly Bitcoin’s, means that transactions leave a permanent, albeit pseudonymous, record. Investigators can often de-anonymize transactions by connecting wallet addresses to real-world identities through points of interaction like exchanges or other services subject to regulations. The Significance of This Bitcoin Seizure and Stablecoin Confiscation The scale of this specific Bitcoin seizure and stablecoin confiscation sends a clear message to cybercriminals who rely on digital assets. It demonstrates that law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly adept at following the money trail in the crypto world. Key implications include: Increased Deterrence: Actions like this can deter potential cybercriminals by showing that cryptocurrency is not an untouchable haven for illicit funds. Resource Deprivation: Seizing significant assets disrupts the financial infrastructure of criminal operations, making it harder for them to fund future activities. Potential Victim Compensation: In some forfeiture cases, seized assets can eventually be used to compensate victims of the crimes, although this is a lengthy and often complicated process. Validation of Tracing Capabilities: Successful seizures validate the effectiveness of blockchain analytics and investigative techniques employed by the DOJ and its partners. Challenges in Combating Ransomware Crypto and Associated Crime Despite successes like this DOJ crypto seizure , the fight against crypto crime and ransomware remains challenging. Some key difficulties include: Challenge Description Jurisdiction Cybercriminals often operate across international borders, making prosecution and asset recovery complex. Evolving Tactics Criminals constantly adapt their methods, using new technologies or obfuscation techniques. Anonymity Tools Use of mixers, tumblers, or privacy coins can complicate tracing efforts. Global Cooperation Requires consistent international legal frameworks and cooperation between countries. The case against Gallyamov and the forfeiture complaint highlight the need for continued investment in cybersecurity defenses and international law enforcement cooperation to effectively combat these threats. Actionable Insights for Readers While law enforcement tackles the big players, what can individuals and businesses do? Strengthen Cybersecurity: Implement robust security measures, including strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular software updates. Be Wary of Phishing: Qakbot and other malware often spread through malicious emails or links. Exercise caution with unsolicited communications. Learn more about identifying phishing attempts. Backup Data: Regularly back up important data to an external or cloud source to mitigate the impact of ransomware. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter potential malware or ransomware, report it to relevant authorities. Conclusion: The Ongoing Fight Against Crypto Crime The U.S. DOJ’s move to seize over $24 million in cryptocurrency from an alleged Qakbot malware developer underscores the commitment of law enforcement to pursue cybercriminals who leverage digital assets for illicit gain. This significant DOJ crypto seizure , involving both Bitcoin seizure and stablecoins, serves as a powerful example of how investigators are utilizing advanced techniques to follow the money on the blockchain. While challenges in combating ransomware crypto and broader crypto crime persist, actions like this demonstrate increasing capabilities in disrupting criminal operations and potentially recovering assets. As the digital landscape evolves, so too must the methods used to secure it against those who seek to exploit it for financial gain through malicious means.

2025-05-23T21:09:17.000Z,"Hedge funds are betting against Metaplanet. The GameStop 2021 short squeeze scenario is possible","On May 23, 2025, Metaplanet topped the list of Japanese stocks as the most active stock. The same day, Metaplanet became the top loser, which didn’t stop it from being the biggest stock in Japan as it still leads by a large margin. The company is allegedly on the brink of a huge short squeeze similar to the GameStop 2021 situation. How did this small hotel operator become the fastest-growing stock in Japan and an international role model Bitcoin accumulator? Table of Contents How Metaplanet chose Bitcoin Metaplanet today Short squeeze speculations and parallels with GameStop How Metaplanet chose Bitcoin While currently Metaplanet poses itself as “Japan’s first and only publicly listed Bitcoin Treasury Company,” it hasn’t always been like that. The company has a rich history predating Bitcoin’s existence, and Metaplanet’s newfound Bitcoin fame is just the latest episode of a long run. The company started in 1999. At the early stage, it had a different name and was working in various spheres. In 2010, Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, founded a hotel business with budget hotels in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan. The COVID quarantine harmed the hotel business. Around the same time, Gerovich learned about Michael Saylor’s Stratgy switch to Bitcoin. The crucial change occurred in 2024. Here’s how the company puts it on its website: “In 2024, Metaplanet’s management embarked on a strategic pivot, recognizing Bitcoin as the world’s most scarce monetary asset and transformed the company into a Bitcoin Treasury Company.” Metaplanet sold all the hotels but one. Ever since, Metaplanet has been following its new plan to aggressively stack bitcoins, which are seen as a long-term reserve asset. The company is working to accrue the wealth of Metaplanet’s shareholders and harness transparency and fairness. The company’s aim is to make its stock more profitable than Bitcoin. On top of this, Metaplanet consults other companies about Bitcoin and Web3.

I’m standing on top of the next Bitcoin Hotel in Japan. 365 days from now Metaplanet will transform this hotel, the Hotel Royal Oak, to the first Bitcoin Hotel in Tokyo. pic.twitter.com/c4btm151zM — isa⚡️ (@isabellasg3) March 27, 2025 Metaplanet today Today, Metaplanet is one of the few companies that followed the footsteps of Strategy, becoming a Bitcoin-centred company, sometimes referred to as “MicroStrategy of Asia.” As of May 23, 2025, Metaplanet holds 7,800 BTC. It may seem that it’s a humble amount if we compare it to Strategy, with its BTC stack exceeding 576,000 units. However, Strategy’s treasury is extraordinary, and Metaplanet is actually one of the leading corporate Bitcoin holders. Its Bitcoin treasury is around $800 million in value and ranks tenth globally. To emphasize the significance of Bitcoin over fiat money, the main KPI metric used by Metaplanet is BTC Yield. https://twitter.com/gerovich/status/1925879544939938113 Earlier this May, the company went through a strong short-seller pressure that didn’t stop it from gaining more value and continuing its exponential growth. It took only a year for Metaplanet to grow its stock price from around 40 JPY to 1,000 JPY. In 2025, the stock’s price gained over 420%. Metaplanet’s year-to-date 291.3% return strikingly contrasts with the nearly 5% decline of the Nikkei 225, a compound index reflecting the average value of the top 225 Japanese stocks. Short squeeze speculations and parallels with GameStop Despite aggressive Bitcoin accumulation and speedy growth, not all the stats are bullish. According to Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. While Bitcoin treasuries are somewhat trendy, and this trendiness attracts retail and institutional investors, hedge funds are betting against Metaplanet and shorting its stocks in bulk. High volatility within 12 months signals an intense battle between Metaplanet bears and bulls. High volatility and nine-digit trading volumes on the stock exchange signal a possible high-scale short squeeze of the Metaplanet stock. It loosely resembles the 2021 GameStop stock case. In 2021, hedge funds were betting against GameStop. However, the activism of hobby traders from the Reddit group who collectively started to open long positions resulted in an explosive 3,200% growth of the GME stock. Hedge funds couldn’t predict such an outcome and lost $838 million in a single day . As of May 23, 2025, it is unclear what the future holds for Metaplanet stock and if it will repeat the GameStop trajectory. If hedge funds are not right about the future of Metaplanet, they will pay a hefty price for their mistake. However, if the Bitcoin strategy fails for Metaplanet, the company may get a serious slap.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization.

Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integrations. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from investors, who view the company as a stalwart in the AI industry following the overwhelming success of its ChatGPT large language model (LLM). As of May, ChatGPT had nearly 800 million weekly active users, according to industry data. These usage trends were behind OpenAI’s massive $157 billion valuation as of October 2024 — a figure that nearly doubled to $300 billion by March 2025.ChatGPT usage trends.

With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated. The support range is a daily order block, which should provide higher time frame (HTF) support in case of a price correction. Related: Bitcoin could go much higher due to lack of FOMO and futures market euphoria — AnalystsSolana price fractal aims for $260Crypto trader Robert Mercer shared a chart identifying a price fractal pattern similar to October 2024.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy. In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025.Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum.FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingViewThe memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends.FARTCOIN’s relative strength index (RSI) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels.Dogwifhat price could doubleLike FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat (WIF) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%.But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks. As of May 22, WIF’s price was testing the pennant’s upper trendline for a breakout, with its technical target at around $2.50, up about 125% from the current price levels.  WIF/USDT daily price chart.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts. As of May 22, the memecoin had entered the breakout stage of its prevailing ascending triangle pattern, eyeing a rally toward $1.34 by June.SPX6900/USDT daily price chart.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.

Source: DeBankTrader loses out on $2.6 million gainWith ETH up over 70% since the sale, the trader lost out on over 1,000 ETH, or roughly $2.67 million, in the process of buying back in. If the trader decided to hold on to their Ether, the assets would be worth about $6.7 million. As ETH rallied, the asset surpassed the market capitalization of big companies like Coca-Cola and Alibaba. At the time of writing, company data tracker 8marketcap shows that Ether’s $321 billion market capitalization makes it the 38th most-valuable asset in the world, surpassing the pharmaceutical company AbbVie and inching closer to the Bank of America. Ether’s upswing is largely fueled by the successful launch of its Pectra upgrade.
