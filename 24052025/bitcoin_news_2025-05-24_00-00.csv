In a new filing with the state government of Massachusetts, Chase says an employee accessed its systems “without business justification” on November 5th of 2024. The worker managed to tap into and share credit card information of a customer living in the state, which was used to make fraudulent transactions. Due to various reporting requirements, it is not known whether that same employee stole data from customers in other states at time of publishing. Chase says the employee has been fired and fraudulent transactions have been reimbursed. Meanwhile, a separate new filing in Massachusetts shows TD Bank has uncovered a similar incident affecting several customers in the state. “We recently discovered that in November 2024, an employee accessed your information without a legitimate business purpose. We believe this was the cause of the fraudulent activity on your account(s).” TD Bank says the personal information that may have been exposed includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, addresses, account numbers, social security numbers and transactional data.

2025-05-23T21:30:38.000Z,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Flashes Major Strength — Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP May Be Lagging Behind","A quiet but powerful rotation is underway across the crypto landscape. While Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP have long been the heavyweights of the market, a new contender is emerging with remarkable momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Stage 8 of its presale nears completion and whale accumulation intensifies, analysts say this stealth accumulation phase could be the start of a major breakout for MAGA—one that retail investors can’t afford to overlook. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Activity and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the most-watched early-stage altcoin of 2025. With over $8 million raised, a fixed listing target of $0.007, and a scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply, MAGA’s blend of political branding and Hashex-audited contracts is fueling a surge of strategic accumulation. Whale wallets previously focused on Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP are now locking in positions ahead of listings, with some analyst models forecasting 25x–35x returns—and projections as high as 20,000% if current momentum continues. Early buyers can still claim a 50% bonus by using the promo code PATRIOT50X , making now the prime window for entry before the next wave of price discovery. As capital moves in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as the top asymmetric bet for Q3 2025. Bitcoin: Macro Anchor, But Capital Is Rotating Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market’s foundation, trading above $105,000 as institutional inflows continue to pour in. However, with whale wallets diversifying and profits being rotated into high-upside altcoins, BTC’s role is shifting from explosive growth engine to macro anchor. As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking for the next major wave of upside. This strategic shift is positioning MAGA as a leading candidate for outsized returns as the cycle progresses. Cardano and XRP: Whales Rebalance for Higher Upside Cardano (ADA) is holding around $0.85, with forecasts calling for a steady climb to $1.05 by July and $1.50 by October. While ADA developers are delivering new milestones, whale movements show a clear trend: high-net investors are reallocating into smaller, pre-exchange tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher near-term upside. XRP, trading at $2.36, is also seeing whales diversify as legal clarity and futures launches fuel renewed interest, but limited short-term catalysts are driving capital toward emerging high-ROI alternatives like MAGA. This rebalancing underscores the market’s hunger for early-stage momentum and asymmetric returns. Solana and Cosmos: Quiet Strength, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Solana (SOL) is holding strong above $170, with robust DeFi activity and developer engagement, while Cosmos (ATOM) continues to build quietly in the background. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s disciplined rollout, transparent tokenomics, and clear roadmap are making it the breakout favorite for those chasing the next big crypto move. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion The stealth accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by whales from Bitcoin, Cardano, and XRP is a signal retail investors can’t ignore. As capital shifts from large caps and recently pumped tokens, MAGA is emerging as the top asymmetric play for Q3 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , and a locked-in $0.007 listing price, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most promising early-stage opportunity of the year. If current momentum continues, MAGA could deliver exponential returns—and early movers are already making that bet.

2025-05-23T21:24:33.000Z,"Texas governor signals support for Bitcoin reserve bill","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signaled support for a bill recently passed by the state House of Representatives that would establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections. Related: Ukraine strategic Bitcoin reserve bill reportedly in final stages On May 6, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte was the first to sign a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs later approved a law allowing the state to claim ownership of unclaimed crypto. Some jurisdictions have rebuffed efforts to pass similar legislation, with roughly half of the 50 state governments considering a Bitcoin reserve. New administration working to have the US government hodl At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order (EO) in March for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” but Congress had not codified the order as of May 23. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has led efforts in the chamber to pass the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide, or BITCOIN, Act, reintroduced a few days after Trump’s EO. As of March 11, the bill has been referred to the Senate Banking Committee, and it was unclear if or when the chamber would consider a vote. The Senate will likely first move forward with debate on a bill to regulate payment stablecoins, the GENIUS Act, with some lawmakers anticipating a vote by Memorial Day, May 26.

2025-05-23T21:20:59.000Z,"Kalshi Revolutionizes Access: Seamless Crypto Deposits Now Live","BitcoinWorld Kalshi Revolutionizes Access: Seamless Crypto Deposits Now Live Are you involved in the world of cryptocurrency and looking for new ways to engage with your digital assets? Get ready for some exciting news! A significant development is unfolding in the prediction market space that directly impacts how you might use your crypto. What Exactly is Kalshi and Why Does it Matter? Before we dive into the big announcement, let’s quickly touch upon what Kalshi is. Imagine a platform where you can trade on the outcome of future events. Not stock prices or commodities, but real-world occurrences like ‘Will the US GDP grow by X% this quarter?’ or ‘Will a specific weather event happen?’. That’s the essence of Kalshi – it’s a regulated prediction market platform based in the United States. Prediction markets are fascinating because they allow people to bet (or trade) on the probability of events. The price of a contract on Kalshi reflects the market’s collective belief about the likelihood of that event occurring. They are often seen as a unique way to gauge public sentiment or even hedge against certain risks. Why does Kalshi matter? As a regulated entity, it brings a level of legitimacy and accessibility to prediction markets that wasn’t widely available before, especially in the US. It operates within a defined legal framework, making it distinct from some more decentralized or less regulated alternatives. The Big Reveal: Kalshi Adds Crypto Deposits The core news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, is that Kalshi has officially introduced support for crypto deposits . This means users now have an alternative method to fund their accounts beyond traditional methods like bank transfers or credit cards. This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a significant bridge being built between the traditional financial world, where platforms like Kalshi operate, and the rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. For years, accessing platforms like this often required navigating conventional banking rails, which can sometimes be slow or restrictive for those whose wealth is primarily in digital assets. By integrating crypto deposit functionality, Kalshi is opening its doors wider to the cryptocurrency community, acknowledging the increasing prevalence and utility of digital currencies as a form of value and payment. How Does Supporting Crypto Deposits Benefit Users? Adding the ability to deposit crypto brings several tangible benefits to users interested in participating in the Kalshi prediction market: Increased Accessibility: For individuals holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency, this provides a direct path to fund their Kalshi accounts without needing to first convert crypto to fiat currency through an exchange and then transfer it to their bank. Potential Speed: Depending on the specific cryptocurrency and network supported, crypto deposits can sometimes be faster than traditional bank transfers, especially international ones. Alternative Funding Source: It diversifies the funding options available, offering flexibility to users who may prefer using their digital assets. Lower Fees (Potentially): While network fees exist for crypto transactions, they might be more favorable than certain traditional payment processing fees, depending on the amount and method. Seamless Experience: For crypto-native users, funding directly from a wallet creates a more integrated and familiar experience. How to Deposit Crypto on Kalshi (Likely Process) While specific steps can vary slightly depending on Kalshi’s implementation, the general process to deposit crypto on a platform like this typically involves the following: Navigate to the Deposit Section: Log in to your Kalshi account and find the section dedicated to depositing funds. Select Cryptocurrency: Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit from the list of supported options (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, etc.). Kalshi will likely support major, stable cryptocurrencies first. Generate Deposit Address: The platform will generate a unique deposit address for that specific cryptocurrency and potentially specify the required network (e.g., ERC-20 for Ethereum/USDC, BTC network for Bitcoin). It is crucial to use the correct network. Send Funds from Your Wallet: Open your external cryptocurrency wallet (hardware wallet, software wallet, or exchange wallet) and initiate a transfer to the generated Kalshi deposit address. Confirm Transaction: The transaction will need to be confirmed on the blockchain. This can take varying amounts of time depending on the network congestion and the specific cryptocurrency. Funds Appear in Kalshi Account: Once confirmed, the deposited crypto amount (or its equivalent value, likely converted to USD internally by Kalshi) will appear in your Kalshi account balance, ready for trading on the prediction market . Users should always double-check the deposit address and network before sending funds, as sending crypto to the wrong address or network can result in permanent loss of funds. What Does This Mean for the Prediction Market Landscape? The integration of crypto deposits by a regulated platform like Kalshi is a significant indicator of the growing convergence between traditional finance and the crypto world. It signals that mainstream platforms are increasingly recognizing the need to accommodate users who hold digital assets. For the prediction market sector specifically, this move could attract a new demographic of users who were previously hesitant or found it inconvenient to use traditional funding methods. It could potentially increase liquidity and participation in the markets offered on Kalshi, leading to more robust price discovery on various event outcomes. This also sets a precedent. As one regulated platform successfully integrates crypto, others in similar or adjacent spaces might follow suit, further blurring the lines between centralized, regulated platforms and decentralized, crypto-native applications. Challenges and Considerations While exciting, the integration of cryptocurrency deposits isn’t without potential challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory environment for both prediction markets and cryptocurrencies is still evolving, particularly in the US. Kalshi operates under specific regulations, but the interaction with crypto could introduce new complexities. Price Volatility: If users deposit volatile cryptocurrencies, the value of their deposit in fiat terms (which is likely how account balances on Kalshi are tracked for trading) can fluctuate significantly before it’s used. Kalshi may opt to support primarily stablecoins to mitigate this. Security Risks: While Kalshi will implement security measures, the act of transferring crypto from a user’s wallet carries inherent risks related to user error (wrong address/network) or wallet security. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto deposits adds operational complexity for Kalshi, including handling various cryptocurrencies, networks, and compliance requirements related to digital assets. Despite these challenges, the benefits of tapping into the vast cryptocurrency user base seem to outweigh the hurdles for Kalshi. The Broader Trend: Crypto Meets Mainstream Finance Kalshi adding the ability to deposit crypto is part of a larger, undeniable trend. We are seeing increasing integration points between the crypto ecosystem and traditional financial services. From PayPal and Venmo adding crypto features to major banks exploring digital assets and institutions offering crypto investment products, the walls are coming down. This move by Kalshi reinforces the idea that cryptocurrency is moving beyond niche speculation and becoming a more fundamental part of the global financial infrastructure. As more platforms allow users to seamlessly deposit crypto , the utility and adoption of digital assets will likely continue to grow. Conclusion: A Seamless Future for Prediction Markets and Crypto Kalshi’s decision to support crypto deposits is a forward-thinking move that enhances accessibility and convenience for a significant segment of potential users. By building this bridge, the regulated prediction market platform is not only improving its own service but also contributing to the broader narrative of cryptocurrency integration into mainstream financial activities. For users, it means a more direct and potentially faster way to fund participation in event markets. For the industry, it’s another clear signal that digital assets are here to stay and are increasingly being recognized as legitimate forms of value by regulated entities. This seamless integration marks an exciting step for both Kalshi and the evolving relationship between prediction markets and the crypto world.

2025-05-23T21:10:01.000Z,"DOJ Crypto Seizure: US Government Files to Confiscate Astonishing $24M From Qakbot Developer","BitcoinWorld DOJ Crypto Seizure: US Government Files to Confiscate Astonishing $24M From Qakbot Developer In a significant move highlighting the ongoing battle against cybercrime and the illicit use of digital assets, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has initiated proceedings for a major DOJ crypto seizure . This action targets a Russian national accused of being a key figure behind the notorious Qakbot malware, aiming to confiscate millions in cryptocurrency. What Prompted This Significant DOJ Crypto Seizure? The U.S. DOJ filed a civil forfeiture complaint seeking to seize more than $24 million worth of cryptocurrency. The target of this action is Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, identified as a developer of the potent Qakbot malware . According to reports, Gallyamov is alleged to have played a crucial role in the operation of Qakbot, a sophisticated threat responsible for widespread global ransomware attacks and other malicious activities. This isn’t the first time Qakbot has been in the crosshairs of international law enforcement. Known for its ability to infect systems, steal financial information, and deploy ransomware, Qakbot has been a persistent and costly threat for individuals and organizations worldwide. The scale of its operation is staggering, having reportedly infected hundreds of thousands of computers globally over its lifespan. Breaking Down the Seized Assets: A Closer Look at the DOJ Crypto Seizure The assets subject to forfeiture in this DOJ crypto seizure case are substantial and diverse, reflecting the types of digital currencies often favored by cybercriminals for various reasons, including perceived anonymity and ease of transfer across borders. The seized assets include: Approximately 170 Bitcoins (BTC) Over $4 million in various stablecoins At current market prices, the value of 170 BTC alone can fluctuate significantly, but combined with the stablecoins, the total value exceeds $24 million, making it a noteworthy seizure in the context of combating crypto crime . Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, might seem counterintuitive for criminals seeking to hide funds. However, they are often used for temporary storage or transfer due to their stable value compared to volatile assets like Bitcoin, making them practical for moving large sums without price risk. The Allegations: Qakbot Malware and Ransomware Crypto Rustam Gallyamov is accused of developing and utilizing the Qakbot malware in connection with global ransomware campaigns. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom, typically demanded in cryptocurrency, is paid. Qakbot has served as a crucial tool in the ransomware ecosystem, often acting as an initial infection vector or a delivery mechanism for more potent ransomware strains. The use of ransomware crypto payments has become a significant challenge for law enforcement. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a decentralized way to transfer value, the public nature of blockchain ledgers also provides investigators with potential avenues for tracing funds. This duality presents both challenges and opportunities in tracking down cybercriminals. The civil forfeiture complaint alleges that the seized crypto assets represent proceeds traceable to the Qakbot malware scheme and were used to facilitate illegal activities. This legal maneuver allows the government to target assets linked to crime, even if criminal charges against an individual are pending or difficult to pursue in certain jurisdictions. How Does Law Enforcement Track and Seize Crypto in Cases of Crypto Crime? Tracking and seizing cryptocurrency used in criminal activities is a complex process that has evolved significantly. Law enforcement agencies, including the DOJ and FBI, have developed specialized units and techniques to follow the money on the blockchain. This involves: Blockchain Analytics: Using sophisticated software tools to analyze transactions on public blockchains, identifying the flow of funds from known illicit addresses to others. Exchange Cooperation: Working with cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers, often requiring them to provide information about users and transactions linked to suspicious activity. International Collaboration: Partnering with law enforcement agencies in other countries to trace transactions and apprehend suspects across borders. Identifying Wallets: Linking specific cryptocurrency wallet addresses to individuals or groups through various investigative methods. While privacy-enhancing technologies exist, the transparency of many major blockchains, particularly Bitcoin’s, means that transactions leave a permanent, albeit pseudonymous, record. Investigators can often de-anonymize transactions by connecting wallet addresses to real-world identities through points of interaction like exchanges or other services subject to regulations. The Significance of This Bitcoin Seizure and Stablecoin Confiscation The scale of this specific Bitcoin seizure and stablecoin confiscation sends a clear message to cybercriminals who rely on digital assets. It demonstrates that law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly adept at following the money trail in the crypto world. Key implications include: Increased Deterrence: Actions like this can deter potential cybercriminals by showing that cryptocurrency is not an untouchable haven for illicit funds. Resource Deprivation: Seizing significant assets disrupts the financial infrastructure of criminal operations, making it harder for them to fund future activities. Potential Victim Compensation: In some forfeiture cases, seized assets can eventually be used to compensate victims of the crimes, although this is a lengthy and often complicated process. Validation of Tracing Capabilities: Successful seizures validate the effectiveness of blockchain analytics and investigative techniques employed by the DOJ and its partners. Challenges in Combating Ransomware Crypto and Associated Crime Despite successes like this DOJ crypto seizure , the fight against crypto crime and ransomware remains challenging. Some key difficulties include: Challenge Description Jurisdiction Cybercriminals often operate across international borders, making prosecution and asset recovery complex. Evolving Tactics Criminals constantly adapt their methods, using new technologies or obfuscation techniques. Anonymity Tools Use of mixers, tumblers, or privacy coins can complicate tracing efforts. Global Cooperation Requires consistent international legal frameworks and cooperation between countries. The case against Gallyamov and the forfeiture complaint highlight the need for continued investment in cybersecurity defenses and international law enforcement cooperation to effectively combat these threats. Actionable Insights for Readers While law enforcement tackles the big players, what can individuals and businesses do? Strengthen Cybersecurity: Implement robust security measures, including strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular software updates. Be Wary of Phishing: Qakbot and other malware often spread through malicious emails or links. Exercise caution with unsolicited communications. Learn more about identifying phishing attempts. Backup Data: Regularly back up important data to an external or cloud source to mitigate the impact of ransomware. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter potential malware or ransomware, report it to relevant authorities. Conclusion: The Ongoing Fight Against Crypto Crime The U.S. DOJ’s move to seize over $24 million in cryptocurrency from an alleged Qakbot malware developer underscores the commitment of law enforcement to pursue cybercriminals who leverage digital assets for illicit gain. This significant DOJ crypto seizure , involving both Bitcoin seizure and stablecoins, serves as a powerful example of how investigators are utilizing advanced techniques to follow the money on the blockchain. While challenges in combating ransomware crypto and broader crypto crime persist, actions like this demonstrate increasing capabilities in disrupting criminal operations and potentially recovering assets. As the digital landscape evolves, so too must the methods used to secure it against those who seek to exploit it for financial gain through malicious means.

2025-05-23T21:09:17.000Z,"Hedge funds are betting against Metaplanet. The GameStop 2021 short squeeze scenario is possible","On May 23, 2025, Metaplanet topped the list of Japanese stocks as the most active stock. The same day, Metaplanet became the top loser, which didn’t stop it from being the biggest stock in Japan as it still leads by a large margin. The company is allegedly on the brink of a huge short squeeze similar to the GameStop 2021 situation. How did this small hotel operator become the fastest-growing stock in Japan and an international role model Bitcoin accumulator? Table of Contents How Metaplanet chose Bitcoin Metaplanet today Short squeeze speculations and parallels with GameStop How Metaplanet chose Bitcoin While currently Metaplanet poses itself as “Japan’s first and only publicly listed Bitcoin Treasury Company,” it hasn’t always been like that. The company has a rich history predating Bitcoin’s existence, and Metaplanet’s newfound Bitcoin fame is just the latest episode of a long run. The company started in 1999. At the early stage, it had a different name and was working in various spheres. In 2010, Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, founded a hotel business with budget hotels in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan. The COVID quarantine harmed the hotel business. Around the same time, Gerovich learned about Michael Saylor’s Stratgy switch to Bitcoin. The crucial change occurred in 2024. Here’s how the company puts it on its website: “In 2024, Metaplanet’s management embarked on a strategic pivot, recognizing Bitcoin as the world’s most scarce monetary asset and transformed the company into a Bitcoin Treasury Company.” Metaplanet sold all the hotels but one. Ever since, Metaplanet has been following its new plan to aggressively stack bitcoins, which are seen as a long-term reserve asset. The company is working to accrue the wealth of Metaplanet’s shareholders and harness transparency and fairness. The company’s aim is to make its stock more profitable than Bitcoin. On top of this, Metaplanet consults other companies about Bitcoin and Web3.

I’m standing on top of the next Bitcoin Hotel in Japan. 365 days from now Metaplanet will transform this hotel, the Hotel Royal Oak, to the first Bitcoin Hotel in Tokyo. pic.twitter.com/c4btm151zM — isa⚡️ (@isabellasg3) March 27, 2025 Metaplanet today Today, Metaplanet is one of the few companies that followed the footsteps of Strategy, becoming a Bitcoin-centred company, sometimes referred to as “MicroStrategy of Asia.” As of May 23, 2025, Metaplanet holds 7,800 BTC. It may seem that it’s a humble amount if we compare it to Strategy, with its BTC stack exceeding 576,000 units. However, Strategy’s treasury is extraordinary, and Metaplanet is actually one of the leading corporate Bitcoin holders. Its Bitcoin treasury is around $800 million in value and ranks tenth globally. To emphasize the significance of Bitcoin over fiat money, the main KPI metric used by Metaplanet is BTC Yield. https://twitter.com/gerovich/status/1925879544939938113 Earlier this May, the company went through a strong short-seller pressure that didn’t stop it from gaining more value and continuing its exponential growth. It took only a year for Metaplanet to grow its stock price from around 40 JPY to 1,000 JPY. In 2025, the stock’s price gained over 420%. Metaplanet’s year-to-date 291.3% return strikingly contrasts with the nearly 5% decline of the Nikkei 225, a compound index reflecting the average value of the top 225 Japanese stocks. Short squeeze speculations and parallels with GameStop Despite aggressive Bitcoin accumulation and speedy growth, not all the stats are bullish. According to Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. While Bitcoin treasuries are somewhat trendy, and this trendiness attracts retail and institutional investors, hedge funds are betting against Metaplanet and shorting its stocks in bulk. High volatility within 12 months signals an intense battle between Metaplanet bears and bulls. High volatility and nine-digit trading volumes on the stock exchange signal a possible high-scale short squeeze of the Metaplanet stock. It loosely resembles the 2021 GameStop stock case. In 2021, hedge funds were betting against GameStop. However, the activism of hobby traders from the Reddit group who collectively started to open long positions resulted in an explosive 3,200% growth of the GME stock. Hedge funds couldn’t predict such an outcome and lost $838 million in a single day . As of May 23, 2025, it is unclear what the future holds for Metaplanet stock and if it will repeat the GameStop trajectory. If hedge funds are not right about the future of Metaplanet, they will pay a hefty price for their mistake. However, if the Bitcoin strategy fails for Metaplanet, the company may get a serious slap.

2025-05-23T21:01:15.000Z,"Qakbot Malware Developer’s $24M in Crypto Seized – Is a Bigger DOJ Crackdown Coming?","Key Takeaways: The U.S. Department of Justice seized over $24 million in crypto linked to a Russian national. The suspect allegedly ran a cybercrime operation that infected computers worldwide and later facilitated ransomware attacks. The FBI, in collaboration with international partners, led the investigation and plans to return the recovered assets to the victims. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on May 23 that it has seized over $24 million in cryptocurrency from a Russian national accused of developing and operating the Qakbot malware. The unsealed federal indictment identifies Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, 48, of Moscow, as the lead developer behind Qakbot. Gallyamov now faces federal charges for allegedly leading a global cybercrime group that infected computers with malware and facilitated large-scale ransomware attacks. U.S. Charges Russian Hacker Behind Qakbot and Disrupts Its Operation According to the DOJ, Gallyamov created and controlled the malware beginning in 2008 and later used it to infect thousands of computers worldwide. These infected systems were then used to build a botnet, which became a platform for widespread ransomware attacks. https://twitter.com/USAO_LosAngeles/status/1925620287879483397 “Today’s announcement of the Justice Department’s latest actions to counter the Qakbot malware scheme sends a clear message to the cybercrime community,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. “We are determined to hold cybercriminals accountable and will use every legal tool at our disposal.” From 2019 onward, Gallyamov is accused of giving access to this botnet to other cybercriminal groups. These groups then deployed ransomware strains such as REvil, Conti, Black Basta, and Cactus. In return, Gallyamov allegedly received a share of the ransom payments. The Qakbot botnet was disrupted in August 2023 as part of a U.S.-led international operation. At the time, authorities seized over 170 Bitcoin and more than $4 million in USDT and USDC from Gallyamov. However, according to prosecutors, Gallyamov continued his cyber activities even after the takedown. Instead of relying on the botnet, Gallyamov and his associates allegedly switched to new tactics, including “spam bomb” attacks. These involved flooding victims with emails to trick employees into granting access to their systems. Prosecutors say he continued this activity as recently as January 2025. “The charges announced today exemplify the FBI’s commitment to relentlessly hold accountable individuals who target Americans and demand ransom, even when they live halfway across the world,” said Akil Davis, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. On April 25, the FBI seized another 30 Bitcoin along with more than $700,000 in USDT from Gallyamov under a court warrant. The haul—valued at over $24 million—has been folded into a civil-forfeiture case in the Central District of California, and the Justice Department says it will return the money to ransomware victims. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli emphasized the department’s goals, stating, “The forfeiture action against more than $24 million in virtual assets also demonstrates the Justice Department’s commitment to seizing ill-gotten assets from criminals in order to ultimately compensate victims.” The investigation was led by the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office in coordination with law enforcement in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK, Canada, and Europol. New DOJ Cases Indicate Broader U.S. Crackdown on Crypto-Backed Cybercrime The $24 million crypto seizure from a Qakbot-linked developer is only the latest in a sweeping U.S. crackdown on cybercrime. In December 2024, U.S. authorities charged Rostislav Panev , a dual Russian-Israeli national, for his alleged role in the notorious LockBit ransomware group. Panev, who was arrested in Israel last August, remains in custody as extradition proceedings continue. The DOJ describes him as a key developer behind malware tools used to disable antivirus software, access victim networks, and issue ransom demands. Authorities say he was behind malware that disabled antivirus software and delivered ransom notes via infected devices. Investigators also traced over $230,000 in crypto payments allegedly linked to his activity. His lawyer claims he unknowingly created software used by the group and is cooperating with law enforcement. Meanwhile, in a sweeping May 2025 indictment, U.S. officials charged 12 people , including Americans and foreign nationals mostly aged 18 to 21, for a crypto-driven racketeering scheme that netted $263 million. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1923455603902435725 Prosecutors allege the group engaged in coordinated cyberattacks, laundering stolen funds through lavish purchases like private jets, exotic cars, and luxury goods. Federal charges are also advancing against Roman Storm , the developer of the sanctioned mixing service Tornado Cash. Authorities claim the platform was instrumental in laundering billions in illicit crypto .

The letters come after the close of a month-long comment period on two regulatory initiatives launched by the agency in April. Hyperliquid Cites DeFi’s Capacity to Meet Market Demands The CFTC’s Requests for Comment (RFCs), titled “Request for Comment on the Use of Perpetual Swaps in U.S. Markets” and “Request for Comment on Round-the-Clock Derivatives Trading,” seek to explore regulatory approaches for continuous trading environments and new types of derivatives products. The comment period for both RFCs closed on May 21, 2025, following a month-long feedback window. In a public statement, Hyperliquid Labs praised the CFTC’s engagement on these issues, calling them “fundamental to the evolution of global markets.” The following post is from Hyperliquid Labs Hyperliquid Labs is committed to the advancement of defi and its promise in delivering a more open, transparent, and efficient financial system for all. As a contributor to the Hyperliquid blockchain, we believe in defi’s ability not… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) May 23, 2025 The initiatives were introduced under the leadership of Commissioner Caroline Pham, who has been vocal in encouraging dialogue between regulators and the Web3 industry. In its submissions, Hyperliquid Labs noted the role that decentralized finance can play in shaping the future of financial markets. The organization described DeFi as a powerful tool for improving transparency, efficiency, and user control in financial systems. “Hyperliquid exemplifies how core DeFi principles can be put into practice to enhance market efficiency, market integrity, and user protection,” the group wrote in a statement released on May 23. It also urged U.S. regulators to recognize the country’s opportunity to lead in financial innovation by establishing clear and supportive rules for the sector. The group further indicated how its decentralized model offers a real-world example of DeFi principles in action. Hyperliquid Labs is a contributor to the Hyperliquid blockchain protocol, which supports decentralized perpetual markets. Other Industry Submissions to CFTC’s April 2025 Consultations Several other blockchain projects and financial firms submitted responses to the CFTC by the May 21 deadline. Coinbase, Uniswap Foundation, and dYdX Trading Inc. have publicly confirmed filing their own letters. However, these documents, posted to the CFTC’s comment portal , address issues including continuous risk monitoring, decentralized governance, and regulatory parity between centralized and decentralized platforms. On April 10, 2025, the CFTC announced both RFCs simultaneously, requesting public input by May 21, 2025 . The move marked a continuation of the agency’s outreach efforts that began in March 2024, when it launched the Office of Technology Innovation (OTI) to liaise directly with blockchain developers and digital asset firms.

2025-05-23T20:42:48.000Z,"Crypto wrap: ETH, XRP drop as Bitcoin falls below $110k amid tariff jitters","The cryptocurrency market cap fell by about 4% in 24 hours on Friday to see Bitcoin (BTC) drop below $110k amid huge liquidations. Data on CoinMarketCap showed the global crypto market cap was down to $3.55 trillion, with Bitcoin’s market cap at $2.16 trillion Coinglass indicated volatility had over $566 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. The metric was up by 73%. Despite this, Bitcoin’s fear & index measure remained at 78, signalling extreme greed. Bitcoin retreats from all-time high amid tariff-driven sell-off While Bitcoin price remained above $108k, bears had earlier in the day pushed it as low as $107.6k, threatening to scuttle bulls’ plans amid fresh tariff jitters. BTC fell more than 3% as the stock market also reacted negatively to President Donald Trump’s new tariff threats. Bitcoin price chart by CoinMarketCap Jim Cramer’s view as risk assets plunged was that many people are likely seeing a bottom. However, he said this might not be the case and that “it is too early to do so.” Bitcoin’s robust support The all-time high for Bitcoin above $111k had bulls yearning for more. However, bears might have other ideas short term. If this happens, a return to $100k could open up a fresh leg down. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin has a robust support zone around $94k. “More than 420k $BTC now have a cost basis around the $94K level, forming one of the strongest support zones in the current cycle. This dense cluster of accumulation has held firm through consolidation in early May – providing the launchpad for #Bitcoin’s breakout to new highs,” the platform shared on X. Peter Schiff on Trump’s tariff threats Although Trump explained on Truth Social why he recommended a 50% tariff on the European Union and 25% on Apple for iPhone made outside the U.S., crypto skeptic Peter Schiff commented via X that the tariff threat is anything but “market manipulation.” “Trump just threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe, much higher than what Americans pay to import goods from China. The skeptic in me thinks this is just market manipulation, giving insiders opportunities to trade before the tariffs are called off with a fake win,” Schiff wrote. ETH and XRP drop 3% each, top memecoins gain As the flagship cryptocurrency dipped, top altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) snapped their slight gains. ETH and XRP both dropped 3% in 24 hours to trade around $2.5k and $2.36 respectively. BNB price ws down 2.7% to around $664, Solana was up 0.61% to $179, and Dogecoin down 2.8% to $0.23. The market also saw the prices of Sui (SUI) dip amid the impact of Thursday’s $223 million hack of the DEX and liquidity protocol Cetus. Meanwhile, despite Trump’s dinner with top holders of Official Trump (TRUMP), the memecoin still plunged more than 15% to trade around $13.21. Most other altcoins, including Lido DAO, The Graph and Stacks were down. But while these top coins dropped, there were a few top performers on the day. These included Hyperliquid (HYPE ), Worldcoin (WLD) and several memecoins. However, the gains were minute compared to bull market rallies. Pepe, Bonk and dogwifhat all rose between 4% and 6%.

2025-05-23T20:40:09.000Z,"AI Ethics Confronted: Experts Tackle Generative AI’s Dangerous Line at Bitcoin World AI","BitcoinWorld AI Ethics Confronted: Experts Tackle Generative AI’s Dangerous Line at Bitcoin World AI In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, the conversation around AI ethics has moved from theoretical debates to urgent practical concerns. As generative AI tools become incredibly sophisticated and accessible, the potential for misuse, deception, and unforeseen consequences grows exponentially. For those invested in the trust and security inherent in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, understanding these ethical frontiers is crucial. This pressing issue takes center stage at the upcoming Bitcoin World Sessions: AI event. AI Ethics: Unpacking the Crisis The core challenge in AI ethics today lies in the speed and power of development outpacing our ability to govern it responsibly. The tools for creating hyper-realistic synthetic media, manipulating information, and automating decisions with potential biases are now widely available. This raises fundamental questions: How do we ensure powerful AI systems are also safe? Who is responsible when AI causes harm? And what mechanisms can we put in place to maintain control? Generative AI: The Double-Edged Sword Generative AI , capable of creating text, images, audio, and video that are virtually indistinguishable from human-created content, represents a significant leap forward. While offering immense creative and productivity potential, it also presents serious risks. The ease with which convincing deepfakes can be produced, for instance, poses threats to individual reputation, political processes, and public trust in media. The discussion at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI will delve into these dual aspects, exploring both the promise and the peril. Tackling AI Safety: Expert Perspectives Addressing the critical need for AI safety requires insights from those on the front lines of both research and application. The session features two leading voices: Artemis Seaford, Head of AI Safety at ElevenLabs, and Ion Stoica, co-founder of Databricks and a professor at UC Berkeley. Artemis brings deep experience from her work at ElevenLabs, OpenAI, and Meta, focusing specifically on media authenticity and preventing abuse. Her perspective is grounded in real-world challenges posed by evolving deepfake technology. Ion, with his background building foundational AI infrastructure like Spark and Ray, offers a systems-level view on how safety can be architected into the very core of AI platforms. Together, they offer a comprehensive look at the technical and societal challenges of building safe, trustworthy AI. Deepfakes: The Evolving Threat One of the most visible manifestations of the ethical crisis in AI is the rise of deepfakes . These AI-generated synthetic media are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it harder to distinguish real from fake. The session will provide a clear-eyed assessment of how deepfake technology is advancing, the new risks emerging from its proliferation, and which countermeasures are proving effective. Understanding this specific threat is vital for navigating the information landscape shaped by advanced AI. Join the Discussion at Bitcoin World AI The conversation with Artemis Seaford and Ion Stoica is just one highlight of the day-long Bitcoin World Sessions: AI event on June 5 at UC Berkeley. This event offers a unique opportunity to engage with a diverse group of experts from companies like OpenAI, Google Cloud, Anthropic, and Cohere.

2025-05-23T20:39:38.000Z,"What Are America’s Ultra-Rich Doing with Bitcoin: An Executive Managing $200 Billion Speaks Out, Secrets Revealed","Bitcoin breaking a record by exceeding the $111,000 level yesterday had a great impact on the cryptocurrency market. While this rise was supported by increasing optimism about regulations in the US, it was also a matter of curiosity how high-income investors positioned this asset in their portfolios. According to Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of TIGER 21, ultra-rich investors are considering cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, as a long-term store of value, with some even preferring it to gold. “For some of our members, Bitcoin is neck and neck with gold. It stands out as a store of value like gold, but it is more attractive because it is digital,” Sonnenfeldt said. TIGER 21’s 1,600 members manage a combined total of nearly $200 billion in wealth. Members’ portfolio allocations average 28% private equity, 28% real estate, and 24% public stocks. Cryptocurrency investments currently range from 1% to 3% of total assets. However, Sonnenfeldt noted that some members are allocating a significant portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Related News: Analysis Firm Warns: “Something Unusual Is Going On With This Altcoin's Data” Noting that Bitcoin has shown the highest performance among all asset classes in recent years, Sonnenfeldt said, “This is a development that increases institutional interest not only with price movements, but also with Coinbase's inclusion in major indices.” While interest in Bitcoin is increasing among TIGER 21 members, investors' attitudes towards volatility are also drawing attention. According to Sonnenfeldt, while there is concern among those who buy and sell in the short term, long-term investors see every decline as a buying opportunity. “This is already the dynamic that creates the market. While investors with a fundamental belief see declines as opportunities, those who are momentum-oriented can be more cautious,” he said. While traditional investment instruments are weakening, investments in hedge funds in particular have fallen to 1%. On the other hand, Bitcoin's digital nature and decentralized structure attract investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-23T20:30:34.000Z,"Dogecoin Price Breaks Out Of Bearish Trendline And Enters Ascending Channel Headed For $0.3","Dogecoin’s recent price action has taken a noticeably bullish turn, with the meme coin bouncing off support at the beginning of the week and steadily building upward momentum. Over the past few days, Dogecoin has been on the path to reclaiming the $0.25 level after rebounding from a low near $0.215. This upward move coincides with Bitcoin’s surge to new all-time highs, which has helped to inject new confidence across the broader crypto market. Notably, technical analysis of the Dogecoin/TetherUS pair on the daily candlestick timeframe shows that the meme coin’s price has now flipped into an ascending channel headed for at least $0.3. Dogecoin Confirms Bullish Breakout As Trendline Crumbles According to a technical analysis posted on the TradingView platform by crypto analyst Melika, Dogecoin has bounced on through a long-standing bearish trendline that had acted as a major resistance in April. This breakout is a by a clear validation of an ascending channel that has formed since late April. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falling Wedge Breakout Puts Bulls In Charge, Target Moves Up To $0.62 The breakout indicates a full transition from bearish pressure into a bullish environment, with the price structure now leaning heavily in favor of the bulls. In this case, Dogecoin is now on the path to continue its uptrend from its $0.13 bottom on April 7, and the next target is to reach the top of the ascending channel. A critical aspect of this breakout is the reaction from the midline of the channel, which Dogecoin respected with precision before climbing again. The coin also retested the demand block between $0.1950 and $0.2150 earlier in the week. The failure to break below shows that this region has now turned into a strong structural support moving forward. As long as the price remains above this level, Dogecoin’s potential of reaching the top of the ascending channel is valid. What Targets Lie Ahead For Dogecoin? With momentum now on the side of the bulls, Melika’s analysis projects three critical levels that could serve as short profit zones for Dogecoin traders. The first target is $0.2530, which aligns with the swing high on May 11. If Dogecoin bulls maintain the price uptrend, the second target of $0.2750 could come into play. Interestingly, this target is located at the upper boundary of the ascending channel. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gearing Up For Major Explosive Rally – Why $1 Is Still In The Cards Beyond that lies the major horizontal resistance at $0.3035. This level is significant because it acted as a support level for Dogecoin in January. However, Dogecoin eventually went on a clean breakthrough below $0.3035 in early February, which has flipped into a zone to look out for resistance. Breaking through this area would not only signal a full recovery from the recent downtrend but also open the door to higher price levels. However, any rejection or breakdown below $0.1950 would invalidate this bullish thesis, as it would indicate a breach of both the demand zone and the channel structure. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.2447, up by 2% in the past 24 hours.

2025-05-23T20:20:51.000Z,"Analyst Predicts XRP Could Hit $11 This Cycle","XRP may still have substantial upside potential before the current crypto bull market concludes, according to market analyst Tim Warren. Speaking on a recent episode of the Paul Barron Network podcast , Warren shared an optimistic outlook on XRP’s price trajectory, predicting a significant price jump despite the token’s recent sideways performance. During the discussion, Paul Barron, the host of the show, focused on the broader altcoin market’s response to Bitcoin’s continued surge past $111,000. As attention turned to XRP in the latter part of the conversation, Barron asked whether Warren was trading the token actively or taking a long-term position. Warren confirmed that he is holding his XRP assets and emphasized his continued confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. XRP Could Increase Fivefold, Says Warren Warren noted that although XRP has been consolidating for several months, technical signals suggest a possible breakout is approaching . He pointed to a bullish chart pattern forming on the daily timeframe and said that XRP had briefly surpassed a previous resistance level around $2.55 before retracing. Despite this pullback, Warren believes the overall trend remains positive. He projected that XRP could dip to approximately $2.20 in the near term, but once it establishes stronger momentum, the token could rally past resistance levels and reach a minimum of $5. His long-term target is a price range between $11 and $12, which he believes could be achieved before the ongoing bull run concludes. While smaller altcoins may offer greater short-term returns, Warren emphasized that a four to five times increase from current levels would still represent a strong performance. He also noted that XRP has already gained over 380% since November 2024, further supporting his bullish case. Ripple’s Reported Interest in Acquiring Circle Raises Questions Earlier in the conversation, Barron addressed reports suggesting that Ripple may be exploring a possible acquisition of Circle , the company behind the USDC stablecoin. He cited commentary from Gabriel Shapiro of MetaLeX Labs, who raised concerns about the impact such a deal could have on the broader crypto ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The potential acquisition, rumored to be valued at around $11 billion, could position Ripple as a leading asset issuer across multiple blockchains. Critics, particularly from the Bitcoin community, have expressed apprehension about the implications for competition and regulatory scrutiny. Barron questioned whether the acquisition could positively influence XRP’s market performance or, conversely, lead to selling pressure if Ripple were to liquidate some of its XRP holdings to fund the deal. Warren responded by acknowledging that the financing structure of such an acquisition remains unclear. He agreed that if Ripple were to sell XRP, it could temporarily affect the token’s price. However, he dismissed the idea that Ripple would deliberately offload large amounts of XRP onto the market, a theory he previously entertained but now views as outdated. Having engaged with experienced professionals in the industry, Warren stated that Ripple benefits more from XRP performing well. In his view, even if some market participants interpret the acquisition as a risk, he personally believes it could ultimately support XRP’s long-term value.

2025-05-23T20:20:14.000Z,"Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Bitwise Predicts Massive $427 Billion Holdings by 2026","BitcoinWorld Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Bitwise Predicts Massive $427 Billion Holdings by 2026 Are we on the cusp of a significant shift in global finance? A recent prediction from Bitwise and UTXO Management suggests that the landscape of Bitcoin ownership is set for a dramatic transformation. They forecast a massive surge in institutional Bitcoin adoption and nation-state Bitcoin holdings , reaching a staggering 4.27 million BTC by the end of 2026. This isn’t just a number; it represents hundreds of billions of dollars potentially flowing into the world’s premier cryptocurrency, signaling a new era for digital assets. Understanding the Bitwise Prediction 2026 The core of this exciting forecast comes from analysis by Bitwise Asset Management, a well-respected name in the crypto investment space, and UTXO Management, known for its data-driven insights. As reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, their combined research points to a significant accumulation trend among some of the world’s most powerful entities: nation-states and large institutions. Specifically, the Bitwise prediction highlights that by the close of 2026, these major players are expected to collectively hold 4.27 million Bitcoin. At current market valuations (which are, of course, subject to change), this amount of BTC would be worth approximately $426.9 billion. This figure is not only substantial on its own but also represents a significant portion of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, suggesting a profound impact on market dynamics and stability. This prediction isn’t pulled out of thin air. It’s likely based on observing current trends, analyzing potential future regulatory environments, understanding macroeconomic factors driving the need for alternative assets, and assessing the growing infrastructure facilitating large-scale bitcoin investment . Why the Surge in Nation-State Bitcoin Holdings? The idea of nations holding Bitcoin might seem revolutionary, but it’s a trend that has already begun. El Salvador famously became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender and actively accumulate it as a reserve asset. Other nations have shown interest, often driven by unique economic or geopolitical circumstances. Several factors could motivate nation-state Bitcoin holdings : Reserve Asset Diversification: Historically, nations hold reserves in gold and foreign currencies like the US dollar. Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative, not controlled by any single government, potentially acting as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. Economic Sovereignty: For smaller nations, holding Bitcoin could reduce reliance on traditional financial systems and reserve currencies, offering greater economic independence. Attracting Innovation: Adopting or holding Bitcoin can signal a nation’s openness to financial technology and innovation, potentially attracting investment and talent. Hedge Against Currency Devaluation: Countries facing high inflation or currency instability might see Bitcoin as a more stable store of value compared to their own fiat currency. While the path for nation-states to accumulate significant amounts of Bitcoin is complex, involving political decisions, regulatory frameworks, and secure storage solutions, the prediction suggests that more countries will explore or expand their strategic reserves in digital assets over the next few years. The Growing Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Perhaps the most visible driver of recent Bitcoin price movements and market structure has been the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption . From asset managers launching Bitcoin ETFs to corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, institutions are finding more accessible and regulated ways to gain exposure to the asset. What’s fueling this institutional appetite? Let’s look at the key drivers: Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for many traditional financial institutions and their clients. These products provide regulated, familiar investment vehicles. Search for Yield and Diversification: In a low-interest-rate environment (historically) and with traditional asset classes facing uncertainty, institutions are seeking alternative investments that offer potential for high returns and portfolio diversification. Bitcoin, with its low correlation to traditional assets over the long term, fits this criteria for many. Macroeconomic Hedging: Concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies have made Bitcoin’s characteristics as a scarce, decentralized asset increasingly attractive as a potential hedge. Client Demand: Wealth managers and financial advisors are seeing increased demand from their clients – including high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and even smaller institutions – for exposure to digital assets. Corporate Treasury Management: Following the lead of companies like MicroStrategy, more corporations are exploring holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term store of value, rather than keeping excess cash in traditional low-yield instruments. The Bitwise prediction for 2026 underscores the belief that these trends are not temporary fads but represent a fundamental shift in how large pools of capital view and allocate to Bitcoin. The infrastructure is maturing, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer in some regions, and the perceived risks are diminishing relative to the potential rewards for many sophisticated investors. Breaking Down the Numbers: 4.27 Million BTC by 2026 Let’s put the 4.27 million BTC figure into perspective. While precise, real-time data on current institutional and nation-state holdings is difficult to pin down definitively, estimates vary. However, this prediction suggests a substantial increase from today’s levels. Consider that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. 4.27 million BTC represents over 20% of the total potential supply. If achieved, this level of accumulation by nation-states and institutions would make them a dominant force in the Bitcoin market, potentially influencing liquidity, price discovery, and overall market stability. The sheer volume predicted for 2026 highlights the scale of capital that could transition into Bitcoin. A value of nearly $427 billion (at the assumed price point) is comparable to the market capitalization of some of the world’s largest companies or the GDP of medium-sized countries. This level of bitcoin investment signifies a deep integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric. What Does This Prediction Mean for Your Bitcoin Investment? While the Bitwise prediction 2026 focuses on large entities, its implications ripple down to individual investors. Increased institutional Bitcoin adoption and growing nation-state Bitcoin holdings could have several potential effects: Increased Demand: More buyers with significant capital entering the market could drive up demand and potentially the price of Bitcoin, assuming supply remains constrained. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Large, long-term holders like institutions and nations might be less likely to trade frequently based on short-term price swings, potentially leading to reduced volatility compared to periods dominated by retail speculation. Further Validation: The embrace of Bitcoin by traditional financial powerhouses and sovereign entities lends significant credibility to the asset class, potentially encouraging more widespread acceptance and use. Infrastructure Development: The needs of large institutions often spur the development of more robust, secure, and regulated infrastructure for custody, trading, and management of Bitcoin. It’s important to remember that predictions are not guarantees. The path to 2026 will likely involve regulatory hurdles, market corrections, and evolving geopolitical landscapes. However, the Bitwise prediction provides a compelling outlook on the potential trajectory of large-scale Bitcoin adoption. Challenges and Considerations on the Path to 2026 While the forecast is bullish for institutional Bitcoin adoption and nation-state Bitcoin holdings , the journey is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented globally. Shifting regulations could impact the speed and scale of adoption. Security and Custody: Securing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin requires highly sophisticated and trusted custody solutions, which are still evolving. Public and Political Opposition: In some countries, there may be political or public resistance to allocating national reserves or public funds to a volatile and relatively new asset class like Bitcoin. Market Volatility: While institutional involvement might eventually reduce volatility, Bitcoin is still subject to significant price swings, which can be a deterrent for risk-averse entities. Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for the Bitwise prediction 2026 to materialize fully. The development of robust, regulated, and secure solutions for large-scale bitcoin investment is paramount. Conclusion: A Transformative Prediction for Bitcoin’s Future The prediction from Bitwise and UTXO Management that nation-states and institutions will hold 4.27 million BTC by the end of 2026 is a powerful statement about the evolving role of Bitcoin in the global financial system. It highlights the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption and the potential for significant nation-state Bitcoin holdings to emerge as a major market force. This forecast, representing potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in bitcoin investment , underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, a potential store of value, and a strategic holding for large entities. While challenges remain, the trajectory points towards a future where Bitcoin is increasingly integrated into the portfolios of the world’s most influential financial players and even sovereign nations. The Bitwise prediction for 2026 serves as a compelling indicator of the potential scale of capital inflow and structural shifts that could define the Bitcoin market in the coming years, reinforcing its position on the global financial stage.

2025-05-23T20:16:51.000Z,"Genius Group Resumes Bitcoin Purchases After U.S. Court Lifts Ban","Genius Group, a technology and education company, has started buying Bitcoin (BTC) again. This comes after a U.S. court removed a legal order that had stopped the company from adding more Bitcoin to its treasury. With this decision, the company continues its plan to grow its Bitcoin holdings. Court Ruling Allows Genius To Restart Bitcoin Strategy On May 22, Genius Group confirmed it had bought 24.5 more Bitcoin units, pushing its total holdings to 85.5 BTC. This new purchase followed a key decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court paused a previous order that had stopped the company from using investor funds to buy Bitcoin. In April, a legal order forced Genius Group to pause its Bitcoin strategy and sell off most of its earlier holdings. The company is back on track and has already increased its Bitcoin stash by 40% since the court’s decision. The latest Bitcoin purchase cost an average of $99,700 per coin. Altogether, Genius Group has now spent around $8.5 million on Bitcoin. While the restrictions were in place, Genius Group filed an updated lawsuit under the RICO Act in the Southern District of Florida. This aims to recover losses from “third-party actions” that hurt the company and forced it to sell its Bitcoin. Genius Group To Launch Bitcoin Academy Genius Group is also focused on education—the firm plans to launch a Bitcoin Academy at the end of May. The academy will include guest speakers like Saifedean Ammous, who wrote The Bitcoin Standard. This new program is part of the company’s larger mission to teach the “ABCs of the Future”. This stands for Artificial Intelligence, Bitcoin, and Community. Genius Group wants to prepare students for the new digital economy. Genius Group operates in over 100 countries and serves over 5.8 million users. Its stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GNS. The stock is now $0.34, down over 8% and less than half its price at the start of the year. Still, the company sees Bitcoin as a way to boost its finances. Genius Group Follows A Broader Industry Trend This Bitcoin strategy is not isolated. Genius Group is joining the bandwagon of firms choosing Bitcoin as a long-term financial strategy. Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, currently holds the largest Bitcoin stash. The Nasdaq-listed firm recently bought another BTC for $1.34 billion and is looking to buy more soon. Others are following too. A catering company in Bahrain recently announced a Bitcoin strategy. Similarly, Hong Kong luxury watchmaker renamed itself AsiaStrategy, and Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp has adopted a Bitcoin-first approach .

In a new note to investors, M&S says that the company believes the cyberattack will reduce profits in the fiscal years 2025-2026 operating budget by $403 million, “before cost mitigation, insurance and trading actions.” Says M&S CEO Stuart Machin, “Over the last few weeks, we have been managing a highly sophisticated and targeted cyber-attack, which has led to a limited period of disruption. We have tackled this head on with incredible spirit, teamwork and deep sense of responsibility as we prioritized serving our customers… As a team, we have worked around the clock with suppliers and partners to contain the incident and stabilize operations, taking proactive measures to minimize the disruption for customers.” Machin also says sales disruptions due to the cyberattack, which the company announced on April 22nd, may continue for the next two months. “In Fashion, Home and Beauty, online sales and trading profit have been heavily impacted by the necessary decision to pause online shopping, however stores have remained resilient. We expect online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations.” The M&S cyberattack allowed the cybercriminals to obtain sensitive personal information from the retailer’s customers, including contact details, date of birth and online order history. The incident appears to be connected with a broader operation by a hacking group known as “DragonForce,” which has also claimed responsibility for a breach of the Co-op Food grocery chain, also in the UK.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin ( BTC ) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar. Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising. This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world. A lesson from hyperinflation Before Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said. He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said. Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo. Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructure Banco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily. SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services. Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik. Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claims America’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell. In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%. Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin Campbell Strategy continues to stack sats With Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million. The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion. The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

The ongoing cooling down of the leveraged crypto trading has set a precedent for a fresh rally beyond $111.9k. The rising conflict between the United States and the European Union has weighed down on a weakening greenback against major global currencies. The cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin (BTC), has emerged as a better alternative for investors seeking to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Since the Doland Trump administration took office earlier in 2025, three states – including New Hampshire , Arizona , and Texas – have approved the strategic Bitcoin reserve bills in both the senate and House. In the past six days, Bitcoin’s investment products recorded a net cash inflow of about $2.3 billion, according to market data from CoinShares . With the CME futures and options markets leaning towards bullish sentiment, BTC price will soon enter the euphoric phase of the 2025 crypto bull run. Bitcoin Price Expectations in the Midterm In the 1-hour timeframe, BTC price has been rising in a parallel channel since a local low of about $74.8k earlier in April. Earlier this week, BTC price was rejected at the upper border of the rising channel and is now signaling a drop towards the lower border. Moreover, the 1-Hour MACD line has already dropped below the zero line and the histograms have been growing in a bearish fashion in the past two days. In the daily timeframe, BTC price has been following an almost similar fractal pattern to the Q4 2024 bullish breakout. If BTC price consistently closes above the upper border of the established rising channel in the coming days, a potential rally towards $140k will be inevitable. However, a consistent close below the lower border of the rising channel will trigger a rejuvenated bearish pressure potentially towards $74k again.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-analysis-constructive-market-structure-signals-parabolic-rally-ahead/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi tells his 863,800 followers on the social media platform X that the second-largest digital asset by volume appears on its way to a $3,300 price tag, though no specific time frame was given. “ETH. Getting closer for its move towards 28xx, flip that opens a potentially big move into $3,300. But first, let’s get there.” Source: Pentoshi/X Earlier this week, the trader predicted that the top altcoin would hit a price tag of $2,800 during its surge, noting that dips during this period would be optimal for buying. “I wouldn’t sleep on ETH here either. It has had a nice reclaim at a key high-time frame (HTF) level as well as 200-day moving average. Price has been brought back up now, but still four hours out from the close yet. $2,800 is [in my opinion] highly likely in the short term. Dips [are] likely for buying for now.” Source: Pentoshi/X Ethereum has yet to reach Pentoshi’s prediction of $2,800 this cycle, though it got close and peaked around $2,700.

Customers can add funds to their Solana accounts in this way. This follows the addition of support for Bitcoin deposits. Kalshi and Zero Hash have decided to collaborate in order to make the Solana deposits possible. In addition to managing the transaction process and changing the contributions into US dollars, the company is also in charge of guaranteeing security and regulatory compliance. 🚨JUST IN: U.S.-based prediction market @Kalshi has enabled SOL deposits, allowing users to fund their accounts with Solana for the first time. pic.twitter.com/VJfN7JbVDg — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 23, 2025 This move to allow SOL deposits is designed to boost activity on the platform, which has been proven to have many crypto users. It is also meant to increase trading volume on crypto-related event contracts. Kalshi strategic partnerships for expansion The exchange and prediction market, which is regulated by the CFTC and lets investors trade on how real-life events will turn out, originally only accepted USD Coin (USDC) as a form of crypto deposit. Kalshi Circle’s USDC for bets received up to $25M in deposits during the US election season. In early 2025, Kalshi achieved monthly volumes of around $13M, with a peak of $26M in October 2024. In early April, it added Bitcoin payments made through the Bitcoin network to the list of crypto deposits it accepts. Kalshi has over 50 crypto-specific markets where users can trade contracts based on Bitcoin price thresholds, legislative events, and adoption milestones. For instance, markets for betting on coins’ 2025 highs and lows, as well as on headlines such as US President Donald Trump’s proposed National Bitcoin Reserve. The platform has over 300 markets in 12 main categories. Several strategic relationships have led to the new integration. Kalshi and World App just released a mini app that lets users access regulated prediction markets from the World App interface. Users can also use Worldcoin (WLD) to pay their Kalshi account. This week, Kalshi announced its integration with Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI to offer AI-generated information for betting on events that happen in the real world. Although it was called off , this still shows that the company has plans to expand. Kalshi’s competes with Polymarket Prediction markets, in particular, are starting to disrupt the sector. They’re growing fast in the US, and they’re not regulated the same way as traditional sports betting or online gambling. With both Kalshi and Polymarket, they are currently legal in all 50 states. Polymarket has been doing quite well because it doesn’t charge any fees to trade. Therefore, users can easily buy and sell shares, like betting on and against outcomes. If a user wants to cash out USDC, it costs 1.5%. However, the network fees are very low because it’s based on Polygon. Polymarket announced on March 25 that users can deposit SOL into their wallets. This to some extent has influenced Kalshi, its biggest competitor. In a now-deleted podcast segment, Kalshi CEO admits enlisting influencers to dis Polymarket. On the other hand, Kalshi charges 2% for each account withdrawal. They also charge a 1% trading fee that can’t be more than 10% of net profits and a 10% settlement fee on net wins. The fees differ for each payment method when you deposit or take money. In addition, Polymarket works in a bit of a legal gray area. Its website doesn’t list any official rules. This has made it blocked in several countries. There are some risks when it comes to clear laws and market trickery. For instance, it was accused of fraud after a $7 million market was allegedly manipulated by UMA whales. However, many users are interested in trends like Polymarket’s decentralized, blockchain-based website. This is what Kalshi has become interested in. With Kalshi, users can also use regular money, and the CFTC fully regulates it. This makes it easy to use, especially for more traditional people.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum eyes a breakout past $3,000, Shiba Inu gains 20% in a month, and AI-powered Unilabs draws whale interest. Table of Contents Unilabs: A new DeFi crypto to buy this cycle Ethereum: Primed for a breakout? Shiba Inu: 20% gain in the past month Unilabs: Why Ethereum and Shiba Inu whales are showing interest While it has been an exciting week for Bitcoin after registering a new high, the same can’t be said for altcoins. The Ethereum price has been underwhelming despite BTC crossing $111,000, but a bounce might be close. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu coin whales have been doubling down on Unilabs (UNIL) , a new ICO. This new player stands out for its deep AI integration and blend of TradFi and DeFi. Its unique value proposition revolves around identifying high-potential digital assets early through artificial intelligence, thereby assisting retail traders to maximize gains — an AI-backed DeFi asset manager. With the UNIL token in presale, it is on experts’ lists of the best AI coins to buy now. You might also like: Bitcoin’s pullback from $111K wiped out $560M in crypto liquidation wave Unilabs: A new DeFi crypto to buy this cycle Unilabs , an emerging AI-DeFi coin, stands out in the ICO scene for its novelty. Early funding surpassing $810,000 highlights its upside potential and, most importantly, real-world applications. With over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) as of the second quarter of 2025, the increasing demand and interest in this AI-driven DeFi asset manager is understandable. The goal of the platform is to democratize access to alpha by equipping retail investors with AI-enhanced portfolios and transparent performance metrics for better investment decisions. Key features include a mining pool, flash loan accelerator, stablecoin savings account, self-custodial asset value and cross-chain trading hub. Unlike conventional protocols, the UNIL protocol will operate a state-of-the-art mining pool with cutting-edge hardware. Further, its DEX aggregator will be compatible with multiple blockchains. Equally important, users will have full ownership and protection over their digital assets, self-custodial storage solutions. Ethereum: Primed for a breakout? Despite recording a 65% monthly gain, the Ethereum price has been underwhelming these past few days, especially with BTC reaching a new peak. It consolidated around $2,600, down from its 30-day high of $2,736. Nevertheless, the moving averages flash “strong buy.” The 9-HMA and 20-VWMA suggest now might be a great time to stack up. Reclaiming its monthly peak might ignite a rally toward $3,000, making the current Ethereum price a good entry. In addition, experts believe the Layer-1 altcoin is among this cycle’s best DeFi tokens to buy, especially with the ETH ETFs. Washigorira, a leading expert on Crypto Twitter, expects the Ethereum price to range between $3,000 and $3,500 in the coming weeks. VECTORCP, another crypto expert, echoes this bullish Ethereum price prediction — a run toward $3,200 and $3,800. Shiba Inu: 20% gain in the past month Like the rest of the crypto market, the Shiba Inu coin performed well this month — a 20% upswing in the past 30 days. The bulls maintain the $0.000015 price level, with a breakout expected to ignite a run toward $0.00002. BezosCrypto, with an optimistic outlook, targets $0.00017 this cycle, a bold Shiba Inu price prediction. LordOfAlts, also optimistic, believes the Shiba Inu coin rally is just starting, identifying the growing adoption of Shibarium as a bullish catalyst. At the same time, the Awesome Oscillator, Momentum (10) and 9-HMA suggest a big leap in the Shiba Inu coin price. However, given its strong memetic appeal and growing shift towards AI, Unilabs might be a more promising alternative this year. Unilabs: Why Ethereum and Shiba Inu whales are showing interest The UNIL presale races toward $1 million in funding, propelled by growing whale interest. Its higher upside potential as a low-cap coin makes it a more compelling alternative than the Shiba Inu coin. In addition, traders don’t need to break the bank before positioning for gains, unlike the high Ethereum price. To learn more about Unilabs, visit the official website , and Telegram .

2025-05-23T19:39:35.000Z,"Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Draws Billionaires, Basketball Stars, and Fierce Criticism","A high-dollar gathering at President Donald Trump’s Virginia golf club has ignited a storm of ethical debates, blending crypto spectacle with accusations of constitutional overreach. The Thursday dinner, reserved for the top 220 holders of the head of state’s TRUMP meme coin, attracted billionaires, celebrities, and a cascade of legal threats, with critics calling it a gateway for foreign influence peddling. The Price of Proximity Entry to the event required holding TRUMP tokens, and reports indicate that attendees collectively spent as much as $394 million on the meme coin to sit at the president’s table. The gathering included crypto elites such as Tron founder Justin Sun, who is also an investor in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial project. The businessman, who topped a publicly posted leaderboard with a $18.5 million stash, flaunted clips of himself at the event, even claiming he had received a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch from the president. This raised eyebrows, given that the SEC is investigating him over allegations of fraud, although the matter was paused abruptly in February. While former NBA star Lamar Odom made no secret of his presence at the Trump National Golf Club, most attendees remained anonymous, using nicknames on the leaderboard. Protestors reportedly lined up at the venue’s entrance, waving signs that read “Crypto corruption” and “America is not for sale.” Blockchain data shared by Bloomberg shows that more than half of the guests likely live outside the United States, with many buying their tokens from offshore crypto exchanges that claim to exclude American users. This detail alone raised concerns that foreign actors could exploit crypto to circumvent U.S. campaign finance laws. In response, 35 members of Congress have signed a letter calling for an investigation by the Department of Justice, citing possible violations of the emoluments clause in the Constitution. Meanwhile, Representative Maxine Waters has rolled out the “Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act,” which aims to bar officials from profiting from digital assets. Massachusetts senator and renowned crypto critic Elizabeth Warren didn’t mince words either, calling the dinner an “orgy of corruption” at a Thursday press conference . Fellow lawmaker Richard Blumenthal claimed it put a “for sale” sign on the White House. Both called for transparency on who attended the event and how access was monetized through the TRUMP token’s structure, with on-chain records indicating that the top 25 investors alone bought at least $111 million worth of the meme cryptocurrency. Trump Unfazed Despite claims from the White House that Trump attended in a personal capacity, reports indicate that the president delivered brief remarks behind a lectern bearing the seal of his office. He is said to have made no new crypto policy announcements, instead reiterating support for a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve , before promptly jumping on his helicopter and flying out of the venue. The ensuing criticism doesn’t seem to have bothered the commander-in-chief, with the politician posting on his official Truth Social account, “The U.S.A. is DOMINATING in Crypto, Bitcoin, etc., and we are going to keep it that way!” The post Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner Draws Billionaires, Basketball Stars, and Fierce Criticism appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/trumps-meme-coin-dinner-draws-billionaires-basketball-stars-and-fierce-criticism/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","AA News|Crypto News|Donald Trump|Justin Sun|Official Trump (TRUMP)|United States",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T19:35:17.000Z,"Semler Scientific makes fresh $50M BTC purchase near all-time high price","On May 23, 2025, Semler Scientific, Inc. filed a Form 8-K with the SEC, in which it outlined its latest Bitcoin investments and at-the-market (ATM) equity offering progress. According to the filing , Semler Scientific has established a Bitcoin dashboard on its website to meet Regulation FD requirements, ensuring broad access to material information. The dashboard will show market data for the company’s common stock and Bitcoin, alongside key performance indicators like BTC Yield, BTC Gain, and BTC $ Gain. It also tracks Bitcoin purchases and holdings. Key data from the filing As far as its BTC acquisition is going, Semler Scientific has had access to a steady stream of cash. On April 15, 2025, Semler entered a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with multiple financial institutions, which permitted the sale of up to $500 million in common stock via an ATM program. By May 22, 2025, the company had parted with 3,003,488 shares and raised $114.8 million in net proceeds. Those funds went into the acquisition of 455 Bitcoins between May 13 and May 22, 2025, for $50 million, at an average price of $109,801 per Bitcoin, fees inclusive. As of May 22, 2025, Semler had 4,264 Bitcoins, purchased for $390.0 million at an average price of $91,471 per Bitcoin. The market value of these holdings was $474.4 million, based on Coinbase’s price at 4:00 p.m. ET, reflecting an $84.4 million unrealized gain. The company’s BTC Yield, a KPI measuring the performance of its Bitcoin strategy, reached 25.8% year-to-date through May 22, 2025, highlighting the accretive nature of its investments. Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin plan is not as aggressive as Strategy’s Since the world woke up to the genius of Michael Saylor, many companies have attempted to replicate his playbook with respect to Bitcoin acquisition. Super BTC Sunday with the 🐐 pic.twitter.com/pcwhiXH2zO — Eric Semler (@SemlerEric) February 9, 2025 Semler Scientific is one of the companies that has followed that playbook, adopting a bold shift toward BTC as a treasury asset. However, it does not mirror Strategy’s aggressiveness, instead favoring an equity-focused approach. Semler Scientific’s pivot began in 2024, when it announced its first Bitcoin purchases, aiming to diversify its balance sheet and hedge against inflation. Like many financial bodies now, the company sees Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, and has leveraged its ATM program to raise capital efficiently without diluting shareholder value excessively. Its 25.8% BTC Yield, driven by Bitcoin’s price appreciation, is proof that the approach works. Semler’s leadership, including CFO Renae Cormier, who signed the filing, hopes to emphasize transparency through the Bitcoin dashboard, and its latest moves align with growing corporate interest in cryptocurrency as a strategic investment. Other companies doing something similar include Metaplanet , Mara Holdings , Riot Platforms, and Hut8.

2025-05-23T19:30:37.000Z,"Massive $200 Million Sell Wall Holds Bitcoin At $111,000 And $113,000 – Here’s What We Know","After several days of asking from bullish investors, Bitcoin has finally carved out a new all-time high above $108,800, reaching as high as $111,814 in the last 24 hours. The breakout to the new all-time high has been accompanied by strong buying volume , but the recent rally is now facing heavy friction from a concentrated zone of sell orders that appear to be keeping price action capped in a tight range. Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below $111,000 after retracing, and on-chain order book data from CoinGlass offers an explanation. Chart Liquidity Heatmap Shows Strong Resistance Cluster Data from CoinGlass reveals an aggressive concentration of sell orders between the $111,000 and $113,200 range. This is clearly visible in the heatmap chart below, where bright yellow bands represent heavy liquidity levels stacked above the current market price. However, what is really interesting is what is happening at these liquidity levels. Sell orders are being layered at a rate of $8 million per $100 increment within these levels, forming a thick wall of resistance. Altogether, this zone carries approximately $200 million in cumulative sell-side pressure. The visual data reflects consistent order flow resistance, with several candles wicking into the highlighted region only to retreat shortly after. In effect, the market could be entering a liquidity trap where bullish momentum is absorbed, and buyers at the top can get liquidated. What The Massive $200 Million Sell Wall Means For Bitcoin Price This large-scale sell wall typically represents institutional distribution or protective positioning from whales who anticipate a short-term correction. With Bitcoin having surged from below $106,000 to over $111,000 in such a short time, it’s unsurprising to see some profit-taking at these psychological thresholds. However, the presence of this wall does not necessarily invalidate the broader bullish trend ; it introduces a layer of friction that may result in consolidation or a temporary pullback. If Bitcoin is unable to break through this wall cleanly, there can be a prolonged sideways pattern as buy-side liquidity attempts to absorb the sell pressure. However, a sudden spike in spot demand or a liquidation cascade in short positions could trigger a breakout above $113,200, which would clear the path for price discovery beyond $115,000. The Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross seems to support this latter outlook. Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action using this indicator shows that the Bitcoin NVT golden cross is still out of the overbought zone, meaning that the price still has much room to run. On the other hand, on-chain data shows an interesting trend from Bitcoin whales that can contribute to selling pressure. New whales, those currently holding huge amounts of BTC for less than 30 days, have started taking profit off of this new price peak. However, old whale addresses have contributed very little to selling pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $110,670.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sell-wall-holding/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinglass|NVT",cryptocompare
2025-05-23T19:30:29.000Z,"US Stock Market Plunges at Open: Understanding the Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Plunges at Open: Understanding the Crypto Market Impact For many watching the cryptocurrency space, keeping an eye on traditional financial markets, particularly the US Stock Market , is becoming increasingly important. Today, the US Stock Market saw a notable dip right at the Stock Market Open , a move that often sends ripples across various asset classes, including digital assets. What Happened at the Stock Market Open ? The trading day kicked off with major indices registering losses. Here’s a quick look at the numbers from the Stock Market Open : S&P 500 : Down 1.03% Nasdaq : Down 1.45% Dow Jones Industrial Average : Down 0.8% These percentages might seem small, but they represent significant value shifts across thousands of companies listed on these exchanges. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index often shows higher volatility, and today was no exception, leading the decline among the major indices. Why is the US Stock Market Facing Pressure? The reasons behind a market move are rarely singular, but current pressures on the US Stock Market often stem from a mix of macroeconomic factors. Concerns about inflation, expectations around potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical events can all weigh on investor sentiment. When investors become more cautious, they may reduce their exposure to assets perceived as higher risk, which can lead to sell-offs in stocks. Understanding the Crypto Market Impact So, how does a dip in the US Stock Market relate to cryptocurrencies? Historically, assets like Bitcoin and other digital currencies have shown increasing correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 . This correlation has grown as more institutional investors and large funds enter the crypto space, bringing with them trading strategies and risk assessments that link digital assets to the broader financial landscape. When the US Stock Market declines, it can sometimes trigger a similar reaction in the crypto market. This is often due to: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of economic uncertainty or market fear, investors tend to move away from assets considered more volatile or speculative. Both tech stocks (heavy in the Nasdaq ) and cryptocurrencies can fall into this category for some investors. Liquidity Needs: Large investors holding both stocks and crypto might sell off parts of their portfolio (including crypto) to cover margin calls or raise cash during a stock market downturn. Algorithmic Trading: Some trading algorithms are designed to react to movements in traditional markets, automatically adjusting crypto positions based on indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq . Therefore, monitoring the health of the US Stock Market provides valuable context when analyzing potential movements in the crypto market. Navigating the Downturn: What Investors Can Consider A downturn in the US Stock Market and its potential ripple effect on crypto presents both challenges and opportunities, depending on your perspective and strategy. The challenge is the potential for further price declines in digital assets if the correlation holds. The opportunity, for some, might lie in potential buying opportunities if they believe in the long-term value of certain cryptocurrencies. It’s important to remember that while correlation exists, it’s not always perfect, and the crypto market has its own unique drivers and catalysts. However, ignoring the macro environment, including the performance of the US Stock Market at the Stock Market Open and throughout the day, would be a mistake for any serious crypto enthusiast or investor. Conclusion Today’s lower Stock Market Open in the US serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. With the S&P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow all registering losses, understanding the potential Crypto Market Impact becomes crucial. While cryptocurrencies offer a distinct asset class, their increasing link to traditional markets means that headlines from Wall Street can and often do influence sentiment and price action in the digital asset world. Staying informed about these broader market movements is key to navigating the volatile landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest pullback has contributed to a wave of liquidations of futures positions. On Friday, May 23, liquidations on crypto exchanges affected 160,905 traders, with a total value of erased positions amounting to $563.20 million . Out of these liquidations, $418.63 million accounted for long positions, while $144.35 million accounted for short positions. According to Coinglass, the largest single liquidation order was a BTC-USDT bet on OKX, valued at $9.53 million. You might also like: Ethereum, Bitcoin ETFs see biggest inflows since the start of the year Bitcoin traders lost the most, with $153.04 million in total liquidations, while Ethereum followed in close second, with $144.19 million. In both cases, longs made up a majority of the liquidated positions, likely due to heightened volatility. Bitcoin, Ethereum slip on Trump trade war Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin fell from its all-time high of $111,970 to the $107,000 range, before rebounding back to $109,231. At the same time, Ethereum went from a daily high of $2,731 down to a low of $2,508, before rebounding back to $2,574. You might also like: XRP could explode after Bitcoin dominance declines, Unilabs crosses $800k raised Both major crypto assets fell shortly after the U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new punitive tariffs on the EU and Apple. Escalating trade tensions impact risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum more than many other assets. This is because traders are less likely to make risky bets in a potential low-growth environment. Still, Bitcoin proved to be relatively resilient throughout the trade war. The asset surpassed its previous high in November, which coincided with Trump’s inauguration. Ethereum was less resilient, trading far below the $4000 level it broke in November. Bitcoin’s resilience is likely due to its “digital gold” narrative. Traders, including institutional investors, are starting to look at Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a counter-cyclical asset, which typically do well in volatile market conditions.

2025-05-23T19:15:34.000Z,"Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance Was Ignored in 2021, Qubetics Might Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency in the Coming Quarter","How often do people realize the biggest crypto win was the one they scrolled past? Back in 2021, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance made noise—but too many chose to wait, question, or simply ignore it. Fast forward, and that pause turned into a missed shot at millions. It’s a brutal reminder: hesitation in crypto often comes with a price tag. Now, another serious contender is stepping up—and this time, the momentum isn’t subtle. Qubetics is capturing attention with real innovation, an engaged community, and a growth curve that feels anything but accidental. Qubetics offers a full-spectrum blockchain solution with real utility, and it’s already creating waves with its presale momentum. Backed by a unique tokenomics model and tangible user applications, Qubetics is not just promising change—it’s delivering. As a project, it’s engineered to redefine secure asset management, and its presale stage offers both accessibility and urgency. If you missed the last big one, this is your chance to act. The most popular cryptocurrency in the coming quarter may not be Bitcoin or Ethereum—it could very well be Qubetics. The Most Popular Cryptocurrency Opportunity You Shouldn’t Miss: Qubetics Regret is a tough teacher—and those who overlooked the earliest Qubetics presale rounds know this all too well. Those initial investors were able to secure $TICS at a mere $0.01 back in September 2024, when the project’s presale quietly began. Since then, multiple stages have flown by, each with a 10% price increase every seven days. If you’re reading this now, you haven’t missed your chance entirely—Qubetics is currently in Stage 35, priced at $0.2785, with the mainnet launching in Q2 2025. Over $17.3 million has already been raised, more than 513 million tokens sold, and over 26,900 holders have claimed their stake in what could become the most popular cryptocurrency this year. The return on investment potential for Qubetics is impossible to ignore. At the current price, an investor putting in $2,000 would receive 7,190 tokens. Should $TICS reach $1 post-presale, the return would stand at approximately $5,385—translating into a 258.95% ROI. If it climbs to $5, the earnings could be $35,900, reflecting a massive 1,694.74% ROI. At $10, that investment balloons to $71,800—a 3,489.47% ROI. And if $TICS hits $15 after the mainnet launch, the reward spikes to $107,700, a staggering 5,284.21% ROI. It’s clear why Qubetics is gaining recognition as the most popular cryptocurrency among strategic investors. This is not just another presale—this is the top crypto presale of 2025. A standout innovation fueling this rise is the Qubetics Wallet—a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet designed for unmatched accessibility and security. Whether it’s a small business managing vendor payments, a freelancer securing cross-border income, or a corporate treasury diversifying into crypto assets, the wallet offers seamless and intuitive control. It’s compatible across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms, making it viable for users in finance, retail, or tech. For those managing $TICS tokens or any digital assets, the Qubetics Wallet makes asset management streamlined, independent, and secure, adding real-world utility that sets Qubetics apart from speculative-only projects. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance: The Ignored Titan of 2021 When the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance launched in 2021, it was introduced with ambitious goals to fuse blockchain with cutting-edge AI capabilities. The coin debuted with a modest ICO price, making it accessible to most early investors. Yet, the market was flooded with distractions and competing projects that drew attention elsewhere. While some early believers recognized its potential, the broader community remained skeptical—and that skepticism proved costly. The coin went on to hit significant all-time highs, far surpassing expectations and leaving those who dismissed it with lingering regret. It became a textbook example of what happens when innovation is ignored before adoption kicks in. Over the last few years, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance has shown consistent growth and has carved out a niche for itself in both the AI and blockchain communities. It has formed notable partnerships, expanded its user base, and demonstrated consistent performance. The token’s market presence today reflects the credibility it has earned post-ICO. Yet despite its substantial growth, many investors still remember the early days—the chance they had to invest before the narrative shifted. While the coin now commands respect in the market, its initial dormancy remains one of crypto’s biggest missed opportunities. Conclusion: Qubetics Could Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency You Still Have Time For Crypto history is full of missed opportunities—but the smart investor doesn’t dwell on the past. Instead, they act on what’s in front of them now. Qubetics has not only created momentum but sustained it, and the data speaks volumes. Between the explosive ROI projections, the ongoing success of the Qubetics presale, and the unmatched utility offered by its technology, this project is well-positioned to become the most popular cryptocurrency in the coming quarter. If you missed out on previous projects like the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance, you now have a chance to realign your portfolio with a future-focused asset. By choosing to join this top crypto presale , you’re not just investing in a token—you’re stepping into a powerful ecosystem with real-world usability and community-driven growth. The opportunity is here. The time is now.

Technical indicators show cooling momentum as retail investor sentiment falls to a 90-day low and liquidity data points to price volatility. Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market \""breather.\"" Glassnode analysis shows that STHs, often considered traders rather than long-term investors, have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,000. The profit-taking peaked at $747 million daily, a rapid increase from the $1.2 billion realized in the last 30-day period, highlighting a shift in new investor sentiment. Bitcoin entity-adjusted short-term holder. Source: Glassnode The STH Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has spiked, with profits now significantly outweighing losses, and only 8% of trading days have seen this ratio at a higher level. This level of profit-taking is typical during bullish trends but often precedes local market tops. Excessive profit-taking can overwhelm new demand, creating overhead supply resistance and halt Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr noted that Bitcoin’s 30-day price momentum has already slowed by 38%, currently sitting at 19%. Adler described it as a “technical cooldown” after the recent peak. The Bitcoin researcher suggested the market needs a “breather” before potentially resuming its rally. Similarly, analysis from Hyblock Capital advised caution as the previous three months outlined Bitcoin consistently targeting short liquidity zones above current prices, driving its recent highs. However, retail sentiment is at a 90-day low, with only 31.59% of retail accounts holding long positions. Meanwhile, open interest is at a 90-day high, and combined order books sit in the 91st percentile, signaling high liquidity and potential volatility. Bitcoin aggregate order book and open interest.

2025-05-23T19:07:42.000Z,"Bitcoin whale James Wynn pushes 40x long position to $1.07 billion","James Wynn, a pseudonymous crypto trader known for swinging massive positions on-chain, has expanded his Bitcoin long bet to $1.07 billion using 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, the decentralized derivatives platform. The final scale-up was shared by James via X on Friday, with a screenshot that showed the total exposure was pegged at 974.44634 BTC, entered at around $109,000 per coin. The size of the position in satoshis (1,073,912,068.95) is a figure few traders would ever dare touch. Source: James Wynn/X James started with an $830 million long opening on May 21, timed with Bitcoin’s price breaching $109,000. At the time, optimism in the market was being fueled by growing institutional participation and clearer rules from the US government and regulators. But James’ play came during a moment when most large traders were taking short positions, expecting a pullback, and he went the opposite direction. Bitcoin whale trims holdings, then reloads to over $1.1 billion Ninety minutes into that original $830 million position, James took profit by cutting 3,688 BTC, worth about $400 million, from the exposure. That reduced the position to $430 million. EmberCN, a blockchain analytics firm, said this was likely an early gain lock rather than a shift in outlook. By the morning of May 22, James returned heavier, as he had raised his position to $1.1 billion, maintaining the same 40x leverage. At that time, Bitcoin had crossed $110,000, and James’s trade was sitting on $39 million in unrealized gains, per wallet data tracked by Lookonchain. Later that day, James again reduced exposure, selling off 540 BTC valued near $60 million. He booked a $1.5 million profit and repeated his previous day’s pattern of partial exits after strong price actions. Lookonchain reported that three previous trims by James had all preceded pullbacks in Bitcoin, causing traders to monitor his wallet for the next move. Some were speculating that James’ exits might be playing into short-term volatility across the market. Meanwhile, amid this, data from Glassnode shows that over 420,000 Bitcoins have a cost basis near $94K, forming one of the strongest support zones of the current cycle. The Fear & Greed Index has also hit 78 at extreme greed in its highest level since January. James originally became known for flipping meme tokens with shocking results. His wallet, identified as 0x507, was first flagged after massive wins trading PEPE , the frog-themed memecoin. He bought 2.83 trillion PEPE for just $8,524, and by June 2024, that bag was worth $44.4 million. In June 2024, James deposited 491 billion PEPE, worth $7.54 million, into Binance, triggering speculation that he was offloading. But he didn’t sound bearish. In a post on X after the deposit, James said PEPE was “still severely undervalued,” and added that the “PEPE takeover just began.” He also claimed, “everyone who bought PEPE was in profit unless they sold it,” pushing back against doubts in the memecoin’s value.

2025-05-23T19:00:46.000Z,"Ledn Pivots Exclusively to Bitcoin Lending: Ending ETH Support Marks Bold Strategy","BitcoinWorld Ledn Pivots Exclusively to Bitcoin Lending: Ending ETH Support Marks Bold Strategy In a significant strategic shift within the crypto lending space, platform Ledn has announced it will discontinue support for Ethereum (ETH)-backed loans and related savings products. This change, effective July 1, marks a decisive move for Ledn to concentrate its efforts solely on its Bitcoin lending services, specifically its “Custodied Bitcoin Loan” offering. This decision highlights a growing trend towards specialization in the competitive digital asset market. Why is Ledn Focusing Solely on Bitcoin Lending ? Ledn’s move to end ETH support and focus exclusively on BTC-backed loans is driven by several factors, according to company statements and market analysis. The platform aims to streamline its operations and enhance its core offering. By concentrating on Bitcoin, Ledn can potentially optimize its infrastructure, security protocols, and customer service around a single, dominant digital asset. This specialization allows for a deeper focus on the unique characteristics and market dynamics of Bitcoin. Key reasons behind this strategic pivot include: Market Demand: There is increasing institutional and retail interest specifically in Bitcoin-related financial products. Bitcoin remains the largest and most established cryptocurrency, often viewed as digital gold. Operational Efficiency: Managing diverse asset types adds complexity. Focusing on Bitcoin simplifies risk management, compliance, and technological development. Enhanced Security & Transparency: Ledn emphasizes the security and transparency of its “Custodied Bitcoin Loan.” By focusing on a single asset’s custody and loan process, they can potentially offer a more robust and auditable service. Aligning with Core Strengths: Ledn may see its primary strength and competitive advantage in serving the Bitcoin community with tailored financial products. This strategic choice comes at a time when the crypto lending market is maturing, with platforms seeking distinct value propositions to attract and retain users. What Does This Mean for Existing Users with ETH Support on Ledn? For Ledn users who currently utilize ETH-backed loans or have funds in ETH savings products, the announcement requires action before the July 1 deadline. Ledn has outlined a process for transitioning or closing these positions. Users are typically given instructions on how to: Repay existing ETH-backed loans. Withdraw ETH from savings accounts. Convert ETH to another supported asset (like BTC or stablecoins) if they wish to continue using Ledn’s services, although the primary focus will be BTC-centric. It is crucial for affected users to review the specific communications from Ledn regarding deadlines and procedures to avoid any disruption or potential liquidation of positions if loans are not managed in time. The platform’s support channels are the best resource for personalized guidance during this transition. Exploring the Benefits of BTC-Backed Loans With Ledn’s exclusive focus, it’s worth understanding the appeal of BTC-backed loans for cryptocurrency holders. These loans allow individuals and businesses to access liquidity without selling their valuable Bitcoin holdings. This can be particularly advantageous for long-term Bitcoin holders who believe in its future appreciation but need immediate capital. Key benefits include: Liquidity Access: Unlock the value of Bitcoin without triggering a taxable event from selling. Continued Exposure: Maintain ownership of Bitcoin, benefiting from any potential price increases while the loan is active. Flexibility: Use the borrowed funds for various purposes, such as investments, business expenses, or personal needs. Potential Tax Efficiency: In many jurisdictions, taking out a loan against an asset is not a taxable event, unlike selling the asset. Ledn’s emphasis on a “Custodied Bitcoin Loan” suggests a model where they take possession of the collateralized Bitcoin, offering a specific type of service compared to non-custodial options. This model typically provides more certainty regarding the handling and security of the collateral for both the platform and the user, albeit requiring trust in the platform’s custody practices. The Competitive Landscape in Crypto Lending Ledn’s decision to specialize in Bitcoin lending occurs within a dynamic and competitive crypto lending market. Numerous platforms offer lending and borrowing services for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Some platforms offer decentralized lending, while others operate on a centralized model like Ledn. Here’s a brief look at the landscape: Platform Type Model Asset Focus Key Characteristic Centralized Platforms (like Ledn, historically others) Custodial Wide range (or specializing) Ease of use, potential for higher yields/lower rates (depending on market), counterparty risk Decentralized Protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound) Non-custodial Wide range Transparency via smart contracts, no single point of failure (protocol level), smart contract risk By focusing exclusively on Bitcoin, Ledn aims to carve out a niche, positioning itself as the go-to platform for individuals and institutions who primarily hold or are interested in leveraging their Bitcoin assets securely and transparently through a custodial service. This specialization could allow them to offer more competitive terms or a superior user experience specifically for Bitcoin users compared to platforms supporting dozens of different assets. What Actionable Insights Can Users Take? For cryptocurrency holders, Ledn’s announcement offers a moment to evaluate their strategies, particularly concerning lending and borrowing activities. For Ledn ETH Users: Act promptly before July 1 to manage existing loans and savings. Explore Ledn’s BTC services if you hold Bitcoin, or research other platforms if you need ETH lending/savings options. For Bitcoin Holders: If you are considering using your Bitcoin as collateral, platforms like Ledn (with its new focus) offer a way to do so. Compare terms, interest rates, loan-to-value ratios, and custody practices across different providers. For Ethereum Holders: This highlights the need to be aware of platform-specific changes. If you use or plan to use lending/borrowing services with ETH, research platforms that have strong, continued support for Ethereum. Understand the Risks: Regardless of the asset, crypto lending involves risks, including counterparty risk (the platform defaulting), liquidation risk (if the collateral value drops significantly), and interest rate risk. Always do thorough due diligence. Ledn’s pivot underscores that the crypto lending landscape is still evolving. Platforms are adapting their business models based on market conditions, regulatory environments, and perceived user needs. The Future of Specialization in Crypto Lending Ledn’s bold move to specialize in Bitcoin lending could signal a future trend in the crypto lending industry. As the market matures, platforms may find it more sustainable and competitive to focus on specific assets or types of services rather than trying to be a one-stop shop for everything. Specialization can lead to deeper expertise, more tailored products, and potentially stronger security measures for the supported assets. Bitcoin, with its large market cap, strong network effects, and growing acceptance as a store of value, presents a compelling case for focused financial services. Platforms that can offer secure, transparent, and competitive BTC-backed loans are likely to attract a dedicated user base. Conversely, the decision to drop ETH support might alienate users who hold a diversified portfolio or primarily hold Ethereum. These users will seek platforms that continue to offer robust services for ETH and other altcoins. This could lead to increased competition among platforms vying for the Ethereum lending market share. Ultimately, Ledn’s strategy is a bet on the continued dominance and specific financial needs of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its success will likely depend on its ability to execute its focused strategy effectively, providing a superior and trustworthy Bitcoin lending service. Conclusion: A Focused Future for Ledn Ledn’s announcement to cease ETH support and channel all its energy into Bitcoin lending marks a pivotal moment for the platform. Effective July 1, Ledn will operate with a singular focus on providing secure and transparent BTC-backed loans through its custodial service. This strategic pivot aligns with the increasing market interest in Bitcoin-centric financial products and allows Ledn to specialize its operations and expertise. While requiring current ETH users to transition, this move positions Ledn to potentially become a leading provider in the dedicated Bitcoin lending niche. The broader crypto lending market will watch closely to see if this specialization strategy yields significant advantages in a competitive landscape.

The marketplace announced it had enabled Solana ( SOL ) as a new account funding option on Friday, May 23, with this shared an update the Kalshi team posted on X. SOL coming to the regulated prediction marketplace sees the altcoin join USDC ( USDC ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ) as deposit methods. Users can also fund accounts with Worldcoin ( WLD ). Initially, Kalshi only accepted the Circle-issued stablecoin as its crypto deposit option. Kalshi will now look to tap into Solana’s traction to attract more crypto users to its platform, increasing its competition with Polymarket. While Kalshi’s other deposit methods include bank transfer, debit card and wire deposits, crypto has quickly caught on. Benefits such as fast transactions when funding accounts and higher deposit limits are attractive to crypto-natives. On Kalshi, users can trade on any prediction , from politics, sports, weather and crypto. The platform’s service is available across all 50 U.S. states.

2025-05-23T18:50:48.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Soars to New Peak: Is the Crypto Market Overheating?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars to New Peak: Is the Crypto Market Overheating? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! The Bitcoin price recently achieved a monumental milestone, reaching a brand-new all-time high (ATH) that grabbed headlines globally. This surge in value is exciting for investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling strong momentum. However, as the price action unfolds, market participants and analysts are keenly watching for signs of potential shifts. While breaking records is undoubtedly bullish, it also raises important questions about the sustainability of the current rally and whether the overall Crypto Market might be showing signs of getting ahead of itself. Let’s dive into the details of this record-breaking move and what experts are saying about the road ahead. Bitcoin ATH: How High Did It Go and What Happened Next? Setting a new Bitcoin ATH is always a significant event, and this latest one was no exception. The price surged to an impressive peak of $111,970, a level previously untouched in Bitcoin’s history. This moment was met with widespread optimism, reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a valuable and appreciating asset. However, markets rarely move in a straight line. Shortly after hitting this peak, the Bitcoin price experienced a swift retracement, pulling back to around the $110,700 level. This immediate pullback is a common occurrence after significant price spikes, often indicating some level of profit-taking or simply market participants reacting to the rapid ascent. This price action – hitting a record high followed by a quick dip – sets the stage for the crucial discussion happening among analysts: is this just a healthy fluctuation in an upward trend, or is it a warning sign that the market is becoming overextended? Is the Crypto Market Overheating? Unpacking the Warning Signs The question of whether the Crypto Market is overheating is complex, with various indicators offering different perspectives. Some data points are indeed flashing caution signals that analysts are paying close attention to. Funding Rates: In perpetual futures markets, funding rates reflect the sentiment of traders. Positive funding rates mean long position holders are paying short position holders, indicating bullish sentiment and demand for leverage on the long side. When funding rates become excessively high and sustained, it can suggest that the market is becoming overly leveraged and potentially due for a correction to flush out these positions. Recent data has shown some elevated funding rates, leading some to point to this as a sign of potential Market Overheating . Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100. Generally, an RSI reading above 70 is considered overbought, suggesting the asset may be due for a price correction. While not a perfect predictor, high RSI levels can indicate that a rally has been very strong in a short period, potentially making it unsustainable without a cool-off period. According to reports, RSI data for Bitcoin has been indicating potential overbought conditions following the recent surge to the Bitcoin ATH . These indicators, among others, provide a basis for the argument that the market might be entering a phase where caution is warranted. A market that is overheating is more susceptible to sharp pullbacks as traders take profits or leveraged positions are liquidated. Crypto Analysis: Why Some Experts Remain Bullish Despite Warnings Despite the cautionary signals, many prominent analysts, including those conducting in-depth Crypto Analysis , remain optimistic about the current market phase. They argue that while some indicators might suggest overheating, the overall market structure and participant behavior tell a different story. One key voice in this perspective is Crypto Dan from CryptoQuant. CryptoQuant is known for its on-chain data analysis, providing insights into the behavior of various market participants, particularly large holders (whales) and miners. According to Crypto Dan and other data points highlighted by Cointelegraph, several factors suggest the market might still be in a healthy upward trajectory: Minimal Whale Profit-Taking: Whales, or large Bitcoin holders, have a significant impact on market movements. If whales were aggressively selling their holdings, it would be a strong signal of potential downside. However, analysis indicates that profit-taking from these large entities has been minimal or subdued during this rally. This suggests that whales are holding onto their Bitcoin, perhaps anticipating further price appreciation, which is a bullish sign. Subdued Overall Profit-Taking: Beyond just whales, broader market data on realized profits (when coins that were bought at lower prices are sold at higher prices) also suggests that widespread profit-taking is not occurring at a level typically seen before a major market top. This indicates that many investors are holding for the long term rather than cashing out immediately after the price increase. Healthy Correction Dynamics: The retracement after hitting the Bitcoin ATH could be viewed not as a sign of weakness, but as a healthy correction. Upward trends require periods of consolidation or slight pullbacks to shed excess leverage and allow new buyers to enter the market, setting the stage for the next leg up. This perspective suggests that while individual indicators like high funding rates or RSI might warrant monitoring, they should be viewed within the broader context of on-chain data and overall market structure. The lack of aggressive selling from key players is a powerful counter-signal to the idea of imminent Market Overheating . Bringing It All Together: What Does This Mean for You? The current situation presents a classic picture of conflicting signals within the Crypto Market . On one hand, we have the undeniable momentum of a new Bitcoin ATH and indicators like subdued whale selling suggesting underlying strength. On the other hand, metrics like high funding rates and RSI levels raise valid questions about potential short-term volatility and Market Overheating risks. Here are some actionable insights based on this analysis: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on key market indicators, including funding rates, on-chain data related to whale movements, and technical indicators like RSI. Sources like CryptoQuant and Cointelegraph provide valuable analysis. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: The potential for volatility is ever-present in the crypto space, especially around new ATHs. Assess your personal risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Many analysts who remain bullish emphasize the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader Crypto Market . Short-term fluctuations, even significant ones, may be less concerning if your investment horizon is several years. Avoid Excessive Leverage: High funding rates highlight the risks associated with leveraged trading in this environment. Excessive leverage can lead to rapid liquidations during pullbacks. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For many, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price highs or lows, can be a strategy to navigate market volatility and reduce the risk of buying only at the peak. Ultimately, navigating the market requires balancing the excitement of new highs with a cautious awareness of potential risks. The debate among analysts underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Conclusion: A Market at a Crossroads? Bitcoin’s recent surge to a new all-time high is a powerful testament to its enduring strength and growing adoption. However, the subsequent retracement and the mixed signals from various market indicators paint a picture of a market at a crucial juncture. While some data points suggest potential Market Overheating , analysis of on-chain behavior, particularly the lack of aggressive selling from large holders, provides a compelling counter-argument for a healthy, ongoing uptrend. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining which narrative prevails. Will the cautionary signals lead to a more significant pullback, or will the underlying strength continue to propel the Bitcoin Price higher? For now, the market remains a fascinating study in conflicting forces, demanding careful observation and informed decision-making from all participants.

The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.   Related: Ukraine strategic Bitcoin reserve bill reportedly in final stagesOn May 6, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte was the first to sign a Bitcoin reserve bill into law.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets.

Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. “US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”May 22 letter to DOJ official calling for investigation into Trump memecoin dinner.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

2025-05-23T08:47:40.000Z,"DeFi near-zero onboarding costs can help 1.4B unbanked: 1inch co-founder","Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms have a major cost advantage over traditional banks when it comes to onboarding new users, according to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange (DEX) 1inch.Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed. Crypto works the same way,” he said. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/1inch-cofounder-defi-financial-inclusion-dbw-event?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T02:38:39.000Z,"‘No questions asked’ Bitcoin launderer gets 6 years in prison","A US man operating what prosecutors called a “no questions asked” cash-to-Bitcoin conversion service has been sentenced to six years behind bars and was ordered to hand over millions of dollars. Boston federal court Judge Richard Stearns sentenced Trung Nguyen, from Danvers, Massachusetts, to six years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to forfeit $1.5 million, the Boston US Attorney’s Office said on May 22. Prosecutors said Nguyen ran an unlicensed money-transmitting business called National Vending between September 2017 and October 2020, which used various techniques he learned in an online course to evade authorities.As part of the course, Nguyen was taught how to conceal his actual business from banks, crypto exchanges and state authorities by masquerading as a vending machine company that accepted cash deposits, had a list of fictional suppliers, and generally avoided using the phrase “Bitcoin” where possible.Prosecutors say Trung Nguyen operated a fake vending machine business to obscure the cash deposits he was receiving. Source: PacerAccording to prosecutors, among Nguyen’s customer base were several scam victims who were tricked into converting cash into Bitcoin (BTC) by con artists overseas, as well as a drug dealer who sent $250,000 in cash across 10 transactions in 2018.The Justice Department said Nguyen converted more than $1 million to Bitcoin and “purposely failed” to register with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) despite being required to do so under federal Anti-Money Laundering regulations.Nguyen also “failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports or Currency Transaction Reports on any of these transactions, including cash transactions of more than $10,000,” according to prosecutors.Undercover cops sting NguyenNguyen would often meet his clients in person to accept large sums of cash, which is how he was caught, prosecutors said.A May 2023 indictment said that during several meetings with undercover law enforcement officers, he accepted cash and sent Bitcoin in return, taking just over 5% in commission.Related: Crypto use in money laundering ‘far below’ cash — US TreasuryThe indictment said Nguyen used encrypted messaging apps and “technologies that made it more difficult” to trace his Bitcoin transactions and broke up the cash deposits into smaller sums over consecutive days and at different branches of the same bank to evade notice by authorities.Nguyen was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and two counts of money laundering.

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March.

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions.

While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.Solana 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe trend remains bullish, supported by the relative strength index (RSI) at 64.30, indicating healthy momentum without overbought conditions. However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated. The support range is a daily order block, which should provide higher time frame (HTF) support in case of a price correction. Related: Bitcoin could go much higher due to lack of FOMO and futures market euphoria — AnalystsSolana price fractal aims for $260Crypto trader Robert Mercer shared a chart identifying a price fractal pattern similar to October 2024. Mercer emphasized two critical zones: one around late 2024, where SOL broke past $180 after consolidation, and a current zone mirroring that setup. He predicts a breakout above $180 could trigger a sharp upward rally, mirroring the late 2024 rally that saw $SOL peak near $260.Solana price fractal analysis.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.Fartcoin ascending channel hints at more gainsSolana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) memecoin has surged 30% in the last three days to hit $1.57 as of May 22, its highest level in the last four months.The rally extends Fartcoin’s strong year-to-date (YTD) performance—up 74.50%—amid the ongoing memecoin frenzy. In comparison, Bitcoin has risen 18% so far in 2025.Technically, Fartcoin is trading within a well-defined ascending channel that began forming in early March, suggesting sustained bullish momentum.FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingViewThe memecoin has also broken above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), currently near $1.06, a key support level in uptrends.FARTCOIN’s relative strength index (RSI) was hovering near 64 as of May 22, suggesting there is room to run before selling conditions emerge near the overbought threshold at 70. If the uptrend holds, Fartcoin could retest the channel’s upper boundary near $2.74 by June, up 80% from the current price levels.Dogwifhat price could doubleLike FARTCOIN, Dogwifhat (WIF) has outperformed Bitcoin during the recent rally, up over 27% in the past three days. But the Solana memecoin has underperformed the top cryptocurrency year-to-date, down about 38%.But a bull pennant formation may put Dogwifhat in a position to catch up in the coming weeks. As of May 22, WIF’s price was testing the pennant’s upper trendline for a breakout, with its technical target at around $2.50, up about 125% from the current price levels.  WIF/USDT daily price chart.

It is, therefore, underperforming Bitcoin on a YTD timeframe but, like WIF, shows the potential of outperforming BTC this cycle in percentage terms.At the core of this bullish outlook is SPX6900’s ongoing bullish reversal attempts. As of May 22, the memecoin had entered the breakout stage of its prevailing ascending triangle pattern, eyeing a rally toward $1.34 by June.SPX6900/USDT daily price chart.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit. Source: CaselawRelated: Bitcoin SV investors attempt to resurrect 2019 Binance lawsuitCourt strikes down “loss of a chance” argumentThe appeal also challenged the Tribunal’s application of the “market mitigation rule,” arguing that such issues should be left for trial.The court dismissed that notion, stating the rule clearly applies to freely tradable assets like BSV, and that the damages must be measured shortly after the delisting.An additional argument concerning the “loss of a chance” to benefit from future price gains was also struck down. The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.
