2025-05-24T08:00:37.000Z,"American Tourist Drugged, Crypto Worth $123K Stolen By ‘Uber’ Driver","An American visitor ended up losing $123,000 in crypto after getting into the wrong cab in central London. He said he felt drowsy and blank after taking a cigarette the driver offered him. Thirty minutes later, he woke up on the pavement with a smashed phone and no way to unlock his crypto wallet. Mistaken Identity At Night According to My London , Jacob Irwin-Cline hailed what he thought was an Uber at around 1:30 a.m. on May 9, 2025. It wasn’t. The driver looked similar to the person in the app, but the car was different. He didn’t check the plate number. He says he only spotted the mistake after the attack. US Tourist Says Bitcoin, XRP Worth $123K Stolen After Ride With Fake Uber in London An American tourist has lost more than $123,000 in crypto after being drugged and abducted by a fake Uber driver in London’s West End.Read more: https://t.co/6oEsTH79ig pic.twitter.com/uIu9ZijSK7 — Mars Signals (@MarsSignals) May 21, 2025 Sedative Cigarette Encounter Based on reports, the driver handed him a cigarette when Jacob was already half asleep. He says it felt odd right away. He thinks it was laced with scopolamine, a powerful sedative. This drug can make you feel calm, confused, or even forget what just happened. He lost consciousness for about 30 minutes. When he woke up, the taxi was gone. Lost Wallet And Cold Facts His phone was the real prize. It held his private keys and gave full access to his crypto accounts. He later discovered the cab clipped him as he stumbled out. He spent days trying to track down the device. It was never returned. Now he has no way to tap into that $123,000 stash. Rising Threats To Crypto Holders This case follows other violent crimes targeting people in the crypto world. On May 3, French police freed the father of a crypto exchange owner after he’d been held for ransom . The kidnappers wanted millions of euros. Days later, masked men tried to shove Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat’s daughter and grandson into a van in broad daylight. They fought back and escaped. Steps To Stay Safe Experts urge crypto holders to use hardware wallets for large sums and only keep small amounts on a phone. They say matching every ride-share detail helps too. Check plates, car model, and driver name before you step in. Use long passcodes or biometric locks on phones. And if you carry big assets, think about a travel companion or security guard in unfamiliar places. The growing number of violent crimes against crypto investors shows that digital money can attract more than just hackers online. It can draw real-world danger. Jacob Irwin-Cline’s loss is a stark reminder that convenience often comes at a cost. Stay alert, check the details, and keep most of your holdings offline. That way, you won’t wake up to a $123,000 hole in your pocket.

2025-05-24T08:00:32.000Z,"Solana Climbs to $183 — MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Momentum Suggests a 15,000% Upside","Bitcoin may still be the king of crypto, but a new generation of investors is constantly on the hunt for the next early-stage opportunity with Bitcoin-level upside. In 2025, one name is climbing the radar faster than most: MAGACOIN FINANCE. As Solana rallies to $183 and XRP investors look for fresh momentum ahead of exchange debuts and regulatory milestones, a growing number are accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE. Alongside it, Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building—but MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum and positioning are sparking serious speculation: Could this be the next major crypto breakout? HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating 2025 Altcoin Picks MAGACOIN FINANCE launched into the 2025 cycle with undeniable force—selling out stage after stage and drawing comparisons to early SHIBA INU and even Bitcoin’s earliest days. With a listing target of $0.007 and investors already anticipating a major exchange debut, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now viewed as a realistic 25x–35x play by early entry analysts. Key reasons investors are watching MAGA closely: Political narrative that cuts through noise and captures community energy Early-stage positioning with strong tokenomics and limited supply Rapid stage progress—Stage 8 is nearly at capacity and filling fast Analyst forecasts pointing to 15,000%–18,500% upside potential Unlike most meme-themed tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is combining sentiment with structure—and that’s the exact combination that early Bitcoin investors once recognized before the market caught on. Solana’s Consistent Climb Draws Institutional Eyes Solana (SOL) is making headlines as it reclaims the $180–$183 range, a key inflection point that could set the stage for new all-time highs. After a strong rebound from April lows, Solana’s price has surged nearly 30% in recent weeks, fueled by robust DeFi activity, low fees, and growing institutional interest. Analysts now see SOL potentially reaching $213–$362 in 2025 if the bullish trend continues, with a clear path to $240–$260 later this year. While Solana isn’t early-stage anymore, it still offers strong performance for those wanting exposure to a leading smart contract platform. That said, some SOL holders are now rotating into smaller-cap options like MAGACOIN FINANCE to chase outsized returns ahead of listings. XRP Inches Toward Futures and Institutional Access XRP remains one of the most actively discussed altcoins—trading between $2.35 and $2.65 and benefiting from regulatory clarity, ETF speculation, and renewed institutional interest. Analysts say a confirmed futures launch could drive XRP into the $2.85–$3.40 range rapidly, with long-term believers eyeing $5.50 or more as adoption grows. As XRP holders seek the next wave of upside, many are reallocating to pre-listing opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the growth curve hasn’t even begun. Kaspa: Quiet Growth, But MAGA Steals the Spotlight Kaspa (KAS) is quietly building momentum, trading around $0.11 and up over 80% since the start of the year. With its unique GHOSTDAG protocol and expanding ecosystem, KAS is attracting developers and users alike. Analysts expect Kaspa to test resistance at $0.37 by year-end, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to the explosive presale momentum of MAGACOIN FINANCE. As capital seeks sharper returns, MAGA’s early-stage appeal and viral narrative are making it the go-to allocation for traders chasing the next 15,000% winner. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion While Solana’s climb to $183 is impressive and XRP’s institutional momentum is building, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the bold, attention-grabbing pick that’s catching investor eyes across the market. With Stage 8 heating up, analyst targets pointing to 15,000%–18,500% potential, and momentum still building, MAGACOIN FINANCE may not just be another altcoin—it could be this cycle’s defining early entry moment. For investors seeking the next supercycle winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the name on every smart investor’s radar.

2025-05-24T07:50:56.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: 8 Straight Days Signal Strong Market Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: 8 Straight Days Signal Strong Market Confidence Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Ever wonder what’s driving the recent positive sentiment in the market? A significant factor is the performance of US spot Bitcoin ETF products. These investment vehicles have been making waves, and the latest data shows a promising trend that’s catching everyone’s attention. What’s Happening with Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows? On May 23rd, US spot Bitcoin ETF s collectively recorded a net inflow of $212.02 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the eighth consecutive day of positive net flows into these funds. This consistent buying pressure indicates growing investor confidence and demand for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated financial products. Let’s break down where these flows are going, based on the data shared by Trader T on X: ETF Ticker Issuer Daily Flow (May 23) IBIT BlackRock +$431.05 million HODL VanEck +$17.72 million GBTC Grayscale -$89.17 million ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares -$73.89 million FBTC Fidelity -$73.69 million Other ETFs Various $0.00 million As you can see, BlackRock IBIT continues to dominate the inflow charts, attracting a substantial amount of capital. While some funds like Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC saw outflows on this particular day, the overall trend across the ecosystem remained strongly positive, driven by the significant inflows into other products, especially IBIT. Why Are These BTC ETF Inflows a Big Deal? The consistent positive BTC ETF inflows are crucial for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar investment vehicles for traditional finance players and large institutions. Sustained inflows signal increasing comfort and allocation of capital from these major players into the Bitcoin space. Market Liquidity and Price Support: When ETFs receive inflows, they typically purchase the underlying asset (Bitcoin) to back the new shares. This creates consistent buying pressure on the spot market, providing price support and potentially driving prices higher. Accessibility for Retail Investors: Spot Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for everyday investors to get exposure to Bitcoin through their standard brokerage accounts, without the complexities of managing private keys or dealing directly with crypto exchanges. This broadens the potential investor base. Validation of the Asset Class: The success and increasing adoption of these regulated products lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a recognized and investable asset class within the traditional financial system. The fact that we’ve seen eight straight days of gains in net flows suggests that the initial volatility around the launch and subsequent outflows from GBTC are stabilizing, and a new phase of accumulation might be underway. Exploring the Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance The performance of the Spot Bitcoin ETF market is closely watched by analysts and investors alike. The competition among issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK Invest, VanEck, and others is driving innovation and fee adjustments, ultimately benefiting investors. While BlackRock IBIT has consistently led the pack in terms of inflows since its launch, the performance of other funds also contributes to the overall market sentiment. Outflows from funds like GBTC, which was converted from a trust, were anticipated as investors sought lower fees or moved to newer, more efficient ETF structures. However, the key takeaway from the recent data is that the *total* inflows across all products are outweighing the outflows, leading to a net positive trend. This dynamic flow data provides valuable insight into investor behavior and market trends. It helps us understand where capital is moving and which products are currently favored by the market participants looking for a regulated way to invest in Bitcoin. The Role of Crypto ETF Products in the Ecosystem Beyond just Bitcoin, the broader Crypto ETF landscape is evolving. While spot Ethereum ETFs are currently awaiting regulatory decisions, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs sets a precedent and builds confidence in the potential for other crypto-based investment products to gain regulatory approval and investor traction in the future. The existence of regulated crypto investment vehicles like the spot Bitcoin ETF provides a bridge between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space. They offer a familiar wrapper for a novel asset, making it more accessible and less intimidating for a wider range of investors. However, it’s important to remember that investing in any ETF, including a spot Bitcoin ETF, carries risks. The value of the ETF is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, which is known for its volatility. Market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and other factors can impact performance. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before investing. What Could Drive Future BTC ETF Inflows? Several factors could continue to fuel positive BTC ETF inflows : Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainty in traditional markets, inflation concerns, or changes in monetary policy could drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Performance: A rising Bitcoin price often attracts more investor interest and can lead to increased inflows into related investment products. Further Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions like pension funds, endowments, or wealth managers begin allocating small percentages of their portfolios to Bitcoin via ETFs, significant capital could flow in. Regulatory Clarity: Continued positive regulatory developments globally could increase confidence and reduce perceived risks for investors. The eight consecutive days of positive net flows are a strong indicator that these drivers might already be in play or gaining momentum. In Conclusion: A Bullish Signal? The recent streak of positive net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling over $212 million on May 23rd and marking eight straight days of gains, is undoubtedly a significant development. Led by strong performance from funds like BlackRock IBIT , these flows highlight increasing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and accessible investment products. While individual fund flows fluctuate, the overall trend of positive net inflows into the Spot Bitcoin ETF market provides a compelling signal of growing confidence and potential future growth for Bitcoin as an asset class.

2025-05-24T07:40:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Accumulation: DDC Enterprise Kicks Off Ambitious BTC Purchase Plan","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Accumulation: DDC Enterprise Kicks Off Ambitious BTC Purchase Plan In a move signaling growing confidence in digital assets among diverse businesses, DDC Enterprise Limited, an e-commerce firm operating across both China and the U.S., has officially commenced its ambitious Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This initial step, marked by the purchase of 21 BTC, positions DDC Enterprise among a growing list of companies exploring the integration of cryptocurrencies into their treasury strategies. What Does DDC Enterprise’s Initial BTC Purchase Signify? According to a recent Business Wire press release, DDC Enterprise completed its first BTC purchase as part of a larger, phased plan. While 21 BTC might seem like a modest start compared to some corporate giants, it represents a concrete commitment to their previously announced digital asset strategy. The firm isn’t stopping there; they intend to execute two more transactions in the immediate future to reach an initial target of 100 BTC. This initial phase is just the tip of the iceberg for DDC Enterprise’s vision. Earlier this month, the company laid out a much grander plan: accumulating up to 5,000 BTC over a 36-month horizon. They’ve set an aggressive near-term goal of acquiring 500 BTC within the first six months alone. This structured approach suggests a deliberate strategy, likely aimed at mitigating volatility risk through dollar-cost averaging or tactical buys based on market conditions. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: A Trend Gaining Momentum? DDC Enterprise’s decision is part of a broader, albeit still nascent, trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have famously added significant amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Their motivations vary but often include: Treasury Reserve Asset: Treating Bitcoin as a store of value to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, offering a potential alternative to traditional cash holdings or low-yield bonds. Investment Potential: Speculating on Bitcoin’s price appreciation as a way to potentially boost company value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their financial holdings. Strategic Alignment: Signalling innovation and embracing future financial technologies, potentially appealing to tech-savvy investors and customers. While DDC Enterprise operates in e-commerce, its move highlights that the interest in Bitcoin as a corporate asset isn’t limited to the tech or financial sectors. Their dual presence in China and the U.S. adds an interesting layer, given the differing regulatory landscapes surrounding cryptocurrencies in these regions. Decoding DDC Enterprise’s Ambitious Bitcoin Accumulation Plan The scale of DDC Enterprise’s proposed Bitcoin accumulation – up to 5,000 BTC – is significant for a company of its presumed size, especially compared to smaller public companies that have made similar moves. The phased approach (21 initial, 100 short-term, 500 within 6 months, 5,000 over 3 years) allows flexibility. It suggests they are managing risk and adapting to market price fluctuations rather than making one massive lump-sum purchase. This strategy could involve buying on dips, setting specific price targets, or allocating a fixed amount of capital at regular intervals. The transparency in announcing these targets also provides insight into their long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Is This Institutional Bitcoin Investment a Sign of Things to Come? The term Institutional Bitcoin often brings to mind large asset managers, hedge funds, or major corporations like MicroStrategy. However, DDC Enterprise’s entry suggests that this trend might be filtering down to a wider range of public companies, including those outside the traditional finance or tech spheres. This could be a leading indicator of increasing mainstream corporate interest. For the cryptocurrency market, more corporate buyers, regardless of size, contribute to demand and potentially reduce the circulating supply available on exchanges, which could have long-term price implications. It also adds legitimacy and visibility to Bitcoin as a viable asset class for treasury management. Potential Benefits for DDC Enterprise Asset Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s price increases, the value of DDC’s holdings could significantly boost their balance sheet. Inflation Hedge: Protect the purchasing power of their treasury against potential fiat currency inflation. Market Attention: The move could attract investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. Future Flexibility: Potentially leverage BTC for future strategic initiatives or even customer payment options down the line. Potential Challenges and Risks Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which could negatively impact DDC’s reported earnings and balance sheet value in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, particularly complex for a company operating in both China and the U.S. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require companies to report Bitcoin as an intangible asset, potentially leading to impairment losses if the price drops below the purchase cost. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Actionable Insights For investors, DDC Enterprise’s move serves as another data point indicating growing corporate interest in Bitcoin. It underscores the potential for continued demand from non-traditional sources. While this specific purchase is small, the stated long-term goal is ambitious and worth monitoring. For other companies, DDC’s strategy provides an example of how a phased approach can be used to enter the crypto space, potentially mitigating some of the risks associated with volatility. It prompts questions about the role of digital assets in modern corporate treasury management. Conclusion DDC Enterprise’s initial BTC purchase marks a significant step in its stated plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation . As an e-commerce firm with international operations, their entry into the space highlights the expanding scope of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . While challenges remain, the strategic rationale behind such Institutional Bitcoin investments appears to be gaining traction beyond the usual suspects. The coming months will reveal how DDC’s phased approach unfolds and whether they meet their ambitious 500 BTC short-term target, providing further insight into the evolving relationship between traditional businesses and digital assets.

2025-05-24T07:30:34.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Soars Past $108,000: What’s Driving This Powerful Rally?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars Past $108,000: What’s Driving This Powerful Rally? Exciting times in the digital asset space! The Bitcoin price has just achieved a significant milestone, pushing past the $108,000 mark. This latest move is capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide, signaling strong momentum in the market. According to real-time monitoring data, the BTC price is currently trading around $108,009.99 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market, confirming the breakout above this key psychological and technical level. What’s Fueling This Latest Bitcoin Rally? When Bitcoin price makes such a decisive move, it’s rarely due to a single factor. A combination of elements typically contributes to a significant Bitcoin rally . Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone navigating the crypto market . Several potential catalysts are being discussed: Increased Institutional Interest: We continue to see growing adoption and investment from large financial institutions. Their entry often brings significant capital and lends credibility to the asset class, positively impacting the Bitcoin price . Positive Macroeconomic Signals: Shifting global economic conditions, inflation concerns, or changes in monetary policy can sometimes drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge. Technical Breakouts: Surpassing key resistance levels, like the recent $108,000 mark, can trigger automated trading systems and attract momentum traders, further propelling the price upwards. Supply Dynamics: Events like the recent Bitcoin halving reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, tightening supply over time if demand remains constant or increases. This fundamental scarcity is often cited as a long-term bullish factor for the BTC price . Improving Market Sentiment: Positive news cycles, favorable regulatory developments, or successful technological upgrades within the Bitcoin network can boost investor confidence and contribute to a positive Bitcoin rally . Analyzing the Current BTC Price Action: What Does $108,000 Mean? Breaking above $108,000 isn’t just a random number; it holds significance from a technical and psychological perspective. For traders and analysts, hitting or surpassing such a level can confirm upward trends and potentially set new targets. Let’s look at some aspects of this price movement: Historical Context: While $108,000 is a new high, understanding previous price cycles provides perspective. Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by periods of rapid growth followed by corrections. Each new peak builds on the foundation of prior cycles. Key Levels: Technical analysts watch specific price points. $108,000 likely acted as a short-term resistance level. Breaking it suggests the bulls are in control and could target higher levels next. Support would now likely be found at previous resistance levels. Volume Analysis: Often, a strong price move is accompanied by healthy trading volume. Increased volume during the breakout suggests strong conviction behind the move, rather than just a low-volume anomaly. Checking volume indicators provides further insight into the strength of the Bitcoin rally . Navigating the Crypto Market: Opportunities and Challenges A surging Bitcoin price naturally brings opportunities for those holding the asset. However, the crypto market is known for its volatility, and this rally is no exception. It’s important to consider both sides. Opportunities: Potential for Gains: For existing holders, a price increase translates directly into unrealized or realized profits. Increased Attention: Rallies attract new participants and capital to the market, potentially creating further upward pressure. Ecosystem Growth: A healthy BTC price often fuels development and innovation within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Sharp price increases can be followed by sudden pullbacks. The higher the price goes, the potentially larger the dollar value of price swings. Risk of FOMO: Fear Of Missing Out can lead to impulsive decisions, like buying at the peak without proper research. Market Corrections: Rallies are rarely linear. Expect pullbacks and corrections along the way. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? Actionable Insights In light of the recent Bitcoin rally and the BTC price reaching new highs, what steps should investors consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand why the price is moving. Look beyond the headlines at the underlying factors. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: The crypto market is high-risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Have a Plan: Whether you are buying, holding, or selling, have a strategy based on your financial goals and risk profile. Avoid making decisions based purely on emotion triggered by price movements. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying across different asset classes, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed: Keep up with reliable Bitcoin news and market analysis. Understanding the landscape helps you make better decisions. What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin News and the Market? Predicting future price movements in the crypto market is challenging, but the current momentum is undeniable. The breakout above $108,000 is a significant technical event. The focus will now likely shift to whether Bitcoin can consolidate above this level and target the next potential resistance zones. Factors to watch include: Continued institutional flows. Global regulatory developments. Technological advancements in the Bitcoin network. Overall macroeconomic environment. Sentiment shifts in the broader market. Reliable Bitcoin news sources will be key to staying updated on these developments. Conclusion: A Powerful Move in the Bitcoin Price The surge in Bitcoin price past the $108,000 threshold marks a significant moment in the current market cycle. Fueled by a confluence of factors including potential institutional adoption, favorable technical conditions, and supply dynamics, this Bitcoin rally demonstrates the continued strength and volatility inherent in the crypto market . While the excitement is palpable, investors are reminded to approach the market with caution, conduct thorough research, and manage risk effectively. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be dynamic, and reaching this new price point is a testament to its evolving position in the global financial landscape.

2025-05-24T07:26:17.000Z,"Bitcoin treasury companies will hold 'way more' than Bitcoiners expect: Exec","Moon Inc. head of Bitcoin strategy Jesse Myers says that Bitcoin holders are underestimating the significant amount of Bitcoin that corporations will accumulate by 2045. “Bitcoin Treasury Companies will hold 50% of all BTC, way more than most Bitcoiners are prepared for,” Jesse Myers said in a May 23 X thread. Strategy will own $70T of Bitcoin by 2025, says Myers Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker. Source: Jesse Myers Myers said, “To set the stage, there is $1,000T of asset value in the world.” He added that Bitcoin represents just 0.2% of that total amount. He explained that, since half of all capital in the world is essentially seeking the best store of value, more capital will “osmotically flow” into Bitcoin over time. “Over the last 2 years, an exodus from fiat assets (bonds and money) has already begun. Hard money assets (Bitcoin and gold) are where things are shifting,” he said. Source: Jesse Myers Myers said that there is around $318 trillion of capital in bonds “looking for greener pastures.” He said most of this capital is tied up in fixed-income institutional vehicles with “strict mandates.” “That’s where Bitcoin Treasury Companies come in,” Myers said. “Treasury Cos will be the primary bidders for BTC over the coming decades, deploying an ocean of SoV capital to BTC.” Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high, and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yet While Strategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, other treasury companies are starting to emerge. On April 24, Twenty One Capital formed, which is a Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is looking to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” According to Bitbo data, publicly traded and private companies, ETFs, and nation-states collectively hold 3.23 million BTC, valued at approximately $348.25 billion.

2025-05-24T07:20:12.000Z,"Bitcoin Options: Nasdaq PHLX Files Exciting SEC Proposal for Trading","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options: Nasdaq PHLX Files Exciting SEC Proposal for Trading Big news shaking up the world of digital assets and traditional finance! The potential for more sophisticated crypto trading just took a significant step forward. Nasdaq PHLX, a well-known options trading platform, has reportedly filed a proposed rule change with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Bitcoin options . This move, if approved, could open up new avenues for investors and traders looking to engage with Bitcoin in different ways. What Does This Nasdaq PHLX SEC Filing Mean? The core of the news is the SEC filing by Nasdaq PHLX . This isn’t just a casual inquiry; it’s a formal proposal submitted to the regulatory body that oversees securities markets in the United States. The filing seeks permission to list and trade options contracts based on a Bitcoin index. While the specific index wasn’t detailed in the initial report, the implication is clear: Nasdaq wants to bring regulated, exchange-traded options tied to Bitcoin’s price movements to its platform. Think of it this way: Nasdaq PHLX: A major, regulated options exchange. SEC Filing: A formal request to regulators for approval. Bitcoin Index Options: Derivatives contracts allowing traders to speculate on or hedge against the future price of Bitcoin, based on an underlying index value, without directly owning the Bitcoin itself. This development underscores the growing interest from established financial institutions in providing regulated access points to the cryptocurrency market. It’s a sign that major players see demand and potential in offering sophisticated products like Bitcoin options . Why Are Bitcoin Index Options Important for Crypto Trading? The introduction of regulated Bitcoin options on a platform like Nasdaq PHLX could be a game-changer for several reasons, primarily enhancing crypto trading strategies and market maturity. Potential Benefits Include: Hedging Opportunities: Investors holding Bitcoin could use options to protect against potential price declines. For example, buying put options could provide a form of insurance. Speculation: Traders can speculate on Bitcoin’s price direction with potentially less capital outlay compared to buying Bitcoin outright. Options offer leverage, meaning a small price movement in the underlying asset can result in a larger percentage gain (or loss) on the option contract. Income Generation: Sophisticated strategies like selling covered calls could allow Bitcoin holders to generate income from their existing positions. Price Discovery: Increased trading activity in a regulated environment can contribute to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin. Accessibility: Trading on a platform like Nasdaq PHLX might be more accessible or familiar to traditional finance participants compared to native crypto derivatives exchanges. These tools offer flexibility that simply buying and holding Bitcoin does not. They allow for more nuanced strategies tailored to different market outlooks and risk tolerances. Does This Filing Signal Increased Institutional Adoption? Absolutely. An SEC filing from a major exchange operator like Nasdaq PHLX is a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption interest. Large financial institutions, asset managers, and hedge funds often prefer to trade on regulated exchanges using familiar financial instruments like options. This provides them with: Regulatory Clarity: Trading on a regulated platform offers more legal and compliance certainty. Established Infrastructure: They can leverage existing trading systems and relationships with brokers and clearers. Risk Management Tools: Regulated options come with established clearing processes, reducing counterparty risk compared to some unregulated venues. Meeting Client Demand: As client interest in crypto grows, institutions need regulated ways to offer exposure. The move by Nasdaq PHLX suggests they see sufficient institutional demand to warrant the effort and cost of pursuing regulatory approval for Bitcoin options . This isn’t just about retail traders; it’s a significant step towards integrating Bitcoin into the broader financial ecosystem for large-scale participants. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the SEC Filing? While the filing is a positive step, approval from the SEC is not guaranteed. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, and the SEC has historically taken a cautious approach, particularly with products directly tied to cryptocurrencies. Potential Hurdles Include: Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators often worry about the potential for manipulation in the underlying spot Bitcoin market, which could impact the options market. Investor Protection: Ensuring that retail investors understand the risks associated with options trading, especially on a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Regulatory Framework: Determining how Bitcoin index options fit within existing securities regulations. Index Methodology: The SEC will likely scrutinize the methodology of the underlying Bitcoin index to ensure it is robust and resistant to manipulation. The approval process can be lengthy and involve public comment periods. It’s not uncommon for such filings to face questions or requests for more information from the SEC staff. The outcome will heavily depend on the SEC’s current stance on crypto-related financial products and whether Nasdaq PHLX can adequately address their concerns regarding market surveillance, liquidity, and investor protection. How Do Bitcoin Index Options Compare to Other Crypto Products? It’s helpful to understand how potential Bitcoin options on Nasdaq PHLX might fit into the existing landscape of crypto trading products. Here’s a quick comparison: Product Description Key Difference from Index Options Spot Bitcoin Direct ownership of Bitcoin. Requires full capital outlay, no leverage (unless margin trading), limited to price appreciation/depreciation. Options offer leverage and complex strategies. Bitcoin Futures Agreement to buy/sell Bitcoin at a future date/price. Obligation to buy/sell (for physical settlement) or cash settlement based on price difference. Options give the right , but not the obligation, to buy/sell. Options offer more flexible strategies (e.g., spreads, combinations). Bitcoin ETFs (Spot) Fund holding actual Bitcoin, traded on stock exchanges. Provides indirect exposure to spot price via shares. Options are derivatives offering leverage and hedging capabilities beyond simple price exposure. Bitcoin ETFs (Futures) Fund holding Bitcoin futures contracts. Provides exposure via futures, subject to roll costs. Options offer different risk/reward profiles and strategy flexibility. Index options, specifically, are cash-settled and based on the value of an index rather than the physical delivery of Bitcoin. This is typical for index options in traditional markets and simplifies the settlement process for large institutions. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors While this is still a proposal, the possibility of regulated Bitcoin options on Nasdaq PHLX offers potential insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on the SEC’s response to the filing. Regulatory approval timelines can be unpredictable. Educate Yourself on Options: If you’re new to options trading, now is a good time to learn the basics – calls, puts, strike prices, expiration dates, and key strategies. Options involve significant risk and are not suitable for all investors. Understand the Index: If approved, familiarize yourself with the specific Bitcoin index the options will track. How is it calculated? What exchanges does it source data from? Assess Your Strategy: Consider how regulated options might fit into your existing crypto trading or investment strategy, whether for hedging, speculation, or income. Institutional Watch: The progress of this filing is a key indicator for the pace of institutional adoption in the crypto space. This development highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto market and its increasing intersection with traditional finance. It reflects growing demand for diverse and regulated financial products tied to digital assets. Summary: A Milestone Filing for Bitcoin Options The filing by Nasdaq PHLX with the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin options is a significant development. It signals strong interest from a major exchange in expanding regulated crypto trading offerings. While regulatory approval is far from certain and potential challenges exist, this move represents another step towards greater institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset class. It could potentially provide traders and investors with powerful new tools for hedging, speculation, and income generation within a familiar, regulated framework. The market will be watching closely to see how the SEC responds to this important proposal.

2025-05-24T07:10:42.000Z,"Corporate Bitcoin Demand Soars: Buys Triple New Supply in 2025","BitcoinWorld Corporate Bitcoin Demand Soars: Buys Triple New Supply in 2025 The world of finance is buzzing with a significant trend: Corporate Bitcoin Demand is not just growing; it’s exploding. According to a compelling observation by Bradley Duke, Head of Europe at Bitwise Asset Management, publicly reported Bitcoin purchases by listed companies in 2025 have already reached an astonishing level, tripling the amount of New Bitcoin Supply generated through mining so far this year. Why is Corporate Bitcoin Demand Skyrocketing? This dramatic statistic, shared by the Bitwise executive on social media platform X, paints a clear picture: institutions and corporations are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. While the exact reasons vary, several key drivers are pushing companies towards the premier cryptocurrency: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unpredictable economic policies and potential currency devaluation, Bitcoin is seen by many corporations as a robust store of value, similar to digital gold. Balance Sheet Diversification: Holding a portion of corporate reserves in Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and assets. Long-Term Value Proposition: Companies are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term appreciating asset, driven by its fixed supply and growing network effects. Investor and Shareholder Interest: Some companies may also be responding to growing interest from investors who see Bitcoin exposure as a positive sign. It’s crucial to note the caveat mentioned by Duke: this figure strictly accounts for disclosed acquisitions by publicly traded firms. Purchases made by privately held corporations, sovereign wealth funds, or other large private entities are not included in this calculation, suggesting the actual total Corporate Bitcoin Demand could be considerably higher. The Scarcity Factor: Demand vs. New Bitcoin Supply The significance of corporate buys tripling the New Bitcoin Supply cannot be overstated. Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition is rooted in its scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, the creation of new Bitcoin is governed by a predetermined, algorithmic schedule known as BTC Mining . Approximately every ten minutes, a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain, and miners who successfully add a block are rewarded with newly minted BTC. However, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created is halved roughly every four years in an event called the ‘Halving’. The most recent Halving occurred in April 2024, significantly reducing the daily issuance of new BTC. This means the available New Bitcoin Supply entering the market each day is now considerably lower than in previous cycles. When you combine this reduced supply from BTC Mining with surging demand, particularly from large-scale corporate buyers, you create a powerful supply shock dynamic. These large purchases absorb the limited new supply entering the market, potentially putting upward pressure on the price, assuming other market factors remain constant or are also positive. Understanding Bitcoin Institutional Adoption The statistic shared by the Bitwise executive is a clear indicator of deepening Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . While early Bitcoin cycles were primarily driven by retail investors and enthusiasts, recent years have seen a marked increase in interest and investment from major financial institutions, asset managers, and corporations. Key catalysts for this surge in Bitcoin Institutional Adoption include: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, have provided a regulated, accessible, and familiar investment vehicle for institutions and corporations. These ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or security. Improved Custody Solutions: The development of robust and secure institutional-grade custody solutions has alleviated concerns about storing and protecting large amounts of Bitcoin. Increased Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies is becoming clearer in many parts of the world, providing institutions with more confidence to enter the market. Peer Effect: As more high-profile companies and institutions disclose their Bitcoin holdings or involvement, others may feel compelled to explore similar strategies to remain competitive or appealing to investors. Companies like MicroStrategy have been pioneers in adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, a strategy that has proven highly successful and has likely inspired others. The trend highlighted by Bitwise suggests this is not an isolated phenomenon but a growing corporate movement. The Role of BTC Mining in the Supply Equation While Corporate Bitcoin Demand represents the significant inflow side of the equation, BTC Mining represents the supply side. Miners perform the crucial function of validating transactions and securing the network, and their reward (the block subsidy plus transaction fees) is their incentive. The Halving mechanism ensures that the issuance rate of new Bitcoin decreases over time, making it an increasingly scarce asset. The fact that disclosed corporate purchases alone are three times the amount of BTC mined in 2025 illustrates the immense buying pressure relative to the natural supply creation rate. This dynamic fundamentally shifts the supply/demand balance compared to earlier periods when mining output represented a larger portion of available sell-side pressure. Insights from Bitwise and Future Outlook Bradley Duke’s observation from Bitwise serves as a crucial data point underscoring the evolving market structure for Bitcoin. It suggests that institutional and corporate treasuries are becoming significant accumulators of BTC, potentially absorbing much of the new supply as well as liquidity from the open market. What does this mean for the future? Continued strong Corporate Bitcoin Demand , coupled with the constrained New Bitcoin Supply from BTC Mining post-Halving, could act as a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin’s price in the long term. It signals a maturation of the asset class and its increasing acceptance within traditional financial frameworks through Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges, such as market volatility, macroeconomic shifts, and unforeseen regulatory actions that could impact corporate strategies. Nevertheless, the trend highlighted by Bitwise is a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era of Bitcoin Accumulation The statistic shared by the Bitwise executive is a powerful testament to the current state of the Bitcoin market. Corporate Bitcoin Demand in 2025 is significantly outpacing the rate at which new coins are being mined, highlighting robust Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . This dynamic of high demand meeting limited New Bitcoin Supply from BTC Mining creates a compelling environment for Bitcoin’s future price discovery. As more corporations and institutions follow this trend, the foundational support for Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class continues to strengthen, marking a new era of institutional accumulation.

2025-05-24T07:07:14.000Z,"Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth more than $1.25B","Arkham Intelligence says Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings are valued at over $1.25 billion. With these holdings, the Elon Musk-led automaker and Musk himself have firmly established their status as committed HODLers of the leading cryptocurrency. In an X post , Arkham Intelligence revealed that the electric car manufacturer has $1,257,345,294.56 worth of Bitcoin, roughly 11900 BTC. Tesla now holds over $1.25 Billion of BTC. Elon Musk is bullish on Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/rNbzOP1QPJ — Arkham (@arkham) May 23, 2025 Tesla sold part of its BTC holdings in 2022 Tesla first announced its Bitcoin investment in Q1 2021. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2021, the automotive company disclosed that it had invested around $1.5 billion to purchase 43,200 BTC and intended to incorporate Bitcoin into its payment system. Shortly after, the firm began accepting BTC payments for vehicle purchases before halting the option in May 2021. However, the suspension led to a more than 10% drop in Bitcoin’s value and Tesla’s stock price decline. Musk claimed they were obliged to halt BTC payments over concerns about the increasing reliance on fossil fuels, particularly coal, for Bitcoin mining and transactions. He argued that crypto investments have great potential; they shouldn’t come at the expense of the environment. However, skeptics suggested that the billionaire’s decision was just another attempt to influence the crypto market. In Q2 2022, the car manufacturing firm also sold about 75% of its Bitcoin holdings, valued at $936 million, remaining with only 9,720 BTC. Nonetheless, Musk clarified that their decision to sell their holdings had nothing to do with the asset’s market performance but rather the firm’s need for cash. Since then, Tesla has added more BTC to its portfolio, holding roughly 11,900 BTC worth $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, the crypto community began speculating that Musk’s X Money will incorporate Bitcoin after Tesla’s Q4 2024 net income increased to $600 million due to crypto. Metaplanet and Strategy are still growing their BTC holdings Multiple firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin holdings. For instance, Strategy holds 576,230 BTC, with its most recent purchas e on May 19, when it acquired 7,390 BTC for $764.9 million. Metaplanet is on pace to reach its target of holding 10,000 BTC, being only a little over 2,000 coins short. So far, the firm has 7,800 BTC. The firm’s stock, 3350.T, also soared 15% after the company recently purchased 1,004 BTC. Aside from corporations investing in BTC, there is growing interest in the US among certain states in integrating Bitcoin reserves, especially after Donald Trump took office. More than 25 states have proposed bills in favor of Bitcoin reserve legislation, with Texas and New Hampshire among the first to pass their bills. However, Arizona’s Governor, Katie Hobbs, recently rejected two crypto reserve bills after Florida dropped discussions on their bills. Nevertheless, there are still 13 active crypto bills at the federal level, which, if passed, could promote Bitcoin integration and establish a Bitcoin reserve. President Donald Trump named five cryptocurrencies for his proposed strategic reserve at the start of the month. His list included Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. His announcement did stir the crypto market, with Caradona surging by over 70%, Solana by 20%, and XRP by 30%. Bitcoin and Ethereum also saw a rise in market value, jumping by over 10%. Trump has consistently insisted that a digital asset reserve would elevate the country, reduce inflation, and build the crypto industry. In one of his Truth Social posts, he commented, “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.

2025-05-24T07:04:57.000Z,"Market Meltdown and Recession Incoming, Warns Former BlackRock Fund Manager Edward Dowd","A former BlackRock fund manager just issued a major warning on the US economy. In a new interview on Market Disruptors, Edward Dowd forecasts an incoming recession and market meltdown driven in part by a housing crisis and a bursting AI bubble. Dowd points to collapsing new home permits since 2022 and falling tenant rents as early signs of a housing crash. He also warns that government spending cuts and a slowdown in illegal immigration will sap economic growth, with stock markets facing a potential 50% drop based on historical patterns. “The idea here is you have a recession that we think manifests itself pretty soon, and the stock markets bottom sometime in the first quarter of 2026. Then you have a recovery, that’s the ideal situation… We’re not claiming anything’s going to go systemic. We’re not doom and gloom. It’s just we think it’s an old-fashioned deep recession and hopefully it’s quick. Typically speaking in recessions like in the dot-com recession and the great financial crisis, stocks went down 50% before they recovered, so we’re nowhere near down 50% yet and we think that’s coming.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from its all-time high of 45,073 in December of 2024 to a low of 38,314 last month, registering a 15% decline. Dowd traces the crisis to a global debt problem, temporarily masked by COVID-era money printing and spending, with commercial real estate and rising auto loan delinquencies signaling a broader credit crunch. In the long run, he expects deflationary pressures to force the Federal Reserve to slash rates and print money. For protection, Dowd advocates holding cash, pointing to Berkshire Hathaway’s massive position in T-bills/bonds, as well as physical gold, while cautioning against Bitcoin’s volatility and historic correlation with risk assets.

2025-05-24T07:03:32.000Z,"Crypto Bulls Lose $500M as Bitcoin Hovers Around $108K After Trump’s Tariff Threats","Bullish crypto bets lost over $500 million in the past 24 hours as traders took profits and markets slid following President Donald Trump’s fresh threats of tariffs on European imports and Apple products, sparking a wave of liquidations. Bitcoin, which had been trading above $111,000, dropped quickly to around $108,600, wiping out intraday gains and rattling broader market sentiment. BTC’s drop was mirrored across the crypto complex, with futures tracking ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) showing losses from $30 million to over $100 million. Bitcoin futures saw roughly $181 million in losses, while Ether futures accounted for nearly $142 million. Altcoins added another $100 million in liquidations, including notable wipeouts in SOL, DOGE, and XRP. pic The largest single liquidation was a $9.53 million BTC-USDT swap on OKX, CoinGlass data shows. A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment. The pullback arrived just as bitcoin was gaining momentum on ETF inflows and growing institutional interest, leading some to expect a calm weekend. Instead, volatility returned in full force. With the macro environment now destabilized by renewed trade war fears, traders may remain cautious heading into next week’s sessions.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/24/crypto-bulls-lose-500m-as-bitcoin-hovers-around-108k-after-trumps-tariff-threats,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T07:00:39.000Z,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Urgent Shift to Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Urgent Shift to Greed Zone Are you keeping a pulse on the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies? Understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial, and one popular tool for this is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . This index offers a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly optimistic (greed) or overly cautious (fear). Recently, we’ve seen a notable shift that every investor should pay attention to. What Does the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Tell Us? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me, serves as a barometer for crypto market sentiment . It aggregates data from various sources to assign a score between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). Think of it as a quick way to gauge the prevailing emotional state driving market decisions. A score closer to 0 suggests that investors are highly fearful, often indicating potential buying opportunities according to contrarian investment principles. Conversely, a score closer to 100 signals extreme greed, which can sometimes precede a market correction as assets may be overvalued. As of May 24th, the index registered 66, a decrease of 12 points from the previous day. This movement caused the index to transition from the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (typically above 75) into the ‘Greed’ zone (55-75). While still indicating positive sentiment, this drop signifies a cooling off from the recent peak. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a single factor but is a composite score derived from six key market indicators. Understanding these components helps demystify how the index arrives at its score and what forces are influencing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): This measures the current crypto volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility in an upward trend can signal a greedy market, while high volatility during a downturn points to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component looks at the current volume and market momentum compared to average values. High buying volume in a positive market trend suggests a greedy market. Social Media (15%): Analyzes social media sentiment using algorithms that scan posts and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. High levels of positive or overly excited posts can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by Alternative.me, historically this involved weekly polls asking users about their market perspective. (Note: The weight of this factor might be distributed among others when surveys are not active). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks the market capitalization share of Bitcoin compared to the total crypto market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be moving funds from altcoins back into the perceived relative safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal increasing greed or confidence, as funds flow into riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google search data for cryptocurrency-related terms. A surge in search queries for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ often indicates fear, while terms like ‘buy Bitcoin’ can signal increasing public interest and potential greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. Understanding the Shift: From Extreme Greed to Greed The move from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ isn’t necessarily a bearish signal, but rather a moderation of sentiment. The ‘Extreme Greed’ zone (75-100) is often seen as a potential warning sign for a pullback, as it suggests the market might be overheating. A score in the ‘Greed’ zone (55-75) still indicates positive sentiment and buying pressure, but without the same level of potential irrational exuberance seen in the higher range. This shift could be attributed to various factors, including minor price pullbacks, changing news cycles, or simply a natural ebb and flow of market psychology after a period of rapid gains. It’s a reminder that even in bullish phases, market sentiment is rarely static. How Does This Impact Your Investing Strategy? For many traders and investors, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t be the only one. It’s best used as a complementary indicator within a broader investing strategy . Some investors use the index as a contrarian signal: buying when the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (indicating potential undervaluation) and selling or taking profits when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (indicating potential overvaluation). The current shift to ‘Greed’ might lead some to become more cautious or consider adjusting their positions, while others might see it as a healthy consolidation phase before further upward movement. Consider how the index reading aligns with other technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and overall market conditions. For example, pairing the index with an analysis of crypto volatility or recent trends in Bitcoin dominance can provide a more complete picture. Challenges and Considerations While useful, the index has limitations. It’s based on publicly available data and algorithms, which may not capture all market nuances. Sentiment can change rapidly, and the index is a lagging indicator to some extent. Furthermore, relying solely on this index without considering other factors or having a well-defined investing strategy is risky. The index is primarily focused on Bitcoin sentiment, although it reflects the broader crypto market to a significant degree due to Bitcoin’s influence (reflected in the Bitcoin dominance factor). However, altcoin-specific sentiment might differ. Conclusion: Navigating Market Sentiment The recent drop in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from ‘Extreme Greed’ to ‘Greed’ signals a moderation in market enthusiasm. While still positive, this shift is a timely reminder for investors to stay vigilant and base their decisions on more than just emotion. By understanding the factors that influence the index – including crypto volatility , momentum, social sentiment, and Bitcoin dominance – and integrating this knowledge into a robust investing strategy , market participants can better navigate the complexities of the crypto landscape.

2025-05-24T07:00:32.000Z,"Stocks Tick Downward As Trump Proposes 50% Tariff on the European Union and 25% Tariff on Apple’s iPhones","The US stock market is seeing a slight downturn as President Donald Trump proposes a new round of tariffs on the European Union (EU) and tech giant Apple. In a new post on Truth Social, Trump says that he’s going to recommend a hefty tax on EU goods starting June 1st due to their unfair economic practices and unwillingness to negotiate. “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on TRADE, has been very difficult to deal with. Their powerful trade barriers, VAT taxes, ridiculous corporate penalties, non-monetary trade barriers, monetary manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans companies, and more, have led to a trade deficit with the US of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable. Our discussions with them are going nowhere! Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1st, 2025. There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Regarding Apple, Trump says that he’s imposing tariffs on the tech giant until the firm relocates its manufacturing base to the US. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” News of the new tariff recommendations caused US stock markets as well as Apple stocks to pull back. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw dips of 0.67% and 1%, respectively, and Apple shares fell 3%.

2025-05-24T06:50:37.000Z,"Explosive Spot Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume Exceeds $4.5B on May 23","BitcoinWorld Explosive Spot Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume Exceeds $4.5B on May 23 Were you watching the markets on May 23? If so, you might have noticed something significant happening with Spot Bitcoin ETF products. These investment vehicles, which offer investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin without requiring them to directly hold the cryptocurrency, saw an extraordinary surge in activity. This isn’t just a minor blip; the total Bitcoin ETF trading volume for the day was truly remarkable, hitting a figure that underscores growing market participation. What Triggered This Impressive Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume? According to data shared by Watcher Guru on X, the cumulative trading volume across all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs on May 23 exceeded a staggering $4.5 billion. This figure represents a significant uptick in activity and is a key indicator of the current sentiment surrounding BTC ETF products and the broader crypto market. But what factors might have contributed to such a high volume on this particular day? Several elements could be at play: Market Momentum: Bitcoin’s price movement leading up to and on May 23 likely played a crucial role. Positive price action often correlates with increased investor interest and trading activity in related investment products like ETFs. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or shifts in investor risk appetite can drive capital towards or away from assets like Bitcoin, influencing ETF volumes. News and Developments: Specific news related to regulations, institutional adoption, or technological advancements within the crypto space can spur trading. Rebalancing and Flows: Large institutional players might have been rebalancing portfolios or executing significant buy/sell orders, contributing to the high volume. Understanding the context of this volume requires looking at the overall market environment at the time. Was Bitcoin experiencing significant volatility? Were there major announcements from asset managers or regulators? These external factors are often intertwined with the trading patterns observed in ETFs. Why Does High Spot Bitcoin ETF Volume Matter for Crypto Investment? The volume seen on May 23 is more than just a number; it carries significant implications for the market. High trading volume generally indicates strong liquidity and robust interest. For crypto investment , particularly through regulated products like ETFs, this is a positive sign. Here’s why it’s important: Liquidity: High volume means it’s easier for large buyers and sellers to trade shares without significantly impacting the price. This makes the ETF market more efficient and attractive, especially for institutional players. Institutional Interest: A substantial portion of this volume likely comes from institutional investors – hedge funds, asset managers, and financial advisors – who are increasingly comfortable using ETFs to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This points towards growing institutional crypto adoption. Market Validation: High trading volume validates the demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure and reinforces the role of ETFs as a primary gateway for traditional finance participants entering the crypto space. Price Discovery: Active trading in ETFs contributes to the overall price discovery mechanism for Bitcoin, as large flows can influence spot market prices. Think of it this way: the higher the volume, the more capital is flowing into or out of these regulated Bitcoin products, providing clearer signals about market demand from traditional investment channels. Who Are the Key Players in the BTC ETF Space? While the original snippet provides a total volume, it’s worth noting which ETFs typically contribute the most to the overall Spot Bitcoin ETF trading volume. Since their launch in January 2024, several funds have emerged as leaders. Prominent examples include: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT): Has consistently seen high inflows and trading volume. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): Another major player attracting significant investment. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): Although it started as a trust and converted to an ETF, it holds a large amount of Bitcoin and sees substantial trading volume, often related to outflows as investors switch to newer, lower-fee options. Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): Also holds a notable share of the market. The competition among these funds, particularly regarding management fees and performance, also influences where the volume flows. Investors often compare these options based on costs, liquidity, and the reputation of the issuing firm. How Does This Volume Compare Historically? To fully appreciate the $4.5 billion+ figure, it’s helpful to compare it to previous trading days or weeks. While this wasn’t necessarily an all-time record volume day (which were often seen shortly after the ETFs launched), it represents a strong level of sustained interest. Days with volume exceeding several billion dollars indicate periods of heightened activity, often coinciding with significant price movements or market events. Looking at historical data for Bitcoin ETF trading volume helps us understand trends. Are volumes increasing over time? Are they becoming less volatile? Consistent, high volume suggests maturation of the market and increasing integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Investing via a Spot Bitcoin ETF? The high trading volume on May 23 highlights the popularity of this investment method. But what are the pros and cons? Benefits: Accessibility: Easily tradable on traditional stock exchanges through brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection compared to some direct crypto exchanges. No Custody Hassle: Investors don’t need to worry about setting up wallets, managing private keys, or securing their Bitcoin directly. Liquidity: High trading volume ensures you can typically buy or sell shares easily. Familiarity: ETFs are a well-understood investment product for traditional investors. Challenges: Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) that can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror Bitcoin’s price due to fees, operational costs, and tracking methods. Not Your Keys: You own shares in a fund that holds Bitcoin, not the Bitcoin itself. This goes against the core crypto principle of self-custody. Market Volatility: While the ETF structure is familiar, the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is highly volatile, meaning the ETF price can experience significant swings. Despite the challenges, the significant volume indicates that for many investors, particularly institutions, the benefits of accessibility and regulatory clarity offered by a BTC ETF outweigh the drawbacks. What Does This High Volume Suggest for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent, and at times surging, volume in spot Bitcoin ETFs is perhaps the strongest signal yet of increasing institutional crypto adoption. Institutions require regulated, familiar, and liquid pathways to invest in new asset classes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide exactly that. The willingness of large funds and wealth managers to allocate capital through these products suggests a shift in perspective. Bitcoin is moving from being seen purely as a speculative retail asset to a legitimate, albeit volatile, component of diversified portfolios. This trend is likely to continue as more data becomes available and confidence in the regulatory framework grows. Actionable Insights for Investors For individuals interested in crypto investment , the high volume in spot Bitcoin ETFs offers several insights: Monitor Volume: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF volumes as an indicator of overall market demand, especially from larger players. Understand the Gateway: Recognize that ETFs are a primary way traditional finance interacts with Bitcoin. Their activity can influence the spot market. Evaluate Your Options: If considering Bitcoin exposure, compare direct ownership vs. ETF investment based on your comfort with technology, security, and fees. Stay Informed: Follow news related to ETF flows, regulatory changes, and the performance of the major funds. The $4.5 billion+ day on May 23 wasn’t just a random event; it was a data point reinforcing the growing integration of Bitcoin into the mainstream financial system via regulated products like ETFs. Conclusion: The Expanding Footprint of Spot Bitcoin ETFs The significant Bitcoin ETF trading volume exceeding $4.5 billion on May 23 serves as a compelling indicator of the robust and growing interest in regulated Bitcoin exposure. This high volume reflects strong liquidity, increasing institutional crypto participation, and the successful integration of Spot Bitcoin ETF products into traditional investment frameworks. As more investors, both retail and institutional, utilize these vehicles for crypto investment , the BTC ETF market is poised to play an even more critical role in the overall health and development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The trend points towards continued maturation and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class.

2025-05-24T06:48:46.000Z,"Dogecoin, Cardano’s ADA, XRP Fall 7% in Weekend Bloodbath","The crypto market turned red over the weekend, with Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano’s ADA, and XRP each dropping over 7% as profit-taking set in after a strong week. Bitcoin fell from a daily high of $111,200 to just over $107,000 on Friday, causing a swift change in sentiment. The drop came as President Donald Trump revived fears of a tariff war with the European Union — threatening a 50% levy as talks were “going nowhere.” Market cap shed 5% and the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, fell 2.2% as traders moved to lock in gains amid rising volatility. The move comes despite bitcoin touching fresh highs above $111,500 just days earlier, with ETF inflows, stablecoin legislation, and institutional buying supporting its rally. But those same tailwinds haven’t kept altcoins afloat in the short term. “Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high also carries altcoins toward a bullish direction,” said Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of HashKey Group, said in a Telegram message. “But if BTC’s volatility picks up again, traders may rotate into regulated stablecoins — especially with new frameworks in the U.S. and Hong Kong easing that transition.” Alex Kuptsikevich, chief analyst at FxPro, crypto sentiment recently hit levels last seen in January, just as BTC and ETH reached critical resistance zones. “Unlike previous BTCUSD rallies, the current movement is not just momentum-driven but backed by real demand and macro factors,” he noted. Still, markets are showing signs of fatigue. Ethereum is struggling to break past its 200-day moving average near $2,650, while altcoins that previously surged — such as HYPE and EIGEN — are now cooling off after double-digit gains. Analysts warn that if BTC doesn’t establish a new support zone, altcoin losses could deepen.

2025-05-24T06:45:31.000Z,"Tariff Tensions Return: Trump’s Trade Threats Rattle Bitcoin and Markets After New ATH","The crypto world had just begun to recover from the market’s deep and prolonged Bitcoin winter when the scene shifted once again to Washington, D.C. You could even say that as the Bitcoin ball kept rolling downhill—past $17,000, $18,000, and even $19,000—the excitement and participation level of the crypto space kept rising. At the same time, the crypto-killer ice storms of 2014 and 2018 seemed to be occurring further in the past than they really were. And then came late May 2019. The fresh dangers encompass a far-reaching 50% duty on all merchandise coming in from the European Union and a sharp 25% tax on imports that targets Apple directly if the company maintains its current course of building iPhones anywhere but in the U.S. Tariffs Target EU and Apple Amid Trade Frustration The announcement from President Trump was accompanied by some very sharp criticism of both the trade policies of Europe and of Apple’s global supply chain strategy. Expressing what he saw as frustrations with the negotiating process—specifically, he called the negotiations “stalled”—Trump made it very clear that unless things in trade talks started to improve, we could expect to see the proposed tariffs go into effect on June 1. One of the most valuable and famous companies in America, Apple, found itself in the political crosshairs. The tech giant was directly cited by Trump for moving much of its iPhone production to India, an American company in an American-style business move. Apple made this move to diversify its manufacturing base and reduce dependence on China, not in deference to any foreign government. The president warned, however, that unless Apple got the message and began relocating more of its production back to U.S. soil, it would face a 25 percent tariff on devices made overseas. Trump stated in a press release that the tariffs impose a balance and fairness to trade. He asserted that they are about bringing manufacturing to America and defending American workers. Although Trump’s rhetoric has always concentrated on the theme of economic nationalism, the sudden appearance and the sheer scale of these new threats caught lots of folks off guard. And it struck that way for a couple of reasons. First, the rhetoric had just recently begun to cool down, and we were in the middle of a global economic outlook conference when Trump poured fresh fuel on the fire. Crypto Markets React Swiftly to Tariff Uncertainty The immediate and intense effect on financial markets was evident. Bitcoin had only recently attained a new all-time high of $112,000, but in the blink of an eye, it lost more than 3%, with some brave (or foolish) souls even forecasting a price as low as $107,600. Analysts blamed the uncertainty unleashed by the tariff threat. The S&P 500 also slipped, and tech stocks took a notable hit in the aftermath of the announcement. Traders are becoming more uneasy about the unpredictable nature of U.S. tariff policies, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and investor confidence. Just a day after Bitcoin's new $112K all-time high was established, tariff drama was quickly brought back on to the menu and has temporarily spoiled the crypto party. President Trump has announced two new major tariff threats as the U.S. heads into Memorial Day weekend: … pic.twitter.com/6hgdBqGY6r — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 23, 2025 A crypto analyst said, “This is classic FUD,” referencing the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that often drives sharp market reactions. “Just as things were stabilizing post-China tensions, we’re right back to uncertainty. People are hesitant to make bold moves right now. Many are simply holding and hoping for clarity.” The atmosphere today mirrors the worries evident in early April, when surging trade tensions made the cryptocurrency markets uneasy. From April 7 to 9, crypto traders experienced significant volatility as it was predominantly the talk of tariffs that was lighting up the headlines. This latest round of threats seems to have revived that same anxiety uptrend. A Cautious Outlook Heading Into June With the June 1st deadline for tariffs fast approaching, markets will likely continue to be on edge. Investors and traders in virtually all sectors are now battening down the hatches for what is expected to be a pretty significant volatility spike, especially if the U.S.-EU trade talks don’t manage to get off the ground. If the talks do fail, that also opens the door for Apple to become the next poster child for the administration’s punitive tariff policy, a scenario that would truly rock the global tech supply chain. For traders in cryptocurrency, this situation reveals the larger truth that digital assets are not protected from the kinds of seismic macroeconomic shifts that can happen to any nation or region. Altogether, decentralized by design, the crypto market is more connected to the global financial system—and to the political decisions that impact the health of that system—than it often seems. The dust is settling, and the weekend is approaching; the mood that followed Bitcoin’s ATH has shifted to cautious optimism. The exuberance that came with this year’s all-time high for Bitcoin seems likely to continue only as long as the political and economic conditions that produced it remain unchanged.

2025-05-24T06:42:55.000Z,"BNB Chain Shows Resilience Amid Price Pressure, Institutional Optimism","This week, the price of BNB has been performing disappointingly, but the ecosystem is showing strong fundamentals and moving forward with development. BNB Chain has encountered setbacks but is making major progress, painting a complex, but overall optimistic, picture for BNB Chain—a principal Layer 1 blockchain in the market. Recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and institutional reinforcement mean that BNB Chain has advanced — seems to be advancing — even if that elevation hasn’t yet shown itself in the token’s price and market capitalization. BNB Price Dips Slightly as Bitcoin Dominance Weighs on Altcoins This week, the total market cap of the BNB Chain ecosystem saw a slight dip, falling 1.4% to just over $7 billion. BNB itself shed some weight, falling to just under $280 and holding a market valuation of about $91.8 billion as of Friday afternoon. This week, the decline of the BNB Chain ecosystem is a direct effect of the rising tide earlier in the week of Bitcoin. Short-term weaknesses notwithstanding, BNB Chain’s monthly performance still reveals a very healthy 15.7% gain that shows a longer-term uptrend. “Greed” is presently the market sentiment for Bitcoin, indicating that investors are generally optimistic about the leading cryptocurrency. Trading across the altcoin market has remained muted in recent days, with BNB and other altcoins seeing paltry volumes, as the market patiently awaits more significant Bitcoin price action. BNB price pullbacks look to be not so much about weakness in the chain but more about macro trends. All eyes are on Bitcoin, and as it goes, many altcoins are barely hanging on by a thread. This seems to be the case with BNB, which has actually flipped bullish on the BTC pair, but then again, that’s the kind of dynamic that too many altcoins are struggling with these days. DeFi Thrives: PancakeSwap V3 and Ecosystem Metrics Surge The price of BNB can be unstable, yet the DeFi infrastructure based on it seems to be thriving. This week, the leading decentralized exchange on BNB Chain, PancakeSwap, gave us a prominent metric to look at. It had a trading volume that surged by an unbelievable 152% from the week prior. What this looks at kind of at a top layer is: this is one of the major platforms on BNB Chain. It’s an interface through which a lot of folks are accessing the chain’s DeFi infrastructure. So to see it doing 152% better, that is quite an eyepopper. Increased activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the BNB Chain is offsetting a minor decrease in the total value locked (TVL) in the network’s DeFi protocols. The DEX week-over-week activity metric is up 81%, which is substantial and suggests that user preference is shifting to DEXs. In the DeFi layer of the BNB Chain, even with this small downturn of 2.4%, the total value locked (TVL) today is still the third-largest amount among all Layer 1 blockchains. Week in BNB Chain: Weak Price Performance, Fundamental Strength. PancakeSwap V3 volume surges 152%! Wello launches global PayFi app! Standard Chartered forecasts BNB at $1,275 by year-end! Let's examine BNB Chain's mixed signals this week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/Pf7JBFNTaR — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 22, 2025 The Platform Update The BNB Chain’s transaction costs are very low, and that’s a big part of the chain’s appeal. Right now, the average transaction cost is just $0.06. That’s about as low as it gets. And for those who want to do business on the BNB Chain, that’s a very nice price. Wello Launch and Institutional Confidence Paint a Bright Future Apart from DeFi, BNB Chain witnessed a notable development in the payments sector with the worldwide unveiling of Wello PayFi. The platform allows for rapid, inexpensive cross-border payments and plays nicely with Apple Pay, Visa, and more than 120 fiat onramps. Wello merges the decentralized security of blockchain with the user-friendly centralization necessary for mass adoption. This makes it a potentially huge player in the global remittance market. This product launch is the real-world adoption step for BNB Chain; it shows that BNB Chain can do what we really want — impact the world with user-facing financial applications. And it isn’t just a narrative; it shows that BNB Chain isn’t just a DeFi playground. It’s positioning itself as a viable full-stack blockchain ecosystem. Possibly the most encouraging aspect is the long-term look from institutions. Analysts at Standard Chartered are giving a very bullish forecast for BNB. They see it reaching $1,275 by the end of 2025, which would be a gain of more than 300% from current levels. Their report cites ongoing ecosystem growth and rising adoption as the main reasons they are confident in BNB’s future. Conclusion This week saw a slight drop in price, but the BNB Chain remains durable and full of potential. Surge in DEX Activity A group of 40 decentralized exchanges launched a global app on the same day. Bullish Institutional Sentiment Last week, news broke that the BNB Chain raised $3 billion in fresh capital from more than 100 institutional investors. Price Stability Stable growth in the Bitcoin dominance number suggests that BNB has a good chance of recapturing the kind of sustained price growth that rewards dollar-cost-averaging investors.

2025-05-24T06:41:06.000Z,"XRP Might Not Make It Into the U.S. Crypto Reserve? Here’s Expert Opinion","A recent X post by Coin Bureau has drawn attention to the political dynamics surrounding XRP and its exclusion from recent U.S. policy considerations related to cryptocurrency reserves. According to the post , Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known supporter of digital assets and head of the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee, recently canceled a meeting with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse without public explanation. This development has triggered concerns about the senator’s impartiality toward different crypto projects, specifically regarding XRP. Allegations of Personal Bias in Policy Decisions Coin Bureau highlighted that the XRP community discovered online activity by Lummis’s son-in-law, Will Cole, which appears to reveal a strong negative stance toward both Ripple and its associated digital asset. Cole reportedly reposted content describing XRP as a “fake token” and referring to Ripple as a “centralized joke of a scam.” The resurfacing of these statements has raised questions about whether personal bias might influence Lummis’s decisions on digital asset policy. Preference for Bitcoin in U.S. Reserve Discussions This scrutiny is especially relevant given Lummis’s prominent role in pushing the creation of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The proposal, which originated from her 2024 legislative initiative, included a clear emphasis on Bitcoin as the digital asset of choice for national strategic interests. Coin Bureau emphasized that such alignment with Bitcoin may be viewed by critics as favoritism that sidelines other projects, including XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coin Bureau also noted that speculation about XRP being considered for inclusion in the reserve had previously been fueled by a post on Truth Social attributed to Donald Trump. In that post, several major cryptocurrencies were mentioned —namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. However, when the formal executive order was later released, only Bitcoin was referenced, with no mention of XRP or any other altcoin. This omission has led many to question whether XRP is being deliberately excluded. Regulatory Delays and Legal Uncertainty Weigh on XRP The tweet also addressed the broader institutional hurdles XRP faces in the United States. Among them are ongoing delays in the approval of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Applications from entities such as 21Shares and Grayscale remain unapproved, with some analysts suggesting that approval might not come until later in the year. These regulatory delays further complicate the possibility of XRP gaining official recognition or integration into federal crypto strategies. Coin Bureau concluded that XRP’s chances of being included in any future U.S. crypto reserve currently appear low. The combination of unresolved legal matters, ETF approval obstacles, and now indications of political and personal bias contributes to a challenging environment for XRP in U.S. regulatory and strategic circles.

2025-05-24T06:38:04.000Z,"Strategy Taps Markets for $2.1 Billion in Preferred Shares to Expand Bitcoin Holdings","In a major move that deepens its commitment to digital assets, Strategy has announced the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in Series A perpetual preferred stock. The company intends to put the money to work expanding its Bitcoin holdings and fortifying its investment operations. The news underlines what now seems an unstoppable path for Bitcoin to financial respectability and highlights an increasingly aggressive push by Strategy into the digital finance arena. The recently issued shares, trading under the symbol STRF, opened for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 21, at an initial offering price of $100.65. They are being offered by Starwood Property Trust, Inc., a real estate investment trust. A Preferred Offering With a Strong Yield The preferred shares, known as Series A perpetual preferred stock, carry a 10% interest rate, making them very enticing to investors looking for income. As a perpetual security, STRF does not have a maturity date, making it more akin to an equity instrument than to traditional corporate debt. The strong yield reflects Strategy’s willingness to pay a premium for capital—access to which has somehow eluded its poorer, common shareholders—as it works to establish a bigger foothold in the crypto markets. The offering is being underwritten by leading financial institutions, such as TD Securities, Barclays Capital, and Benchmark. Their participation adds to the deal’s credibility and sends a message that large, traditional financial firms have no problem facilitating fundraising that ties Bitcoin to anything but a dark alley. Using preferred stock gives us a strategic advantage: it lets us avoid diluting common equity, and thereby preserve, at least for now, our main constituents’ (i.e., our shareholders’) stake in our company. What’s more, we can raise huge amounts of capital with preferred stock. Bitcoin-Centric Investment Strategy Continues Funds raised through the offering will be put to work in “business and investment activities,” with Bitcoin purchases called out as a major intended use of the capital. This allocation meshes with the investment thesis we have held since Bitcoin was first added to the Strategy, which sees the cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value and, increasingly, as an inflation hedge. In the past, the company has made news for switching a large part of its corporate treasury into Bitcoin and, in the process, has effectively positioned itself as a hybrid between a technology firm and a digital asset holding company. With the issuance of $2.1 billion in fresh capital, the firm seems to be doubling down on its conviction — potentially purchasing thousands more BTC depending on market prices. Strategy phát hành 2,1 tỷ USD cổ phiếu ưu đãi để mua thêm Bitcoin Strategy vừa thông báo sẽ phát hành cổ phiếu ưu đãi vĩnh viễn Series A với lãi suất 10% (mã: #STRF ), tổng giá trị tối đa 2,1 tỷ USD. Các đơn vị bảo lãnh phát hành bao gồm TD Securities,… https://t.co/QUyPMFwdFd pic.twitter.com/PB0NTvcGJY — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) May 23, 2025 This method is not untested. Other public companies, such as MicroStrategy, have used similar tactics when dealing in Bitcoin, raising money via capital markets to buy up a lot of the cryptocurrency. What sets Strategy apart is its use of high-yield preferred equity, rather than standard debt, to get this deal done—especially given the rising rates environment. Market Reaction and Strategic Implications STRF’s initial share price of $100.65 indicates a robust interest from investors in the offering, especially among those seeking reliable, fixed-income returns in today’s shaky macroeconomic climate. The preferred shares’ 10% yield, well above the rates on most corporate bonds and many old-school, dividend-paying stocks, make for a very attractive income-generating security. This capital increase marks a new phase of institutional Bitcoin adoption. By using public markets to raise billions to buy Bitcoin, Strategy is helping to establish the cryptocurrency as a balance sheet asset for big companies. And as with so much else in the crypto universe, it all comes down to, well, down payments. For the human side of it, the big news this quarter is that Bitcoin is hitting the balance sheets of actual companies. In the future, analysts will pay close attention to the deployment of capital, the acquisition of Bitcoin, and the trading performance of STRF in order to ascertain how market participants are likely to respond. Other firms might be nudged by this development to look into similarly inspired financing arrangements as a way to gain exposure to digital assets. Conclusion Strategy has issued $2.1 billion in high-yield preferred stock—a landmark event, not just for the company but for the digital asset ecosystem. It is a shining example of the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Institutional underwriters, a healthy interest rate, and a specific desire to accumulate BTC make Strategy a clear bullish bet on a Bitcoin future. And the future its backers are betting on is one in which Bitcoin is a central player. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-24T06:30:32.000Z,"Massive Bitcoin Profit Taking by Short-Term Holders Signals Potential BTC Price Pause","BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Profit Taking by Short-Term Holders Signals Potential BTC Price Pause Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Let’s dive into some fascinating on-chain data that’s got the market buzzing. Bitcoin (BTC) has seen incredible price action recently, rallying significantly towards its all-time high. But amidst the excitement, a massive wave of Bitcoin profit taking has occurred, particularly among those who bought relatively recently – the short-term holders (STHs). Who Are Short-Term Bitcoin Holders and Why Does Their Profit Taking Matter? Understanding market dynamics often involves looking at different types of participants. Short-term holders are typically defined as wallets that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. These are often the more speculative traders or newer entrants to the market, more reactive to recent price movements compared to long-term holders (who’ve held for over 155 days and are often seen as stronger hands). Their activity is a key indicator because: They are more likely to sell during periods of high volatility or significant price pumps to lock in quick gains. Their selling can contribute significantly to market supply, potentially slowing down or reversing upward price trends. High levels of STH profit taking often coincide with local market tops or periods of consolidation during a bull run. So, when we see significant activity from this group, it provides valuable crypto market signals about the immediate sentiment and potential near-term price trajectory. Unpacking the $11.6 Billion Bitcoin Profit Taking Wave According to data reported by Cointelegraph, drawing from Coinglass, short-term Bitcoin holders have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This isn’t just a large number; it represents the cumulative gains taken off the table by these specific market participants during Bitcoin’s recent rally. Think about it: $11.6 billion flowing out of STH wallets and presumably into stablecoins or fiat. This indicates that a substantial portion of the supply that moved recently has now been sold for a gain. While realizing profit is a fundamental part of any market, the sheer scale of this activity from STHs is what catches the eye of analysts. What Does This Massive Profit Taking Signal for BTC Price Analysis? This level of STH profit taking, while characteristic of a strong bullish cycle where opportunities for quick gains are abundant, is often observed in the periods leading up to or immediately following a local price peak. It suggests that the easiest, fastest gains for recent buyers might have already been made, and selling pressure is mounting from this group. Coupled with this, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted another crucial point: Bitcoin’s 30-day Bitcoin momentum has seen a notable drop of 38%. Momentum indicators measure the speed and strength of price changes. A significant drop suggests that the rapid upward thrust is weakening. The buying power that drove the recent rally might be pausing or facing increased resistance from sellers. Putting these two signals together – high STH profit taking and decreasing price momentum – paints a picture that suggests the market might be due for a breather. This doesn’t necessarily mean a crash is imminent, but rather that a period of consolidation, a slight pullback, or sideways trading could be on the horizon before the next potential move up. Navigating External Factors Impacting the BTC Price It’s also important to remember that crypto markets don’t exist in a vacuum. External macroeconomic and geopolitical events can significantly influence price action. The article mentions a recent pullback in BTC price to around $108,000 following an announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding potential 50% tariffs on European Union imports. While the direct link between tariffs and Bitcoin might not always be immediately obvious, such announcements can: Increase overall market uncertainty and risk aversion among traditional investors, which can spill over into crypto. Impact global trade and economic outlooks, potentially affecting liquidity and investment flows. Serve as a catalyst for traders looking for reasons to take profits in a market already showing signs of cooling momentum. This highlights that while on-chain data provides deep insights into internal market structure and participant behavior, staying aware of broader global events is also vital for comprehensive BTC price analysis . Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should investors make of these signals? For Short-Term Traders: Be aware that the market might be entering a choppier phase. Increased volatility and potential pullbacks could present new entry or exit points. Risk management becomes even more critical. For Long-Term Holders: Significant STH profit taking is a normal part of a bull cycle. It clears out some of the weaker hands and can provide opportunities for accumulation during dips. This data doesn’t necessarily invalidate the long-term bullish outlook, but signals potential near-term price fluctuations. General Advice: Don’t panic sell based solely on this data. Consider these signals as part of a broader analysis, combining on-chain data, technical analysis, and macro factors. Have a strategy and stick to it. Whether you are looking to take some profits yourself, buy dips, or simply hold, a plan helps navigate potential volatility. Stay informed about both on-chain developments and global news. Conclusion: Reading the Crypto Market Signals The recent $11.6 billion in Bitcoin profit taking by short-term holders is a significant data point during the current rally. It signals that a large amount of supply that was recently acquired has been sold for gains. Combined with decreasing Bitcoin momentum and potential impacts from external economic news, it suggests that the market may be entering a phase of consolidation or a slight correction. This isn’t necessarily a bearish omen for the long run, but rather a potential indication that the rapid ascent may pause. Understanding these crypto market signals , especially the behavior of short-term Bitcoin holders , is crucial for conducting effective BTC price analysis and navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrency.

2025-05-24T06:30:31.000Z,"Bitcoin Surges Past $110K — MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Poised for the Next 10,000% Rally","Bitcoin has stormed through the $110,000 milestone, setting a new all-time high and reaffirming its status as the undisputed leader of the digital asset class. This historic rally, fueled by institutional inflows, ETF demand, and a favorable regulatory climate, is reverberating across the crypto market. Yet, while Bitcoin’s ascent dominates headlines, analysts are swiftly shifting their gaze toward a select group of altcoins—notably MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP—where the next wave of exponential returns could be brewing. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Phenomenon With 10,000%+ Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, with over $8 million raised and its price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Key points: Capped supply: 100 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity. Secure contracts: HashEx-audited for investor confidence. Viral appeal: Political meme narrative driving rapid growth. Analyst forecasts: 25x–35x returns, up to 18,500% upside possible. A recent $132,000+ whale buy—the largest single early-stage investment this year—highlights strong belief in MAGA’s potential. With a $0.007 listing target and a limited-time 50% bonus for early buyers using PATRIOT50X , MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for early-stage gains before listings begin. Bitcoin: The Macro Anchor With Unmatched Momentum Bitcoin’s surge to $110,000 and beyond is a testament to its resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. The rally has been propelled by a confluence of factors: record ETF inflows, a favorable U.S. regulatory environment, and institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. Analysts now project targets as high as $115,000 in the near term and $130,000 by year-end, with some even speculating about $150,000 if bullish momentum persists. While Bitcoin’s dominance is clear, its massive market cap means that the days of 10,000% gains are likely in the past—prompting smart capital to rotate into high-upside altcoins. XRP: Bullish Catalysts and the Potential for a Historic Rally XRP is capturing renewed attention as technicals and fundamentals align for a potential breakout. Analysts are divided, with some forecasting a move to $2.85–$3.40 in the near term and others speculating about a $4.50 rally by June if bullish momentum persists. More ambitious projections even suggest a parabolic rally to $1,200–$1,700 by year-end, though these are considered highly speculative and would require unprecedented market dynamics. While XRP’s upside is strong, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns is still wide open. Cardano and Litecoin: Steady Performers in a Dynamic Market Cardano (ADA) is trading above $0.80, with analysts eyeing a potential move toward $0.90–$1.00 if bullish momentum holds. The network’s integration with the Brave browser and growing wallet adoption are positive signs, but ADA’s near-term upside is more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Litecoin (LTC) is consolidating after a strong run, with price predictions ranging from $140 to $231 in 2025, depending on market conditions and ETF developments. While Litecoin remains a reliable hold for long-term investors, its upside is less dramatic compared to the presale momentum of MAGA. CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge past $110,000 is a watershed moment for the crypto market, but the real excitement is unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With MAGA’s presale still on, a $0.007 listing target, and analyst forecasts of up to 10,000%–18,500% upside, the window for early entry is closing fast. For investors seeking the next breakout winner, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025, while XRP offers a compelling blend of technical strength and institutional momentum. As capital rotates from established giants to high-upside altcoins, the stage is set for a summer of transformative gains—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge.

Overall, the digital asset still seems to be in a bullish uptrend, but there are now some signs that it’s getting tired. Traders are closely watching key support levels to see whether this is a standard sort of retest or the beginning of a larger correction. The market finds itself in a critical situation, where pricing, liquidation, and investor sentiment are all doing their part to create an increasingly tense short-term outlook. Bitcoin Rally Pauses After $5K Surge: A Sell Signal Emerges The latest leg upward for Bitcoin started at about $106,300, where a buy alert lighted a fire under the rally that tacked on more than $5,000 to its price. That uptrend finished in a surge to $111,950, making for a new local high. But not long after reaching that point did a sell alert get triggered, suggesting that the buyers may have been running on fumes and that the rally was losing upward momentum. As this is being penned, Bitcoin trades at about $110,402 on the BTC/USDT pair offered by Binance. The SuperTrend indicator is still green. However, it now sits at a make-or-break level that could swing in the opposite direction if downward pressure on the price continues. On May 22 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $935 million, marking seven consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $111 million, with five consecutive days of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 23, 2025 This hesitation comes in the face of heightened activity from sellers, who are starting to probe the recent structural bullishness. Despite the long-term uptrend being quite intact, the rejection at $111.9K signals that the bulls may be contending with either profit-taking from previous longs or some kind of institutional rebalancing. Liquidation Zones Signal Key Pressure Points Analyzing liquidation data also provides better insight into how the market might be moving. When looking at the resistance side, there’s a very clear short liquidation zone from about $111,800 to $112,300. Not only is this area a little thin in terms of order book depth, but it’s also effectively the last line of defense for all those fortunate enough to have opened short positions recently. If the buyers truly are stepping up, then a move through this zone could very well trigger a short squeeze and push Bitcoin beyond the $112,500 mark, which many analysts see as a potential breakout level. Support areas are now taking center stage. The next long liquidation cluster is at about $110,000 to $109,200. If this area holds and doesn’t get pushed through to the downside, it might very well set the stage for a next bullish push and reinforce the kind of confidence you need for breakouts and pushes to the next higher high. Beneath that, the territory between $108,000 and $106,300 marks the original base of the current upswing. It also serves as a supply zone, where above it, buyers step in with more confidence. If prices tumble below this range, it’s highly probable that we’d see a serious trend breakdown, with this area serving as a tipping point—and not a very good one at that, given how close it is to current price levels. Bitcoin just tapped $111.9K before stalling, and a fresh sell signal has now emerged at the top. Is this a standard retest of support or the first crack in bullish momentum? SuperTrend remains green, but sellers are probing. Full liquidation and trend breakdown below … https://t.co/MpjTUzsPcR pic.twitter.com/JnEFRyb7BU — IT Tech (@IT_Tech_PL) May 23, 2025 The $109,200 level could see serious volume profile action and market reaction. A strong bounce there could reset bullish sentiment in the crypto market. But a breakdown might induce overleverage long liquidations to cascade downward. Sentiment Still Positive, But Cracks Are Forming Even in the face of short-term ambiguity, the general outlook stays relatively positive. On May 22, spot Bitcoin ETFs took in a net of $935 million—an amount that marked the seventh straight day of positive inflows. That brings the total net inflow for Bitcoin ETFs in 2023 to more than $1.5 billion. Notably, this institutional demand has largely sidestepped the kind of pronounced sell-offs that have characterized previous bear markets. Yet, how markets feel about an asset can change in the blink of an eye. The recent rejection of Bitcoin’s price at $111,900 may turn out to be just a small, local dip on the way up, but some analysts are interpreting it as a sign of market exhaustion, at least in the short term. They’re saying that if the $110K level can’t hold as a support level, then the next likely prices in play for a retracement are $108,000 or $106,000—both of which got significant play from bulls late last year and early this year. To sum up, Bitcoin’s uptrend remains in place, but the market is entering a precarious phase. As long as it maintains a price higher than $110,000, a retest of $112,000 and perhaps even loftier levels remain within striking distance. But if sellers can force the price down to $109,000 or below, a more significant correction seems likely to follow. Like any otherwise in volatile markets, everything remains concentrated on volume, liquidation activity, and structural support to divine the next move in Bitcoin’s by-now-familiar saga.

2025-05-24T06:26:16.000Z,"Ethereum Surges Past Key Price Metrics as Bullish Momentum Builds","Ethereum’s latest price action has renewed excitement in the world of crypto, with the second largest digital asset by market capitalization lifting above some key valuation yardsticks and finding a couple of new technical support bases. After several months of sideways action and kind of tepid price performance, Ether (ETH) is starting to show stronger signs of life and price resilience, in a way that seems very evocative of the early stages of a new bull cycle. Ethereum’s market structure appears to be solidifying at about $2,370, and with more inflows from institutions through spot ETFs, it seems like the stage is being set for a potential run toward $3,000—provided, of course, that the resistance levels don’t just hold but get cleared in the next few days. On May 22 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $935 million, marking seven consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $111 million, with five consecutive days of net inflows. https://t.co/ueXcZjub6m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 23, 2025 Realized Price Reclaimed: Average Holders Return to Profit Ethereum has, at long last, moved back above its Realized Price of $1,900. This price point is critical, as it reflects the average price at which all ETH in circulation was last moved on-chain. And it serves as a proxy for the average cost basis of market participants. It is not just Ethereum, though, that is enjoying these past few days of price appreciation. Bitcoin, too, has surged in and around the $31,000 range. And it has reclaimed that narrative of steadfastness in the marketplace. Overall, Ether’s performance has yet to rival Bitcoin’s, though, over the past week. Still, ETH holders are finally back to being in the black. ETH is currently trading at $2,400, which is now above the True Market Mean. This line has acted as a dividing line in past market cycles. When Ethereum has historically been above it, the market has been in a full-blown bull phase. Not only has it acted as a marker for when the market has been in a bull phase, but I also think you’ve got to give it some respect because when Ethereum has crossed above it, it’s acted as a precursor to some pretty good upward price action. Ethereum rally update: $ETH has moved above its Realized Price ($1,900), which means the average holder is back in profit. Even more important — it’s now trading above the True Market Mean at $2,400. That’s been a key line in past cycles. The next level to watch? Active… pic.twitter.com/NekeAFeBrW — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 22, 2025 The next major landmark to keep an eye on is the Active Realized Price at $2,900. This measure gives the average purchase price of active market players—those who have shifted their ETH recently. Moving above this level would seriously suggest momentum and offer a strong mental go sign for both retail and institutional investors who have been waiting to see if Ethereum can pull off a sustained breakout. #Ethereum $ETH has built a solid support floor at $2,370, with no significant resistance walls ahead! pic.twitter.com/E67jeybl6e — Ali (@ali_charts) May 22, 2025 Technical Setup Strengthens: Ethereum Support at $2,370, Eyes on $2,588 Ethereum has established a firm support base at $2,370, which has held up relatively well in the face of recent retests. It is now solidly beneath us and serving as a launching off point for price to try to push above without getting immediately shoved back down by apparently impatient sellers. And should volume and buying pressure continue to push the price higher, a lack of resistance walls ahead figures to allow for some pretty clean upsides. The $2,588 level of resistance for Ethereum is next in line and is significant enough that a break through it would likely send the second largest crypto flying toward the $3,000 area. Such a move would mark a full recovery from the lows seen earlier in the year and would signal a return to a more aggressive bullish posture across the Ethereum ecosystem. Analysts note that there is little resistance between present prices and the $3,000 threshold, creating a favorable risk-reward ratio for traders. They see momentum indicators moving in a bullish direction and note that the ETH is priced above several key moving averages. For now, market structure looks pretty solid for the bulls. Spot ETF Inflows Signal Growing Institutional Confidence Ethereum-based investment products have shown very promising inflows recently, which indicates a marked improvement in sentiment. On May 22, spot Ethereum ETFs had a net inflow of $111 million—the fifth consecutive day of positive institutional investment. A steady stream of cash has recently come into Ethereum-backed funds, with the latest figures showing that these vehicles now manage over half a billion dollars. This might not sound like a lot, but these are still the early days for these funds; the amount could grow quite a bit. And in any case, the funding they have now is certainly taking them in an interesting direction. As with Bitcoin, there are now Ethereum index funds. They don’t hold all the assets that an ETF would; indeed, they invest mostly in Geth, the Ethereum client program written in Go that runs (or should run) on all ETH nodes. And they also invest in a few other things. Still, it’s a start. Ethereum seems to be on the verge of a possibly large-scale breakout. Why? Well, sentiment is certainly improving, and some of the key price metrics are showing either improvement or completion of bullish setups. Also, from a technical perspective, there really isn’t much in the way of the price until around the $2,900 range, and even then, there are some doubts that whatever happens at that price level will have any lasting effect.

2025-05-24T06:20:30.000Z,"Tesla Bitcoin Holdings Surge to $1.24 Billion","BitcoinWorld Tesla Bitcoin Holdings Surge to $1.24 Billion Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and curious minds! We’ve got some interesting news coming out of the corporate world, specifically from the electric vehicle giant, Tesla. Their dive into the world of digital assets continues to be a hot topic, and the latest data gives us a fresh look at their position. Tesla Bitcoin Holdings: What’s the Latest? Let’s get straight to the numbers that everyone’s talking about. According to recent data compiled by Arkham, Tesla’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings currently stand at a significant amount. We’re talking about a figure that solidifies their position as a major corporate player in the crypto space. Here’s a quick snapshot: Amount Held: 11,509 BTC Current Estimated Value: Approximately $1.24 billion This valuation, based on current market prices, highlights the fluctuating nature of cryptocurrency investments but also the substantial value Tesla holds in its digital treasury. A Look Back: Tesla’s Bitcoin Journey Remember when Tesla first announced its massive Bitcoin purchase? It sent shockwaves through both the financial and cryptocurrency markets. In early 2021, Tesla revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, citing a change in its investment policy to provide more flexibility and maximize returns on cash. This move was groundbreaking for several reasons: It was one of the largest single Bitcoin purchases by a publicly traded company at the time. It signaled a major endorsement of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class from a globally recognized brand led by Elon Musk. It paved the way for other companies to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Later in 2021, Tesla did sell a portion of its holdings, which Elon Musk stated was to test the liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on the balance sheet. Despite this sale, the company retained a significant portion, which constitutes the BTC holdings we see today. Understanding the Tesla BTC Value The reported Tesla BTC value of $1.24 billion isn’t a fixed number. Like any asset, the value of Bitcoin is constantly changing based on market supply and demand. This means Tesla’s reported holding value will fluctuate daily, if not hourly, with the price of BTC. For investors and market watchers, tracking the Tesla BTC value provides insight into: The performance of a major corporate crypto investment. The impact of market movements on large-scale holdings. Tesla’s potential unrealized gains or losses from their initial investment (though their average purchase price isn’t publicly detailed for the current holdings, the initial large buy was near a different price point than today). This $1.24 billion valuation underscores the significant appreciation Bitcoin has experienced since Tesla’s initial entry into the market, despite the volatility along the way. Why Are Corporate Bitcoin Holdings a Big Deal? Tesla isn’t the only company holding Bitcoin, but their high profile makes their investment particularly impactful. The trend of Corporate Bitcoin holdings represents a significant shift in how companies view treasury management and asset allocation. Here are some reasons why companies are considering or already holding Bitcoin: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Many see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation due to its capped supply (21 million coins). Store of Value: Analogous to digital gold, companies view it as a long-term store of value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (though correlation varies) to traditional holdings like cash and bonds. Attracting Talent/Innovation: Signaling forward-thinking and tech-savviness can appeal to certain employees and investors. Potential Appreciation: Hopes for significant returns on investment if Bitcoin’s price continues to rise over time. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, leading to significant paper losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require companies to mark down Bitcoin holdings if the price drops, even if they don’t sell, impacting reported earnings. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent hacking or loss. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view crypto investments as risky or speculative. Companies like MicroStrategy have made acquiring Bitcoin a central part of their corporate strategy, accumulating far more BTC than Tesla. However, Tesla’s move was arguably the catalyst that brought mainstream attention to the possibility of holding crypto on a corporate balance sheet. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Tesla’s initial purchase, and their continued holding of Institutional Bitcoin , is part of a larger narrative: the increasing adoption of cryptocurrency by institutions. This includes not just corporations, but also asset managers, hedge funds, and even some governments. The entry of institutional players is significant because: Adds Capital: Brings substantial capital into the market, potentially increasing liquidity and stability. Increases Legitimacy: Lends credibility to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the eyes of traditional finance and the public. Develops Infrastructure: Drives the creation of regulated products and services (like Bitcoin ETFs) catering to institutional needs. Influences Market Dynamics: Large trades by institutions can have a notable impact on price movements. Tesla’s $1.24 billion valuation for its Institutional Bitcoin stash serves as a prominent example of this trend in action, showcasing the scale at which major companies are now involved. What Can We Learn From Tesla’s Holding? Tesla’s journey with Bitcoin offers several insights: Volatility is Real: Their holding value has gone up and down significantly since their purchase. This is a core characteristic of crypto. Long-Term View: Despite selling some, they retained a core holding, suggesting a belief in its long-term potential as an asset. Pioneer Effect: Being one of the first major companies to publicly hold significant BTC created a blueprint and encouraged others. Influence: Corporate actions and CEO statements can significantly impact market sentiment. For individual investors, this highlights the importance of understanding volatility, having a long-term perspective if investing in volatile assets like Bitcoin, and recognizing the growing presence of large players in the market. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings Will more companies follow Tesla’s lead? The trend towards Corporate Bitcoin holdings seems to be gaining momentum, especially with easier access through regulated products like spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions. However, challenges like regulatory clarity and accounting standards still need to be fully addressed. Tesla’s decision to hold onto its 11,509 BTC, valued now at a substantial $1.24 billion, indicates a continued, albeit perhaps quieter, conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a balance sheet asset. Their actions remain a key indicator for how mainstream corporations might engage with cryptocurrencies in the future. Summary: Tesla’s Enduring Bitcoin Bet In conclusion, Tesla’s reported BTC holdings of 11,509 coins, currently valued at approximately $1.24 billion, underscore the continued presence of major corporations in the cryptocurrency market. This valuation is a testament to Bitcoin’s market performance and highlights the significant scale of Corporate Bitcoin holdings . Tesla’s initial bold move paved the way for increased Institutional Bitcoin adoption and continues to serve as a high-profile example of a company integrating digital assets into its financial strategy. While the value fluctuates with market dynamics, Tesla’s substantial holding remains a key data point for anyone tracking the convergence of traditional corporate finance and the evolving world of cryptocurrency.

2025-05-24T06:02:46.000Z,"America is ‘going big’ on crypto after years of industry starvation","U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent affirmed that the administration is committed to positioning the country as the global leader in digital assets. Bessent, speaking to Bloomberg, said the government is “going big” on crypto, a striking contrast with the previous administration, which took a restrictive approach that left many companies struggling to survive. In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bessent said that, instead, the White House plans to tighten up anti-money laundering (AML) standards for digital assets, especially stablecoins. He said the administration will pursue strong compliance while encouraging innovation, stating, “Digital asset companies deserve regulatory clarity, and that’s exactly what we are working toward.” Bessent also highlighted one of his key projections that stablecoins will generate $2 trillion in demand for U.S. Treasuries and bills in the near term, far more than the current $300 billion. According to the Treasury Secretary, this shift will inject a lot of liquidity into traditional markets without weakening oversight. Legislative momentum is also building in Washington. A bipartisan stablecoin bill that recently cleared a procedural roadblock in the U.S. Senate could soon become a reality. The measure had been stalled by a filibuster, which the Senate voted to end 66–32 earlier this month, allowing debate on the floor. Key changes to the bill brokered by crypto-supporting Democrats led by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks brought the breakthrough. They also dropped demands for a ban on former President Donald Trump profiting from his family’s crypto investments. The legislation marks a pivotal step, but even though a final vote might not take place until after the Memorial Day recess, industry insiders say. If it passes, it will create a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, ending years of legal limbo and inviting more institutional participation to the industry. Bessent eyes relief for the Treasury market Bessent hinted at heavily transforming the traditional financial system beyond digital assets. He said U.S. regulators are nearing the end of a process that will remove the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) requirement on banks that trade Treasuries. As a post-2008 crisis safeguard, the SLR currently requires banks to hold more capital against holding trading Treasuries in their reserves. Bessent said that removal could increase liquidity in the $29 trillion market and lower Treasury yields by a few basis points. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC are in discussions. This would represent a significant regulatory change and may help digital asset markets. Trump’s crypto dinner stirs debate Meanwhile, President Trump is seizing the opportunity to brand himself as crypto’s political champion. In a recent Truth Social post, he said the U.S. is ‘dominating in crypto, bitcoin, etc.,’ vowing to ‘keep it that way.’ The top 220 holders of Trump’s TRUMP meme coin were invited to a high-profile crypto dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club. Legislators raised concerns about the VIP event’s transparency and its ethical implications. It was reported to have raised $148 million. They questioned the concentration among Trump-linked entities and the risk of foreign influence. Despite the criticism, attendees viewed the dinner as indicative of just how politically relevant crypto is becoming. The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the president was there in his personal time and that no official guest list will be released. Several guests attended with the intent of changing Trump’s stance on crypto regulation, the New York Times later reported. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-24T06:00:18.000Z,"Litecoin Monthly Close Above Key Resistance Could Ignite 30% Rally – Is A Breakout Coming?","As Litecoin (LTC) tries to break out of a bullish pattern, an analyst suggests that a monthly close above its key horizontal zone could propel the price to levels not seen since the 2021 bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For Second ‘Price Discovery Uptrend’ Following $109,000 Breakout – What’s Ahead For BTC? Litecoin Attempting Key Breakout Litecoin has seen a remarkable 63% rally from April’s lows over the past month and a half, surging above crucial levels in the past few weeks. Just this month, the cryptocurrency has recovered the $80 and $90 support levels and attempted to reclaim the $100 barrier again. Fueled by the market recovery and Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark, LTC hit a two-month high of $107 nearly two weeks ago. Since then, the altcoin has struggled to hold the $100 mark. However, analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show recently suggested that Litecoin “is about to pump.” The analyst highlighted a bullish pattern on LTC’s chart, which could see the cryptocurrency rise 20% toward the $117.5 mark for the first time since early March. According to Runefelt’s chart, the cryptocurrency formed a bullish flag pattern after hitting its two-month high. Since then, LTC has hovered between the upper and lower boundary, bouncing once before from the support line toward the pattern’s resistance line. Earlier this week, Litecoin bounced again from the support after touching the $92 level, which led the analyst to suggest it has “every chance to break out of this bullish flag to the upside.” On Friday, the altcoin jumped 11% from the pattern lows, briefly breaking out and hitting the $102 mark before retracing to the $96 mark. The cryptocurrency now hovers between the $98-$99 levels, just 1% below the pattern’s upper boundary. A surge above this level to confirm the breakout could set the stage for the pattern’s $117.5 target and mark a significant push toward a key horizontal level. LTC Preparing For Rally To $150? Analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Litecoin needs a Monthly Close above its key resistance level to target the $150 mark and above. He highlighted the $110-$125 horizontal level, explaining that LTC “spends most of its time below it and very little time comparatively beyond it.” The analyst noted that since 2019, the rejection from this resistance level has been getting “progressively weaker over time to the point where only a couple of months ago, LTC tried to retest this region as support” during the early 2025 rally. Despite failing to reclaim this level, this could suggest that the resistance is “struggling to hold price down,” which is why the next breakout above this area could signal that “the chances of a successful retest are high.” Related Reading: SUI Preparing For Another Leg Up – Is $5 The Next Target? Moreover, the weakening of the resistance could be partly attributed to its multi-year Marco Higher Low, as Litecoin has bounced from the ascending trendline toward this resistance each time it has been retested. Based on this, the analyst considers that a Monthly Close above the key horizontal level, followed by a retest to confirm the breakout, would give the necessary strength for a 30% rally above the $150 mark for the first time since 2021. As of this writing, Litecoin trades at $98.60, a 2.7% decline in the weekly timeframe.

The altcoins have also bled out on a daily scale, with more than $100 billion leaving the space within this timeframe. BTC Pushed Below $107K In general, it was a very good, some would say historic, week for the primary cryptocurrency. It started on a volatile foot as it pumped from $104,000 to $107,000 on a couple of occasions on Sunday and Monday but was stopped in its tracks and driven south hard. However, the bulls kept the pressure on, and that upper boundary finally gave in on Wednesday. Moreover, bitcoin rocketed past its January all-time high of $109,100 and set a new one at almost $110,000. It was met with immediate resistance there and a drop to $106,500, but that was short-lived. Bitcoin began another, even more impressive leg up in the following hours and tapped a fresh peak at $112,000 on Pizza Day. It retraced slightly to $111,000 on Friday but remained at around that level until the POTUS recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU to start from June 1. In minutes, BTC’s price tumbled below $107,500, bounced off, and then slipped again to under $107,000. It has recovered some ground now and sits above $108,000, but it’s still over 2% down on the day. Its market cap has plunged to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61% on CG. BTCUSD.

2025-05-24T05:41:44.000Z,"Bitcoin Bull Run Could Last Until 2027, Says Top Crypto Analyst","The post Bitcoin Bull Run Could Last Until 2027, Says Top Crypto Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Something strange is happening in the crypto world. Bitcoin is rising. Institutions are joining . And yet, the market doesn’t feel like it used to. Popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently shared a bold thought, this market cycle is unlike the one we’ve seen before. In fact, he believes it could be longer, more powerful, and very different from the classic four-year pattern everyone’s been expecting. Despite this, he believes Bitcoin could hit $400,000 to $600,000 by 2026 or 2027. Here’s why! Forget the Old 4-Year Rule Bitcoin, the biggest player in the crypto world, continues to hit new highs of $112k and claim a larger share of the overall market. Usually, Bitcoin goes on a big run, then altcoins catch up, and eventually, everything dips before starting over. But this time? The whole rhythm seems off. In the last 18 months, Bitcoin has been taking center stage—breaking highs and growing stronger while everything else follows. It’s now holding about 60% of the total crypto market cap, a number we haven’t seen in a while. That kind of dominance usually signals that Bitcoin might slow down soon. But this time, it’s not just retail traders behind the push—it’s big players too. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Now?

Institutions now see crypto not just as risky bets, but as real investments with long-term potential. As Matthew Kimmell from CoinShares explains , Bitcoin usually gains strength in early recoveries, then cools off when traders chase riskier coins. But today, things feel more stable. That’s why van de Poppe says we need to open our minds, maybe this cycle won’t peak in 2025. Perhaps we’re looking at 2026 or even 2027. And yes, he even sees Bitcoin reaching $400K to $600K , with altcoins flying even higher. Bigger Game for Altcoins And it’s not just about Bitcoin. If this extended cycle plays out, altcoins could see even greater growth. With more real-world use cases, better infrastructure, and rising investor interest, coins beyond BTC might finally have their breakout moment. This isn’t just speculation—it’s a shift in thinking. Van de Poppe urges investors to approach the market with an open mind. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests this cycle is unique, potentially longer and more powerful than the traditional four-year pattern, with Bitcoin hitting $112K highs. What role are institutions playing in this crypto cycle? Institutions, through spot Bitcoin ETFs and growing interest from government leaders, are viewing crypto as long-term investments, bringing stability and significant capital to the market. What does increased institutional involvement mean for retail investors? Increased institutional involvement can bring more stability to prices, but retail investors might enter later, potentially facing higher risks and fewer profit opportunities.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-bull-run-could-last-until-2027-says-top-crypto-analyst/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T05:40:09.000Z,"Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Now? Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K?","The post Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Now? Will BTC Price Go Down to $100K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price faced a notable pullback after a failed attempt to sustain itself above the gained levels. The BTC price dropped below $107K while Ethereum and the other altcoins also witnessed a similar pullback. The ongoing crypto crash occurred at times when the stock market has also been facing a sell-off. The BTC price recovered despite the Moody’s shockwaves in the financial market by downgrading the US credit rating . Regardless of the upward pressure, Bitcoin displays huge upward potential of marking a fresh ATH in the coming days. While the institutions are piling up Bitcoin , the retailers do not seem to have entered the space. The Google search trends show retail interest is still only half of what it was in November 2024, which suggests smart money is buying while retail stays silent. This can be considered a huge bullish signal, as there was no hype, no frenzy, despite the BTC price forming new highs. On the other hand, funding rates are neutral, which hints that the leverage is under control. While there are no signs of overexposure in futures, a healthy structure is expected to continue. With the BTC price holding up above $100K, the trade setup hints at more upside ahead. Will Bitcoin’s (BTC) Price Rise to $120K or Drop to $100K? Bitcoin saw a sharp and aggressive drop following Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a 50% tariff on EU imports . The sudden macro triggered broad risk-off flows, with BTC quickly selling off from local highs near $111.3K and tapping into a key fair value gap around $107.5K. Although the price witnessed a short-term bounce since the low, it failed to be validated as a bullish reversal. Currently, the momentum remains fragile, and the overall structure still favors caution as Bitcoin trades within a compression zone. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run Could Last Until 2027, Says Top Crypto Analyst , The BTC price is trapped between two major fair value gaps, which are currently the threshold for the upcoming market direction. If the bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, the bulls could gain strength and push the levels towards the higher resistance beyond $112K. These levels line up with a larger supply zone and could become a key-magnet zone. On the flip side, if the BTC fails to hold the lower FVG and breaks below $107,000, it may enter the liquidity pool around $106K, which could be supported by price inefficiency and unmitigated demand just below. The current trade setup hints towards a major compression, and hence it is important that the Bitcoin (BTC) price does not get trapped in the middle range. Therefore, it would be important to witness which FVG will be filled ahead of the monthly close. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How does the downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s impact Bitcoin’s price? A US credit rating downgrade can sometimes positively affect Bitcoin long-term by shaking confidence in traditional finance, prompting investors to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin as a hedge.

The company says investors deserve clear and timely decisions instead of silence without explanation. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel shared a post on X showing frustration with the SEC for delaying the company’s CBOE’s 19b-4 filing without explanations. SEC again delays ruling on CBOE’s 19b-4 to list options on VanEck $HODL ETF. We find the lack of explanation confounding & frustrating. Investors deserve transparency and timely action. @HesterPeirce — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 23, 2025 VanEck asks for answers after the SEC delays a decision on Bitcoin ETF options The SEC has again delayed a decision on whether to approve options trading for VanEck’s spot Bitcoin ETF trading under the ticker symbol $HODL. This delay further frustrated other crypto asset managers waiting for the SEC to decide on their applications. VanEck also awaits approval on a similar request to include in-kind creations and redemptions for the same Bitcoin ETF. Still, the SEC has not moved forward on that either. The feature would allow investors to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares and vice versa directly. VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, posted on X claiming that the SEC does not explain why it keeps pushing back these decisions. He added that the lack of feedback makes the process more confusing and makes it difficult for applicants to understand what they need to fix or improve. Matthew described the SEC’s silence as “confounding and frustrating” because it makes the process feel unfair and unpredictable for companies trying to follow all the rules. He also tagged SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, expecting her Crypto Task Force to step in, provide answers, and show some leadership on an issue affecting many crypto players. The repeated delays without clear reasoning hurt investor confidence and slow growth and innovation as people feel uncertain about whether the SEC will ever make firm decisions or continue stalling indefinitely. The SEC keeps delaying crypto ETF decisions while new filings keep coming in The SEC has again delayed a decision on a major crypto ETF proposal affecting CoinShares’ application for a spot XRP ETF, which would be exposed to XRP through a regulated product. The SEC pushed back the decision from May 26 to Aug. 24 and sought public comments and rebuttals to the proposal rather than approving or rejecting it. This delay is one more instance in a trend where the SEC takes longer than usual without providing any explanation for the delay, leaving the applicants and the entire market wondering. The agency also stalled Fidelity’s proposals for in-kind redemptions in its spot Bitcoin ETF and a similar Ethereum-based product. The in-kind redemption is more efficient and tax-friendly because investors can swap actual crypto for ETF shares rather than using cash. The pace of new ETF applications is accelerating despite these repeated roadblocks because asset managers believe the rewards of being first to market with new crypto ETF products outweigh the frustrations of dealing with regulatory restraints. Firms have filed for ETFs based on a range of altcoins, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and XRP for the past few weeks. These products allow investors to access blockchain ecosystems and technologies outside the Bitcoin-Ethereum duopoly. Canary Capital recently filed to launch a staked Tron ETF that would track the price of the Tron token (TRX) and pass on staking rewards to investors. The SEC acknowledged this application, which shows that it might be warming up to innovative structures, even if it is not ready to approve them yet. Similarly, companies won’t stop applying because they believe the Trump administration favors crypto more than its predecessor. Industry leaders have also pointed to leadership changes and evolving political sentiment as signs that the regulatory climate may become more supportive or, at the very least, more predictable. The SEC has not released new crypto-specific guidance, but it continues to accept and publish new applications through its formal processes, which gives some hope that the agency may be preparing for a new phase of regulatory clarity KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/vaneck-challenges-secs-bitcoin-etf-silence/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Bitcoin|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-05-24T05:00:29.000Z,"Ethereum’s Consolidation Phase Sparks Interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP Among Analysts","Ethereum’s current consolidation above $2,500 is drawing close scrutiny from market watchers, as technical patterns suggest a major breakout could be on the horizon. While Bitcoin and Ethereum anchor the market, analysts are increasingly highlighting the explosive potential of early-stage altcoins—especially MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP. With capital rotation intensifying and bullish sentiment building, these tokens are now at the center of the conversation for those seeking outsized gains in 2025. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Acceleration and 15,000% Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the spotlight in 2025, with over $8 million raised and its presale price still under $0.001 as Stage 8 nears completion. Analysts are projecting up to 18,500% returns, with some forecasting a $1 target by year-end if current momentum continues. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, Hashex-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling rapid accumulation and early-stage investor enthusiasm. As each presale stage fills and the $0.007 listing target approaches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare ground-floor opportunity—one that could rival the early days of SHIBA INU or DOGE, but with more transparency and a scarcity-driven model. Even a modest $500 stake could multiply many times over if projections hold true, making MAGA the breakout bet for the next supercycle. Ethereum: Technical Structure and Breakout Watch Ethereum (ETH) is currently consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with technical indicators pointing to a possible surge toward $2,800–$2,900 if momentum holds. Analysts note that ETH is trading above its 50-day EMA and forming a bullish flag, with the RSI rebounding and volume poised to increase as summer approaches. A decisive move above $2,800 could trigger a multi-month rally, with some forecasts calling for a climb toward $4,500 by late 2025. As Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem expands and institutional adoption grows, ETH remains a cornerstone for both stability and upside in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP: Bullish Structure and Renewed Accumulation XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts closely watching as futures and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Whale accumulation has surged, historically a precursor to major rallies. Technicals show XRP forming higher lows and breaking above resistance, with projections of $2.85 by June and $5.50 by year-end if ETF approvals and adoption accelerate. While XRP’s legal clarity and infrastructure are positives, the most dramatic growth potential may now be shifting toward early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the window for exponential returns remains open. HBAR and Bitcoin: Steady Growth, but MAGA Steals the Spotlight HBAR continues to build through enterprise integrations and real-world use cases, but its near-term upside is less dramatic compared to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is holding above $103,000, with price predictions between $110,000–$115,000 as institutional interest remains strong. Yet, as capital rotates for higher multiples, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing the attention of those seeking the next 10x–100x opportunity. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion Ethereum’s consolidation phase is fueling analyst interest in breakout altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE and XRP now leading the charge for potential 15,000% gains in 2025. With MAGA’s presale nearly complete, a $0.007 listing target, and projections as high as 18,500% ROI, the window for early entry is closing fast. For investors seeking the next big crypto success story, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout contender that could define this cycle’s upside.

2025-05-24T04:30:52.000Z,"Buy XRP Before It Explodes To $1,000, Market Expert Says","According to a recent analysis from popular XRP commentator BarriC, the token’s current price makes it a tempting buy. He pointed to the fact that XRP sits at about $2.35 right now. That price is low compared with where he thinks it will go. He told followers to pick up as much as they can while the chance is there. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight XRP Trading Below $3 XRP has climbed about 350% over the past year. That beat gains in some of the top altcoins in the market today. Yet many still see the move as slow. At $2.39 per coin, that view is easy to understand. Even so, BarriC calls anything under $3 a bargain. Predictions For A Rally Based on examination from his Twitter thread, BarriC expects XRP to hit $10 first. He then sees it pushing to $20 in the months ahead. Those moves would set a new high during what he calls the next alt season. If those figures come true, buyers who got in under $3 would see roughly a seven-fold gain at the $20 mark. $XRP will become very expensive to buy in the next few months and the next few years Right now, you can accumulate $XRP below $3 And somehow that’s considered a failure When $XRP skyrockets over the next few months and hits $10-$20 per #XRP That’s the new all time high… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 17, 2025 … But Possible Correction Ahead BarriC also warned of a pullback after a big rise. He thinks XRP could drop by about 50% once it reaches $20. That would put it back in the $5–$10 range. He sees that dip as a fresh chance to buy in. Even then, $5 is still higher than today’s $2.39. Long Term Vision For XRP Looking past the next cycle, BarriC outlined a bold scenario. He believes banks and big payment firms will use XRP for daily money transfers. In that case, demand could send the price all the way to $1,000 within 10 years. When banks start using $XRP We will know because of the insane price per $XRP We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 Per #XRP The fact that we can still accumulate $XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilising $XRP …. YET Once that day comes Once banks and… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 3, 2025 To reach that level, XRP’s market cap would top $58 trillion. That would put it on par with major pieces of the global money system. Technical Signals And Short-Term Outlook Technical indicators point to a possible drop to around $2.21 by June 22, 2025, which would be a -9.20% change from now. The current sentiment gauge reads Bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index sits at 0. Over the past 30 days, XRP had 13 out of 30 green days and showed about 5.10% price swings. Those numbers hint at mixed views. Some traders see room to run. Others expect more choppy action before the next big move. Related Reading: Only 5% Will Make It – XRP Expert Reveals Path To Riches Market watchers will be watching Ripple’s deals with banks and payment networks. If those start to speed up, we could see more buzz around XRP’s real-world uses. Until then, buying under $3 could look smart—or it could stay quiet for a while. Either way, investors will have to decide how much risk they want for the chance at a big payout in the years to come.

Source: Laevitas.chThe open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion.

Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels.Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time. According to data from market analytics firm Multpl, the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has consistently remained above 19.6 since December 2018, higher than the index’s historical average P/E ratio of around 16.1 and suggesting that investors have been willing to pay a premium for earnings in recent years.Zooming out, the S&P 500’s average valuation has been gradually rising for decades, driven by factors such as low interest rates, growing corporate gains, and investor optimism about technology. However, high valuations have also coincided with periods of market corrections, like the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.S&P 500 P/E ratio since inception. Source: MultiplAccording to Akshay, a way to combat this overheating is to open up certain markets to retail investors, a lofty goal that some sectors of crypto, like RWA tokenization, aim to facilitate. Akshay noted that some entrepreneurs had tried this before, but the available technology didn’t support this view. “[Crypto] starts with the game, and very quickly becomes profound.”“What it gives you is the ability for you to financialize all the productive assets in an economy, so you can have anybody who participates in that economy be an owner of that economy,” he said.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-will-make-everyone-an-investor-or-a-dreamer-over-time-solana-exec?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart.

The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart.

That heightens the risk of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($147).Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) turned down from the $0.26 overhead resistance on May 23, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level.DOGE/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why?

Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice?

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff. Steve Witkoff serves as the US Special Envoy to the Middle East under the Trump administration, while Zach Witkoff has been involved in securing a reported $2 billion crypto deal.The report raised questions about whether diplomatic efforts overlapped with private crypto ventures, and implied Zhao may have been attempting to curry favor with the Trump administrationOn May 6, Zhao confirmed that he is seeking a pardon from the Trump administration for his earlier money laundering conviction. The report also highlighted that WLFI, which raised over $600 million in token sales, does not disclose the names of all its investors aside from some publicly known ones like Tron founder Justin Sun, who attended Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. Trump hosted the dinner for the largest investors of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin. Sun, Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu and BitMart CEO Sheldon Xia were among attendees and shared photos of the event.Related: Binance scores legal win as UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV lawsuitZhao claims the WSJ report is an “attack” on crypto Zhao claimed the WSJ submitted a list of questions containing what he described as “wrong and negative assumptions.” He and his public relations team responded by pointing out several factual inaccuracies, he said, but concluded that the article was “built on a flawed narrative.”Zhao slammed the WSJ, calling it a “mouthpiece” for anti-crypto forces in the United States. He said the forces behind the publication want to hinder efforts to make the US a crypto capital. “They want to attack crypto, global crypto leaders and the pro-crypto administration,” CZ claimed, saying the article is part of a broader effort to stifle the industry’s growth in the US.This is not the first time Zhao has clapped back at the WSJ recently. In an April 11 report, the publication cited anonymous sources alleging that Zhao agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as he settled with US prosecutors. CZ dismissed the report, saying that people who become government witnesses don’t go to prison and are protected.

Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analystBitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On May 20, the US Senate voted 66-32 in favor of advancing discussion on the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The bill outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics argue that President Trump stands to personally benefit from passing favorable stablecoin regulation.Related: World Liberty Financial brushes off oversight concerns from CongressStablecoin demand surgesThe demand for stablecoins has been on the rise, with nation states adopting and institutions wanting to incorporate stablecoins.The total market capitalization of stablecoins has shot up to $245 billion from $205 billion at the start of the year, representing a 20% increase.Earlier this week, it was reported that yield-bearing stablecoins now account for nearly 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market, with a circulating supply of $11 billion.Austin Campbell, a New York University professor and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting, said the American banking lobby is “panicking,” as stablecoins can disrupt the traditional banking business model.Earlier this month, it was reported that tech giant Meta is exploring ways to incorporate stablecoin payments into its platforms.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-big-banks-in-talks-for-joint-crypto-stablecoin-wsj?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T05:11:25.000Z,"Trendspotting in crypto: How to discover winning projects before the crowd","TL;DRSpotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.So, how do they do it? Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.This guide breaks down how to find crypto projects with real potential using lessons from past winners like Solana, Arbitrum, Chainlink and even memecoins like Pepe. Along the way, it will highlight the tools that matter, red flags to avoid and the difference between organic growth and manufactured buzz.How the real winners took offSolanaWhen Solana launched in 2020, few outside of developer circles had heard of it. But it had one big edge: speed. Solana’s proof-of-history tech made it one of the fastest chains around, and it quickly became a magnet for builders, especially in DeFi and NFTs. By 2021, its ecosystem exploded with apps like Serum and Magic Eden.Early adopters who paid attention to onchain growth — like wallet activity and DEX volume — could see something brewing. Solana (SOL) went from under $1 to $50+ in less than a year. Arbitrum Arbitrum launched in 2021 as an Ethereum layer 2, but its big moment came with the Arbitrum (ARB) token airdrop in March 2023. At launch, Arbitrum was already processing more transactions than many layer 1s and had billions in total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (DApps).Smart investors were watching. Even before the token, the signs were there: user activity, rising liquidity and growing app adoption. When ARB dropped, the pump stuck because the foundation was real.ChainlinkChainlink is a classic example of a project with long-term utility. It doesn’t have flashy branding or meme power, but it does one thing incredibly well: feed real-world data into smart contracts.By 2024, it had become the backbone of much of DeFi, gaming and even tokenized real-world assets. If you were watching closely in 2019-2020, you saw LINK (LINK) getting integrated everywhere. That kind of early utility often flies under the radar — until price action catches up.PEPE Coin (PEPE)Let’s not pretend memes don’t matter. Pepe (PEPE) launched in 2023 with no roadmap, no utility and no VC backing. But it hit a nerve, and the internet ran with it. The coin hit a billion-dollar market cap within weeks.That kind of run is rare — and risky. But for traders tracking social sentiment, wallet distribution and community activity, the early signals were all there. PEPE didn’t promise anything, but it delivered returns by becoming a viral moment.How to find crypto gems earlySo, how do you separate the next Solana from the next rug pull? Here’s how serious trendspotters approach it.1. Start with onchain metricsPublic blockchains are transparent. Use that to look at:Daily active walletsTransaction volumeTokenholder growthLiquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)TVL (for DeFi projects).If users and capital are moving in — before the token moons — that’s a great sign. Tools like Dune Analytics, Nansen and DefiLlama are your best friends here.2. Understand the tokenomicsAsk questions like:What’s the total supply? How much is circulating?Are there upcoming unlocks or vesting cliffs?Who holds the tokens, and how concentrated are the top wallets?Is there utility? Does the token do anything?Tokens with capped supply, smart incentives (like staking or burn mechanisms) and fair distribution models tend to do better long-term.3. Check developer activityIs the team actually building?GitHub is a goldmine. Look at how often code is pushed, how many contributors are active, and whether the repo looks alive. No updates for months? Big red flag.You don’t need to read code — just track commits and releases. Projects with real traction are always shipping.4. Look for ecosystem signalsAre other developers building on top of it? Are DApps launching? Is liquidity growing? Are users coming back week after week?Ecosystem growth is hard to fake, and it’s often the strongest early indicator that a project has legs.5. Follow the communityX, Discord, Telegram, Reddit — yes, it’s noisy. But it’s also where trends start. Look beyond the price talk:Are people actually using the product?Are devs answering questions?Is the tone constructive or just hype?Use LunarCrush or Santiment to track social momentum, but always double-check it with onchain data.Key tools to spot crypto trendsHere’s a quick rundown of the top platforms used by smart crypto trendspotters:Top tip: Don’t just use one tool. Great traders cross-reference everything.Crypto trend analysis 2025A coin might be flying, but is it because people are actually using it or just talking about it? Learning to tell the difference can save you from making a bad investment. Signs of real tractionSteady user growth and TVL over time: If users are showing up before a token pumps — and the numbers keep climbing week over week — that’s usually a sign of substance. You’ll often see this in DeFi protocols or layer 2s gaining trust slowly, not overnight.Code commits and product updates: A live GitHub with regular commits, active devs and visible progress means the team is building. This shows momentum and long-term focus — not just a marketing push.More tokenholders, less whale control: When new holders join steadily — and supply isn’t all locked up by the top five wallets — it’s a healthier setup. Distributed ownership reduces the risk of rug pulls or coordinated dumps.New integrations and ecosystem activity: If other apps are integrating the token or building on the protocol, it usually means the tech is solid and useful. This kind of network effect compounds fast and often precedes a breakout.Liquidity that builds slowly: Gradual increases in liquidity and trading volume tend to reflect real interest. If liquidity sticks around (rather than vanishing after a pump), it’s usually organic.Signs of manufactured hypeSudden spikes in social mentions or trading volume with no news: If the project is everywhere on X overnight, but there’s no product update, launch or roadmap shift, be skeptical. It’s likely a coordinated shill.Influencer spam and recycled talking points: When you see multiple anonymous influencers posting the same meme or catchphrase, that’s a signal someone’s trying to manufacture buzz.No dev activity or roadmap: If there’s no GitHub, no changelog and the team isn’t shipping anything, it’s probably just a hype machine.Anonymous team, outrageous promises: Combine a mystery team with claims like “100x guaranteed,” and you’re likely looking at a cash grab. Real builders let the work speak for itself.Rule of thumb: If the price is moving and everything else — users, devs, integrations — is standing still, you’re looking at hype. But when those fundamentals are quietly ticking up in the background? That’s when it’s worth a closer look.More red flagsSome projects look great on the surface — slick websites, trending hashtags, a fast-moving chart — but fall apart under the hood. Here are some more red flags to watch out for:High holder concentration: If most of the token is sitting in a handful of wallets, it doesn’t take much for a price crash. Whales often buy early and dump on retail.Unverified token contracts: A token that hasn’t been verified on Etherscan or BscScan might hide functions that allow minting, blocking wallets or draining liquidity. Always check the contract or look for an audit.No liquidity lock or audit: If the devs control all the liquidity provider tokens and there’s no lock or time-locked contract, they can pull the rug at any moment. Similarly, no third-party audit? That’s a gamble.Big token unlocks coming up: Large unlocks for insiders or early investors can trigger huge sell-offs. If you’re holding during a major vesting event, you could be exit liquidity. Know the schedule.Top tip: Before you click buy, ask, Who stands to gain the most if this pumps? Who gets hurt if it dumps? If the answer points to a few insiders with heavy bags and zero accountability, walk away.How to spot crypto trends before the crowdThe best early investors are the mechanics looking under the hood. They study token structures and unlock schedules, join communities early to catch signals firsthand, and follow the builders to see who’s actually shipping. Most importantly, they cross-check everything: on-chain data, social sentiment, developer activity, and liquidity. Tools like Dune, DefiLlama, Nansen and GitHub help them separate noise from substance — and spot winners before the crowd does.Crypto rewards those who are curious, critical and a little bit contrarian. The crowd usually shows up late. If you want to find gems before they moon, you’ll need to think independently, dig deeper, and act before the narrative forms.It’s not easy. But it’s doable. And the more you practice spotting early signals — the real ones, not the noise — the more second nature it becomes.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It would also prohibit state officials from advocating or supporting a proposed CBDC from the federal government.The bill defines advocating or supporting a CBDC to involve issuing a memorandum or official statement endorsing a CBDC proposal related to its testing, adoption or implementation.Source: Bitcoin LawsMichigan to consider two crypto mining billsHB 4512, the third crypto bill introduced by a bipartisan group led by Democratic Representative Mike McFall, would create a Bitcoin mining program allowing operators to set up at abandoned oil and gas sites. A supervisor would be assigned to determine how much oil or gas could reasonably be expected to be produced from the site, who the last operator of the site was and how long it has been left unused.Related: US Senate moves forward with GENIUS stablecoin billThose seeking to participate in the program would need to submit legal documents outlining their organizational structure, demonstrate their ability to operate as a Bitcoin mining entity and provide estimates of the breakeven price for a profitable venture.The fourth bill, HB 4513 — also filed by a McFall-led bipartisan group — would amend Michigan’s income tax laws to include income obtained from the proposed Bitcoin mining program.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-four-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel extremely docile and tired, causing him to pass out for around 30 minutes before regaining consciousness.Shortly after Cline woke up, the driver ordered him out of the vehicle. As Cline exited, the driver suddenly sped off, striking him with the car and fleeing with his cellphone, which contained his private keys and access to his crypto accounts.The unfortunate incident comes amid a recent spate of kidnappings, extortion incidents, armed robberies, and ransom attempts directed at crypto industry executives, investors, and their families.

However, Noizat's daughter and another individual were able to fight off the masked attackers.The rise in violent attacks against crypto investors and professionals has prompted an increase in personal security, including requests for bodyguards and private security measures for those likely to be victimized.Magazine: China’s ‘point running’ crypto scams, pig butchers kidnap kids: Asia Express",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-tourist-drugged-fake-uber-driver-robbed-123k-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.“Passing the GENIUS Act without our anti-corruption amendment stamps a Congressional seal of approval on Trump selling access and influence to the highest bidder,” Merkley said in a May 22 X post.Trump his three sons are involved in the crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which launched its USD1 stablecoin in March. Critics have pointed out that the president could continue to personally benefit from legislation that helps recognize stablecoins like USD1 as financial instruments in the US. Related: US lawmaker introduces anti-corruption bill ahead of Trump’s dinnerAn Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said that it would use USD1 to settle a $2-billion investment in Binance, effectively allowing the president’s family to profit from the transaction fees. Democratic lawmakers have already called for an investigation into Trump’s connections to the platform, which was largely dismissed as “flawed” by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff.Stablecoins are just one of many potential conflicts, say DemocratsMerkley and Warren are also planning responses to Trump hosting a dinner at his golf club for up to 220 people who purchased the most significant amounts of his personal memecoin. Merkley is expected to attend a protest organized by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, in partnership with progressive political organization Our Revolution, outside the Trump venue on May 22. Warren held a press conference with Merkley, Senator Chris Murphy and Public Citizen representatives, calling on Trump to “release the guest list” for the dinner event. Though a few of the potential attendees have publicly announced they were the owners of the wallets who purchased the memecoin and intended to go, the majority were still anonymous at the time of publication.“What is happening tonight — this private, secret dinner — in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump’s pocket, get access to him, is maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption,” said Murphy, adding:“They were able to pay their way in to get an audience with the President of the United States to ask for favorable national security concessions.”Cointelegraph reached out to the White House for comment, but had not received a response at the time of publication.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-amendment-genius-act-world-liberty-financial-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Far from being bearish, the current level leaves room for bullish positioning on XRP futures markets.Related: Which senators invest in crypto? 11 lawmakers have blockchain-related investmentsFavorable regulation opens the door for new partnerships and acquisitionsPart of the limited XRP price upside can be explained by the multiple rejections of US Senator Cynthia Lummis, Chair of the US Congress Digital Assets Subcommittee, to meet Ripple representatives. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse asked on May 19 that the lawmaker “reconsider and be a leader for ALL of crypto,” and discuss “how to make the US the crypto capital of the world.”There is nothing stopping XRP from hitting $3.50 or even higher, as Ripple Labs is no longer facing direct threats from regulators, which paves the way for partnerships and acquisitions. Historically, XRP has reacted very positively following those announcements, and the $2.2 billion futures open interest could help catapult XRP price above the current $3.25 all-time high.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, SOL needs a clear market structure break (MSB) or a decisive bullish breakout above $180 to trigger the next leg of the rally. Declining volumes during the consolidation phase suggest caution, as a lack of buying pressure could stall the breakout. If SOL fails to breach $180, the immediate key area of interest is between $140-150, and the bull flag pattern would be invalidated.

2025-05-22T15:00:00.000Z,"Semiconductor exemptions don’t matter when it comes to tariffs","Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyzSemiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to support domestic chip manufacturing. Yet advanced lithography machines — key equipment from countries like the Netherlands and Japan — face 20%–24% tariffs. Ironically, tariffs designed to boost American production increase the cost of essential manufacturing equipment.The effect of new tariffs is already slowing progress in critical supply chains — just as generative AI and large language models are gaining momentum across sectors like finance and defense. Any delays or cost increases now could blunt America’s technological advantage.Indirect costs undermine exemptions for AIModern semiconductor supply chains are global and highly integrated. An exemption on raw silicon means nothing when servers, GPUs and other finished products face steep tariffs. Tariffs indirectly inflate costs, eliminating any competitive advantage from domestic manufacturing.Indirect tariff costs hit high-end systems disproportionately hard. The effect ripples through AI model training, data center expansions and major infrastructure projects, significantly slowing the industry’s momentum.Tariff impasse halts investmentSo far, it’s clear that the US president’s tariff plan didn’t follow any conventional economic trends or calculated strategy. The uncertain tariff situation stalls investment decisions across the technology sector. Companies need predictable costs to justify large capital expenditures. Ongoing tariff volatility prevents them from committing resources to new data centers and manufacturing lines.This mirrors the supply chain chaos of 2020. At that time, uncertainty caused massive order cancellations and slowed industry recovery for years. If tariff ambiguity continues, we could see similar waves of cancellations in 2025. This would further compound existing inventory and revenue issues in the semiconductor sector.Domestic production is not optimalThe border argument for these tariffs is that they’re meant to boost domestic production. They do little, however, to encourage genuine domestic semiconductor production. Despite subsidies under the CHIPS Act, most US semiconductor companies still rely on international foundries for manufacturing. Instead, they face increased equipment and operational costs.Recent: How trade wars impact stocks and cryptoThe idea that tariffs promote domestic production ignores the reality of global semiconductor manufacturing. Costs rise across the board, putting American companies at a disadvantage rather than offering protection.AI projects face heightened riskThe blockchain and crypto sectors, particularly AI-driven projects, also feel the pinch. Projects depend heavily on GPUs and high-performance servers for mining, validating transactions and running decentralized AI computations. Increased hardware costs directly affect profitability and growth, potentially stalling innovation in blockchain applications. AI developments have just started to pick up the pace in the blockchain and Web3 space. The industry saw increased interest from investors and VCs just a year ago. So, they are still on tighter budgets. Elevated costs can, however, lead to stagnation. We might see innovators and developers exiting the market. The ripple effect extends beyond the general technology sector and could threaten future digital economies. Moreover, these cost pressures disproportionately affect startups and smaller tech firms. Industry giants can absorb additional expenses, but innovative, smaller players face existential threats. This dynamic risks stifling innovation at the grassroots level, harming the entire tech ecosystem.What to expect Semiconductors have momentarily escaped direct tariffs, but the exemption provides little benefit. Tariffs continue to hit finished products, driving up indirect costs across the industry. Instead of boosting domestic manufacturing, these tariffs create economic paralysis, stall critical infrastructure projects, and threaten America’s lead in AI innovation. Policymakers must acknowledge these realities and adjust their approach before irreversible damage is done to the nation’s technological future.Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid of O.xyz.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.Source: Raoul Pal“There is some validity to the statement that NFTs, and in extension art, become a vehicle for the wealthy once a certain level of wealth is reached,” wrote Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, calling it a “natural move” for asset diversification.“For traders and investors, further down the wealth curve, NFTs are partially about speculating on future returns,” he told Cointelegraph, adding that NFTs also benefit from the allure of strong communities, beyond just wealth creation.Related: German gov’t missed out on $2.3B profit after selling Bitcoin at $57KArt NFTs may see a resurgence as “digital ownership gains acceptance among younger, tech-savvy cohorts,” if collections manage to move past the “speculative fervor,” according to Anndy Lian, author and intergovernmental blockchain expert.Still, Lian said broader adoption depends on blockchain networks improving scalability and security to “instill confidence.” He added that art NFTs “must transcend hype, anchoring value in cultural significance or utility.”  Beeple’s “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” Source: ChristiesSome digital artists made millions of dollars through NFTs.

2025-05-22T13:30:00.000Z,"How staking incentivizes trust without burning energy","What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.Understanding stakingJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”To help unpack this topic further and examine the deeper mechanics behind staking, the hosts are joined by Noam Nisan, principal researcher at StarkWare and a widely respected computer scientist who has held roles at Google and Princeton.Related: How to handle crypto trading gains and losses on your balance sheet“So we have this general system with operators... Why would they want to do that? The system, the protocol, incentivizes them to actually run the system,” Nisan explained. “Basically, it can give them tokens for operating the system.”Staking offers what Nisan describes as two distinct types of security: computer science-based guarantees and economic disincentives for bad actors. “If a majority or supermajority, maybe two-thirds of the parties of the token of the staked amount are behaving properly... we can prove that the system acts correctly,” he said. “But you also have what I would call an economic guarantee... if they destroy the system, very likely the value of the token... will go down. So they are the one losing.”PoW vs PoSJenkinson, a vocal Bitcoin (BTC) supporter, posed the classic comparison: proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake. “Do you have any strong feelings about one or the other?” he asked.“The truth is that it’s not clear.. it's really a social question, I think.”Nisan noted that both mechanisms involve trade-offs around cost, control, and decentralization. The episode also explores the role of staking in tokenomics and system design. Nisan unpacks how fee mechanics and inflation controls, such as Ethereum’s minting curve, help keep the ecosystem in balance.To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-22T12:38:44.000Z,"UK court partially dismisses Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit against Binance","The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal has partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique cryptocurrency without reasonably similar substitutes,” pointing to the representative’s own use of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as comparators.Sub-class B’s central claim was that delisting led to a missed opportunity to benefit from price appreciation. However, the court determined that those investors had ample chance to mitigate losses by selling or reinvesting in other crypto assets.“They had a duty to mitigate their losses,” wrote Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos. “They cannot recover losses that they could reasonably have mitigated.”UK court ruling against Bitcoin SV investor’s lawsuit.

The court ruled it “flawed as a matter of principle,” noting that “cryptocurrencies are, by their nature, volatile investments.”Binance’s limited strike-out application ultimately succeeded, with the court stating that even if some holders were unaware of the delisting, “they could never claim more than the total value of their holding before the delisting events plus any quantifiable consequential losses.”Related: Binance wants arbitration for all members of securities class suitBinance seeks to dismiss FTX lawsuitOn May 16, Binance filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit filed by the FTX estate, arguing that the claims are legally flawed and an attempt to shift responsibility for FTX’s collapse.The exchange stated the downfall of FTX stemmed from internal fraud, not external manipulation, citing Sam Bankman-Fried’s conviction on multiple fraud charges.Binance has asked the court to dismiss all claims with prejudice.
