2025-06-06T15:57:32,"Trump Media Registers $12 Billion in New Securities Amid Bitcoin Acquisition Plans","Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has filed to register up to $12 billion in new securities following Bitcoin acquisition plans. This move, disclosed in a recent S-3 filing, marks another significant step for the company, which recently concluded a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal. The filing reveals plans to issue up to 84.6 million shares of common stock. However, the offering will not take effect until the SEC grants approval.Bitcoin Treasury Deal and Future AcquisitionsTrump Media’s decision to file for additional securities follows its recent involvement in acquiring Bitcoin. Last week, the company announced a Bitcoin treasury deal valued at $2.3 billion. This move aims to strengthen Trump Media’s capital position, as well as support its future expansion. Notably, the company had previously denied reports suggesting it would raise a larger $3 billion fund for Bitcoin investments. Despite this, the current filing indicates the company’s intention to continue acquiring the cryptocurrency. With this, it positions itself alongside other firms like Strategy , which have adopted similar Bitcoin acquisition strategies.Meanwhile, Trump Media’s growing interest in Bitcoin signals a broader trend among companies exploring ways to integrate the digital currency into their portfolios. Companies such as Marathon Digital and Metaplanet have also engaged in Bitcoin acquisitions.Interestingly, new entrants have emerged. Specifically, KULR Technology entered the scene in December 2024 with $21 million worth of Bitcoin. Acurx Pharmaceuticals and Hoth Therapeutics also announced plans to acquire BTC this year. In addition, gold mining firm Bluebird recently became the latest entrant.Expansion Plans and Capital Markets AccessDevin Nunes, the CEO and President of Trump Media, emphasized the company's focus on securing capital for rapid growth. He mentioned that the capital raised through these initiatives would provide the flexibility needed to acquire valuable assets and increase the company's customer base. This, in turn, is expected to enable Trump Media to tap into capital markets when most advantageous. Nunes highlighted that the company's goal is to ensure financial independence while accelerating its growth trajectory, which is increasingly dependent on acquiring digital assets like Bitcoin.Furthermore, Trump Media's involvement in crypto extends beyond just holding Bitcoin. The company is also exploring the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which could expand its presence in the crypto market. This is in line with other companies offering similar financial products related to Bitcoin.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/06/trump-media-registers-12-billion-in-new-securities-amid-bitcoin-acquisition-plans/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trump-media-registers-12-billion-in-new-securities-amid-bitcoin-acquisition-plans,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T15:49:59,"Ethereum forecast suggests rally to $10k, new DeFi coin poised to soar alongside Tron","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyst sees Ethereum hitting $10k, Tron surging to $1.2; Unilabs Finance gains traction with $2.3m ICO and $30m AUM. A top analyst has discovered a pattern that could propel the Ethereum price to $10,000. Also, the Tron price is expected to surge to $1.2 as user activity on its blockchain explodes. Meanwhile, the spotlight is now shifting toward Unilabs Finance (UNIL) for blending AI and smart investing. Its debut in the crypto space has been terrific: $2.3 million raised in crypto ICO and an AUM of more than $30 million. You might also like: Tron and Unilabs battle set to soar above the $1 mark, Binance Coin suffers volatility Analyst draws a parallel between Ethereum and Bitcoin Ted Pillows, a crypto investor, points out that the Ethereum price has formed four consecutive two-week green candles since its recent bottom. According to him, this pattern closely mirrors Bitcoin’s behavior following the March 2020 crash. Ted said there is a similarity between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025, calling it “mind-blowing.” If history repeats itself, the analyst says the price of Ethereum may follow the same upward trajectory that Bitcoin experienced during the 2020–2021 bull market cycle. Ted forecasts the Ethereum price may soar past $10,000 before the end of the year. MerlijnTrader also posted the same Ethereum price prediction. He noted the altcoin is a good crypto to buy for gains for those who missed out on Bitcoin in 2020. MerlijnTrader forecasts that Ethereum price may rise to $11,000 soon. In the meantime, CoinMarketCap data shows the ETH price has been trading between $2,400 and $2,750 in the past week. Tron Network activity skyrockets, price targets $1 The Tron price has been on an upward surge in the past few days, bouncing off the support level around $0.26. Currently, the Tron price is attempting to surpass the current weekly high of $0.2775. If the Tron price crosses it, the crypto could rise above the $0.28 region. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Tron coin price has rallied by 0.1% on the weekly timeframe and 10.1% on the monthly level. The Tron price continues to show strength amid the ongoing market correction. Data from CryptoQuant also shows Tron’s 50-SMA and 100-SMA active addresses have hit a new all-time high of over 2.4 million. This massive increase favors buying pressure, supporting a Tron price surge. Going forward, Altwolf forecasts the price of Tron could surge to $0.32 if it follows its current ascending channel. Lennaert Snyder, another market commentator, thinks the Tron price may go as high as $1.20 in the coming months. Unilabs Finance, the AI-based DeFi project gaining momentum The upcoming project, Unilabs Finance, is looking to take investment in the crypto space to a new level. The platform merges AI with crypto investment strategies, creating smart, adaptive portfolios. As the global DeFi market is expected to reach $232 billion by 2030, Unilabs is leading the charge as the next big thing in the DeFi space. What sets Unilabs apart is its AI-driven investment funds, which automate exposure to high-growth sectors like BTC, AI tokens, and real-world assets (RWAs), making portfolio management seamless for users. With real yield potential, AI-powered fund strategies, and a strong community push, Unilabs is a smart bet on the future of AI-integrated investment. Unilabs is currently in the cryptocurrency ICO phase, and its UNIL coin is trading at $0.0062. Thanks to a large influx of buyers, the project has raised over $2.3 million. Unilabs Finance has seen faster traction than ADA’s early ICO phase, offering utility, 122% APY staking rewards, and governance rights. Analysts predict that if adoption trends continue, UNIL could reach $0.10 by the end of 2025, driven by rising user demand, platform growth, and limited token supply. Why the new DeFi crypto is gaining investors’ attention While the Ethereum and Tron prices aim for ambitious price targets, Unilabs offers a rare opportunity for early adopters seeking exponential returns. Its AI-powered ecosystem, presale structure, and access to curated investment funds create a unique value proposition. As market attention intensifies, Unilabs could become the surprise giant of 2025. Getting in early might just be the smartest move in the DeFi market right now.

It buttressed Bitcoin’s exceptionalities in a recent Coin Report publication, shared in a Friday tweet . The $6 trillion asset manager discussed the facts, strengths, and weaknesses of the pioneering cryptocurrency, including its potential use case.Bitcoin As a Store of ValueFidelity branded Bitcoin as a potential store of value, a term used to classify assets that retain their purchasing power over time. Interestingly, this distinct quality is rare not just in the digital asset industry but in the global financial market, placing Bitcoin on an exclusive list.Bitcoin has continued to grow over the years, outperforming even the best asset classes globally. Notably, BTC has outpaced even gold, an asset considered the best store of value over the past five years. The leading cryptocurrency has increased by 951% within this timeframe compared to gold’s moderate 57% uptick.Meanwhile, Fidelity buttressed that Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value places it on a superior caliber than other cryptocurrencies. While others, like its closest competitor, Ethereum, have put in strong performances, none has done so on the same level and with the same conviction as the native token of the first fully decentralized electronic payment system.There Is Only One BitcoinFurthermore, the asset manager highlighted Bitcoin’s unique strengths of scarcity, decentralization, and security. For instance, there will only be 21 million of the asset that will ever exist, a demonstration of its finite nature.This limited cap, in addition to Bitcoin’s well-structured issuance rate, drives its value, establishing its role as an emerging store of value and aspiring monetary good. Meanwhile, with demand reaching insane levels, watchers have asserted that we will soon be out of Bitcoin to buy.Bitcoin is also decentralized, spurred by its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. With no singular or central control, the network achieves consensus through a voting process, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly difficult to attack or compromise. The growing number of nodes, miners, and the asset’s price have made it practically and cost-wise impossible for a single individual to control up to 51% of computing power. Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establishes Security Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establish Security Remarkably, this places Bitcoin on track to solve the blockchain trilemma, with its scalability drawdown being the only missing piece. For one, the Bitcoin network ranks as one of the slowest in the sector, with its decentralized nature playing a significant role in this regard. It can process just three to seven transactions per second compared to new chains like Solana, which has a TPS of 4,000.Essentially, Fidelity holds Bitcoin in high regard, projecting that its value will continue to rise in line with its growing utility and scarcity. While it did not predict the asset’s price trajectory, there are predictions that it would rally to $200,000 this year and $1.5 million in the next five years.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/06/bitcoin-potential-as-a-store-of-value-sets-it-apart-from-other-digital-assets-fidelity/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-potential-as-a-store-of-value-sets-it-apart-from-other-digital-assets-fidelity,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

We’re proposing to lift the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes (cETNs), to retail investors. Consumers would be informed of risks in the same way as when buying cryptoassets directly. https://t.co/myKza5dp9a #cryptoassets #CryptoETNs #CryptoRegulation #FCAGrowth pic.twitter.com/UbOXbhW2oc — Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) June 6, 2025 If the plan goes ahead, retail investors in the UK would once again be able to buy crypto ETNs—something they haven’t been allowed to do since the 2021 ban . The FCA has put the change out for comment as part of a broader look at how to encourage digital-finance innovation while still protecting consumers. ETNs tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether could then list on FCA-approved markets such as the London Stock Exchange, giving everyday investors the same access professionals already enjoy. A Shift From Past Caution to Measured Access When the FCA originally introduced the ban on crypto derivatives and ETNs for retail investors in 2021, it did so on the grounds of consumer protection. At the time, the regulator warned that cryptoassets were “ill-suited for retail consumers,” citing concerns about high volatility, market manipulation, and a lack of reliable valuation. However, in its latest statement, the FCA acknowledges that the market has evolved. “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry,” said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” The proposed changes would apply only to crypto ETNs traded on FCA-approved investment exchanges. The broader ban on crypto derivatives, such as options and futures, for retail customers will remain in place. Safeguards and Rules for Retail Access Should the FCA lift the ban, the sale of crypto ETNs to retail investors would still be subject to strict conditions. Only products listed on a recognised investment exchange (RIE) would be permitted, and all firms offering them would need to comply with financial promotion rules. The rules seek to ensure investors grasp the risks. They call for plain-language disclosures and ban gimmicky incentives or misleading ads, much like the safeguards that already cover direct crypto purchases. Crypto ETNs function as bank-issued debt notes that track digital-asset prices, letting investors follow the market without holding the coins themselves. They’re already traded in the EU and the US, where demand for regulated crypto products keeps rising. Boosting the UK’s Crypto Ambitions The FCA’s proposal supports the UK government’s broader ambition to become a global hub for cryptoasset technology and innovation. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly stated his commitment to fostering a more competitive regulatory environment for digital finance in the UK. Industry leaders have welcomed the FCA’s willingness to revisit earlier restrictions. “This is a step in the right direction for UK crypto policy,” said one digital asset fund manager. “It gives investors more choice and shows the FCA is willing to adapt to a changing market.” The consultation period will remain open until later this year, with a final decision expected in early 2026. If approved, crypto ETNs could return to the UK retail market soon after, opening new regulated investment pathways for everyday investors seeking exposure to digital assets.

The latest decline has managed to push this meme coin’s year-to-date losses to 41.5% again. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have surged by nearly 78% as the sell-off intensified yesterday afternoon. On-chain data indicates that a significant amount of tokens are held by investors are held by investors with a cost basis ranging from $0.000012 to $0.000013. Hence, this may be a heavily defended price zone where trading volumes may skyrocket. This favors a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast in the near term as bulls will do their best to keep their positions afloat and in green territory to avoid a long squeeze. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can the #ShibArmy Keep the Price Above $0.00001200? The #ShibArmy, the community that backs this meme coin, is one of the strongest in the crypto space. Its social media accounts are followed by millions and more than 1.5 million accounts hold $SHIB at press time. In addition, the project recently launched the ShibaDAO – a decentralized governance entity that has effectively surrendered the project’s reins to the community. If the army closes ranks at this point, they could manage to keep the price up through a concerted effort. The daily chart shows that SHIB broke its trend line support in the past few days and has also dropped below its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs). The price has found support at $0.00001200 for now and rose strongly during the Asian session as bulls seem determined to hold their ground at this level. SHIB could be pushed to retest its former trend line support from below. If it rejects it, we could draft a Shiba Inu price prediction of $0.00001050 as this is the nearest area where the token has found support after a bearish breakout below $0.00001200. This meme coin’s upside potential seems capped at the moment. However, Bitcoin’s path to new all-time highs has been paved lately. One meme coin stands to gain if BTC rises to $125,000 in the next few weeks. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the name of one of the hottest crypto presales of the year . Its innovative rewards system tied to the performance of the top crypto has attracted nearly $7 million from investors already. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Hands Out Rewards Every Time Bitcoin Hits a Price Milestone BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a fun and innovative way to profit from Bitcoin’s rally to new heights. The reward mechanism is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked for every additional $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once the price rises to $150,000, token holders will receive a direct Bitcoin airdrop. To buy this meme coin and start generating passive income once Bitcoin reaches new milestones, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Back then, the crypto market took a sharp downturn in 2022—thanks in part to FTX’s collapse—and the timeline slipped. Still, Draper believes today’s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper’s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn’t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn’t happen—2022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a “recent surge” in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: → General optimism… pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become “infinite against the dollar,” arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn’t exist. His confident tone suggests he’s sticking with the same numbers—$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media & Technology Group’s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66–32 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs—like BlackRock’s IBIT—as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token.

He talked about Web3 apps built on Bitcoin and said “Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum.” Right now, Lightning Network handles many Bitcoin transactions, making payments faster and cheaper.

2025-06-06T15:25:05,"K-Pop’s K Wave Media Plans $500M Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","K Wave Media’s Stock Skyrocket by 143% K Wave Media, a NASDAQ-listed company, recently agreed to sell up to $500 million of its common stock to Bitcoin Strategic Reserve KWM, intending to reinvest the proceeds into Bitcoin. With the trend of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries gaining steam, K Wave Media doesn’t want to be left out because it plans to be the “Metaplanet of Korea.” Choi Pyeungho, the KVM board chairman, welcomed this move, and stated , “K Wave Media’s bold adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset is a visionary move that signals the growing convergence between digital media and decentralized finance. We are proud to support K Wave’s mission to lead Web3 integration in the content space and believe this strategy will create strong, long-term value for its shareholders.” This strategic move has paid off since the entertainment company’s stock surged by 143%, illustrating heightened market optimism. By holding Bitcoin as a primary corporate reserve asset, K Wave Media sees this as a stepping stone towards heightened innovation and forward-thinking asset management. Ted Kim, the co-interim CEO of K Wave Media, believes that adding Bitcoin on the balance sheet not only strengthens the company’s commitment to decentralization, agility, and forward-looking value creation, but also reimagines the future of media. This is because Bitcoin is more than a store of value—it’s a catalyst for innovation, independence, and global scalability. Meanwhile, French footballing giant Paris Saint-Germain recently unveiled its Bitcoin treasury before the Champions League Final , which it ultimately won against Inter Milan of Italy. Why is the Demand for a Bitcoin Treasury Going Through the Roof? In an era of accelerating inflation, currency devaluation, and global economic uncertainty, companies are rethinking their cash management strategies. Enter the Bitcoin treasury: a revolutionary approach that is reshaping corporate finance. Traditionally, companies have held large amounts of cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheets, typically in fiat currencies like the US dollar. However, as central banks print more money and real interest rates remain historically low or even negative, these holdings often lose value over time. To combat this erosion, forward-thinking companies are now turning to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Bitcoin offers several advantages that make it an attractive addition to corporate treasuries. First, its fixed supply — capped at 21 million coins — ensures scarcity, which protects against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed at will, Bitcoin’s issuance schedule is transparent and predictable. This built-in scarcity has fueled its rise as a digital store of value akin to digital gold. Second, Bitcoin is highly liquid and globally transferable, making it easy to buy, sell, or move across borders, even during times of financial stress. Its decentralized nature means it is not subject to any single government’s monetary policy or capital controls — a major plus for companies operating internationally. Third, Bitcoin’s historical performance has outpaced most traditional asset classes. While its volatility is higher than that of fiat currencies or bonds, its long-term returns have often made it a compelling hedge against currency debasement and an effective diversification tool. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have led the charge, converting portions of their cash reserves into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has argued that Bitcoin is “digital property” superior to cash, while Tesla’s 2021 Bitcoin purchase showcased how even large, mainstream companies are willing to embrace this new paradigm. MicroStrategy recently unveiled a $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition strategy , meant to boost its equity-issuance plan. Conclusion As the corporate treasury BTC gains steam, K Wave Media sees it as an innovation that will enhance its media prowess. While Bitcoin treasuries are not without risks — including regulatory scrutiny and price volatility — they represent a forward-looking strategy that aligns with the digital transformation of finance. As more companies realize the potential of Bitcoin to protect against inflation and preserve purchasing power, Bitcoin treasuries might become an increasingly mainstream component of corporate finance.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9473/k-pop-s-k-wave-media-plans-500-m-bitcoin-treasury-strategy,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T15:25:00,"Romania Leads Eastern Europe With Postal Bitcoin ATM Rollout","A line of text in a paragraph.In a drive that combines tradition and digital innovation, Romania's state post office, Poșta Română, has introduced its first Bitcoin ATM at a branch in Tulcea — becoming the first public institution in the country to provide cryptocurrency services to regular citizens directly. This pilot, rolled out in cooperation with leading local exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR/Tradesilvania), is the beginning of the extensive rollout to cities including Alexandria, Piatra Neamț, Botoșani, and Nădlac, with a view to bridging the digital divide and increasing financial inclusion across the nation. The procedure was as simple as making a withdrawal from an old-fashioned ATM for most Romanians. ”I paid my mobile phone bill and saw the new machine,” said Andrei, 31, from Tulcea. ”I've heard of Bitcoin, but never paid with it. I spent my first 0.001 BTC today — just to see how it works.” The network, powered by the backend of Bitcoin Romania, allows one to buy or sell Bitcoin with cash, read a wallet QR code, and make transactions in minutes. The ATM is accessibility-focused, with Romanian language interface and step-by-step instructions, ID verification for higher amounts to comply with local KYC/AML laws. The partnership is strategic for both sides. Poșta Română with its large coverage and reputable public image is taking its service bouquet into the digital age to woo new clients and increase digital maturity. For Bitcoin Romania, the collaboration means rapid expansion into underserved regions and a chance to reach new demographics. “We’re bringing crypto to the people, not just the cities,” said Constantin Rotariu, co-founder of Bitcoin Romania. “This is about access, education, and building trust in digital finance.” Fees for the new ATM are competitive in European terms — typically between 4% and 7% per transaction, the same or slightly lower than the EU-wide average for Bitcoin ATMs. While exchanges online are still cheaper, convenience and cash availability are worth the premium for users, especially for those with limited easy access to online banking. “I’d rather pay a bit more and know my transaction is instant and secure,” said Maria, a retiree who used the ATM to send Bitcoin to her grandson in Germany. Romania’s move comes as crypto adoption accelerates in Eastern Europe, with the region seeing $499 billion in crypto inflows over the past year and a growing appetite for decentralized finance. Over 600,000 Romanians now hold investments in cryptocurrency, and the country is aligning with the EU's MiCA framework, paving the way for larger-scale public-sector involvement. The postal pilot is considered a blue print for other EU countries, a tangible, trustworthy point of entry to digital assets for city and countryside. Among social media, the launch has created buzz and curiosity. The rollout of Romania’s first postal Bitcoin ATM quickly sparked excitement and curiosity both online and in Tulcea itself. Locals snapped photos and shared their first impressions, with many praising the ATM’s clear instructions and the helpfulness of post office staff. On X, @BTC_Europe summed up the mood: “Romania’s post office just installed a Bitcoin ATM. This is how you bring crypto to the masses!” Across Facebook and Telegram, users discussed the convenience of handling crypto in a trusted public setting, seeing it as a sign that digital assets are finally reaching everyday Romanians.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9471/romania-leads-eastern-europe-with-postal-bitcoin-atm-rollout,"BTC|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T15:14:12,"Six-Figure Bitcoin Call Options Surge as Traders Chase $100K+","Notably, Bitcoin's recent ascent past the $100,000 mark has reignited bullish enthusiasm. This upward trajectory has led traders to anticipate further gains, prompting increased interest in high-strike call options as a means to capitalize on potential price surges. Are Bitcoin’s Speculative Bets on the Extreme Side? Since some traders are placing ambitious bets, such as options wagering on Bitcoin reaching $300,000, a 190% increase from its current value of $103,249, these positions, while highly speculative, reflect a segment of the market banking on significant price movements. Buying a $300,000 Bitcoin call option is a bullish bet on Bitcoin’s price exceeding that strike price before the option expires on June 27, which is three weeks away. Notably, if Bitcoin’s price rises above $300,000 before expiration, the buyer can buy BTC at the strike price ($300,000) and then immediately sell it at the higher market price, capturing a profit. On the contrary, if Bitcoin’s price stays below $300,000, the option would not be worthwhile because BTC would be cheaper in the open market, causing the option buyer to lose the premium paid. Bitcoin’s Market Volatility and Leverage The surge in Bitcoin’s high-strike call options also reflects the market's volatility and the use of leverage. While these instruments offer the potential for significant gains, they also carry substantial risks. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to take a wait-and-see approach based on various on-chain metrics. For instance, BTC will need to break above the $106,000 zone for short-term momentum as Bollinger Bands continue narrowing, which indicates volatility compression. The wait-and-see approach is cemented by the fact that institutional demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are cooling off. For instance, CoinShares revealed that institutional exposure to Bitcoin fell to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025, down from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024, representing a 23% drop. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s profit-taking activity among large players has been going through the roof with hourly cash outs hitting $500 million multiple times. Historic Price Levels, Institutional Momentum, and New National Strategies Fuel Bitcoin's Path Beyond $100,000 Bitcoin's performance above $100,000 is underpinned by robust institutional investment, strategic governmental actions, favorable supply dynamics, and positive market sentiment. Traders and analysts anticipate further gains, driven by these factors: 1. Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024 has significantly bolstered institutional participation. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have launched Bitcoin ETFs, attracting substantial inflows. These ETFs collectively hold BTC worth $122.1 billion , accounting for approximately 5.94% of the total supply, effectively reducing market liquidity and supporting price appreciation. 2. U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, utilizing over 200,000 BTC seized by federal agencies. This move positions Bitcoin to be part of the mainstream economy alongside traditional reserve assets like gold, signaling governmental endorsement and potentially encouraging other nations to consider similar reserves. 3. Post-Halving Supply Constraints Bitcoin's fourth halving in April 2024 reduced the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, decreasing the rate of new supply. Historically, such halvings have preceded significant bull runs, as reduced supply amid steady or increasing demand exerts upward pressure on prices. 4. Accumulation by Long-Term Holders On-chain data indicates a resurgence in accumulation among long-term holders (LTHs). Glassnode's Accumulation Trend Score has reached its maximum value of 1.0, reflecting strong buying activity. Over the past 90 days, more than 374,000 BTC have transitioned into long-term holdings, suggesting growing investor confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value. 5. Bullish Market Sentiment Market analysts project continued price appreciation. Galaxy Digital's Alex Thorn forecasts Bitcoin potentially reaching $185,000 by the end of 2025. Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital envisions a target of $200,000, citing increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory developments. 6. Supportive Regulatory Environment The current U.S. administration's pro-crypto stance has fostered a regulatory environment conducive to digital asset growth. Initiatives like the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the disbanding of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team reflect a shift towards embracing blockchain technologies, potentially attracting further investment. Conclusion The explosion in $100K–$300K Bitcoin call options underscores a market characterized by optimism and speculative fervor as traders remain positive that BTC will continue trading above the psychological price of $100,000. Nevertheless, this crypto bull case should not underscore the inherent risks triggered by the market’s volatile nature.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9472/six-figure-bitcoin-call-options-surge-as-traders-chase-100-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T15:12:11,"Ex-Ripple exec’s company to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategy","While Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook is the talk of Wall Street, another U.S.-listed company, Know Labs, is set to join the growing list of publicly traded Bitcoin treasury companies. Former Ripple chief risk officer Greg Kidd is set to acquire Know Labs Inc., a medical device company that offers non-invasive health monitoring solutions, and adopt a Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury strategy. Know Labs announced the news on June 6, stating that Goldeneye 1995 LLC, an affiliate of Greg Kidd, has agreed to acquire a majority stake. Once the deal closes, the former Ripple executive will become the new chief executive officer and chairman of Know Labs. The acquisition will be completed using a mix of Bitcoin and cash, with Know Labs deploying Goldeneye’s 1,000 BTC payment as part of its treasury strategy. Investors in the company will gain “significant economic exposure to this highly attractive digital asset,” Know Labs wrote in a press release. You might also like: Trump Media files Form S-3 with U.S. SEC over $2.3B raise for Bitcoin treasury Know Labs is Greg Kidd’s latest crypto-related venture. The co-founder and CEO of venture capital firm Hard Yaka has backed several crypto companies, including Ripple, Coinbase, Robinhood, Uphold, and Solana. He previously served in the Federal Reserve’s payments division. His move to take a Bitcoin strategy approach may be inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has amassed a massive haul of BTC since first buying the asset in August 2020.. “I’m thrilled to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy with the support of a forward-looking organization like Know Labs at a time when market and regulatory conditions are particularly favorable,” Kidd said. Know Labs’ Bitcoin holdings will account for 82% of its $128 million market cap once the BTC is added to the balance sheet. This will give the company a net asset value multiple of 1.22x, based on a BTC price of $105,000 at closing. Know Labs expects the transaction to close in Q3 2025, subject to shareholder approval and the finalization of customary closing conditions.

2025-06-06T15:10:21,"Publicly Listed UK Gold Mining Firm to Convert Its Gold Revenue to Bitcoin for Reserve","Bluebird, a UK-listed gold mining company, has announced plans to use the money it earns from gold to build Bitcoin reserves. The company disclosed this in a brief release on X. However, Jonathan Morley-Kirk, the company's Non-executive Chairman, presented more details in a follow-up statement. Bluebird on X Bluebird Eyeing a Bitcoin StrategyMorley-Kirk explained that Bluebird, which runs gold projects across Asia, sees this as the right moment to rethink its approach.Bluebird believes it makes sense to shift toward a strategy that includes both gold and Bitcoin. Morley-Kirk pointed out that gold has long served as a reliable store of value and remains an important asset for central banks and investors. However, he also stressed how Bitcoin's role in the financial scene keeps growing, especially as more people look for ways to protect their money from inflation, rising debt, and global uncertainty. Bluebird sees Bitcoin not as a threat to gold but as a modern counterpart, and the company plans to convert future gold revenue into Bitcoin, treating it as digital gold.Bitcoin Outperforms GoldNotably, Bitcoin has outperformed gold over the past decade, with proponents such as Strategy's Michael Saylor claiming that its volatility makes it better. Recently, Bitwise projected Bitcoin to grow 53.1% annually in the next decade, while it predicted gold to drop 3.6% within this period. Bluebird will not just buy Bitcoin occasionally. Specifically, it wants to hold it as part of its balance sheet, using it as a treasury reserve. The company believes this strategy, paired with low overhead costs, sets it apart from other UK-listed mining firms. To help lead the way, Bluebird is searching for a new CEO who understands digital assets and can help build this strategy from the ground up. Aidan Bishop, the Executive Director and Interim CEO, supports this. He said he believes Bitcoin will reshape financial markets and help Bluebird attract a new kind of investor. Multiple Firms Now Joining the Bitcoin Strategy Campaign This move puts Bluebird in line with a growing list of companies building Bitcoin into their financial playbooks. Just last month, DDC, an Asian food company, bought 21 Bitcoin and set a target of 500 BTC in six months and 5,000 BTC in three years. Just days back, SolarBank, a North American engineering firm, also adopted a Bitcoin treasury plan. While it hasn't shared details yet, the company confirmed that it sees Bitcoin as a major part of its financial future.These firms follow in the footsteps of others who jumped into Bitcoin in 2024. KULR Technology Group began buying Bitcoin in December and committed to putting up to 90% of its extra cash into it. By the end of that month, it had already bought 217.18 BTC worth about $21 million. Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Hoth Therapeutics, and LQR House also approved plans to buy Bitcoin, each starting with at least $1 million.According to Bitcoin Treasuries, 225 entities now hold Bitcoin. Of those, 124 are public companies, which together own more than 816,000 BTC, worth over $85 billion. Private firms make up 34 of the holders. Altogether, these 225 entities control 3.4 million Bitcoin, accounting for more than 17% of the total coins in circulation.

2025-06-06T15:08:09,"Top 3 reasons why the crypto market is down today","The crypto market retreated after Thursday’s trading session, with Bitcoin falling to a low of $100,470, marking its lowest point since May 8 and 10% below its highest level this year. Below are three reasons why the crypto market was trading lower. 1. Profit taking Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins pulled back due to profit-taking among investors after the recent rally. BTC had climbed roughly 50% from its April low to its May high. Similarly, Ethereum jumped 100% from its April lows to the highest point in May. Many smaller coins, including Dogwifhat and Fartcoin, were up over 300%. It is common for cryptocurrencies to retreat after a strong surge. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said in a Thursday note to crypto.news: “After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.” Uncertainty on Federal Reserve policy Cryptocurrencies also declined amid growing uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have indicated they are not in a rush to cut rates, contrary to suggestions from President Trump. Instead, they are monitoring the effects of tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Data released on Friday showed that the economy added 139,000 jobs in May, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2% The U.S. will release updated inflation data on Wednesday next week. If inflation comes in higher than expected, it could signal that the Fed will hold rates higher for longer, pressuring crypto prices. Conversely, a lower-than-expected inflation figure would raise the odds of the Fed cutting rates sooner than anticipated. You might also like: Circle stock price pump gains steam, but a crash may follow Geopolitical uncertainty Bitcoin and altcoins have also dropped due to ongoing geopolitical tensions involving the United States. The Trump administration recently announced export curbs on key technologies to China. In response, China has withheld the supply of rare earth elements used in multiple industries. While Xi Jinping and Trump spoke on Thursday, signs suggest that these trade tensions will persist. Cryptocurrencies and equities typically perform better when geopolitical tensions are minimal. For instance, both markets rallied in May as tensions eased ahead of and following the U.S.-China meeting in Switzerland. Bitcoin price signals recovery BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be poised for a rebound, potentially reaching a new all-time high. The daily chart shows that BTC found support at the 50-day moving average and is beginning to form a bullish engulfing pattern. It’s also shaping the handle portion of a cup-and-handle pattern—a popular bullish continuation setup. The upper boundary is around $109,300, while the lower boundary sits near $74,387, giving the formation a depth of nearly $35,000. Adding that depth to the upper edge projects a potential target of $144,000. Most altcoins are likely to rebound if this plays out.

2025-06-06T15:07:09,"Donald Trump-Elon Musk Debate Hits Cryptocurrency Markets Too! Millions of Dollars Became Liquid! Here Are the Details","The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive liquidation wave over the past 24 hours, with more than 223,300 investors liquidating their positions, totaling over $980.9 million. Near $1 Billion Daily Liquidation in Crypto Market: Overly Leveraged Long Positions Rattled by Macro Concerns According to data shared by Coinglass, these liquidations were largely caused by over-leveraged long positions. According to experts, since the disclosed data only includes publicly available data, the actual amount of liquidation is probably higher than this figure. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu evaluated this sharp decline as follows: “The $980 million liquidation event was a perfect storm of Trump-Musk tensions, macroeconomic fears about tariffs, and an overleveraged market. The inherent fragility in crypto markets caused automated liquidations to quickly turn into a chain reaction, turning a sentiment-based pullback into a flash market crash.” While $876.2 million of the total liquidation came from long positions, the cryptocurrency most affected was Bitcoin. On the BTC side, $341.7 million worth of liquidation occurred. Approximately 90% of this amount originated from long positions. Ether (ETH) came in second with $285.6 million in liquidation. Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) were among the other major altcoins where significant positions were liquidated. According to Vincent Liu, the sharp declines in BTC and ETH caused excessive optimism in the market to work against investors: “Investors who used excessive leverage were caught off guard by the sharp corrections in Bitcoin and Ether, which led to bullish sentiment accelerating the market crash.” Trump-Musk Conflict and Macro Developments Were Effective Cryptocurrency prices have gained momentum in recent weeks, allowing Bitcoin to reach an all-time high of $111,800. However, the correction process that followed this peak accelerated after the social media debate between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Markets have been on edge after Musk’s harsh criticism of Trump’s tax and spending bill, calling it a “disgusting disgrace.” Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000, its lowest level since early May, but has recovered to $103,333 by press time. Nick Ruck, Director of LVRG Research, commented on the background of the decline as follows: “Bitcoin’s price had been hovering around support levels since its peak two weeks ago. Investors were nervous about possible corrections. The dispute between Trump and Musk triggered widespread liquidations, raising concerns about potential mutual sanctions.” Investors are now looking ahead to U.S. employment data and consumer price index (CPI) data due June 11. These data could be important catalysts for the next big price move, Kronos CIO Liu said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-06T15:02:28,"Bitcoin price prediction in June 2025 – bulls close to reclaiming a key level before new ATH?","Bitcoin made a new all-time high of $111,970.17, exactly 13 days ago, and since then it has formed a clear ranging price action. Bulls are aiming for another all-time high, while bears are hoping that price can retrace below the $100k level and beyond. Let’s find out which scenario is more probable in this BTC price prediction. Table of Contents What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin short-term price prediction Bitcoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook BTC price factors for June 2025 Currently ranked at the 1st position with a market cap of $2.1 trillion, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has enjoyed a decent bull run so far with prices reaching $111,970.17, two weeks ago, which also marked its all-time high. Since then the token has seen a 6.45% drop in prices and is currently trading at $104,743, and still in an uptrend on all major HTF timeframes. BTC 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the BTC price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Bitcoin price prediction in June 2025. What is Bitcoin? An individual or group of individuals going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto first detailed the decentralized cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin in a whitepaper published in 2008. It was introduced shortly thereafter, in January 2009. Being a peer-to-peer internet currency, BTC eliminates the need for an intermediary to approve or facilitate transactions by allowing them to occur directly between equal, independent network participants. As Nakamoto himself stated, the purpose of BTC was to enable “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” BTC is the first cryptocurrency to be used in practice, while there have been other ideas for a similar kind of decentralized electronic currency before it. Now let’s discuss BTC price prediction in June 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused uncertainty in international markets for years. Decentralized assets like BTC, which some view as a hedge against the economic instability brought on by wars and geopolitical unrest, have become more popular as a result of this circumstance. Markets have also been tense due to trade concerns between major economies including the US and China as well as the uncertainties surrounding tariffs. The general volatility in conventional markets frequently increases BTC’s appeal as an alternative investment, even though recent pauses in the escalation of tariffs between these two countries have generated short-term optimism. Concerns about inflation continue to influence global monetary policy on the macroeconomic level. In an effort to find a balance between containing inflation and promoting economic growth, central banks—including the US Federal Reserve—have been more cautious when it comes to raising interest rates. BTC’s function as a store of value is becoming more and more alluring to investors wishing to protect their investment as inflation continues to be a major worry. However, the asset class is maturing as a result of significant institutional usage of BTC, as demonstrated by Bitcoin ETFs and incorporation into payment systems, as well as increased regulatory clarity. But given the ongoing turbulence in both the conventional and cryptocurrency markets, it appears that BTC’s future is still dependent on the more uncertain global economic landscape. Immediate Support and Resistance Levels Key resistance level for BTC is the 107k level, while its key support is around the 100k level. The break of either of these levels can spark a trend shift in either direction as shown by the charts below. BTC 1D chart – Source: Tradingview A break of 100k support can take BTC to its next nearest support of 96k-92k level. BTC 2h chart – Source: Tradingview A break of 107k resistance can take BTC to its all-time high around $112k and beyond.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including BTC, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the BTC token. Will Bitcoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the BTC token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new integrations in new world companies, increased token holders, and so on. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for BTC price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low BTC can go. Should I invest in Bitcoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any BTC price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the BTC token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Despite earlier expectations, U.S. jobs data was not the major crypto market mover this week. On Friday, June 6, U.S. hiring slowed, with employers adding 139,000 new jobs . While this figure was lower than the revised 147,000 for April, it was still slightly above the forecasted range of 125,000 to 130,000. U.S non-farm payroll monthly change, seasonally adjusted | Source: BLS At the same time, the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, a relatively low figure for the metric. Notably, government jobs accounted for 22,000 of the jobs lost, painting an even stronger picture for the private sector. While these figures are not particularly bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) , they are unlikely to have triggered the recent market slump.

Still, macro factors will continue to play a key role in Bitcoin’s performance in the near future. Bitcoin traders anticipate the Fed’s next moves With the jobs data meeting expectations, the Federal Reserve will likely maintain its cautious stance on interest rates. According to analysts at Bitfinex , the jobs figure is one of the key metrics the Fed uses to guide its policy direction. Relatively strong employment data means the Fed feels less pressure to reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy. Instead, it will likely remain laser-focused on inflation, which it sees as a major risk tied to Trump’s trade policy. In this context, high interest rates will likely help strengthen the dollar and weigh on Bitcoin ETF flows. Still, the macro environment remains in flux, and reversals are more than possible. At this time, even the Fed is cautious about shifting its policy in either direction.

2025-06-06T15:00:45,"DOGE/BTC Pair Forms New Lower Low – What It Means For Dogecoin Price","The relationship between Dogecoin and Bitcoin is about to take an interesting turn, as the DOGE/BTC trading pair flashes a technical pattern that has always preceded major rallies for the price of Dogecoin. According to a recent analysis shared by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade on X, the latest drop in the DOGE/BTC pair may not be a bearish sign. Instead, it could be the start of something much bigger for DOGE. DOGE/BTC Prints Lower Low Again A notable pattern appears when examining the weekly candlestick timeframe price chart for Dogecoin. Before each of Dogecoin’s explosive price surges, the DOGE/BTC pair tends to slide lower to form new lows. At the same time, DOGE’s price in USD begins to trend upward. This divergence has been observed multiple times, most recently before the surges in early and late 2024, and it appears to be forming once again. Trader Tardigrade’s chart illustrates this recurring structure in Dogecoin’s price behavior. The upper half of the chart highlights Dogecoin’s USD chart with multiple strong bullish moves. Interestingly, each pump is preceded by a distinct downtrend in the DOGE/BTC ratio displayed in the lower half of the chart. The latest series of lower lows on the DOGE/BTC chart indicates that Bitcoin is currently outpacing Dogecoin in relative performance; however, if history is a determinant, the situation may change soon. If this pattern plays out again, the meme coin may be building momentum for a fresh upward phase that will finally push its price beyond notable resistance levels in the $0.20 range and toward multi-month highs. This outlook is also relayed by analyst Trader Tardigrade, who noted that the current setup suggests that “a massive pump is ahead.” Price Target For Next Dogecoin Move At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.1758, reflecting a decline of about 7.3% over the past 24 hours. The coin’s price has fluctuated between $0.1698 and $0.1921 during this period, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2 billion. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently on a 1.4% decline in the past 24 hours. The leading cryptocurrency has fluctuated from an intraday high of $105,888 to as low as $100,783, before recovering slightly to $103,200 at the time of writing. Unsurprisingly, this wide range has also been reflected in the price of every other cryptocurrency around the board. Notably, this recent 24-hour price action has caused Dogecoin to extend its recent low against Bitcoin, with the DOGE/BTC pair currently trading at 0.00000170. If this lower low on the DOGE/BTC pair once again acts as a precursor to a price reversal, it could set the stage for another DOGE price breakout. Based on this setup, Trader Tardigrade projected a Dogecoin price rally to new all-time highs above $0.70.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-btc-new-lower-low/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|bitcoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|DOGE/BTC|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare

The Strategy chairman expressed this view during a recent CNBC Squawk Box interview , where he provided a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. During the interview, Saylor recounted the previous prediction he laid out for BTC at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. At the 2024 conference, Saylor predicted that Bitcoin would grow by 29% on average each year over the next 21 years. He suggested that factors such as Bitcoin education and rising institutional demand for the asset could propel BTC’s price to the $13 million target by 2045. Bullish on $13M Bitcoin Price Forecast While his previous forecast triggered mixed reactions at the time, Saylor has once again backed the prediction. The Bitcoin evangelist emphasized that he is more bullish on the prediction due to the positive market developments over the past six months. Regulatory Clarity for BTC He mentioned that the current U.S. administration now recognizes Bitcoin as a top digital commodity, providing regulatory clarity for the firstborn crypto. Banks Now Allowed to Hold Bitcoin Additionally, he noted that the banking regulator has authorized banks in the United States to hold Bitcoin. Recall that in April, the Federal Reserve withdrew 95% of its anti-crypto rules. These include the 2022 and 2023 supervisory letters, which required banks to notify the central bank before engaging in crypto-related activities. With the rules rescinded, banks can now engage freely in crypto activities without informing the Fed. Growing Institutional Adoption Furthermore, Saylor indicated that there is strong institutional adoption for Bitcoin. According to him, more than 100 public companies currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, with new firms adopting the asset every week. He also highlighted the massive inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. As of press time, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $44.29 billion in net inflows and hold $122.98 billion in net assets.Supply Squeeze According to Saylor, another factor making him more bullish on the $13 million Bitcoin price forecast is the asset’s supply squeeze. He opined that only about 450 Bitcoins are made available for sale daily. The Strategy chairman noted that Bitcoin treasury companies and Bitcoin ETF issuers quickly buy these 450 BTC. Based on these positive developments, Saylor said he is more bullish on the possibility of Bitcoin reaching the $13 million target by 2045, 20 years from now. Interestingly, he raised his expected average annual return for Bitcoin from 29% to 40%, which suggests that BTC could reach the $13 million target sooner. Hitting the $13 million target demands a surge of 12,328% from the current price of $104,596.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/06/michael-saylor-says-hes-more-bullish-on-13m-bitcoin-price-forecast-heres-why/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=michael-saylor-says-hes-more-bullish-on-13m-bitcoin-price-forecast-heres-why,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

However, there is a silver lining to all of this, which is that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is now testing the major support of $101-98k. Analysts predict a pump and memes like Doge may run hard when BTC stabilizes. Let’s find out from which areas that can happen in this Dogecoin price prediction. Table of Contents What is Doge? Doge short-term price prediction Doge coin price prediction: short-term outlook DOGE price factors for June 2025 Currently ranked at the 9th position with a market cap of $26.22 billion, Doge ( DOGE ) has enjoyed a decent bull run so far with prices reaching $0.48562 in December 2024, four months ago. Since then the token has seen a 63.90% drop in prices and is currently trading at $0.17557. DOGE 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the DOGE price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Dogecoin price prediction in June 2025. What is Doge? DOGE has a Shiba Inu in its logo and is based on the well-known “doge” Internet meme. In December 2013, Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon, developed the open-source digital currency, which was a fork of Litecoin. Because Dogecoin was based on a dog joke, its developers envisioned it as a playful cryptocurrency that would appeal to a wider range of users than just the core Bitcoin audience. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, stated on social media that his favorite coin is Dogecoin in multiple tweets. On Reddit and Twitter, DOGE has mostly been utilized as a tipping mechanism to incentivize the production or dissemination of high-quality content. Participating in a community that uses Dogecoin can earn you tips, or you can use a DOGE faucet to obtain your Dogecoin. A website that offers a small quantity of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the cryptocurrency so that you can start engaging with Dogecoin communities is known as a Dogecoin faucet. Now let’s discuss DOGE price prediction in June 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

One noteworthy change has been the continued impact of well-known people like Elon Musk, who is still a major player in the cryptocurrency industry. However, market sentiment is now more unclear due to a recent public dispute between Musk and former US President Donald Trump over economic policies, specifically with reference to regulating cryptocurrencies. Trump’s more cautious approach to digital currencies, together with his recent remarks about tightening regulations, could be a hindrance to DOGE’s price momentum, even though Musk’s positive remarks about the cryptocurrency have previously caused significant price increases. Meanwhile, there is pressure on the larger cryptocurrency market. BTC has already experienced a substantial decline after testing the $100.5k barrier. BTC may continue to struggle at these levels, according to analysts, which might have an impact on other cryptocurrencies like DOGE. DOGE is only one of many altcoins that suffer when the value of BTC declines. DOGE’s price rise is unpredictable because of the cautious attitude created by the broader market downturn and internal disputes among crypto influencers. Given this instability, the meme coin might encounter more difficulties soon, particularly if BTC is unable to restore its positive momentum. The good news, however, is that DOGE is standing at a significant support level as highlighted below. Immediate Support and Resistance Levels Key resistance levels for DOGE are $0.17185-0.16363 and $0.15984-0.15193. From these two levels we can expect a decent push in the price of DOGE to 0.19, 0.26, and beyond.

2025-06-06T14:56:55,"DeFi Technologies: A Solid Bet Amid Growing Crypto Adoption","Summary DeFi Technologies has delivered explosive growth in revenues and net income, outperforming the S&P 500 and showing resilience despite crypto market volatility. The company's diversified business units, especially Valour and DeFi Alpha, are driving rapid AUM and revenue expansion, with ambitious product launches ahead. Shares are trading at low forward P/E and P/S multiples, suggesting undervaluation, if cryptocurrency markets continue to rise and growth persists. Given high cyclical and crypto market risks, I recommend a small, closely monitored position to capitalize on the current 36% dip. Introduction & Company Overview DeFi Technologies Inc. (DEFT) is a lesser-known publicly traded company, though it is possible that this will change soon, as the stock appreciated by more than 500% in 2024. Returning 4.1%, it also beat the S&P 500 year-to-date. From their 52-week-high, however, they are now down 36%. Data by YCharts DeFi Technologies do what their name suggests - they're active in the cryptocurrency ""Defi"" (decentralized finance) realm. There, they operate the following main business units: Valour: A digital asset manager mostly known for their ETPs. This is the most important business unit of DEFT. Revenue is generated by charging management fees and staking set income, generating further appreciation from the underlying digital assets held in their ETPs. DeFi Alpha: An arbitrage crypto trading desk capitalizing on market inefficiencies. Stillman Digital: A crypto financial services company that specializes in OTC trading and market making. Reflexivity Research: Providing in-depth cryptocurrency industry research. Holdings: DEFT's venture portfolio is valued at >$30M. They also have a majority stake in Swiss Artificial Intelligence firm Neuronomics AG and a 5% stake in Amina Bank AG, a regulated crypto bank. Since I believe cryptocurrency growth has not peaked this year already, my thesis is to use this slight dip to set up a small position in DeFi Technologies and benefit from growing cryptocurrency adoption. Recent Financials Q1 2025 financials were a mixed bag, but, in my view, that is wholly to blame on Bitcoin prices dumping by 19% in the first quarter. Here are the most important developments: Revenues of $43.1M EBITDA of $31.2M, up from negative $1.9M YoY Net income of $30M, up from a net loss last year. It is impressive they managed to maintain profitability despite declining cryptocurrency prices. This is unlike many other cryptocurrency proxies. AUM dropped to $640M, down 21% QoQ and down 5% YoY May 2025: As of their May corporate update , May inflows were positive again, totaling $12.7M and resulting in AUM of $812M. The Story Is Right I'm expecting crypto markets to hit further ATHs down this year. After Bitcoin's stellar recovery from its April lows, it is currently taking a much needed breather. It seems to have lost $104.5k as a crucial support. After successfully finding new support, which I could envision either at $102k, $97k or $93.5k, I believe we are set for further ATHs this year. TradingView At Valour, they already have 65 products on the market and plan on listing at least 40 additional ETPs until EOY 2025, which will drive further AUM growth. Larger amounts of AUM will in turn lead to more management fees and higher staking revenues. DEFT IR Needless to say that in an environment of higher digital asset prices, their holdings (both venture and cryptocurrencies) will appreciate as well, making the whole company more valuable. Additionally, DeFi Alpha seems to be growing very quickly. Here's the company's take on it: The Company continues to assess and execute on arbitrage opportunities through its specialized trading desk, DeFi Alpha. Since its launch in Q2 2024, DeFi Alpha has generated a total of C$162.4 million (US$118.8 million) in revenue, including a one-time arbitrage trade announced on May 5, 2025, that delivered C$30.3 million (US$22 million). This strategy has significantly strengthened the Company's financial position, enabling debt repayment and supporting the ongoing expansion of its digital asset treasury. Growth has already been stunning, with total revenue at $10.3M in 2023 and at $55.2 million in 2024. They also reaffirmed their guidance of $201M of revenue in FY2025. At a current market cap of $1.1B, that would put them at a 2025 FWD P/S ratio of 5.5X. While not incredibly cheap, with these levels of growth, I believe they are slightly undervalued here. Further, 2024 net income was $144.8M, largely driven by digital asset gains. If they manage to grow earnings at 25%, then their forward P/E, at 6.1X, looks very low. The market seems to be pricing in a cyclical top for DEFT, which might, in fact, occur this year, but in my opinion, DeFi Technologies can keep growing for the remainder of the year and be awarded with slightly higher multiples in the process. Technically, DeFi has just hit the lower ends of the daily Bollinger Bands, which could offer support. The daily RSI also dropped below 45. I marked the cases in which both of these instances occurred simultaneously in the last two years, as depicted below. Each time posed as a good opportunity to open a small long position. I do believe that we could see some further downside in the short term, though, as the RSI is not oversold either (it was lower in most cases marked below) and Bitcoin is currently trending downwards. If this name-drops another ~20% from here, I might cover it again and increase my small position to a slightly bigger one. TradingView Risks As I've mentioned in the introduction, DEFT does bear higher speculation risks than many other companies since their revenues and especially net income are much more cyclical and very reliant on developments of the cryptocurrency market. The biggest risk for this play therefore is a crypto bear market. In 2022, for reference, DeFi Technologies bottomed out at $0.0485, down 98% from their 2021 highs. With less retail and institutional interest in cryptocurrency investments or trading, DeFi's revenues would suffer sharply. Also, lower digital asset prices will result in huge unrealized gains which might never be recovered. It's thus necessary to mention that a total loss of capital cannot be ruled out. Conclusion DeFi Technologies' growth of revenues, AUM, and net income is beyond impressive. At the same time, the stock is priced as if it was at its cyclical top, trading at a very low P/E ratio. I believe that, this year, they will continue to grow quickly amid further digital asset price appreciation, which might warrant them a higher valuation and result in significant shareholder gains. The risk of a crypto bear market needs to be considered. Still, the current dip of -36% can be put to good use by opening a small swing position. Disclaimer: Due to its risky nature, I would dedicate a maximum of 1% of my portfolio towards this investment and monitor the position very closely, potentially even using a stop loss.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792984-defi-technologies-solid-bet-amid-growing-crypto-adoption?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","DEFT",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T14:55:15,"What is BIP177 and the Bitcoin Name Debate?","The ongoing debate over Bitcoin’s unit display highlights a deeper tension between cultural tradition and usability, as the community revisits whether the decimal should be removed and Bitcoin’s smallest unit be renamed to “Bitcoins” should become the default denomination for everyday use. While the satoshi has become a symbolic and widely recognized unit, some developers and thought leaders argue that the “bit”, equal to 100 sats, is more intuitive for mainstream adoption, especially as Bitcoin’s value grows. This conversation has gained urgency with the emergence of BIP 177, a proposal by Synonym CEO John Carvalho that reimagines Bitcoin’s user interface by removing decimals entirely and standardising bitcoins as the base unit for display. As with previous changes like SegWit or Taproot, meaningful shifts in user experience often require years of debate, testing, and coordination. Whether BIP 177 succeeds or stalls will depend not just on merit, but on the community’s willingness to evolve Bitcoin’s interface for a global audience. After 16 Years, Why Debate the Name of BTC’s Smallest Unit Now? Bitcoin, as a digital asset, is divisible into extremely small units to facilitate a wide range of economic activity, from high-value transfers to microtransactions. The most well-known unit is the satoshi, representing 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin. The term “satoshi,” or “sat,” was first proposed on Bitcointalk.org in 2010 and gained traction after a user named Ribuck proposed using it to refer to the smallest possible division (he also proposed the name “austrian” in homage to the Austrian School of Economics), aligning with a comment by Hal Finney in support of standardised subdivisions. Over time, the community embraced the satoshi as the atomic unit of Bitcoin, partly in honor of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It became a cultural shorthand, for example “stacking sats”, and remains widely used in wallets and discussions across the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, another denomination, the bit, equal to 100 satoshis or 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin, has also been proposed as a more intuitive way to express smaller values. The term “bit” appeared in early Bitcoin discourse and gained renewed attention due to its simplicity and resemblance to conventional currency formats. Prominent voices such as Adam Back have suggested reviving bits for mainstream adoption, noting that if bitcoin’s price reaches $1 million, then 1 bit would conveniently equal $1, making mental conversions easier. Supporters argue that bits map more closely to everyday language and economic behavior, whereas sats, with their large numerical expressions, are cognitively burdensome for the average user. Thus, the sats vs. bits debate highlights a tension between cultural tradition and user-friendly design. Bitcoin has several different unit denominations , BTC, mBTC (millibitcoin), µBTC (microbitcoin or “bits”), and satoshis, which can be confusing for non-programmers and everyday users. One full bitcoin (1 BTC) equals 1,000 mBTC, 1,000,000 bits (µBTC), or 100,000,000 satoshis. This variety creates unnecessary complexity, especially when users encounter tiny decimal places like 0.000043 BTC or 4300 satoshis, making it hard to grasp how much something actually costs. Under BIP 177, a whole Bitcoin, 100 million Satoshis, could be referred to as a “Mega Bitcoin”. For those not accustomed to dealing with micro-denominations or scientific notation, the inconsistent unit usage across wallets and platforms can feel alienating, impenetrable, and needlessly technical, resembling software developer logic more than consumer-friendly money. In 2025, BIP 177 was introduced by Synonym CEO John Carvalho as a proposal to redefine Bitcoin’s commonly understood unit by making the base unit, the smallest indivisible amount recorded on-chain, the new standard for display. Instead of representing bitcoin amounts using simulated decimals (e.g., 0.00004321 BTC), this proposal recommends eliminating the decimal point entirely and referring to each base unit as one “bitcoin.” Under this model, what was previously called one “satoshi” (1/100,000,000 BTC) would now simply be labeled one bitcoin, aligning user interfaces with the reality that Bitcoin’s protocol natively handles integer values, not floating-point decimals. Proponents argue that the decimal system is a legacy UI abstraction that causes confusion, particularly for newcomers who struggle with parsing small fractional amounts. While BIP 177 makes no changes to consensus rules or on-chain data, it would require a coordinated shift in wallet and exchange interfaces and presents a cultural challenge to entrenched terminology like “sats.” By standardising integer-based displays, the BIP aims to simplify education, reduce cognitive load, and reflect the true nature of Bitcoin’s integral accounting. The motivation behind this shift is largely pragmatic. As bitcoin grows in value and adoption, most people will never own a full BTC. Presenting balances in whole integers, whether as “bits,” renamed “bitcoins,” or otherwise, helps demystify the asset for newcomers. Critics of BIP 177 argue that removing the satoshi label might erase a piece of Bitcoin’s cultural history, while others view the change as a necessary evolution for mass usability. Regardless of the outcome, the conversation underscores a broader point: unit representation is not just technical, it shapes perception, accessibility, and ultimately, adoption. The debate between sats, bits, and the BIP 177 vision reflects Bitcoin’s ongoing process of refining its monetary interface for a global audience. Bitkit Wallet is the First to Embrace the BIP 177 Standard Synonym’s Bitkit wallet is a self-custodial Bitcoin and Lightning wallet focused on enabling a user-friendly experience for onboarding everyday people into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Developed by Synonym , a Bitfinex sister company committed to creating the tools and infrastructure for a self-sovereign atomic economy-based future, Bitkit emphasizes privacy, interoperability, and sovereignty. It integrates a variety of features including a built-in Lightning node, contact-based payments using decentralised identifiers (DIDs), and seamless backup via encrypted cloud anchors. But beyond its advanced functionality, Bitkit has emerged as a trailblazer in wallet design through its early and enthusiastic adoption of BIP 177. BIP 177 introduces a clear, consistent specification for displaying Bitcoin values using intuitive unit naming and formatting. Rather than defaulting to BTC (bitcoin) or confusing fractions like mBTC or µBTC, BIP 177 proposes using “bitcoins” as the standard display unit, where 1 BTC equals 100,000,000 bitcoins. This unit size is far more approachable and human-friendly, especially for new users, as it avoids awkward decimals. For example, instead of showing a transaction as “0.000043 BTC,” a wallet adhering to BIP 177 would display “43 bitcoins.” This makes Bitcoin feel less like a foreign technical currency and more like a usable medium of exchange with comprehensible denominations, echoing familiar currency experiences like cents or satoshis. Bitkit’s decision to lead the adoption of BIP 177 is significant because user experience remains one of the biggest hurdles to Bitcoin mass adoption. Most Bitcoin wallets still default to BTC or satoshi denomination, which can alienate or confuse non-technical users. By championing BIP 177, Bitkit provides a more readable, accessible interface that removes friction at the onboarding stage. In doing so, it sets a new usability standard and pressures other wallet developers to rethink their own UI/UX conventions. Bitkit’s implementation is not just symbolic; it offers a working example of how standardization across wallets could improve interoperability and reduce learning curves across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Does BIP 177 Have the Community Support to Become a Lasting Change in Bitcoin? The adoption of BIP 177 remains uncertain, as there is currently no clear community-wide consensus among wallet developers, exchanges, and end users, although Jack Dorsey’s Square has adopted the standard recently. While some forward-thinking projects like Synonym’s Bitkit have embraced the standard, most Bitcoin applications continue to default to displaying BTC or satoshis. This reflects a deeper reality in Bitcoin development: changing widely adopted standards, especially those involving user interface conventions, is notoriously difficult. Many users and developers are resistant to altering established norms, even when the proposed change improves accessibility. Without a coordinated push from major players in the ecosystem, wallets, payment processors, educational platforms, BIP 177 risks becoming another well-intentioned but sidelined proposal. The challenge is rooted in how Bitcoin’s consensus culture and BIP process work. BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) are suggestions submitted to improve various aspects of the protocol or its ecosystem, ranging from core consensus changes to UI conventions like unit display. While some BIPs require network-wide consensus and node upgrades (like soft forks), others, such as BIP 177, are non-consensus changes that depend on voluntary adoption by developers and service providers. Even so, any meaningful change in Bitcoin must navigate a fragmented, cautious, and fiercely skeptical community. Because Bitcoin’s decentralisation is its greatest strength, no single authority can mandate change, even something as seemingly minor as how users see numbers on their screens. As Bitcoin’s value rises and 1 satoshi inches closer to dollar parity, a more intuitive display standard like BIP 177, using bitcoins instead of decimals, could gain broader support by making everyday transactions easier to understand and mentally convert. Historically, even changes with clear technical merit, like SegWit ( BIP 141 ) or Taproot ( BIP 341 ), took years to gain traction. SegWit, for example, was proposed in 2015 and didn’t activate until 2017, after intense debate and social coordination including a user-activated soft fork (UASF) and miner signaling battles. These examples highlight how deeply conservative and consensus-driven the Bitcoin ecosystem is. The reluctance to embrace even minor interface tweaks is not necessarily apathy or obstructionism, it’s a reflection of a culture deeply wary of change without widespread agreement and rigorous testing. This conservatism helps ensure Bitcoin’s long-term resilience but can also delay user experience improvements. In this context, BIP 177 may or may not become the defacto unit display standard. One advantage of BIP 177 is that it is a voluntary or opt-in change, so adoption can take place voluntarily, allowing for wallets and exchanges to implement the standard when they are ready. Wallet developers would need to coordinate display logic, exchanges would have to support bits in pricing and withdrawals, and users would need to learn a new mental model of value representation. Without strong leadership from high-profile apps or companies, or a groundswell of grassroots demand, BIP 177 may join the long list of Bitcoin proposals that linger in limbo, not rejected, but not adopted either. Currently, several Bitcoin-focused projects like Spiral , Square , Workit , and Cashu are in varying stages of BIP 177 adoption. In a protocol where “don’t change it” is the default stance, even a modest improvement like BIP 177 must clear a high bar to earn its place in the standard toolkit of Bitcoin tools.

As investor excitement wanes, the token has been settling around $2.20, down a little from its May highs. Even if the overall cryptocurrency market saw a net influx of $286 million over the last two weeks, institutional outflows have been substantial, totaling $28.2 million. Compared to other digital assets, this disparity reflects a significant lack of confidence in XRP’s near-term prospects, which may be caused by legal ambiguity. The conclusion of the SEC’s discussion behind closed doors has garnered a lot of market attention, with expectations centered on a potential breakthrough in settlement negotiations with Ripple. A positive result, like XRP being recognized as a commodity, would spark institutional inflows again, but the ambiguity has made the tone cautious.

In the meantime, the price movement of Bitcoin is giving the market as a whole conflicting signals. Although Bitcoin ( BTC ) is still structurally sound, a decline from recent highs and worries about US tariffs have caused market hesitancy. This is particularly pertinent to XRP, as it frequently corresponds with changes in the momentum of BTC. Failure at important BTC support levels could exacerbate XRP’s present weakness, but if BTC can regain its bullish trend and break beyond highs, it might drag XRP along for the ride. Immediate Support and Resistance Levels XRP is currently trading in a tight range with its support and resistance levels at $2.1492-1.9317 and $2.6416-2.4898 respectively. Breakout of either level and retest is very important for continuation to either side, until then it is advisable to look for shorts at the resistance level and long at the support levels.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including XRP, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the XRP token. Will XRP go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the XRP token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new integrations in new world companies, increased token holders, and so on. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for XRP price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low XRP can go. Should I invest in XRP? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any XRP price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the XRP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-06-06T14:47:53,"Michael Saylor boasts Strategy’s ‘indestructible balance sheet’","Strategy is doubling down on Bitcoin through a new $1 billion preferred stock IPO. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor explained on CNBC’s Squawk Box how Strategy is leveraging high-yield instruments to convert dollar capital into Bitcoin ( BTC ) exposure. “We are offering fixed U.S. dollar yield and we’re swapping it into BTC yield, which is what our equity investors want,” said Saylor. “The big breakthrough is that and the preferred market the capital never comes due. There’s no refinance risk. We’re basically offering a perpetual US dollar yield forever. And so by matching a very long duration instrument on the liability side with the long duration asset, we’re creating, in essence, an indestructible balance sheet.” Outperformance of Strike and Stride highlights investor appeal Saylor highlighted the strong performance of the company’s previous preferred stock offerings. The first, Strike, saw gains of 29% compared to a broader market decline of 6% in similar instruments. The third issuance, Stride, offered a 10% fixed yield and also outperformed, rising 22% while other preferreds fell by 4.5%. He called this approach a “very scalable, extremely low-risk way to generate leverage” and said it benefits both sides of the market. “It’s a win for the fixed income investors because they’re getting a yield 400 basis points more than typical preferred stocks or junk bonds. And it’s a big win for our equity investors because they want more Bitcoin.” On his bullish long-term forecast, Saylor said he expects Bitcoin to appreciate 29% a year on average for the next 21 years. The math implies a price of $13 million per coin by 2045.” You might also like: Strategy introduced a new perpetual called Stride (STRD). Some call it genius, others say it has ‘Ponzi vibes’ Regulatory progress and long-term Bitcoin upside Saylor emphasized that the broader environment for Bitcoin has never been more favorable. He pointed to increasing regulatory recognition, improvements in accounting standards that allow companies to use fair value reporting for Bitcoin, and a steady rise in the number of treasury-focused firms adding the asset to their balance sheets. Asked about concerns around proof of reserves , Saylor responded that the company’s Bitcoin reserves are audited by KPMG, along with its liabilities. He added that the company is considering ways of accomplishing this with zero-knowledge proof, as he is “not enthusiastic” about publishing all of the company’s wallet addresses, saying it exposes custodians and employees to unnecessary risk. Saylor also pointed to a shift in Bitcoin’s investor landscape, with early crypto advocates now joined by a growing class of institutional holders, including asset managers, exchange-traded funds, and publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. He described the past six months as a turning point for Bitcoin, highlighting a wave of regulatory clarity and institutional support. He cited a number of key developments, including the U.S. government’s recognition of Bitcoin as a digital commodity and approval from banking regulators for financial institutions to engage with the asset. Saylor noted that accounting standards have shifted in Bitcoin’s favor, with new rules allowing companies to report Bitcoin holdings using fair value accounting. These changes have contributed to a growing trend of publicly traded companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, signaling increased confidence in the asset from traditional finance. “These developments mean Bitcoin is no longer on the fringe,” Saylor said. “It’s moving into the financial mainstream, and that’s why I’m so bullish.” You might also like: Bitcoin vs Strategy stock: which is the better buy?",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/michael-saylor-boasts-strategys-indestructible-balance-sheet/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Strategy",cryptocompare

This brought a major gain today, but the market remains weak. Despite past weeks of drawdown across the crypto space, Fartcoin is still considered bullish on the short-term scale, although the latest drops have brought a slight price correction and is now slowly turning bearish daily. Breaking down a key support level of $0.95 amid yesterday’s meltdown, the price dipped to a new monthly low of $0.86, which acted as support, and the price bounced back above the mentioned broken support level. At $1, the price appears strong daily following a steady volume inflow since yesterday. A continuous hold above the monthly low could allow more recoveries to the top before breaking out to higher resistance. If that happens, we can expect a massive explosion in the future. However, considering the fact that Fartcoin is still under correction, we can expect more drops in the coming days, especially if Bitcoin keeps losing traction. The key range to watch for such a correction is $0.6. A correction below March’s low could trigger a crash capable of bringing an end to the bull run. For now, there’s still hope for a rebound. FARTCOIN’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview A strong push from the current trading level could bring us back to last month’s high of $1.646. Breaking through it could rally the price fast to $2 and the $2.74 resistance – tested last December – before exploding.

2025-06-06T14:34:02,"Here’s Why XRP Price Is Down Today","XRP is currently trading at $2.16, reflecting a 2.25% decline over the last 24 hours and a 0.95% decrease over the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This downturn comes amid a broader market cooldown, as Bitcoin also continues its slight retreat from recent highs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,500, marking a notable drop from its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded last month. The present market correction appears to be affecting major digital assets, with XRP among those experiencing short-term declines despite a series of positive long-term developments. Why Is XRP Price Down? Social and Political Context The recent public dispute between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has had a notable impact on the cryptocurrency market, including XRP. The feud began when Musk criticized Trump’s proposed tax and spending bill, leading to a series of retaliatory actions and public exchanges between the two figures. He also alleged in another tweet that Epstein’s file is being kept away from the public because Donald Trump’s name is there. Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 This political tension has brought uncertainty into the market, affecting investor sentiment and contributing to the decline in XRP’s price. While the direct impact of the Trump-Musk feud on XRP’s price is difficult to quantify, the overall market sentiment has been negatively affected. Investors are responding to the increased political uncertainty, which is reflected in the recent price movements across various cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Momentum and Developments on the XRP Ledger While the short-term price chart shows a dip, the underlying fundamentals and ecosystem surrounding XRP have shown continued growth and progress. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, recently commented on the future of digital assets, stating that the industry is on the edge of large-scale institutional adoption. This aligns with several key developments that happened in 2025. Ripple’s collaboration with BDACS, a South Korean digital asset custodian, represents a strategic move to bolster institutional custody capabilities. Earlier this year, Ripple also unveiled a detailed roadmap focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases for institutional players. Central to this plan is the introduction of Automated Market Makers under the XLS-30 standard, which aim to improve liquidity for tokenized assets on the XRP Ledger. Furthermore, the XRPL itself has seen significant upgrades. The integration of native programmability has enabled more efficient and secure development of institutional-grade applications. This allows for permissionless innovation while maintaining compliance, scalability, and operational robustness. Looking Ahead Despite the minor downturn today, the broader trajectory for XRP appears stable, supported by strong institutional interest and ongoing improvements to its ecosystem. The short-term price fluctuation should be weighed against these long-term fundamentals, which continue to attract investment and development activity. Although social narratives and political developments can exert influence on short-term trading behavior, the foundation being laid through Ripple’s partnerships and technical upgrades suggests that XRP’s strategic positioning remains intact.

2025-06-06T14:30:53,"US Trade Deficit Plummets by $76,700,000,000 in April Following the Rollout of Trump’s Tariffs","The US trade deficit plummeted by $76.7 billion in April following the rollout of the Trump Administration’s wave of tariffs. The total goods and services deficit was $61.6 billion in April, down from $138.3 billion in March, per a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The US clocked $289.4 billion worth of exports in April, $8.3 billion more than March, and $351.0 billion worth of imports, which was $68.4 billion less than the previous month. “The April decrease in the goods and services deficit reflected a decrease in the goods deficit of $75.2 billion to $87.4 billion and an increase in the services surplus of $1.5 billion to $25.8 billion. Year-to-date, the goods and services deficit increased $179.3 billion, or 65.7 percent, from the same period in 2024. Exports increased $58.4 billion or 5.5 percent. Imports increased $237.8 billion or 17.8 percent.” The US trade deficit skyrocketed in March as consumers and businesses stockpiled ahead of Trump’s tariffs. The future of those tariffs remains uncertain as rulings about their legality ping-pong back and forth through the US court system. Last week, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that many of the duties exceed the authority granted to the president by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The federal court struck down Trump’s April 2nd executive order establishing tariffs against 57 countries worldwide and several follow-up executive orders modifying the duties’ rates and start dates. The CIT also axed a slew of earlier tariffs Trump had applied to Mexico, Canada and China, which he claimed were retaliation for failing to stop the flood of illegal narcotics into the US. The Trump Administration immediately appealed the CIT’s ruling and requested a stay on the judgment, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted .

The next significant bullish confirmation traders should look for is a breakout above this channel, with an immediate target set at approximately $3,370.</p><p>Long-term bullish targets exceed Ethereum’s all-time high for futures prices of $4,093, with a highly optimistic scenario projecting beyond $4,872, marking over 100% potential gain from the recent entry level around $2,436.</p><p>Risk Management for Crypto Buyer of the Dip: Initial Stop-Loss Placement</p><p>To mitigate risk effectively, the trade setup initially includes a stop-loss approximately 6% below the entry level, rather than directly under recent lows or the channel boundary. This strategic decision accounts for liquidity pools, volume profiles, and the likelihood of fake-outs, as market makers frequently target overly tight stops placed by traders.</p><p>ETH Trade Plan Partial Profit-Taking and Stop Adjustments</p><p>Following the robust principles of the Trade Compass methodology, traders may consider partial profit-taking to lock in gains and reduce risk exposure. Suitable areas for profit-taking include:</p><ul><li><p>Initial partial profit: Around $2,492 (approximately 2.3% gain), just below the psychologically significant $2,500 round-number level.</p></li><li><p>Second partial profit: Around $2,611 (approximately 7% gain), strategically positioned above key candle highs where many short positions may have stops.</p></li></ul><p>Adjusting the stop-loss upwards after taking partial profits further solidifies the trade’s risk management strategy.</p><p>Defensive Strategy and Additional Buys, in Case ETH Does Another 'Fakie'</p><p>If Ethereum's price experiences fake-outs or tests additional lower key levels, the strategy allows for averaging into another position at a lower entry to improve the overall cost basis.
