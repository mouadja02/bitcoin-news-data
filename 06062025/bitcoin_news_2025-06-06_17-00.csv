This alert identified a prime entry range for Ethereum (ETH) between $2,436 and $2,440.</p><p>Previous Successful Call to Buy ETH Before It Popped 50%</p><p>This call follows our <a href=""https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/ethereum-futures-breakout-may-happen-soon-20250507/"" rel=""follow"" target=""_blank"">previous timely call for your consideration on May 7, raising the idea to enter at around $1,840, which subsequently generated a remarkable 50% gain</a>. Ethereum's price surged significantly from the bull flag breakout, demonstrating the effectiveness of well-timed market entries and advanced technical analysis.</p><p>Current Ethereium Technical Analysis and Bullish Outlook</p><p>Ethereum is currently situated within a clearly defined ascending channel, known as a spin-off channel. The next significant bullish confirmation traders should look for is a breakout above this channel, with an immediate target set at approximately $3,370.</p><p>Long-term bullish targets exceed Ethereum’s all-time high for futures prices of $4,093, with a highly optimistic scenario projecting beyond $4,872, marking over 100% potential gain from the recent entry level around $2,436.</p><p>Risk Management for Crypto Buyer of the Dip: Initial Stop-Loss Placement</p><p>To mitigate risk effectively, the trade setup initially includes a stop-loss approximately 6% below the entry level, rather than directly under recent lows or the channel boundary. This strategic decision accounts for liquidity pools, volume profiles, and the likelihood of fake-outs, as market makers frequently target overly tight stops placed by traders.</p><p>ETH Trade Plan Partial Profit-Taking and Stop Adjustments</p><p>Following the robust principles of the Trade Compass methodology, traders may consider partial profit-taking to lock in gains and reduce risk exposure. Suitable areas for profit-taking include:</p><ul><li><p>Initial partial profit: Around $2,492 (approximately 2.3% gain), just below the psychologically significant $2,500 round-number level.</p></li><li><p>Second partial profit: Around $2,611 (approximately 7% gain), strategically positioned above key candle highs where many short positions may have stops.</p></li></ul><p>Adjusting the stop-loss upwards after taking partial profits further solidifies the trade’s risk management strategy.</p><p>Defensive Strategy and Additional Buys, in Case ETH Does Another 'Fakie'</p><p>If Ethereum's price experiences fake-outs or tests additional lower key levels, the strategy allows for averaging into another position at a lower entry to improve the overall cost basis. The original stop-loss placement remains firm, ensuring clear maximum risk control.</p><p>Join Crypto Calls When The Happen, Buy at Better Prices</p><p>To receive timely updates and exclusive alerts, join our free Telegram channel:</p><ul><li><p>Crypto alerts: <a href=""https://t.me/investingLiveCrypto"">Investing Live Crypto</a></p></li><li><p>Stock alerts: <a href=""https://t.me/investingLiveStocks"">Investing Live Stocks</a></p></li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more insights, risk management updates, and strategic entry opportunities, ensuring you capitalize on optimal buy-the-dip scenarios.</p><p>ForexLive.com is evolving to become <a href=""https://www.investinglive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">investingLive.com</a> later this summer.
