The Senate on Wednesday voted 48 to 46 in favor of Bowman assuming the new role after Michael Barr stepped down from the position on February 28th. In a post on the social media platform X, Lummis says the development signals a brighter future for crypto. “I’m thrilled that the Senate has confirmed Miki Bowman as Vice Chair of Supervision at the Federal Reserve. Her confirmation represents a turning point for digital assets and brings much-needed balance and accountability to Fed banking supervision. Miki’s commitment to evidence-based regulation over political considerations will strengthen America’s financial system.” During the nomination hearing in April, Bowman said that regulators must promote innovation in the banking system. “To remain viable and competitive, banks must be able to consider new technologies that can improve products and services, and lower costs. Regulators should adopt an approach that encourages and promotes sensible innovation.” The advocacy group Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) supported the nomination of Bowman in March. Said CCI President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Ji Hun Kim, “Her willingness to explore and discuss the potential benefits and challenges of emerging technologies, including digital assets, reflects a commitment to informed policymaking. We believe that Governor Bowman’s experience, coupled with her strong support for responsible innovation, makes her an exceptional choice for Vice Chair.” Bowman will serve a term of four years.

2025-06-06T16:50:01,"UK Crypto ETNs: Unlocking Opportunity for Retail Investors","BitcoinWorld UK Crypto ETNs: Unlocking Opportunity for Retail Investors Are you a UK-based investor interested in cryptocurrencies but unsure about the regulatory landscape? A significant development has just unfolded that could change how you access digital assets. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced a pivotal decision, granting retail investors access to certain crypto investment products. This move, specifically concerning UK crypto ETNs , marks a shift in the country’s approach to digital asset investment for the general public. What Exactly Are UK Crypto ETNs and Why the Change? Understanding what crypto ETNs are is crucial to grasping the impact of the FCA’s decision. ETNs, or Exchange-Traded Notes, are a type of unsecured debt security that tracks an underlying index or benchmark. In the case of crypto ETNs, they track the performance of a specific cryptocurrency or a basket of cryptocurrencies. Unlike directly buying crypto, investors purchase shares in the ETN through traditional brokerage accounts. For years, the FCA maintained a ban on the sale of crypto derivatives and ETNs to retail consumers, citing concerns about volatility, complexity, and potential harm. However, the regulatory body has now softened its stance specifically on ETNs, albeit under strict conditions. The key points of the FCA’s updated position on UK crypto ETNs include: Permitted Access: Retail investors will now be allowed to buy and sell crypto ETNs. Approved Exchanges Only: This access is strictly limited to products listed on exchanges regulated by the FCA. This ensures a level of oversight and market integrity. Institutional Ban Remains: Interestingly, the existing ban on the sale of crypto derivatives to retail consumers remains in place. This distinction highlights the FCA’s view on the different risk profiles of these products. Risk Disclosures: The FCA emphasizes that strong risk warnings and consumer protection measures will still be mandatory for firms offering these products. This change is seen by many as a strategic move by the UK to foster growth within its nascent UK digital asset market , positioning the country as a more attractive hub for crypto-related financial activities. What Does This Mean for Retail Crypto UK Investors? For individual investors in the UK, this announcement opens up a new, potentially more accessible avenue to gain exposure to the price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without needing to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Previously, options for retail crypto UK investors were limited, often involving offshore platforms or more complex derivative products that were explicitly banned for retail. Here’s a breakdown of the implications for you as a UK retail investor: Increased Accessibility: You can now potentially invest in crypto via your existing brokerage account, making it as simple as buying shares in a company or a traditional ETF. Potential for Lower Barriers: ETNs can sometimes offer a way to invest in crypto with smaller amounts compared to direct purchases, depending on the product structure. Regulatory Oversight: By limiting access to FCA-approved exchanges, the regulator aims to provide a layer of investor protection that might be absent on unregulated platforms. Still Not Direct Ownership: Remember, when you buy a crypto ETN, you don’t own the underlying cryptocurrency itself. You own a security that tracks its price. Derivatives Ban Persists: The FCA is maintaining the ban on products like Contracts for Difference (CFDs) or futures based on crypto for retail, which are generally considered higher risk due to leverage. This distinction between ETNs and derivatives is key. The FCA appears to view ETNs, when listed on regulated exchanges, as having a different risk profile than leveraged derivative products, which can magnify losses rapidly. Navigating FCA Crypto Regulations : Protections and Pitfalls The FCA’s decision, while opening doors, comes with a strong emphasis on investor protection and risk awareness. This aligns with the broader trend of increasing FCA crypto regulations aimed at safeguarding consumers in this volatile market. Key aspects of the regulatory environment you need to be aware of include: Mandatory Risk Warnings: Expect prominent and clear warnings about the high risks associated with investing in crypto ETNs. Firms are required to make these risks explicit. Suitability Assessments: While not as stringent as for complex derivatives, some platforms might require you to confirm you understand the risks before investing. Approved Exchanges: Only ETNs listed on exchanges recognized by the FCA can be marketed and sold to UK retail investors. This includes exchanges like the London Stock Exchange (LSE). No Compensation Scheme Protection: It is highly likely that investments in crypto ETNs will not be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). If the issuer of the ETN goes bankrupt, you could lose your entire investment. This is a critical risk difference compared to some traditional investments. Market Volatility: Regardless of the investment vehicle, the underlying asset (cryptocurrency) remains highly volatile. Prices can go down as well as up, and you could lose all your capital. The FCA’s approach reflects a cautious step towards integration, acknowledging the growing interest in crypto while attempting to mitigate potential harm. Understanding these FCA crypto regulations is paramount before committing any capital. Boosting the UK Digital Asset Market : A Strategic Move? The decision to allow retail access to crypto ETNs is widely interpreted as a strategic move by the UK government and regulators to enhance the country’s position in the global digital asset space. By providing regulated pathways for investment, the UK aims to attract both investors and crypto businesses. How this decision could impact the UK digital asset market : Increased Liquidity: Allowing retail participation can potentially increase trading volumes and liquidity for crypto ETNs listed on UK exchanges. Attracting Issuers: This could incentivize more financial institutions to list crypto ETNs on UK exchanges, offering a wider variety of products. Fostering Innovation: A clearer regulatory stance, even if cautious, can provide more certainty for businesses operating in the crypto sector, potentially encouraging innovation and growth within the UK. Competing Globally: Other jurisdictions, like Germany and Switzerland, already have established markets for crypto ETNs accessible to retail investors. The UK’s move helps it compete on a more level playing field. Investor Confidence: Regulated access through familiar platforms might build greater confidence among mainstream investors who were previously hesitant to use unregulated crypto exchanges. This development signals a potential shift from a purely restrictive approach to one that seeks to balance innovation with necessary consumer protections, aiming to make the UK digital asset market a significant player internationally. Getting Started: Investing in Crypto UK via ETNs If you are considering investing in crypto UK through ETNs following this announcement, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Actionable Insights for Potential Investors: Check Your Brokerage: See if your existing stockbroker or investment platform plans to offer access to FCA-approved crypto ETNs. Many major platforms are expected to list these products. Research Available Products: Once available, research the specific ETNs. Which cryptocurrency do they track (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, a basket)? What are the fees (management fees can impact returns)? Who is the issuer? Understand the Risks: Reiterate your understanding of the risks. Crypto volatility is high. ETNs are debt instruments – understand the issuer risk. There is likely no FSCS protection. Start Small: If you’re new to crypto or ETNs, consider starting with a small amount you can afford to lose. Diversify (Carefully): Don’t put all your investment capital into crypto, even via ETNs. Consider crypto as part of a broader, diversified portfolio, and only allocate a small percentage that aligns with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, regulatory changes, and the performance of the specific ETN you are interested in. Example (Illustrative Only): Imagine a hypothetical ‘UK Bitcoin ETN’ listed on the London Stock Exchange. You could log into your standard brokerage account, search for the ETN’s ticker symbol, and place an order just like buying shares in a company. The price of the ETN would aim to track the price of Bitcoin (minus fees and tracking differences). If Bitcoin’s price goes up, the ETN’s price should also go up, and vice versa. Comparison: ETNs vs. Direct Crypto vs. Derivatives (Retail UK) It’s helpful to see how ETNs compare to other ways of gaining crypto exposure for retail crypto UK investors: Method Accessibility (Retail UK) Direct Ownership of Crypto? Regulatory Status (FCA) FSCS Protection (Likely) Key Risk Considerations Direct Crypto Purchase (via FCA-registered exchange) Yes Yes Exchange registered for AML/CTF, but crypto asset activities largely unregulated No Volatility, platform security, losing keys, regulatory uncertainty Crypto ETNs (on FCA-approved exchange) Newly Permitted No (Debt Security) Product listed on FCA-regulated exchange, but underlying crypto unregulated No Volatility, issuer risk, tracking error, no FSCS protection Crypto Derivatives (e.g., CFDs, Futures) Banned for Retail No (Contract) Banned for retail consumers due to high risk No Volatility, leverage risk (magnified losses), counterparty risk This table highlights that while ETNs offer a regulated access point through familiar channels, they still carry significant risks inherent to the underlying crypto asset and the product structure itself. Investing in crypto UK , regardless of the method, requires careful consideration. Challenges and Considerations While the FCA’s decision is a positive step for many, it’s not without potential challenges: Limited Product Variety (Initially): It may take time for a wide range of crypto ETNs to be listed on UK exchanges. Fees: ETNs typically have management fees that can eat into returns over time, potentially making them more expensive than direct crypto ownership (though direct ownership has its own transaction costs). Tracking Error: The ETN’s price may not perfectly track the underlying crypto asset’s price due to fees, trading costs within the fund, or market inefficiencies. Issuer Risk: As ETNs are debt securities, there is a risk that the issuer could default, potentially leading to a total loss of investment, separate from the performance of the underlying crypto. Regulatory Uncertainty Remains: While this specific area is clarified, the broader UK crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving. These factors mean that while access is improving for retail crypto UK investors, due diligence is still essential. Conclusion: A Cautious Welcome to Regulated Crypto Access The FCA’s decision to allow retail investors access to UK crypto ETNs on approved exchanges marks a significant moment for the UK digital asset market . It provides a new, regulated pathway for investing in crypto UK , potentially increasing accessibility for retail crypto UK investors through familiar investment platforms. However, this is not a green light to invest without caution. The FCA has been clear that the inherent risks of crypto volatility remain, and strong consumer protection measures, including explicit risk warnings, will be enforced. The ban on retail access to crypto derivatives persists, highlighting the regulator’s differentiated view on risk. For UK investors, this development offers an opportunity to gain exposure to the crypto market through a more traditional and regulated structure. Yet, it is imperative to understand exactly what you are investing in – a debt security tracking crypto, not the crypto itself – and to be fully aware of the risks, including volatility, issuer risk, and the likely absence of FSCS protection. Approach this new access with education, caution, and a clear understanding of your own financial situation and risk tolerance.

2025-06-06T16:42:41,"HIVE Digital Capacity Crosses 10 EH/s in May, Aims to More Than Double That by Year-End","Bitcoin miner HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) has surpassed 10 exahash per second (EH/s) in hashrate capacity, a 58% increase from April, driven by the launch of a 100-megawatt hydro-powered site in Paraguay. The company said in a press release on Friday that it's on track to reach 25 EH/s by the end of 2025. The firm mined 139 bitcoin in May, or an average rate of 4.5 BTC per day. Peak capacity hit 10.4 EH/s while average hashrate for the month stood at 8.5 EH/s. HIVE said its fleet efficiency remained steady at around 20 joules per terahash (J/TH), and its network share now exceeds 1% of global Bitcoin mining power. The new facility in Paraguay reflects a broader trend in the mining industry: the race to deploy next-generation ASIC miners rapidly and at scale in regions with abundant renewable power. Co-founder Frank Holmes emphasized the company’s speed and flexibility, pointing to its Buzz HPC division, which supports AI cloud infrastructure alongside Bitcoin mining. CEO Aydin Kilic said the company’s goal for the summer is 18 EH/s, and that fleet upgrades should allow for a daily BTC output of over 12 by the fourth quarter — potentially at a production cost below $50,000 per coin. HIVE operates facilities in Canada, Sweden and Paraguay, powered entirely by hydroelectricity. The company was the first publicly listed crypto miner on the TSX Venture Exchange in 2017.

2025-06-06T16:42:08,"Transportation Network Giant Uber Prepares to Use Stablecoins in Payments! Here Are the Details","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced in San Francisco that the company is exploring the potential of using stablecoins for payments. Uber Considers Using Stablecoins in Payments Stating that stablecoins go beyond cryptocurrencies being just a store of value, Khosrowshahi said, “Stablecoins are one of the most interesting applications of crypto that offer practical benefits.” Emphasizing that Uber is interested in stablecoin technology in order to optimize global payment systems, Khosrowshahi said that these assets have the potential to reduce costs, especially in international money transfers. The CEO also made it clear that his interest in stablecoins is higher than Bitcoin: “Stablecoins are proven instruments. There are different views on the future of Bitcoin.” Khosrowshahi said Uber has not yet decided on the transition to this technology, adding that the company is currently in the “research phase.” Since Uber is one of the most used services in the world, it is thought that such an integration could be effective on a global scale. Khosrowshahi's interest in cryptocurrencies is not new. In a statement he made in 2021, he said Uber was open to accepting payments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if sufficient benefits were provided. However, the company also made it clear at the time that it had no plans to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. He stated that Uber would “definitely” accept crypto in 2022, but expressed reservations about the high exchange costs and environmental impacts. Uber’s stablecoin move also coincides with growing regulatory efforts in the U.S. The regulatory efforts, which are being pushed forward with the open support of former President Donald Trump, aim to create a clear framework for stablecoin issuers. The most prominent regulation is the bill known as the Genius Act. In this process, stablecoin initiatives from the traditional finance world are also drawing attention. Major banks such as Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are reportedly discussing a joint stablecoin development plan through their subsidiaries. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-06T16:40:01,"Alex platform Halted: Critical Suspension After Security Incident","BitcoinWorld Alex platform Halted: Critical Suspension After Security Incident The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is often lauded for its innovation and potential to reshape financial systems. However, it’s not without its significant risks. A recent development has cast a spotlight on these vulnerabilities: the Alex platform , a prominent protocol built on the Stacks blockchain, has temporarily suspended its operations following a confirmed security incident. This news sent ripples through the Stacks DeFi ecosystem and served as a stark reminder of the challenges inherent in securing digital assets. What Happened to the Alex Platform? Confirmation of the incident came directly from the Alex team via their official X (formerly Twitter) account. They announced that they had detected a security breach impacting the platform. While initial details were limited, the immediate and necessary response was to halt all platform activities. This means users are currently unable to access services, trade assets, or interact with the protocol’s features. Suspending operations is a critical step taken by platforms during security events. It allows the team to contain the situation, investigate the extent of the damage, and prevent further potential losses. It’s a difficult decision, as it disrupts user access, but prioritizing the integrity of the protocol and the safety of user funds is paramount in such circumstances. Understanding Stacks DeFi and Alex’s Role To fully grasp the significance of this event, it helps to understand where Alex fits into the picture. Stacks is a blockchain designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin. It does this by connecting directly to the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build on top of Bitcoin’s security. Stacks DeFi refers to the ecosystem of decentralized finance applications built on the Stacks layer, leveraging its connection to Bitcoin. The Alex platform (stands for Automated Liquidity Exchange) is a cornerstone of this ecosystem. It aims to provide a comprehensive suite of DeFi services, including lending, borrowing, swapping, and yield farming, specifically tailored for the Stacks blockchain and assets like STX (the native token of Stacks) and wrapped Bitcoin (sBTC, once fully enabled). Its role is crucial for providing liquidity and financial tools within the Stacks environment, making this security incident particularly impactful for the network. The Nature of the Crypto Security Breach While specific technical details of the exploit were not immediately released, a security breach in a DeFi protocol often involves vulnerabilities in smart contracts, private key compromises, or issues with associated infrastructure like bridges or oracles. A crypto security breach can manifest as unauthorized access to funds, manipulation of protocol logic, or disruption of services. DeFi protocols, by their nature, manage significant amounts of user funds held within smart contracts. These contracts are immutable once deployed, making any flaw or vulnerability within them a potential target for malicious actors. The decentralized aspect, while offering benefits like transparency and censorship resistance, also means there’s no central authority to simply ‘turn off’ the system or reverse transactions easily, making security audits and robust code paramount. Tracing Stolen Crypto Funds: A Difficult Challenge One of the key actions the Alex team announced they are taking is working with centralized exchanges (CEXs) to trace any stolen crypto funds . This highlights a common strategy in the aftermath of a DeFi exploit. While blockchain transactions are public, identifying the real-world entities behind addresses is difficult. However, when attackers attempt to cash out or move large amounts of illicitly obtained funds, they often utilize centralized exchanges. CEXs require users to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. By cooperating with exchanges, protocol teams and law enforcement can potentially identify the attackers if they attempt to deposit or trade the stolen assets on these regulated platforms. Nevertheless, tracing and recovering stolen crypto funds is a complex and often challenging process. Attackers employ various techniques, such as mixing services, chain hopping, and utilizing decentralized platforms, to obscure the trail of funds. Success in recovery is never guaranteed. What Does This DeFi Exploit Mean for Users? For users of the Alex platform , the temporary suspension and the underlying DeFi exploit have immediate consequences: Inaccessible Funds: Assets deposited or locked within the Alex protocol are currently inaccessible. Users cannot withdraw, trade, or manage their positions. Uncertainty: There is natural concern about the safety of their funds and the future of the platform. Need for Information: Users are reliant on the Alex team for timely and transparent updates regarding the investigation, the extent of the losses (if any), and the plan for resolution. It is crucial for affected users to stay vigilant, rely only on official communication channels from Alex, and be wary of scams impersonating the platform or offering recovery services. Lessons from the Crypto Security Breach: Actionable Insights While the Alex incident is specific to one platform, it offers valuable lessons for anyone participating in Stacks DeFi or the broader DeFi space: Diversify Risk: Do not put all your funds into a single protocol, no matter how reputable it seems. Spread your investments across different platforms and asset types. Understand the Risks: DeFi involves smart contract risk, impermanent loss, oracle risk, and platform-specific risks. Educate yourself on how the protocols you use function and what could go wrong. Stay Informed: Follow official channels of the protocols you use. Security announcements, audits, and protocol upgrades are important to track. Use Reputable Platforms: While even audited platforms can have vulnerabilities, using well-established protocols with a track record and multiple audits can potentially reduce risk. Consider Hardware Wallets: For storing significant amounts of crypto, a hardware wallet offers better protection against private key compromises compared to software wallets or exchange storage. This crypto security breach serves as a stark reminder that the responsibility for security in decentralized systems often falls more heavily on the user. The Path Forward for Alex and Stacks DeFi The immediate priority for the Alex team is a thorough investigation into the DeFi exploit . This involves identifying the vulnerability, understanding how it was exploited, and assessing the full extent of any stolen crypto funds . Working with security experts and potentially law enforcement is part of this process. Once the investigation is complete and the vulnerability is addressed, the team will need to formulate a plan for resuming operations. This plan will likely involve: Communicating clearly with the community about what happened and the steps taken. Implementing fixes and potentially undergoing further security audits. Developing a strategy regarding any lost user funds – this could involve using a treasury, seeking external funding, or other recovery mechanisms, though full recovery is often difficult. Gradually restoring platform services. The incident will undoubtedly impact trust within the Stacks DeFi ecosystem. How the Alex team handles the aftermath – with transparency, effective communication, and a clear plan for security improvements – will be crucial for regaining user confidence and ensuring the long-term health of the platform and the broader Stacks ecosystem. Conclusion: Navigating Risk in Decentralized Finance The temporary suspension of the Alex platform following a crypto security breach is a sobering event for its users and the wider Stacks DeFi community. It underscores the persistent challenges of security in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance. While teams like Alex are working diligently to trace any stolen crypto funds and secure their protocols, users must also take proactive steps to protect themselves by understanding the risks, diversifying their holdings, and staying informed. This incident, while negative, provides an opportunity for the Stacks DeFi ecosystem and the broader industry to learn and build more resilient and secure protocols in the future. The path to mainstream DeFi adoption requires not just innovation but also a relentless focus on security and user protection.

2025-06-06T16:30:03,"Dogecoin Ready To Blast Off? Historical Bullish Trend Sparks Hopes Of A Parabolic Surge","During the last hours of Thursday, Dogecoin experienced a notable decline as the broader crypto market retraced, causing its price to revisit the $0.16 mark, a level not seen in several months. Despite the worrying shift in trend, DOGE’s medium-term and long-term outlook remains bullish as crypto analysts advocate for an imminent parabolic surge. A Potential Moonshot For Dogecoin Around The Corner Dogecoin’s waning price action has intensified following the recent decline observed across the broader market. However, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned technical expert and investor, has outlined a key development on the DOGE’s chart that hints at a possible shift in the trend toward the upside trajectory. In his analysis shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Trader Tardigrade highlights that the dog-themed meme coin is showing signs of a major upswing even as prices waver. His analysis is backed by a historical bullish signal that preceded substantial price spikes for DOGE in the last two attempts within a yearly period. Following a period of relative strength, this bullish signal has resurfaced on the weekly time frame chart, increasing the likelihood of a notable impending parabolic surge. It is important to note that the trend often aligns with key signals from the DOGE/BTC chart. As seen on the weekly chart, lower lows are being formed by the DOGE/BTC pair prior to each Dogecoin huge pump within the past year. However, these significant bullish moves tend to be more effective once DOGE’s price begins to trend upward on the weekly chart. Presently, Dogecoin’s weekly price action reveals that the meme coin is at a pivotal juncture, and the DOGE/BTC pair seems to have formed new lower lows. With the signal repeating itself, the expert is confident that a massive pump is imminent, possibly pushing DOGE’s price beyond the $0.70 mark and toward a new all-time high . DOGE To Develop A Bullish Divergence As DOGE hovers near key support levels, key momentum indicators signal positive price movements, suggesting the current bearish movement may be brief. Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached a vital point that is likely to strengthen its upward outlook. According to Trader Tardigrade, DOGE is heading back to the previous swing low, while the RSI indicator displays a higher low after a sharp decline. The expert contends that this signal may result in a bullish divergence, which would suggest that the selling momentum has weakened. A bullish divergence that typically occurs when an oscillator falls to hit a new low and prices drop to a new low signals a potential upward trend reversal after a downtrend.

2025-06-06T16:30:00,"Bank of Russia Key Rate Cut: A Crucial Step for Russian Economy Stability","BitcoinWorld Bank of Russia Key Rate Cut: A Crucial Step for Russian Economy Stability For those monitoring global economic shifts and their potential ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape, a significant development from Eastern Europe warrants attention. The Bank of Russia recently made a key decision regarding its benchmark interest rate. Understanding the implications of this move is crucial, not just for the Russian economy, but potentially for broader market sentiment that can touch digital assets. What is the Bank of Russia Key Rate and Why Does it Matter? The Bank of Russia key rate is the main instrument the central bank uses to influence monetary conditions in the country. Think of it as the base rate for lending and borrowing within the Russian financial system. By setting this rate, the Bank of Russia impacts everything from consumer loans and mortgages to corporate borrowing costs and investment decisions. It’s a primary tool for controlling inflation and stimulating or cooling down economic activity. In times of high inflation or economic overheating, central banks typically raise this rate to make borrowing more expensive, thus reducing spending and investment. Conversely, during economic downturns or when inflation is low, they cut the rate to encourage borrowing and stimulate growth. Therefore, changes to the Bank of Russia key rate are closely watched indicators of the central bank’s assessment of the current economic health and future outlook. Analyzing the Russia Interest Rate Cut : The Details On June 6, the Bank of Russia announced a notable adjustment to its monetary policy. The central bank decided to lower its key interest rate by 100 basis points (bps). This brings the rate down from its previous level to 20% . According to the official statement released on the Bank of Russia’s website, the primary justifications for this Russia interest rate cut were twofold: Easing Inflation: The central bank observed signs that inflationary pressures were starting to subside. High inflation erodes purchasing power and creates economic uncertainty, so its potential easing is a positive signal. Economic Stabilization: The Bank of Russia also cited signs of economic stabilization. This suggests that the initial shock from recent geopolitical and economic events may be starting to settle, allowing for a reassessment of the previously tightened monetary stance. This move follows a period where the rate was significantly hiked to counter extreme volatility and inflationary risks. The decision to cut, even while the rate remains relatively high at 20%, signals a shift in the central bank’s immediate priorities and its assessment of the economic environment. What Does This Mean for the Russian Economy ? A lower key rate generally makes it cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow money. For the Russian economy , this could have several potential effects: Lower Borrowing Costs: Reduced interest rates can decrease the cost of loans for businesses, potentially encouraging investment in expansion, equipment, and projects. Stimulus for Consumption: Cheaper consumer credit (like mortgages and car loans) can boost household spending, a key component of economic growth. Support for Government Borrowing: Lower rates can also reduce the cost for the government to borrow money, providing more fiscal flexibility. However, the impact on the Russian economy is complex, heavily influenced by ongoing international sanctions and global economic conditions. While a rate cut provides conventional monetary stimulus, the unique challenges facing Russia mean the effects may not be as straightforward as in a typical economic environment. The central bank is navigating a difficult balance between supporting economic activity and maintaining financial stability amidst external pressures. Is Inflation Russia Finally Easing? One of the main reasons cited for the rate cut was easing inflation. Recent data points, according to the Bank of Russia, indicate that the peak of inflationary pressure might have passed, at least for now. High Inflation Russia experienced earlier in the year was a major concern, driven by supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations, and increased demand for certain goods. While the rate cut suggests the central bank sees a downward trend or stabilization in price increases, inflation remains a critical factor. The 20% key rate itself is still very high by international standards, reflecting the underlying inflationary risks and the need for a tight monetary stance compared to many other economies. The central bank will continue to monitor price dynamics closely, and future rate decisions will likely depend heavily on whether this easing trend in Inflation Russia proves sustainable. How Does Monetary Policy Russia Influence Global Markets (and Crypto)? Decisions on Monetary policy Russia , while focused internally, can have external relevance. In a globally interconnected financial system, significant economic shifts or policy changes in a major economy can influence investor sentiment and capital flows. While the direct link between the Bank of Russia’s rate and the global crypto market is not immediate or simple, there are indirect connections: Risk Appetite: Central bank actions, especially in times of crisis or uncertainty, can impact global risk appetite. If the cut is perceived as a sign of stabilizing conditions (despite challenges), it might contribute marginally to a more risk-on sentiment, which can sometimes benefit assets like cryptocurrencies. Global Liquidity: While not a major driver for global liquidity compared to central banks like the Fed or ECB, the cumulative effect of monetary policy changes in various countries contributes to the overall liquidity picture. Economic Spillover: The health of the Russian economy impacts global trade and commodity markets, which in turn can have broader economic consequences that eventually touch all asset classes, including digital ones. For crypto investors, the Bank of Russia’s move is another data point in a complex global economic puzzle. It highlights the ongoing adjustments by central banks worldwide as they grapple with inflation, economic slowdowns, and unique geopolitical factors. Understanding these macroeconomic undercurrents provides valuable context for navigating the volatile crypto markets. Potential Challenges and Opportunities While the rate cut is intended to support the Russian economy , significant challenges remain, including the impact of sanctions, potential for renewed inflationary pressures, and structural economic issues. For investors watching from outside, this situation presents both challenges in terms of uncertainty and potential opportunities if it leads to shifts in capital or economic activity that indirectly favor alternative assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should a crypto investor process this information? While you shouldn’t make investment decisions solely based on the Bank of Russia key rate , here are some insights: Stay Informed: Monitor global macroeconomic news, including significant monetary policy shifts like this Russia interest rate cut . These events are part of the larger picture influencing market sentiment. Understand Interconnectedness: Recognize that even seemingly distant economic events can have indirect effects on global markets and crypto. Focus on Fundamentals (Crypto): While macro matters, the fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in are equally, if not more, important. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Global economic uncertainty underscores the need for a diversified portfolio. Summary: Navigating Global Economic Currents The decision by the Bank of Russia to cut its key interest rate to 20% is a significant development signaling the central bank’s assessment of easing Inflation Russia and signs of stabilization in the Russian economy . This move in Monetary policy Russia aims to provide stimulus by lowering borrowing costs following a period of aggressive rate hikes. While the direct impact on the crypto market is indirect, understanding this Bank of Russia key rate change and the underlying economic factors behind this Russia interest rate cut is crucial for crypto investors who wish to remain informed about the global economic currents that can influence the broader financial landscape and, by extension, digital asset markets.

2025-06-06T16:17:13,"Here’s What Could Happen to XRP If BlackRock Drops an XRP ETF Today","In the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets, few developments carry the seismic weight of a potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by a major financial institution. The mere speculation that BlackRock might launch an XRP ETF has sent ripples across crypto communities and traditional finance circles alike. According to a recent post by the crypto influencer Pumpius on X, such an event wouldn’t just be another bullish headline, it could catalyze a systemic shift in global liquidity dynamics. The implications are staggering and demand careful examination. The Institutional Floodgates Could Open Overnight An XRP ETF by BlackRock would act as an instant green light for the world’s most conservative financial actors—pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and traditional banks, to engage with XRP. For years, regulatory uncertainty and reputational risk have kept many institutional investors on the sidelines. If BlackRock drops an $XRP ETF… Forget price predictions. The entire liquidity framework of global finance will shift. Overnight demand from pensions, banks, and sovereigns Instant credibility in tradfi circles A tsunami of capital hunting yield, utility, and speed… pic.twitter.com/wAvxRZ6AFz — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 5, 2025 However, BlackRock’s imprimatur carries exceptional weight. When the firm entered the Bitcoin ETF space, it triggered a flood of institutional inflows that lifted not only Bitcoin but the entire crypto market. An XRP ETF would likely do more than just replicate that phenomenon. XRP, unlike Bitcoin, was designed from inception to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border payments, a functionality that aligns with the strategic objectives of financial institutions and central banks. With the ETF acting as a compliant, accessible gateway, global financial players could shift massive pools of capital into XRP exposure, confident in the asset’s regulatory clarity and utility-driven narrative. TradFi Legitimacy: XRP’s Rebirth in Elite Financial Circles The legitimacy conferred by BlackRock cannot be overstated. Despite XRP’s longstanding partnership with banks and payment providers, it has often been dismissed by the broader financial media and institutional investors, largely due to the SEC lawsuit. A BlackRock ETF would effectively certify XRP as an institutional-grade asset. This move would silence skeptics who have long regarded XRP as peripheral or too risky for serious capital. Within days, major financial networks, analyst desks, and research arms at leading banks would begin publishing coverage and price models for XRP, reinforcing its presence in mainstream financial discourse. Just as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF normalized Bitcoin for Wall Street, an XRP ETF would do the same, possibly with even greater momentum due to XRP’s clearer real-world use case. A Tsunami of Capital Seeking Yield and Utility Beyond price speculation, the utility of XRP positions it uniquely to benefit from institutional inflows. Unlike passive assets such as gold or Bitcoin, XRP is integrated into the Ripple network to facilitate instantaneous, low-cost global payments. Financial institutions entering through an ETF would likely explore deeper integrations with RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), further enhancing demand for XRP in operational contexts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, yield-seeking institutions could leverage XRP in liquidity provisioning, payment corridors, and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms as they mature on XRPL. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and the development of the XRPL EVM sidechain further expand the DeFi possibilities around XRP. These elements transform XRP from a speculative token into a programmable asset with high-velocity capital utility. BlackRock’s ETF would essentially be the bridge between traditional capital and this multifaceted utility, accelerating adoption. Global Liquidity Frameworks Could Be Rewritten Pumpius rightly pointed out that the impact would extend far beyond a temporary price surge. The structure of global finance could begin to tilt toward blockchain-based settlement models. Sovereign wealth funds and reserve managers, always on the hunt for efficient and liquid instruments, would take note. The use of XRP for settlement across borders and across currencies , something Ripple has already proven at scale, would begin to be modeled at the highest levels of financial planning. The speed, transparency, and cost-efficiency offered by XRP-based systems could challenge SWIFT and correspondent banking models, drawing regulatory interest and public-private partnerships. Ripple’s existing engagements with central banks on CBDC offer a glimpse into how such transitions might unfold. With BlackRock’s ETF as the spark, these conversations could quickly escalate from pilot to implementation. The Market Isn’t Ready, But XRP Is Despite its proven utility, XRP remains undervalued in the eyes of many analysts relative to its potential global role. This has often been attributed to regulatory overhang, misinformation, and its early entanglement in crypto tribalism. Yet, behind the scenes, Ripple has meticulously built out the infrastructure, partnerships, and compliance frameworks to support institutional-grade use. As Pumpius noted, “The market’s not ready. But XRP is.” This statement encapsulates a paradox: while investors scramble to understand the implications of an XRP ETF, the foundations for such a future have already been laid. XRP is not a newcomer seeking validation; it is a seasoned digital asset waiting for the capital markets to catch up.

2025-06-06T16:13:03,"Metaplanet Launches Asia’s Largest Bitcoin-Focused Equity Raise","Metaplanet has started Asia’s most significant equity raise, which is dedicated to Bitcoin (BTC). The company plans to issue 555 million shares through special warrants in a capital raise worth about ¥770.9 billion, around $5.4 billion. This move aims to help the company grow its Bitcoin holdings and offer investors a new way to invest in the flagship crypto through the stock market. Metaplanet To Raise $5.4 Billion to Buy More Bitcoin Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, explained that the company will sell shares using moving strike warrants. These warrants are priced higher than the current market price, thanks to strong trading activity and Bitcoin’s price changes. The starting price for the new shares is ¥1,388, which is above recent closing prices. The company expects to finish this capital raise within six to ten months. On June 2, Metaplanet bought 1,088 Bitcoin for ¥16.9 billion, worth about $117.5 million. This purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin stash to 8,888 BTC. With this amount, Metaplanet has become one of the world’s top ten publicly traded companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings. This recent Bitcoin purchase follows a ¥50 billion, equivalent to $330 million, bond sale in May. Like many other Bitcoin-focused firms, Metaplanet is actively using different financial tools to buy more Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s “210 Million Plan” Boosts Bitcoin and Share Price Metaplanet’s current plan follows an earlier capital raise called the “210 Million Plan.” In 60 trading days, the company raised ¥93.3 billion, equivalent to $650 million, by issuing 210 million shares. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings increased from 1,762 BTC to 7,800 BTC during this time. This is a 189% increase in Bitcoin per share, which the company tracks using an internal measure called the “BTC yield.” The company’s share price also tripled during this period. The Japan-based firm said it bought its latest Bitcoin at an average price of about $93,354 per coin. All Bitcoin purchases were funded using non-dilutive debt and warrants, which means the company did not dilute existing shareholders too much. Metaplanet’s BTC yield, which shows how much Bitcoin is held per share, rose to 225.4% this year. Furthermore, the firm plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 30,000 BTC by 2025. It also aims to hold 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is about 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Metaplanet Brings Bitcoin to More Investors in Japan Metaplanet is making it easier for Japanese investors to access Bitcoin. Since Japan has strict crypto rules, buying Bitcoin directly is hard. Metaplanet solves this by holding Bitcoin as a public company. Investors can buy its shares for Bitcoin exposure with tax benefits, NISA eligibility, and access via the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Metaplanet is now Japan’s most traded stock and one of the fastest-growing by market value this year.

FCA said the proposed change would allow individual consumers to access crypto ETNs, provided the products are listed on FCA-recognized exchanges. The regulator revealed that the move aims to support the growth of the UK’s crypto industry. The agency also acknowledged that its promotion rules will still apply. The restriction has existed since 2021 and previously limited access to professional investors only. FCA’s proposal aims to support crypto in the UK 🇬🇧 The FCA will lift the ban on Bitcoin and crypto ETNs for retail investors in the UK! pic.twitter.com/WGXPqTx0Y8 — Jordan Walker (@JayW132) June 6, 2025 The FCA began prohibiting the selling, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and crypto ETNs to retail customers in 2019. The regulator updated its position in March 2024 to allow RIEs to list crypto asset-backed ETNs for professional investors only – restricted to entities such as investment firms and credit institutions. It also added stringent controls to ensure orderly trading and investor protection. Ian Taylor, board advisor at CryptoUK, noted that the UK had been an outlier on ETNs till its recent lift on the ban. He hopes the move will improve consumer protections and promised to continue making the case for lifting the ban on retail investors from accessing highly regulated derivative products. Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at British law firm Clifford Chance, argued that the agency’s initiative is aligned with the UK’s ambition to position itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction in the crypto sector. He also noted that the move will unlock exposure to crypto assets for retail investors and signal that the UK is embracing digital assets. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” -David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Assets at FCA. The UK Treasury acknowledged that crypto exchanges will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms under the proposed rules, with transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience requirements. The regulator also maintained that its rules aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value, irrespective of the value of the backing asset. FCA also urged customers to ensure they know how backing assets are managed. The agency is also working on a new version of its crypto regulatory framework. FCA requested public feedback on proposed stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody regulations last week. Geale said the regulator supports innovation while ensuring market integrity and trust. FCA also noted that the deadline for feedback is July 31, and it will publish the final rules in 2026 Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden noted that the Bank of England will publish a complimentary consultation paper later this year for stablecoins that expect to operate at a systemic scale. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves also suggested plans for a comprehensive regulatory regime to make the country a leader in the crypto space. UK wants to become a global crypto hub Data revealed that the UK is leading the world in increasing cryptocurrency ownership among its population in 2025, surpassing economies such as the U.S. Jamie Jefferson, senior associate at law firm Ashurst, mentioned that the FCA’s latest proposals are a bold step toward making the UK a hub for responsible crypto innovation. Another UK law firm, Wiggin, suggested that the UK is applying the full weight of securities regulation to digital assets rather than opting for a light-touch regime similar to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ). The government agency also introduced new requirements for companies providing crypto custody to ensure they are secured and can be easily accessed at any time. The proposal also seeks to reduce the likelihood and impact of firm failures across regulated companies offering stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody. The Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden argued during the UK House of Commons debate that as finance evolves, so must the rules to ensure transparency in elections. Member of Parliament Sarah Olney highlighted concerns over political parties accepting crypto donations. Olney stressed the need to ensure that donations that do not come from an identifiable source must be returned. Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, had previously announced that the party accepts cryptocurrency contributions from eligible donors.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyst sees Ethereum hitting $10k, Tron surging to $1.2; Unilabs Finance gains traction with $2.3m ICO and $30m AUM. A top analyst has discovered a pattern that could propel the Ethereum price to $10,000. Also, the Tron price is expected to surge to $1.2 as user activity on its blockchain explodes. Meanwhile, the spotlight is now shifting toward Unilabs Finance (UNIL) for blending AI and smart investing. Its debut in the crypto space has been terrific: $2.3 million raised in crypto ICO and an AUM of more than $30 million. You might also like: Tron and Unilabs battle set to soar above the $1 mark, Binance Coin suffers volatility Analyst draws a parallel between Ethereum and Bitcoin Ted Pillows, a crypto investor, points out that the Ethereum price has formed four consecutive two-week green candles since its recent bottom. According to him, this pattern closely mirrors Bitcoin’s behavior following the March 2020 crash. Ted said there is a similarity between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025, calling it “mind-blowing.” If history repeats itself, the analyst says the price of Ethereum may follow the same upward trajectory that Bitcoin experienced during the 2020–2021 bull market cycle. Ted forecasts the Ethereum price may soar past $10,000 before the end of the year. MerlijnTrader also posted the same Ethereum price prediction. He noted the altcoin is a good crypto to buy for gains for those who missed out on Bitcoin in 2020. MerlijnTrader forecasts that Ethereum price may rise to $11,000 soon. In the meantime, CoinMarketCap data shows the ETH price has been trading between $2,400 and $2,750 in the past week. Tron Network activity skyrockets, price targets $1 The Tron price has been on an upward surge in the past few days, bouncing off the support level around $0.26. Currently, the Tron price is attempting to surpass the current weekly high of $0.2775. If the Tron price crosses it, the crypto could rise above the $0.28 region. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Tron coin price has rallied by 0.1% on the weekly timeframe and 10.1% on the monthly level. The Tron price continues to show strength amid the ongoing market correction. Data from CryptoQuant also shows Tron’s 50-SMA and 100-SMA active addresses have hit a new all-time high of over 2.4 million. This massive increase favors buying pressure, supporting a Tron price surge. Going forward, Altwolf forecasts the price of Tron could surge to $0.32 if it follows its current ascending channel. Lennaert Snyder, another market commentator, thinks the Tron price may go as high as $1.20 in the coming months. Unilabs Finance, the AI-based DeFi project gaining momentum The upcoming project, Unilabs Finance, is looking to take investment in the crypto space to a new level. The platform merges AI with crypto investment strategies, creating smart, adaptive portfolios. As the global DeFi market is expected to reach $232 billion by 2030, Unilabs is leading the charge as the next big thing in the DeFi space. What sets Unilabs apart is its AI-driven investment funds, which automate exposure to high-growth sectors like BTC, AI tokens, and real-world assets (RWAs), making portfolio management seamless for users. With real yield potential, AI-powered fund strategies, and a strong community push, Unilabs is a smart bet on the future of AI-integrated investment. Unilabs is currently in the cryptocurrency ICO phase, and its UNIL coin is trading at $0.0062. Thanks to a large influx of buyers, the project has raised over $2.3 million. Unilabs Finance has seen faster traction than ADA’s early ICO phase, offering utility, 122% APY staking rewards, and governance rights. Analysts predict that if adoption trends continue, UNIL could reach $0.10 by the end of 2025, driven by rising user demand, platform growth, and limited token supply. Why the new DeFi crypto is gaining investors’ attention While the Ethereum and Tron prices aim for ambitious price targets, Unilabs offers a rare opportunity for early adopters seeking exponential returns. Its AI-powered ecosystem, presale structure, and access to curated investment funds create a unique value proposition. As market attention intensifies, Unilabs could become the surprise giant of 2025. Getting in early might just be the smartest move in the DeFi market right now.

2025-06-06T15:45:00,"Will Cardano Market Cap Surpass $100 Billion This Year? Whales Pick $0.0062 Coin Instead","Cardano market cap is approximately $24.4 billion. ADA Price dropped by more than 7% this week. Many analysts question a $100 billion run this year. A 400% jump seems hard. That’s why big investors, or “whales,” are looking elsewhere for better gains. They turn to Unilabs Finance , which offers AI-driven tools. Unilabs is managing over $30 million in assets. Whales are looking for new opportunities, and the ADA price is moving between $0.86 and $0.62. The Cardano market cap may remain low in 2025. However, Unilabs Finance provides a clear road to potential 2x gains. ADA Price Prediction: Will Cardano Market Cap Hit $100B? ADA prices have steadily fallen during the last week.

The ADA price dropped by $0.66 three times in one week. Even with the drop, some experts think a bounce could come soon. If ADA stays above $0.66, it might rise again. Some trading tools are showing buy signals. Right now, ADA is at $0.69. But reaching a $100 billion market cap this year seems unlikely. Most experts only see a 2x or 3x gain.

2025-06-06T15:40:21,"Bitcoin Potential as a Store of Value Sets It Apart from Other Digital Assets: Fidelity","Prominent asset manager Fidelity has highlighted Bitcoin unique features and functionalities in comparison to other cryptocurrencies in a recent report. It buttressed Bitcoin’s exceptionalities in a recent Coin Report publication, shared in a Friday tweet . The $6 trillion asset manager discussed the facts, strengths, and weaknesses of the pioneering cryptocurrency, including its potential use case.Bitcoin As a Store of ValueFidelity branded Bitcoin as a potential store of value, a term used to classify assets that retain their purchasing power over time. Interestingly, this distinct quality is rare not just in the digital asset industry but in the global financial market, placing Bitcoin on an exclusive list.Bitcoin has continued to grow over the years, outperforming even the best asset classes globally. Notably, BTC has outpaced even gold, an asset considered the best store of value over the past five years. The leading cryptocurrency has increased by 951% within this timeframe compared to gold’s moderate 57% uptick.Meanwhile, Fidelity buttressed that Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value places it on a superior caliber than other cryptocurrencies. While others, like its closest competitor, Ethereum, have put in strong performances, none has done so on the same level and with the same conviction as the native token of the first fully decentralized electronic payment system.There Is Only One BitcoinFurthermore, the asset manager highlighted Bitcoin’s unique strengths of scarcity, decentralization, and security. For instance, there will only be 21 million of the asset that will ever exist, a demonstration of its finite nature.This limited cap, in addition to Bitcoin’s well-structured issuance rate, drives its value, establishing its role as an emerging store of value and aspiring monetary good. Meanwhile, with demand reaching insane levels, watchers have asserted that we will soon be out of Bitcoin to buy.Bitcoin is also decentralized, spurred by its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. With no singular or central control, the network achieves consensus through a voting process, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly difficult to attack or compromise. The growing number of nodes, miners, and the asset’s price have made it practically and cost-wise impossible for a single individual to control up to 51% of computing power. Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establishes Security Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establish Security Remarkably, this places Bitcoin on track to solve the blockchain trilemma, with its scalability drawdown being the only missing piece. For one, the Bitcoin network ranks as one of the slowest in the sector, with its decentralized nature playing a significant role in this regard. It can process just three to seven transactions per second compared to new chains like Solana, which has a TPS of 4,000.Essentially, Fidelity holds Bitcoin in high regard, projecting that its value will continue to rise in line with its growing utility and scarcity. While it did not predict the asset’s price trajectory, there are predictions that it would rally to $200,000 this year and $1.5 million in the next five years.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/06/bitcoin-potential-as-a-store-of-value-sets-it-apart-from-other-digital-assets-fidelity/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-potential-as-a-store-of-value-sets-it-apart-from-other-digital-assets-fidelity,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

We’re proposing to lift the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes (cETNs), to retail investors. Consumers would be informed of risks in the same way as when buying cryptoassets directly. https://t.co/myKza5dp9a #cryptoassets #CryptoETNs #CryptoRegulation #FCAGrowth pic.twitter.com/UbOXbhW2oc — Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) June 6, 2025 If the plan goes ahead, retail investors in the UK would once again be able to buy crypto ETNs—something they haven’t been allowed to do since the 2021 ban . The FCA has put the change out for comment as part of a broader look at how to encourage digital-finance innovation while still protecting consumers. ETNs tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether could then list on FCA-approved markets such as the London Stock Exchange, giving everyday investors the same access professionals already enjoy. A Shift From Past Caution to Measured Access When the FCA originally introduced the ban on crypto derivatives and ETNs for retail investors in 2021, it did so on the grounds of consumer protection. At the time, the regulator warned that cryptoassets were “ill-suited for retail consumers,” citing concerns about high volatility, market manipulation, and a lack of reliable valuation. However, in its latest statement, the FCA acknowledges that the market has evolved. “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry,” said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” The proposed changes would apply only to crypto ETNs traded on FCA-approved investment exchanges. The broader ban on crypto derivatives, such as options and futures, for retail customers will remain in place. Safeguards and Rules for Retail Access Should the FCA lift the ban, the sale of crypto ETNs to retail investors would still be subject to strict conditions. Only products listed on a recognised investment exchange (RIE) would be permitted, and all firms offering them would need to comply with financial promotion rules. The rules seek to ensure investors grasp the risks. They call for plain-language disclosures and ban gimmicky incentives or misleading ads, much like the safeguards that already cover direct crypto purchases. Crypto ETNs function as bank-issued debt notes that track digital-asset prices, letting investors follow the market without holding the coins themselves. They’re already traded in the EU and the US, where demand for regulated crypto products keeps rising. Boosting the UK’s Crypto Ambitions The FCA’s proposal supports the UK government’s broader ambition to become a global hub for cryptoasset technology and innovation. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly stated his commitment to fostering a more competitive regulatory environment for digital finance in the UK. Industry leaders have welcomed the FCA’s willingness to revisit earlier restrictions. “This is a step in the right direction for UK crypto policy,” said one digital asset fund manager. “It gives investors more choice and shows the FCA is willing to adapt to a changing market.” The consultation period will remain open until later this year, with a final decision expected in early 2026. If approved, crypto ETNs could return to the UK retail market soon after, opening new regulated investment pathways for everyday investors seeking exposure to digital assets.

2025-06-06T15:34:21,"Shiba Inu Price Prediction: 39 Trillion SHIB Held at Crucial Level – SHIB Holders Should Watch Out","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gone down by 7.4% in the past week and currently sits at $0.00001237 as rising tensions between the United States and China on the trader front have managed to spook investors. The latest decline has managed to push this meme coin’s year-to-date losses to 41.5% again. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have surged by nearly 78% as the sell-off intensified yesterday afternoon. On-chain data indicates that a significant amount of tokens are held by investors are held by investors with a cost basis ranging from $0.000012 to $0.000013. Hence, this may be a heavily defended price zone where trading volumes may skyrocket. This favors a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast in the near term as bulls will do their best to keep their positions afloat and in green territory to avoid a long squeeze. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can the #ShibArmy Keep the Price Above $0.00001200? The #ShibArmy, the community that backs this meme coin, is one of the strongest in the crypto space. Its social media accounts are followed by millions and more than 1.5 million accounts hold $SHIB at press time. In addition, the project recently launched the ShibaDAO – a decentralized governance entity that has effectively surrendered the project’s reins to the community. If the army closes ranks at this point, they could manage to keep the price up through a concerted effort. The daily chart shows that SHIB broke its trend line support in the past few days and has also dropped below its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs). The price has found support at $0.00001200 for now and rose strongly during the Asian session as bulls seem determined to hold their ground at this level. SHIB could be pushed to retest its former trend line support from below. If it rejects it, we could draft a Shiba Inu price prediction of $0.00001050 as this is the nearest area where the token has found support after a bearish breakout below $0.00001200. This meme coin’s upside potential seems capped at the moment. However, Bitcoin’s path to new all-time highs has been paved lately. One meme coin stands to gain if BTC rises to $125,000 in the next few weeks. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the name of one of the hottest crypto presales of the year . Its innovative rewards system tied to the performance of the top crypto has attracted nearly $7 million from investors already. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Hands Out Rewards Every Time Bitcoin Hits a Price Milestone BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a fun and innovative way to profit from Bitcoin’s rally to new heights. The reward mechanism is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked for every additional $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once the price rises to $150,000, token holders will receive a direct Bitcoin airdrop. To buy this meme coin and start generating passive income once Bitcoin reaches new milestones, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-06T15:30:49,"Bitcoin Could Break The Dollar — $250K Prediction Still In Play, Billionaire Says","Tim Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has doubled down on his call for Bitcoin to hit $250,000 by the end of 2025. He shared this on X, renewing a prediction he first made in 2018 when he set his sights on reaching that mark by 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Back then, the crypto market took a sharp downturn in 2022—thanks in part to FTX’s collapse—and the timeline slipped. Still, Draper believes today’s drivers are strong enough to push prices higher. He even suggested that the US dollar might vanish in a decade as Bitcoin takes its place. Tim Draper’s Bold Timeline According to Draper, the $250,000 target isn’t just wishful thinking. In 2018, he said Bitcoin would reach that level by 2022. It didn’t happen—2022 saw many digital assets tumble in value. This year, though, he repeated his forecast after seeing a “recent surge” in the crypto. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: → General optimism… pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 He also claimed Bitcoin could become “infinite against the dollar,” arguing that in 10 years the US dollar wouldn’t exist. His confident tone suggests he’s sticking with the same numbers—$250,000 by December 31, 2025. Political And Regulatory Drivers Based on reports, Draper points to politics as a big catalyst. He highlighted moves by US President Donald Trump, who is working on new trade deals. One sign of this push is the Media & Technology Group’s filing on June 5, 2025, for a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. That application is headed to the NYSE Arca, with Crypto.com lined up as custodian, and it aims to bring more mainstream money into Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, the US Senate voted 66–32 on May 19 to advance the GENIUS Act, which would set rules for stablecoins. Plus, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 is under debate. It has bipartisan support and is meant to spell out clear rules for crypto. Financial Institutions And Adoption Draper also sees banks and big companies stepping in. He mentioned that JP Morgan plans to let its clients buy Bitcoin and use spot-BTC ETFs—like BlackRock’s IBIT—as collateral. That shift could open doors to a flood of institutional cash. Meanwhile, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads the pack, holding over 580,000 BTC. At current prices, that stash is worth about $61 billion. These moves, Draper argues, point to people treating Bitcoin more like gold than a risky token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market—Data Technological Advances On Bitcoin In his view, the tech upgrades on Bitcoin matter too. He talked about Web3 apps built on Bitcoin and said “Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum.” Right now, Lightning Network handles many Bitcoin transactions, making payments faster and cheaper.

2025-06-06T15:25:05,"K-Pop’s K Wave Media Plans $500M Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","K Wave Media’s Stock Skyrocket by 143% K Wave Media, a NASDAQ-listed company, recently agreed to sell up to $500 million of its common stock to Bitcoin Strategic Reserve KWM, intending to reinvest the proceeds into Bitcoin. With the trend of companies incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries gaining steam, K Wave Media doesn’t want to be left out because it plans to be the “Metaplanet of Korea.” Choi Pyeungho, the KVM board chairman, welcomed this move, and stated , “K Wave Media’s bold adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset is a visionary move that signals the growing convergence between digital media and decentralized finance. We are proud to support K Wave’s mission to lead Web3 integration in the content space and believe this strategy will create strong, long-term value for its shareholders.” This strategic move has paid off since the entertainment company’s stock surged by 143%, illustrating heightened market optimism. By holding Bitcoin as a primary corporate reserve asset, K Wave Media sees this as a stepping stone towards heightened innovation and forward-thinking asset management. Ted Kim, the co-interim CEO of K Wave Media, believes that adding Bitcoin on the balance sheet not only strengthens the company’s commitment to decentralization, agility, and forward-looking value creation, but also reimagines the future of media. This is because Bitcoin is more than a store of value—it’s a catalyst for innovation, independence, and global scalability. Meanwhile, French footballing giant Paris Saint-Germain recently unveiled its Bitcoin treasury before the Champions League Final , which it ultimately won against Inter Milan of Italy. Why is the Demand for a Bitcoin Treasury Going Through the Roof? In an era of accelerating inflation, currency devaluation, and global economic uncertainty, companies are rethinking their cash management strategies. Enter the Bitcoin treasury: a revolutionary approach that is reshaping corporate finance. Traditionally, companies have held large amounts of cash and cash equivalents on their balance sheets, typically in fiat currencies like the US dollar. However, as central banks print more money and real interest rates remain historically low or even negative, these holdings often lose value over time. To combat this erosion, forward-thinking companies are now turning to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Bitcoin offers several advantages that make it an attractive addition to corporate treasuries. First, its fixed supply — capped at 21 million coins — ensures scarcity, which protects against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed at will, Bitcoin’s issuance schedule is transparent and predictable. This built-in scarcity has fueled its rise as a digital store of value akin to digital gold. Second, Bitcoin is highly liquid and globally transferable, making it easy to buy, sell, or move across borders, even during times of financial stress. Its decentralized nature means it is not subject to any single government’s monetary policy or capital controls — a major plus for companies operating internationally. Third, Bitcoin’s historical performance has outpaced most traditional asset classes. While its volatility is higher than that of fiat currencies or bonds, its long-term returns have often made it a compelling hedge against currency debasement and an effective diversification tool. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have led the charge, converting portions of their cash reserves into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has argued that Bitcoin is “digital property” superior to cash, while Tesla’s 2021 Bitcoin purchase showcased how even large, mainstream companies are willing to embrace this new paradigm. MicroStrategy recently unveiled a $42 billion Bitcoin acquisition strategy , meant to boost its equity-issuance plan. Conclusion As the corporate treasury BTC gains steam, K Wave Media sees it as an innovation that will enhance its media prowess. While Bitcoin treasuries are not without risks — including regulatory scrutiny and price volatility — they represent a forward-looking strategy that aligns with the digital transformation of finance. As more companies realize the potential of Bitcoin to protect against inflation and preserve purchasing power, Bitcoin treasuries might become an increasingly mainstream component of corporate finance.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9473/k-pop-s-k-wave-media-plans-500-m-bitcoin-treasury-strategy,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T15:25:00,"Romania Leads Eastern Europe With Postal Bitcoin ATM Rollout","A line of text in a paragraph.In a drive that combines tradition and digital innovation, Romania's state post office, Poșta Română, has introduced its first Bitcoin ATM at a branch in Tulcea — becoming the first public institution in the country to provide cryptocurrency services to regular citizens directly. This pilot, rolled out in cooperation with leading local exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR/Tradesilvania), is the beginning of the extensive rollout to cities including Alexandria, Piatra Neamț, Botoșani, and Nădlac, with a view to bridging the digital divide and increasing financial inclusion across the nation. The procedure was as simple as making a withdrawal from an old-fashioned ATM for most Romanians. ”I paid my mobile phone bill and saw the new machine,” said Andrei, 31, from Tulcea. ”I've heard of Bitcoin, but never paid with it. I spent my first 0.001 BTC today — just to see how it works.” The network, powered by the backend of Bitcoin Romania, allows one to buy or sell Bitcoin with cash, read a wallet QR code, and make transactions in minutes. The ATM is accessibility-focused, with Romanian language interface and step-by-step instructions, ID verification for higher amounts to comply with local KYC/AML laws. The partnership is strategic for both sides. Poșta Română with its large coverage and reputable public image is taking its service bouquet into the digital age to woo new clients and increase digital maturity. For Bitcoin Romania, the collaboration means rapid expansion into underserved regions and a chance to reach new demographics. “We’re bringing crypto to the people, not just the cities,” said Constantin Rotariu, co-founder of Bitcoin Romania. “This is about access, education, and building trust in digital finance.” Fees for the new ATM are competitive in European terms — typically between 4% and 7% per transaction, the same or slightly lower than the EU-wide average for Bitcoin ATMs. While exchanges online are still cheaper, convenience and cash availability are worth the premium for users, especially for those with limited easy access to online banking. “I’d rather pay a bit more and know my transaction is instant and secure,” said Maria, a retiree who used the ATM to send Bitcoin to her grandson in Germany. Romania’s move comes as crypto adoption accelerates in Eastern Europe, with the region seeing $499 billion in crypto inflows over the past year and a growing appetite for decentralized finance. Over 600,000 Romanians now hold investments in cryptocurrency, and the country is aligning with the EU's MiCA framework, paving the way for larger-scale public-sector involvement. The postal pilot is considered a blue print for other EU countries, a tangible, trustworthy point of entry to digital assets for city and countryside. Among social media, the launch has created buzz and curiosity. The rollout of Romania’s first postal Bitcoin ATM quickly sparked excitement and curiosity both online and in Tulcea itself. Locals snapped photos and shared their first impressions, with many praising the ATM’s clear instructions and the helpfulness of post office staff.

2025-06-06T15:14:12,"Six-Figure Bitcoin Call Options Surge as Traders Chase $100K+","Notably, Bitcoin's recent ascent past the $100,000 mark has reignited bullish enthusiasm. This upward trajectory has led traders to anticipate further gains, prompting increased interest in high-strike call options as a means to capitalize on potential price surges. Are Bitcoin’s Speculative Bets on the Extreme Side? Since some traders are placing ambitious bets, such as options wagering on Bitcoin reaching $300,000, a 190% increase from its current value of $103,249, these positions, while highly speculative, reflect a segment of the market banking on significant price movements. Buying a $300,000 Bitcoin call option is a bullish bet on Bitcoin’s price exceeding that strike price before the option expires on June 27, which is three weeks away. Notably, if Bitcoin’s price rises above $300,000 before expiration, the buyer can buy BTC at the strike price ($300,000) and then immediately sell it at the higher market price, capturing a profit. On the contrary, if Bitcoin’s price stays below $300,000, the option would not be worthwhile because BTC would be cheaper in the open market, causing the option buyer to lose the premium paid. Bitcoin’s Market Volatility and Leverage The surge in Bitcoin’s high-strike call options also reflects the market's volatility and the use of leverage. While these instruments offer the potential for significant gains, they also carry substantial risks. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to take a wait-and-see approach based on various on-chain metrics. For instance, BTC will need to break above the $106,000 zone for short-term momentum as Bollinger Bands continue narrowing, which indicates volatility compression. The wait-and-see approach is cemented by the fact that institutional demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are cooling off. For instance, CoinShares revealed that institutional exposure to Bitcoin fell to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025, down from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024, representing a 23% drop. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s profit-taking activity among large players has been going through the roof with hourly cash outs hitting $500 million multiple times. Historic Price Levels, Institutional Momentum, and New National Strategies Fuel Bitcoin's Path Beyond $100,000 Bitcoin's performance above $100,000 is underpinned by robust institutional investment, strategic governmental actions, favorable supply dynamics, and positive market sentiment. Traders and analysts anticipate further gains, driven by these factors: 1. Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024 has significantly bolstered institutional participation. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have launched Bitcoin ETFs, attracting substantial inflows. These ETFs collectively hold BTC worth $122.1 billion , accounting for approximately 5.94% of the total supply, effectively reducing market liquidity and supporting price appreciation. 2. U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, utilizing over 200,000 BTC seized by federal agencies. This move positions Bitcoin to be part of the mainstream economy alongside traditional reserve assets like gold, signaling governmental endorsement and potentially encouraging other nations to consider similar reserves. 3. Post-Halving Supply Constraints Bitcoin's fourth halving in April 2024 reduced the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, decreasing the rate of new supply. Historically, such halvings have preceded significant bull runs, as reduced supply amid steady or increasing demand exerts upward pressure on prices. 4. Accumulation by Long-Term Holders On-chain data indicates a resurgence in accumulation among long-term holders (LTHs). Glassnode's Accumulation Trend Score has reached its maximum value of 1.0, reflecting strong buying activity. Over the past 90 days, more than 374,000 BTC have transitioned into long-term holdings, suggesting growing investor confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value. 5. Bullish Market Sentiment Market analysts project continued price appreciation. Galaxy Digital's Alex Thorn forecasts Bitcoin potentially reaching $185,000 by the end of 2025. Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital envisions a target of $200,000, citing increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory developments. 6. Supportive Regulatory Environment The current U.S. administration's pro-crypto stance has fostered a regulatory environment conducive to digital asset growth. Initiatives like the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the disbanding of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team reflect a shift towards embracing blockchain technologies, potentially attracting further investment. Conclusion The explosion in $100K–$300K Bitcoin call options underscores a market characterized by optimism and speculative fervor as traders remain positive that BTC will continue trading above the psychological price of $100,000. Nevertheless, this crypto bull case should not underscore the inherent risks triggered by the market’s volatile nature.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9472/six-figure-bitcoin-call-options-surge-as-traders-chase-100-k,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T15:12:11,"Ex-Ripple exec’s company to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategy","While Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook is the talk of Wall Street, another U.S.-listed company, Know Labs, is set to join the growing list of publicly traded Bitcoin treasury companies. Former Ripple chief risk officer Greg Kidd is set to acquire Know Labs Inc., a medical device company that offers non-invasive health monitoring solutions, and adopt a Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury strategy. Know Labs announced the news on June 6, stating that Goldeneye 1995 LLC, an affiliate of Greg Kidd, has agreed to acquire a majority stake. Once the deal closes, the former Ripple executive will become the new chief executive officer and chairman of Know Labs. The acquisition will be completed using a mix of Bitcoin and cash, with Know Labs deploying Goldeneye’s 1,000 BTC payment as part of its treasury strategy. Investors in the company will gain “significant economic exposure to this highly attractive digital asset,” Know Labs wrote in a press release. You might also like: Trump Media files Form S-3 with U.S. SEC over $2.3B raise for Bitcoin treasury Know Labs is Greg Kidd’s latest crypto-related venture. The co-founder and CEO of venture capital firm Hard Yaka has backed several crypto companies, including Ripple, Coinbase, Robinhood, Uphold, and Solana. He previously served in the Federal Reserve’s payments division. His move to take a Bitcoin strategy approach may be inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has amassed a massive haul of BTC since first buying the asset in August 2020.. “I’m thrilled to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy with the support of a forward-looking organization like Know Labs at a time when market and regulatory conditions are particularly favorable,” Kidd said. Know Labs’ Bitcoin holdings will account for 82% of its $128 million market cap once the BTC is added to the balance sheet. This will give the company a net asset value multiple of 1.22x, based on a BTC price of $105,000 at closing. Know Labs expects the transaction to close in Q3 2025, subject to shareholder approval and the finalization of customary closing conditions.

2025-06-06T15:10:21,"Publicly Listed UK Gold Mining Firm to Convert Its Gold Revenue to Bitcoin for Reserve","Bluebird, a UK-listed gold mining company, has announced plans to use the money it earns from gold to build Bitcoin reserves. The company disclosed this in a brief release on X. However, Jonathan Morley-Kirk, the company's Non-executive Chairman, presented more details in a follow-up statement. Bluebird on X Bluebird Eyeing a Bitcoin StrategyMorley-Kirk explained that Bluebird, which runs gold projects across Asia, sees this as the right moment to rethink its approach.Bluebird believes it makes sense to shift toward a strategy that includes both gold and Bitcoin. Morley-Kirk pointed out that gold has long served as a reliable store of value and remains an important asset for central banks and investors. However, he also stressed how Bitcoin's role in the financial scene keeps growing, especially as more people look for ways to protect their money from inflation, rising debt, and global uncertainty. Bluebird sees Bitcoin not as a threat to gold but as a modern counterpart, and the company plans to convert future gold revenue into Bitcoin, treating it as digital gold.Bitcoin Outperforms GoldNotably, Bitcoin has outperformed gold over the past decade, with proponents such as Strategy's Michael Saylor claiming that its volatility makes it better. Recently, Bitwise projected Bitcoin to grow 53.1% annually in the next decade, while it predicted gold to drop 3.6% within this period. Bluebird will not just buy Bitcoin occasionally. Specifically, it wants to hold it as part of its balance sheet, using it as a treasury reserve. The company believes this strategy, paired with low overhead costs, sets it apart from other UK-listed mining firms. To help lead the way, Bluebird is searching for a new CEO who understands digital assets and can help build this strategy from the ground up. Aidan Bishop, the Executive Director and Interim CEO, supports this. He said he believes Bitcoin will reshape financial markets and help Bluebird attract a new kind of investor. Multiple Firms Now Joining the Bitcoin Strategy Campaign This move puts Bluebird in line with a growing list of companies building Bitcoin into their financial playbooks. Just last month, DDC, an Asian food company, bought 21 Bitcoin and set a target of 500 BTC in six months and 5,000 BTC in three years. Just days back, SolarBank, a North American engineering firm, also adopted a Bitcoin treasury plan. While it hasn't shared details yet, the company confirmed that it sees Bitcoin as a major part of its financial future.These firms follow in the footsteps of others who jumped into Bitcoin in 2024. KULR Technology Group began buying Bitcoin in December and committed to putting up to 90% of its extra cash into it. By the end of that month, it had already bought 217.18 BTC worth about $21 million. Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Hoth Therapeutics, and LQR House also approved plans to buy Bitcoin, each starting with at least $1 million.According to Bitcoin Treasuries, 225 entities now hold Bitcoin. Of those, 124 are public companies, which together own more than 816,000 BTC, worth over $85 billion. Private firms make up 34 of the holders. Altogether, these 225 entities control 3.4 million Bitcoin, accounting for more than 17% of the total coins in circulation.

2025-06-06T15:08:09,"Top 3 reasons why the crypto market is down today","The crypto market retreated after Thursday’s trading session, with Bitcoin falling to a low of $100,470, marking its lowest point since May 8 and 10% below its highest level this year. Below are three reasons why the crypto market was trading lower. 1. Profit taking Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins pulled back due to profit-taking among investors after the recent rally. BTC had climbed roughly 50% from its April low to its May high. Similarly, Ethereum jumped 100% from its April lows to the highest point in May. Many smaller coins, including Dogwifhat and Fartcoin, were up over 300%. It is common for cryptocurrencies to retreat after a strong surge. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said in a Thursday note to crypto.news: “After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.” Uncertainty on Federal Reserve policy Cryptocurrencies also declined amid growing uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have indicated they are not in a rush to cut rates, contrary to suggestions from President Trump. Instead, they are monitoring the effects of tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Data released on Friday showed that the economy added 139,000 jobs in May, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2% The U.S. will release updated inflation data on Wednesday next week. If inflation comes in higher than expected, it could signal that the Fed will hold rates higher for longer, pressuring crypto prices. Conversely, a lower-than-expected inflation figure would raise the odds of the Fed cutting rates sooner than anticipated. You might also like: Circle stock price pump gains steam, but a crash may follow Geopolitical uncertainty Bitcoin and altcoins have also dropped due to ongoing geopolitical tensions involving the United States. The Trump administration recently announced export curbs on key technologies to China. In response, China has withheld the supply of rare earth elements used in multiple industries. While Xi Jinping and Trump spoke on Thursday, signs suggest that these trade tensions will persist. Cryptocurrencies and equities typically perform better when geopolitical tensions are minimal. For instance, both markets rallied in May as tensions eased ahead of and following the U.S.-China meeting in Switzerland. Bitcoin price signals recovery BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be poised for a rebound, potentially reaching a new all-time high. The daily chart shows that BTC found support at the 50-day moving average and is beginning to form a bullish engulfing pattern. It’s also shaping the handle portion of a cup-and-handle pattern—a popular bullish continuation setup. The upper boundary is around $109,300, while the lower boundary sits near $74,387, giving the formation a depth of nearly $35,000. Adding that depth to the upper edge projects a potential target of $144,000. Most altcoins are likely to rebound if this plays out.

2025-06-06T15:07:09,"Donald Trump-Elon Musk Debate Hits Cryptocurrency Markets Too! Millions of Dollars Became Liquid! Here Are the Details","The cryptocurrency market experienced a massive liquidation wave over the past 24 hours, with more than 223,300 investors liquidating their positions, totaling over $980.9 million. Near $1 Billion Daily Liquidation in Crypto Market: Overly Leveraged Long Positions Rattled by Macro Concerns According to data shared by Coinglass, these liquidations were largely caused by over-leveraged long positions. According to experts, since the disclosed data only includes publicly available data, the actual amount of liquidation is probably higher than this figure. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu evaluated this sharp decline as follows: “The $980 million liquidation event was a perfect storm of Trump-Musk tensions, macroeconomic fears about tariffs, and an overleveraged market. The inherent fragility in crypto markets caused automated liquidations to quickly turn into a chain reaction, turning a sentiment-based pullback into a flash market crash.” While $876.2 million of the total liquidation came from long positions, the cryptocurrency most affected was Bitcoin. On the BTC side, $341.7 million worth of liquidation occurred. Approximately 90% of this amount originated from long positions. Ether (ETH) came in second with $285.6 million in liquidation. Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) were among the other major altcoins where significant positions were liquidated. According to Vincent Liu, the sharp declines in BTC and ETH caused excessive optimism in the market to work against investors: “Investors who used excessive leverage were caught off guard by the sharp corrections in Bitcoin and Ether, which led to bullish sentiment accelerating the market crash.” Trump-Musk Conflict and Macro Developments Were Effective Cryptocurrency prices have gained momentum in recent weeks, allowing Bitcoin to reach an all-time high of $111,800. However, the correction process that followed this peak accelerated after the social media debate between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Markets have been on edge after Musk’s harsh criticism of Trump’s tax and spending bill, calling it a “disgusting disgrace.” Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000, its lowest level since early May, but has recovered to $103,333 by press time. Nick Ruck, Director of LVRG Research, commented on the background of the decline as follows: “Bitcoin’s price had been hovering around support levels since its peak two weeks ago. Investors were nervous about possible corrections. The dispute between Trump and Musk triggered widespread liquidations, raising concerns about potential mutual sanctions.” Investors are now looking ahead to U.S. employment data and consumer price index (CPI) data due June 11. These data could be important catalysts for the next big price move, Kronos CIO Liu said. *This is not investment advice.

Bulls are aiming for another all-time high, while bears are hoping that price can retrace below the $100k level and beyond. Let’s find out which scenario is more probable in this BTC price prediction. Table of Contents What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin short-term price prediction Bitcoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook BTC price factors for June 2025 Currently ranked at the 1st position with a market cap of $2.1 trillion, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has enjoyed a decent bull run so far with prices reaching $111,970.17, two weeks ago, which also marked its all-time high. Since then the token has seen a 6.45% drop in prices and is currently trading at $104,743, and still in an uptrend on all major HTF timeframes. BTC 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the BTC price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Bitcoin price prediction in June 2025. What is Bitcoin? An individual or group of individuals going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto first detailed the decentralized cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin in a whitepaper published in 2008. It was introduced shortly thereafter, in January 2009. Being a peer-to-peer internet currency, BTC eliminates the need for an intermediary to approve or facilitate transactions by allowing them to occur directly between equal, independent network participants. As Nakamoto himself stated, the purpose of BTC was to enable “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” BTC is the first cryptocurrency to be used in practice, while there have been other ideas for a similar kind of decentralized electronic currency before it. Now let’s discuss BTC price prediction in June 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

The protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused uncertainty in international markets for years. Decentralized assets like BTC, which some view as a hedge against the economic instability brought on by wars and geopolitical unrest, have become more popular as a result of this circumstance. Markets have also been tense due to trade concerns between major economies including the US and China as well as the uncertainties surrounding tariffs. The general volatility in conventional markets frequently increases BTC’s appeal as an alternative investment, even though recent pauses in the escalation of tariffs between these two countries have generated short-term optimism. Concerns about inflation continue to influence global monetary policy on the macroeconomic level. In an effort to find a balance between containing inflation and promoting economic growth, central banks—including the US Federal Reserve—have been more cautious when it comes to raising interest rates. BTC’s function as a store of value is becoming more and more alluring to investors wishing to protect their investment as inflation continues to be a major worry. However, the asset class is maturing as a result of significant institutional usage of BTC, as demonstrated by Bitcoin ETFs and incorporation into payment systems, as well as increased regulatory clarity. But given the ongoing turbulence in both the conventional and cryptocurrency markets, it appears that BTC’s future is still dependent on the more uncertain global economic landscape. Immediate Support and Resistance Levels Key resistance level for BTC is the 107k level, while its key support is around the 100k level.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including BTC, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the BTC token. Will Bitcoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the BTC token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new integrations in new world companies, increased token holders, and so on. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for BTC price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low BTC can go. Should I invest in Bitcoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any BTC price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the BTC token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-06-06T15:01:48,"U.S. jobs report sends mixed signals, Bitcoin traders eye Fed’s next move","U.S. jobs growth in May was in line with expectations, suggesting that the Fed may keep rate cuts on schedule. Despite earlier expectations, U.S. jobs data was not the major crypto market mover this week. On Friday, June 6, U.S. hiring slowed, with employers adding 139,000 new jobs . While this figure was lower than the revised 147,000 for April, it was still slightly above the forecasted range of 125,000 to 130,000. U.S non-farm payroll monthly change, seasonally adjusted | Source: BLS At the same time, the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, a relatively low figure for the metric. Notably, government jobs accounted for 22,000 of the jobs lost, painting an even stronger picture for the private sector. While these figures are not particularly bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) , they are unlikely to have triggered the recent market slump. You might also like: Musk dragging Trump into the Epstein files has nothing to do with the crypto market — and everything to do with it In reality, employment data was completely overshadowed by the public split between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk. Still, macro factors will continue to play a key role in Bitcoin’s performance in the near future. Bitcoin traders anticipate the Fed’s next moves With the jobs data meeting expectations, the Federal Reserve will likely maintain its cautious stance on interest rates. According to analysts at Bitfinex , the jobs figure is one of the key metrics the Fed uses to guide its policy direction. Relatively strong employment data means the Fed feels less pressure to reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy. Instead, it will likely remain laser-focused on inflation, which it sees as a major risk tied to Trump’s trade policy. In this context, high interest rates will likely help strengthen the dollar and weigh on Bitcoin ETF flows. Still, the macro environment remains in flux, and reversals are more than possible. At this time, even the Fed is cautious about shifting its policy in either direction.
