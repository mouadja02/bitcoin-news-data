2025-06-06T12:51:36,"Ethereum ETFs extend inflow streak despite token bleed","Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) defy broader market downturn, holding steady with fresh inflows despite token’s struggles. On June 5, 2024, Ethereum ETFs recorded total inflows of $11.3 million, according to data from SosoValue. This marked the continuation of a positive trend that began earlier in the week, pushing their inflow streak to 14 consecutive days. However, the latest numbers reflected a notable drop from previous days. BlackRock’s ETHA was solely responsible for all the inflows, pulling in approximately $34.7 million. Offsetting the gains, Fidelity’s FETH recorded outflows of $23.4 million, while other issuers saw no activity. Still, the performance marked a win for the funds, especially when compared to ETH’s recent price action . Trading at hands at $2,478 at press time, the token is down approximately 6% in the past two weeks. ETH now sits roughly 33% below its 2025 high of around $3,700, reached earlier in January.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs failed to mirror their ETH counterparts, shedding $278 million in outflows on the same day. This was likely triggered by Thursday’s sharp price drop, which followed the headline-grabbing feud between US President Donald Trump and tech CEO Elon Musk. BTC led a broader market decline , slipping 3% and falling back to the $100,000 price range. In the bigger picture, Bitcoin ETF flows have swung inconsistently between inflows and outflows in the past weeks, reflecting continued investor uncertainty around the token’s performance. As Ether ETFs uphold their positive performance, issuers are loading up on the token. On June 3, on-chain analytics revealed that BlackRock purchased $50 million worth of Ether. Additionally, market confidence hasn’t completely waned despite the token’s price woes, and recent remarks by co-founder Vitalk Buterin chart a positive outlook for the broader ecosystem.

2025-06-06T12:45:52,"Strategy increases Stride fundraising goal to $1B","Strategy announced the initial price for its Stride preferred stock, while expanding the intended offering from $250M to $1B. The new preferred shares will contribute to its general BTC purchases, though the funds will come from selected investors this time. Strategy (MSTR) announced new details of its Stride (STRD) preferred stock, a new tool for fundraising. The STRD offering will be expanded from $250M to $1B, giving the company more leeway for BTC purchases and partially covering other operating costs. Initially, STRD was supposed to sell just 2.5M shares to a smaller circle of investors. This is Strategy’s biggest IPO upsize compared to previous share sales. STRD launches with a discount The initial sale price of STRD will be $85 , with the issuance and sale scheduled for June 10, depending on the completion of final closing conditions. STRD may see demand based on the previous performance of STRK and STRF, which rallied above their IPO prices. The performance may also hinge on the price of BTC and general market sentiment. The offering will place 11,764,700 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride preferred stock. The shares will have a liquidation preference price of $100, as previously stated. Initially, the STRD price was also expected to be $100, so the discount at the initial sale is considered a bid to increase funding. Strategy expects proceeds of $979.7M, excluding discounts and commissions for the underwriters. The proceeds will go toward new BTC acquisitions, as well as general corporate purposes, announced the company. The new STRD asset will offer a 10% dividend, which is not mandatory and depends on favorable market conditions. If declared, dividends will be paid out quarterly. The new sale arrived after Strategy added a small weekly purchase , bringing its total treasury to 580,250 BTC. Strategy bets on STRD to revive its stock growth The proposed placement of $1B in new preferred shares far surpasses previous STRK and STRF placements. On the one hand, the ability to raise more funds would be good news for Strategy and its appeal to investors. However, there are ongoing doubts that Michael Saylor needs to get more creative with fundraising to continue his BTC purchasing strategy. If successful, the offering will give Strategy a leeway to acquire close to 10,000 BTC. The company has no fixed limit to buying BTC on a weekly basis, with purchases depending on demand for its other stock types. Usually, purchases were financed with a mix of MSTR common stock, as well as STRF and STRK. Following the pricing announcement, MSTR common stock traded at $386.60. STRF shares fell to exactly $100, from a recent peak at $107. STRK traded at $101.64. All three share types have sunk below their 2025 peaks as BTC also slid from its recent record at $112,000. The risk profile of STRD also makes the other assets look safer and more attractive. For some potential investors, STRD is the equivalent of a junk bond tranche. The discount price and potential passive income make STRD akin to a high-risk bond. The new IPO coming in a few days will measure institutional demand for Strategy’s BTC maximalism.

Created in 2009 by an unknown person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money directly between people without a bank or middleman. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin is a digital system where everyone shares the same record of transactions. This shared system ensures everyone agrees on who owns what, making it secure and trustworthy. Over the years, Bitcoin's value has seen big ups and downs. By 2025, it has reached new milestones, surpassing previous all-time highs. Many early investors have seen significant returns. Some experts believe Bitcoin will continue to rise. Predictions suggest it could reach prices as high as $1.5 million by 2030, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Others are less optimistic, like Warren Buffett, who doubts its long-term value. Whether Bitcoin will keep climbing depends on many factors, like demand and adoption by big institutions. While some are hopeful about its future, it's important to consider the risks. Bitcoin's journey is ongoing, and only time will tell if it will reach new heights. Conclusion Despite Bitcoin's impressive gains surpassing giants like Amazon, Tesla, and Meta, some analysts see limited short-term potential compared to emerging AI-driven altcoins.

Nonfarm payrolls grew 139,000 last month, according to the a report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts called for gains of 130,000 and April's job growth was 147,000 (revised from an originally reported 177,000). The unemployment rate for May was 4.2% against expectations for 4.2% and April's 4.2%.

Always a closely-followed print, the May payrolls data was of particular import this time around as a string of economic reports this week pointed to growing economic weakness. Among them were the slowest ADP jobs growth in more than two years, ISM Services slipping into levels suggesting economic contraction and a rise in initial jobless claims to the highest level since October. Nearing 4.50% as the week began, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to as low as 4.32% and the odds of a summer Fed rate cut(s) had risen appreciably ahead of this morning's report.

2025-06-06T12:32:15,"Trump–Musk Feud Triggers $1B Crypto Liquidations in Hours","It was a typical day in the cryptocurrency markets, until the world's two most influential men in tech and politics, Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, ignited a social-media firestorm. By Thursday night, what began as heated tweets about Trump's ”Big, Beautiful Bill” had turned into a very public brawl, with Musk unleashing a string of messages on X and Trump fighting back on Truth Social. Musk's audience and prolific posting quickly surpassed Trump's, who, despite all his presidential pulpit, could not keep pace with the Tesla CEO's rapid-fire shots. Social media was left agog over the drama, with one observer commenting, ”This is honestly a wild amount of drama, if you remember we're running a country here.” But the backlash was not just online drama. As Musk called Trump ungrateful and even invoked the Epstein documents, Trump retaliated by vowing to pull government contracts from Musk's companies and calling him ”crazy”. The impact was immediate: Tesla shares plunged 14%, erasing over $150 billion in market value, and the crypto market went into a tailspin. Bitcoin dropped below $101,000, Ethereum dropped 7%, and Dogecoin, long fueled by Musk tweets, dropped nearly 10% within a day. On-chain data showed that more than $988 million in leveraged positions were liquidated over 24 hours, $888 million of which were long positions. Bybit and Binance suffered the most, with Bybit alone seeing $354 million in liquidations. Altcoins like Solana and meme tokens like DOGE and PEPE were also not spared the bloodbath, with DOGE holders particularly suffering as Musk's support evaporated. CoinGlass liquidation heatmaps painted a vivid picture: clusters of forced liquidations stacked up at $105,900 and $100,600, showing how extremely leveraged longs were vaporized as prices fell lower. Twitter was ablaze with memes of the Musk–Trump feud and screenshots of traders' losses. One viral post summed up the mood: ”The Elon Musk vs Donald Trump drama has escalated to a full on war.”. Trump is going to lose this one and it won't be particularly close.” On-chain sentiment metrics like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index also tanked, reflecting a race from ”greed” to ”fear” as traders scrambled to close out positions. The carnage also exposed deeper vulnerabilities in the market. Glassnode analytics pointed to long-term holders taking profit after Bitcoin's all-time high, with previous areas of accumulation becoming active selling zones. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $278 million in outflows, and institutional momentum appeared to wane as even MicroStrategy's latest purchase was a portion of previous ones. Meme coins, which had been riding retail euphoria, were the biggest losers. DOGE, PEPE, and Solana-based tokens all posted double-digit losses, their volatility fueled by Musk's shifting allegiances and Trump's capricious rhetoric. As the dust settles, the questions linger: Will the feud still stoke volatility? Is this a bottom, or the dawn of a new era in which political theatre trumps fundamentals? With nearly a billion dollars in liquidations and sentiment shaken, the Trump–Musk saga is a jarring reminder that in crypto, a single tweet can vaporize fortunes overnight.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9469/trump-musk-feud-triggers-1-b-crypto-liquidations-in-hours,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|PEPE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T12:24:43,"How Low Could Bitcoin Price Go in This Crypto Market Crash?","The post How Low Could Bitcoin Price Go in This Crypto Market Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Highlights Bitcoin price fell 5.2% to a low of $100,345 yesterday due to leveraged trade liquidations and geopolitical tensions. Whale James Wynn had long positions worth $16.14 million liquidated, closing all running positions. Despite the downturn, on June 6th, Bitcoin showed a 3% rise, as trade talks between the U.S. and China are set to resume. The crypto market crash gained steam overnight as its top crypto, “Bitcoin price,” fell 5.2% to a low of $100,345. This fall was seen due to the liquidation of leveraged trades, geopolitics, and the Elon Musk-Donald Trump feud. Keep reading, as this article will shed light on the main reasons for the overnight crash and whether the bull run in BTC is over or not. Aggregated Reasons For Yesterday’s Bitcoin Price Decline The primary reason for the decline was Trump signing a new executive order, which has fueled volatility in major financial instruments, and that has affected BTC’s sentiment too. His EO this time has throwed lightning on steel and aluminium tariffs, which have jumped by 50%, to promote American in-house factories’ production to scale up. Similarly, arguments with China have once again started to heat up, and no resolution has been worked out between China and the US yet. As a result of these global pessimistic factors, the crypto market went into bearish mode last night, the growing uncertainty is creating delays in major technological advancements, too. The result of the bearish mode caused liquidations of 215,593 traders in the past 24 hours, and the total liquidations come in at $967.63 million, per Coinglass. It said the largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex – XBTUSD, valued at $10.00 million. Meanwhile, a popular whale, James Wynn, had long positions worth $16.14 million liquidated. As a result, he had to close all his running long positions, as reported by Lookonchain. Joining the bearish facts, the fallout between Trump and his ex-best buddy, Elon Musk, is also adding bearish pressure on the market. This feud is caused by “big, beautiful bill”, Musk asked that it end EV subsidies and advance debt on the country. This combination of factors is having a strong impact on the crypto market, as Donald Trump and Elon Musk are known among the top crypto advocates for the crypto space, and the feud between them is affecting investors ‘ sentiment. Should We Be Concerned About Bitcoin Price? After the catastrophic last night for top crypto and altcoins, June 6th has shown a 3% rise to $103,976, also the recent 12-hour Rekt shows rising short liquidation compared to longs. This sudden optimism happened as the long-disputed and most argued trade talks between the US and China are set to restart , which has turned yesterday’s bearish situation, and kept the price of BTC above the previous month’s support zone. As per price action, it appears on the daily chart that this daily move took market liquidity by hitting several stop losses, and this could be a trigger point for an upcoming move northwards. Therefore, if things go south and pressure grows, then by June end the price could go as low as $92917. However, if things go north then this time $130K mark is the target for June-end.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-low-could-bitcoin-price-go-in-this-crypto-market-crash/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T12:14:47,"Metaplanet issues new financing to reach 2027 goal of 210,000 BTC portfolio","Metaplanet announced a plan to buy 210,000 Bitcoins by 2027, which will account for 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, revealed a special Bitcoin equity financing plan with a total scale of $5.4 billion to be achieved through the issuance of 555 million mobile exercise warrants. Metaplanet’s previous equity financing plan, dubbed the 210 Million Plan, raised 93.3 billion yen ($650 million) in just 60 trading days, achieving a BTC yield of 189% and a stock price jump of more than three times. The recent plan to issue 555 million moving strike warrants is the biggest acquisition in the Japanese stock market. Metaplanet currently ranks first in Asia and eighth worldwide in Bitcoin holdings of 8,888, valued at $919,657,358. Metaplanet relies on a balanced financing plan to fuel growth Metaplanet has relied on a balanced financing plan between stock and debt issuance since the beginning of the year. The company issued 21 million shares in five installments under a strategy called a 210 Million Plan. It acquired 12.8 million shares in the 14th and 17th series, contributing to more than 35 billion yen, about 42% of the planned stock issuance. The company has already completed early repayment of several installments, including the 9th series due in September, using the proceeds of stock issuance to pay the full 2 billion yen in bond value. Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin — again! 🚀 This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our Bitcoin strategy. Our new target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. Details here: https://t.co/ahL27o9QBg pic.twitter.com/njYybVq1uu — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 6, 2025 The “Japanese MicroStrategy” stock price went up by 21% on Tuesday to an all-time high of 1,423 JPY following the company’s recent purchase of 1,088 BTC. The company stock has risen by 255% since the beginning of the year, attracting more investors. Since last month, the company’s stock has increased 181%, outperforming major Japanese companies. Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, has publicly shown on-chain verification of the company’s assets, building confidence among investors by providing proof of reserve for its Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy , criticized proof of reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, saying it poses a security risk. Strategy bought 705 BTC for $75 million, but the stock increased by only 1 % on Monday. Analysts believe Metaplanet’s transparency has given them a competitive advantage by attracting investor confidence. Metaplanet targets 210,000 BTC accumulation in 2 years The 555 Million Plan, as described by Metaplanet, followed the 210 Million Plan, which targets 30,000 BTC holdings from the previous 10,000 BTC in 2025. The company plans to hold 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and increase it to 210,000 BTC in 2027 to become a major player in the Bitcoin game. Metaplanet’s decision could trigger the Bitcoin market to surge as more institutional investors move to BTC to save their assets against inflation and potential growth in value. Bitcoin is trading at $103,794.60 today, up 2.15% after the announcement. 144 companies have adopted a Bitcoin treasury, with 114 of them being publicly traded companies. Gerry O’Shea, Head of Global Markets at Hashdex, revealed that Trump Media, GameStop, K33, and Paris Saint-Germain have recently adopted the Bitcoin Strategy to advance their Bitcoin treasuries. Strategy remains the biggest holder, accumulating 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. The Japanese company revealed it achieved a BTC yield of 225.4% from the beginning of this year, signaling a high shareholder value. BTC yield assesses the effectiveness of the Bitcoin acquisition strategy in driving shareholder value. The company revealed that they share the Strategy belief that Bitcoin-backed securities form the link between the old financial world and the new. It added that the issuance of perpetual duration securities backed by Bitcoin in the U.S. marks a critical point in the global shift of capital markets. According to the company, Bitcoin is dematerializing $300 trillion of 20th-century analog store of value assets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-06T12:10:09,"UK to allow Bitcoin ETFs for retail investors","The UK’s financial regulator is opening the door for wider retail access to crypto -linked investment products. On June 6, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed lifting its ban on cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs), allowing UK retail investors to buy these products on recognized investment exchanges for the first time. The move marks a major step toward regulated crypto exposure for the public. While UK investors still won’t get access to spot Bitcoin ETFs like in the US, ETNs provide a way to trade debt instruments that track digital asset prices, without holding the underlying crypto. Safeguards will still apply. Products must meet the UK’s financial promotion rules, be listed on regulated exchanges, and include clear risk disclosures. Incentives and aggressive promotions will remain restricted. ETNs: What investors need to know ETNs are unsecured debt notes that mirror the price of assets like Bitcoin , but carry issuer risk and don’t grant ownership of the actual crypto. In practice, the experience will feel like trading an ETF, complete with a ticker and intraday liquidity, but without direct title to coins. Retail investors will now be able to buy the same sterling-denominated ETNs that professional investors already trade on the London Stock Exchange , including products from 21Shares, WisdomTree, Invesco, and ByteTree (such as the bitcoin-and-gold BOLD ETN). ByteTree founder Charlie Morris welcomed the move: “ “I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.” I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.

But for UK investors, today’s move signals progress, and the clearest path yet to bringing mainstream crypto access inside the regulatory perimeter.

Why Did Japan Revise Its Payment Services Law? The revision is a direct response to the rising bankruptcy risks among foreign crypto exchanges . When such platforms collapse, the crypto assets held by Japanese investors are often at risk of outflows or loss . In 2024, a major crypto exchange in Japan was hacked, leading to a Bitcoin outflow worth over $305 million . The incident raised serious concerns about the security of customer funds and highlighted the need for stricter regulations . Key Highlights of Japan’s Revised Crypto Law Stronger Investor Protection: The new law mandates that crypto exchanges operating in Japan must hold investor assets domestically , shielding them from foreign exchange bankruptcies. Flexible Business Model: A new intermediary framework will allow smoother collaboration between crypto exchanges and users , even for in-app crypto asset use in games. Trust-Type Stablecoins Update: Issuers can now manage up to 50% of their stablecoin issuance in low-risk assets , creating room for innovation while maintaining safety. Stringent Registration Requirements: All crypto-related entities must now register under the revised PSA , with strict AML and CFT compliance rules in place. What’s Next? The law passed both the Lower House in May and the Upper House on June 6 . It will be enforced within a year . Japan is also introducing a new category for businesses that facilitate interaction between exchanges and users , encouraging innovation in crypto asset services while tightening oversight.

2025-06-06T12:07:08,"There is a $4 Billion Options Earthquake in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Today – Here are the Details","Cryptocurrency analysis company GreeksLive has shared remarkable data regarding large-scale option contracts set to expire in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) markets today. A total of 31,000 BTC options are expiring. The Put/Call ratio of these options is at 0.71, meaning there are fewer put options than call options. The “maximum loss” point for BTC is $105,000, which represents the price range where option investors face the most losses. The total theoretical value of these BTC options expiring is calculated as $3.18 billion. At the same time, 241,000 ETH options are expiring. On the Ethereum side, the Put/Call ratio is 0.63, and the maximum loss point is $2,575. The total value of ETH options is $590 million. GreeksLive made the following assessment of the general situation in the market: “The market has been volatile for most of the week. The sharp decline in Tesla shares last night led to a significant pullback in the cryptocurrency market along with U.S. stocks. This came after the tension between Trump and Elon Musk became public.” Related News: How Many Bitcoins Have Been Lost Forever? Latest Data Revealed, Here's the True Maximum BTC Supply The company also noted that options delivered this week accounted for around 10% of total positions, a recovery from the decline in recent weeks. Block purchases also increased, with trading activity rising across the market. Finally, GreeksLive argued that institutional investors do not expect a sudden rise for major cryptocurrencies in the near term, but instead a more moderate and long-term bullish scenario comes to the fore. *This is not investment advice.

On Thursday, SHIB experienced a significant 7.7% correction, dropping to 0.0000119 before finding strong support at the 0.0000120 level. Prices have since bounced to $0.00001241, according to CoinDesk data. A massive whale transaction of 2.87 trillion SHIB, worth $36 million to Coinbase Institutional, initially triggered market concerns, according to CoinDesk's AI research. The transaction, however, was later identified as being associated with market maker custody rather than a whale looking to sell coins. However, despite the recovery, SHIB still trades 10% lower for the week as investors navigate broader market pressures. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency remains stuck in a downward-trending channel, identified by trendlines connecting the highs on May 12 and May 23 and the low on May 17. AI technical insights for the past 24 hours SHIB dropped from 0.0000129 to a low of 0.0000119, representing a 7.7% decline with exceptionally high volume (2.9B) during the 19:00 hour sell-off. The price found strong support at the 0.0000120 level, with accumulation evidenced by above-average volume, establishing a clear demand zone. An ascending support trendline has formed during the recovery phase, with the price stabilizing around 0.0000122, approximately 4.9% above the period low. SHIB demonstrated a significant recovery pattern in the last hour, climbing with notable volume spikes. Substantial accumulation occurred at 07:55 with exceptionally high volume (32.3B).

2025-06-06T12:05:13,"GVNR Launches Token Sale on Republic, With Big Aims For DeFi","GVNR, a permissionless general message-passing protocol aiming to tackle fragmentation in decentralised finance (DeFi), has officially launched its public token sale on Republic via Reg D. The raise enables global backers and accredited U.S. investors (this is big, more later) to participate in what the team calls “the next infrastructure layer for DeFi”. As the DeFi sector has grown, so too has the divide between the very blockchains that make up the over $110 billion that’s invested in the space. Innovations unfortunately don’t happen on one chain alone, and with more coming online every year, each solving a different issue in its own unique way, our new crypto frontier full of energy and hope is being segmented into branded silos. These silos aren’t interconnected, they are becoming barriers and hurdles for users and builders alike. The GVNR protocol was built to address this growing issue, not through another wrapped asset standard or custodial bridge, but through a fundamentally different model. The Infrastructure At the beating digital heart of GVNR lies a general message-passing protocol designed to let any user, smart contract, or AI agent control assets across multiple chains. This sounds complex, but in short, their model allows actors (human or AI) to perform tasks like swaps, payments, and governance actions natively, without relying on external bridge infrastructure that can introduce security vulnerabilities. Instead, commands are executed through a permissionless, intent-based system. When we think about making crypto easier for the masses, this is exactly what is needed. We don’t know how secure messages are sent on our phones in milliseconds to our friends around the other side of the world, and this infrastructure starts to push that same envelope forward. The idea of seamless, secure governance of assets without the need for developer-level hoop jumping. To achieve this, GVNR has partnered with several leading infrastructure providers: Lit Protocol provides secure multi-party computation (MPC) technology, ensuring private key material remains hidden, even from node operators. POKT Network and Grove bring decentralised RPC access to over 40 chains, allowing GVNR to read and write data across networks reliably. Bancor Carbon DeFi DEX supports programmable liquidity and MEV resistance, reinforcing GVNR’s focus on sustainable on-chain economics. Ecosystem Ready Unlike many early-stage protocols and projects, GVNR isn’t launching on fantasy whitepapers that promise the world, then delivering undercooked digital garbage. Several core products are already live, and GVNR does appear to be doing everything in their power to show the world exactly what they are about before even seeking out this raise. This build-first approach has led to a first suite of products that is live, not a concept to imagine, but tangible products that are ready and waiting to be used: JUSTSWAP: A bridge-free cross-chain DEX that enables permissionless swaps with slippage protection and predictable execution. JUSTPAY: An embedded payment protocol allowing users to pay with any token on any chain, even when the merchant or recipient requires a different one. GVNR Portfolio: A multi-chain portfolio manager with a sleek UI, letting users view, manage, and track the top 100 assets per chain in one place. Roadmap: The Butler: An AI agent that acts on behalf of the user, executing transactions, monitoring portfolios, and handling cross-chain operations via natural language commands. Roadmap: BTCFI Bitcoin Backed DeFi Loans: An over collateralised DeFi loan platform where loans are based on non-custodial bitcoin. Each of these is designed to plug into the GVNR protocol, with the native $GVNR token at the center. Tokenomics and Utility Much like GVNR's approach to building their token, $GVNR also aims to solve problems and play roles across the protocol. From usage in fee abstraction to governance, it’s the fuel that drives the ecosystem forward, not just something to buy and hodl - it’s critical in the workings of the whole ecosystem. From launch, over 36% of the token’s fixed 20 million supply will be in circulation. For this type of product offering, that percentage is higher than we’ve come to expect recently and a welcome break from the low float high FDV model from 2024. Something that really stood out, and a central piece of the tokenomics model, is “The Furnace,” GVNR’s deflationary engine. This system uses protocol revenue to agnostically buy $GVNR on the open market and burn it, gradually reducing the 20m supply and aligning value with long-term holders. According to the project, this mechanism will scale over time burning from 25% up to 95% of protocol fees. A Regulated Path The sale is structured in three tiers, with early access granted to users who joined GVNR’s whitelist in advance. Unfortunately, the whitelist is now closed, but there are still more options available to latecomers before the token gets released into the wild. While global participants can take part, the use of Reg D enables legally compliant participation from U.S. accredited investors, a significant step forward from previous years. More information on how to participate, including registration and KYC guidance, can be found in GVNR’s official Republic deal page and supporting documentation. Why It Matters In a landscape where many protocols talk about cross-chain coordination, few have shipped working products with security, composability, and decentralisation at their core. GVNR has emerged as a serious contender, not just for its tech, but for its ability to navigate regulation, ship real products, and attract key partners. With DeFi entering its next phase, one shaped by AI, RWAs, and interchain liquidity, GVNR’s approach to unified control and programmable governance could prove essential.

2025-06-06T12:00:59,"Russia moves to relax crypto mining bans on tax revenue concerns","The executive power in Russia has suspended the expansion of a crypto mining ban that would have added several more regions to what’s already a long list of territories where the activity has been severely restricted. On Thursday, the government in Moscow scrapped or postponed measures to curb electricity consumption by Bitcoin miners in places from the Finnish border to beyond Lake Baikal, pointing to an expected decrease in tax and energy revenues as the main reason for the U-turn. Russian authorities take a step back on crypto mining ban Russia’s central government has decided to refrain from introducing restrictions on cryptocurrency mining to more regions, pausing the planned expansion of a ban that has already affected about a dozen subjects of the Federation. The change in course was adopted at a meeting of the government commission on the development of the electric power industry, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak and announced in a post in the cabinet’s Telegram channel on June 5. According to the press release, participants reviewed requests from authorities in several Russian regions seeking authorization to stop mining operations that have been often blamed by local officials for electricity shortages and blackouts. Meeting of the commission on the development of the electric power industry. Source: Russian government The commission declined to ban the activities of crypto miners in the Republic of Khakassia, citing the lack of adequate projections about the deficit of electricity and generation capacity in the region. It also highlighted decreasing tax revenues and profits from distribution. Proposals to curb mining submitted by the heads of the regional governments in the Russian Republic of Karelia, bordering Finland in the northwest, and Penza Oblast, around 600 km southeast of Moscow, were withdrawn during the meeting. Furthermore, the feds decided to postpone for two months the consideration of requests for year-round bans on coin minting in Zabaykalsky Krai, a region in Russia’s Far East also known as Transbaikal, and the neighboring Republic of Buryatia. The Russian government said it’s “taking into account the need to assess lost income in the electric grid complex” and to elaborate a mechanism for redistributing the power freed by the miners “in favor of socially significant consumers in energy-deficient regions.” Russia seeks to relocate miners to energy-rich parts of the country Despite its reluctance to allow the free circulation of Bitcoin and the like in its economy, the Russian Federation has been somewhat lenient in its attitude towards cryptocurrencies lately. For example, at the end of May, the Bank of Russia authorized investments in crypto derivatives . Mining became the first major crypto-related activity to be granted full regulatory recognition after it was legalized last year. Miners can now legally mint digital coins as long as they register with the Federal Tax Service ( FNS ) and pay taxes . But the constant expansion of crypto mining operations, both in industrial-scale Bitcoin farms and in private basements and garages, has caused headaches for authorities in some corners of the country such as Irkutsk Oblast, which attracts miners with low electricity rates. The Russian government is now considering how to entice mining firms to move to regions with surplus energy and idling infrastructure, including by offering them fuel it’s unable to sell to Europe due to Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. During its meeting, the power industry commission recommended: “The Ministry of Energy and the Federal Antimonopoly Service, together with energy companies, must also work out economic incentives for attracting mining loads to regions with surplus in terms of electricity and capacity.” Nearly a dozen Russian regions have been placed under a permanent mining ban until mid-March 2031 after some of them initially introduced only seasonal restrictions during periods of peak electricity consumption in cold winter months. The affected areas include southern Irkutsk, the Russian republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, North Ossetia, and Chechnya as well as the occupied parts of the Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

2025-06-06T12:00:52,"Dark Markets Reborn? Illicit Crypto Platforms Quietly Return Via Telegram—Report","According to blockchain intelligence experts, two major Telegram channels banned in mid‐May have quietly reappeared under new names. The move shows how some crypto crime outfits can bounce back almost immediately. They use simple steps to keep trading, even after high‐profile bans. Rebranding And Rapid Return On May 13, Telegram shut down the Huione Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee channels. Within days, though, both were active again under fresh handles. Based on reports from TRM Labs , Huione Group still runs private “VIP” channels for select vendors. They even relaunched their crypto exchange, taking payments in their own USDH stablecoin. That meant the ban was only a small hurdle. Huge Transaction Volumes Huione wasn’t a tiny operation. It handled over $80 billion in crypto deals from 2021 to now. Xinbi managed over $8.4 billion in USDT trades since 2022. Those figures make them bigger than many darknet markets before they went under. For perspective, Hydra, one of the largest underground markets at its peak, handled less volume before it collapsed in 2022. These markets move huge sums, and that draws more attention than smaller forums ever could. Enforcement Steps And Limits US regulators did take action. Just two weeks before the ban, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network listed Huione Group as a “primary money laundering concern.” On May 29, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control added Funnull Technology to its sanctions list. Funnull, based in the Philippines, was linked to Huione services. Yet, even these steps didn’t stop everything. One main Huione group saw membership fall from more than 800,000 to about 250,000, but it stayed open. Xinbi’s team even teased a relaunch under the name “Xinbi 2.0,” and some users worried about a possible exit scam if the operators ran off with funds. Shifting To New Venues When Telegram blocked these channels, some vendors skipped over to Tudou Guarantee, a site back in 2024 by Huione. TRM Labs noted that Tudou’s user count jumped nearly 30% after the bans. Other operators are now eyeing platforms like ChatMe and SafeW. These apps work like Telegram but don’t have the same kind of third‐party moderation. That leaves room for illicit trading. In other words, the networks don’t truly disappear—they just move to a new house. Guarantee Market Model These groups aren’t selling drugs or weapons directly. Instead, they act as an escrow service for illegal deals. Sellers post a security deposit. That deposit can be lost if they rip someone off. Buyers pick services or goods—fake IDs, SIM cards, even surveillance tools. Bots help manage orders. All payments run through crypto, so it’s hard to track who’s who. This setup makes it easy for big fraud rings to buy exactly what they need.

2025-06-06T11:45:56,"BTC accumulation trend is shifting from older holders to new wallets","BTC has shown mixed signs of accumulation and buying, leading to the relatively flat price action in the past month. However, Bitcoins continue to flow from older wallets into newer cohorts, as long-term holders realize profits. Bitcoin (BTC) continues with its sideways price action, on a mix of buying and selling. The leading coin is in an accumulation range, yet it has struggled to break into a new price range despite ongoing coin scarcity. Currently, BTC has absorbed most of the short-term distribution and profit-taking, and is back in the accumulation range, according to Glassnode. However, older whales are still active, while the rotation to new wallets is taking time. If accumulation is rising, why is $BTC still declining Because while distribution has slowed and accumulation is returning, it hasn’t been enough to offset the pressure from profit-taking by older holders. 🧵👇 https://t.co/hc4TVHxSIs pic.twitter.com/R4jFT0dVvC — glassnode (@glassnode) June 6, 2025 Large BTC holders are responsible for relative stability Until recently, most of the large BTC holders were trending toward coin distribution before switching to overall accumulation . Whale holders are closely watched, as they absorb the known sources of accessible BTC, including exchange reserves, newly mined coins, and reserves on OTC markets. The recent shift of ownership is seen as the main factor behind the relatively ‘boring’ price action, mostly driven by large-scale holders. Currently, every BTC sold finds a buyer, but wallet cohorts of over 12 months may be willing to sell and lock in their sizeable profits. Previous on-chain observations suggest prices above $90,000 per BTC are in the provenance of whales and institutions , with retail remaining a relatively small factor. The trend of distribution from the largest wallets to mid-range wallets with 100 to 1,000 BTC continues. Based on the Rainbow chart, Bitcoin is even more affordable, with a strong buy indicator , with the potential for accumulation at even higher prices. The distribution to wallets also remains less transparent after the inflow of institutions. Some continue to hold through Coinbase Custody, while other large holders control multiple wallets with smaller amounts of BTC. Derivative traders switch to fearful sentiment Demand from institutions works independently of derivative markets. Trading BTC on paper retains its different price mechanisms, driven by leveraged long and short positions. While spot traders and whales are buying up BTC, derivative traders are showing fearful behavior, shifting from extreme greed in May back into the fear range . According to CryptoQuant, the recent cycle still shows strong rallies , which are then tempered by a downward move. The shift may be a sign of big leveraged players trying to cool the market and retain relatively stable and high price levels to extend institutional adoption. In the coming days, derivative traders set up a new range for Bitcoin between $100,000 and $105,000. Any price moves may lead to liquidations of the most numerous positions around those price levels. BTC derivative traders are still limited by the new range of liquidity, this time between $100,000 and $105,000. | Source: Coinglass Derivative traders also partially rely on long-term whales, ETFs and corporate buyers for a deep support level. Even with the most recent acquisitions, some of the institutional buyers have an average acquisition price as low as $67,000. Miners have produced coins at breakeven and can also afford to hold their reserves at over 1.9M coins. Corporate holders as a whole bought up 3.39M coins, with more acquisitions announced almost daily, suggesting a long-term confidence and a relatively low risk of capitulation.

2025-06-06T11:45:31,"Wells Fargo’s Chief Economist Warns US Economy Is ‘Skating Pretty Close to a Recession’ – Here’s His Outlook","The chief economist at banking giant Wells Fargo, Jay Bryson, is warning that America is awfully close to entering an economic recession. In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Bryson says he’s not forecasting a recession at this time, but it wouldn’t take much more negative economic data to change that outlook. “We don’t have the economy going into recession. I would say we’re skating pretty close to one. It wouldn’t take another big shock to potentially push the economy into a recession if things are weakening later.” He expects next year to have greater economic growth than in 2025, which is facing a slowdown from the impacts of Trump’s tariffs. “2026 is going to be a lot better year than 2025. 2025 is, for us, more about the negative effects of tariffs. 2026 is more about some modest stimulus coming from the fiscal side, monetary ease and some deregulation.” Bryson also predicts that in about one year, the Fed will have lowered the current rate of 425-450 basis points to about 100 basis points to stimulate the economy. “A year from now, I still think rates are probably going to be about 100 basis points… If the unemployment rate does start to come up later this year, which we think it will, as tariffs slow the economy down, then we think the Fed pivots and then starts to cut rates.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-06T11:40:59,"Uber Eyes Stablecoins to Cut Cross-Border Payment Costs","Uber is exploring the use of stablecoins as a means to reduce the cost and complexity of international payments, according to CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Speaking at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 5, Khosrowshahi confirmed that the ridesharing giant is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as part of its broader fintech strategy. “We’re definitely going to take a look,” Khosrowshahi said during a live interview. “Stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value.” While he acknowledged Bitcoin’s popularity and established presence, he noted that stablecoins offer something more tangible for companies with global financial operations. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to mirror the value of traditional currencies—most commonly the US dollar—by being backed with fiat reserves and short-term treasury instruments. Khosrowshahi emphasized that their utility as a payment vehicle is what draws Uber’s interest. “They are super interesting to us, especially for moving money across borders and reducing international transaction costs,” he said. Uber Joins List of Companies Exploring Stablecoins Uber isn’t alone in considering stablecoins for mainstream financial infrastructure. Earlier this year, Stripe co-founder John Collison also revealed that the payment firm had entered preliminary talks with banks about integrating stablecoins into their systems. Stripe’s interest, like Uber, stems from the potential of these digital currencies to streamline cross-border payments and reduce reliance on outdated banking rails. According to a recent report by Fireblocks, 90% of surveyed institutional players are currently exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations. This includes not only fintech companies but also traditional banks and government institutions. Globally, governments are also exploring stablecoins. In April, Russia’s finance ministry proposed the creation of a government-backed stablecoin, while in Abu Dhabi, three major institutions teamed up to launch a dirham-pegged coin . These moves reflect a growing recognition of stablecoins as tools not just for speculation, but for efficient, regulated financial transactions. Stablecoin Market Sees Rapid Growth The stablecoin market has seen explosive growth over the past year. Citigroup reported that the market cap for U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins crossed $230 billion in April 2025—a 54% increase year-over-year. Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC dominate the market, making up roughly 90% of the total capitalization. With annual transaction volumes reaching $27.6 trillion in 2024—outpacing both Visa and Mastercard—stablecoins are fast becoming one of the most important tools in digital finance. For global platforms like Uber, their adoption may soon move from consideration to reality.

2025-06-06T11:40:12,"Shocking Bitcoin Donation: AlphaBay Darknet Wallet Sends Millions to Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht","BitcoinWorld Shocking Bitcoin Donation: AlphaBay Darknet Wallet Sends Millions to Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht In a development that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and darknet communities, a significant Bitcoin donation has reportedly been traced back to a wallet linked to the now-defunct darknet marketplace, AlphaBay. This transfer, amounting to 300 BTC – valued at approximately $31 million at the time of the report – was allegedly sent to addresses associated with Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht . This event not only highlights the enduring legacy of darknet markets but also raises serious questions about the movement of illicit funds within the crypto ecosystem. What Happened: The $31M Bitcoin Donation Explained According to reports citing blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, the substantial transfer of 300 Bitcoin originated from a wallet believed to be connected to AlphaBay. AlphaBay was one of the largest darknet markets operating after the shutdown of Silk Road, facilitating the trade of illicit goods and services before its own takedown in 2017. The recipient of this large sum is reportedly wallets controlled by or associated with Ross Ulbricht, who is currently serving a life sentence without parole for his role in creating and operating the original Silk Road marketplace. The sheer size of this alleged donation immediately drew attention, prompting investigations into the source and purpose of the funds. Amount: 300 BTC Approximate Value: $31 million (at the time of reporting) Source: Wallet linked to AlphaBay darknet market Recipient: Wallets reportedly associated with Ross Ulbricht Reported By: Cointelegraph, citing Chainalysis The origin of the funds is speculated to be from a major vendor who operated on the AlphaBay platform. This suggests a potential connection between high-level operators within the darknet world, even years after their respective markets have been dismantled by law enforcement. Connecting the Dots: From AlphaBay Darknet to Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht The alleged transfer links two of the most notorious figures/entities in the history of darknet markets. Silk Road, founded by Ross Ulbricht (under the pseudonym ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’), pioneered the use of Bitcoin for anonymous transactions on a large scale, paving the way for subsequent markets like AlphaBay. AlphaBay rose to prominence following Silk Road’s demise, inheriting a user base and operational model. The connection between an AlphaBay-linked wallet and Ross Ulbricht is significant for several reasons: Historical Link: It underscores the intertwined history and potential relationships between operators and vendors across different generations of darknet markets. Financial Flow: It indicates that substantial amounts of cryptocurrency potentially earned from illicit activities on these platforms may still be moving years later. Ulbricht’s Status: It raises questions about why funds would be sent to someone serving a life sentence and what purpose such a large sum could serve under those circumstances. While the exact motivations behind the alleged donation remain unclear, possibilities range from support for Ulbricht’s legal appeals or personal needs to other, potentially more complex or illicit arrangements. The very act of sending such a large amount from a darknet-associated source to a figure like Ulbricht naturally attracts scrutiny from law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. The Role of Crypto Mixing : Obscuring the Trail A key detail in the report is that the funds were allegedly moved through multiple centralized mixing services, including one known as Jambler. Crypto mixing , also known as coin mixing or tumbling, is a process used to obscure the origin or destination of cryptocurrency funds. Here’s a simplified look at how mixing services work: Imagine you have 1 Bitcoin you want to make harder to trace. You send it to a mixing service. The service pools your Bitcoin with Bitcoin from many other users. After a period, the service sends you back 1 Bitcoin (minus a fee), but it’s a different Bitcoin that came from the pooled funds, not the exact one you sent in. By mixing your funds with those of many others, the direct link between your initial deposit address and your final withdrawal address is broken, making it more difficult for blockchain analysis to follow the trail. Centralized mixers, like Jambler mentioned in the report, are services operated by a single entity. Users send their funds to the mixer’s wallet, and the mixer sends back ‘clean’ coins from its reserves to designated withdrawal addresses. While some users might use mixers for legitimate privacy reasons, they are frequently employed by those seeking to launder money or hide the proceeds of crime, precisely because they break the link to the original source. The alleged use of multiple mixing services in this transfer strongly suggests an intent to obfuscate the transaction trail and hide the connection between the AlphaBay-linked source and the Ulbricht-associated destination. This act itself raises a red flag for potential criminal activity, as legitimate transactions typically do not require such extensive efforts to hide their path. Why Does This Matter? Implications for Crime and Regulation This incident is not just an isolated event; it carries broader implications for the cryptocurrency space and the ongoing battle against financial crime: Perception of Crypto: Events like this reinforce the narrative that cryptocurrency is a tool for criminals, potentially increasing negative public perception and fueling calls for stricter regulation. Regulatory Pressure: Regulators worldwide are already grappling with how to monitor and control cryptocurrency flows. A high-profile case involving a large sum from a darknet market going to a notorious figure via mixing services is likely to intensify calls for greater surveillance and regulation of mixers and potentially self-hosted wallets. Challenge to Law Enforcement: While blockchain is inherently transparent, techniques like mixing present significant challenges to law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms attempting to trace illicit funds. Enduring Darknet Wealth: It highlights that significant wealth generated from darknet activities may still be held and potentially moved within the crypto ecosystem years after markets are shut down. The alleged transfer serves as a stark reminder that the criminal element that was among the early adopters of Bitcoin continues to pose challenges to the ecosystem’s integrity and reputation. Tracking Illicit Funds: Challenges and Progress Tracking funds on the blockchain, especially those that have passed through mixers, is a complex task. While every transaction is recorded on the public ledger, identifying the real-world entities behind addresses is the challenge. Mixers deliberately add noise to the transaction graph. However, blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and others have made significant progress in developing tools and techniques to de-mix transactions and follow funds through complex paths. They use sophisticated algorithms, clustering techniques, and data from known entities (like exchanges or seized wallets) to identify patterns and potentially link addresses back to individuals or services. Challenges still exist: Sophistication of Mixers: Mixers are constantly evolving to become more effective at obfuscation. Decentralized Mixing: While centralized mixers can sometimes be compromised or their operators arrested, decentralized mixing methods (like CoinJoin implemented in some wallets) are harder to control. Regulatory Patchwork: Lack of consistent global regulation on mixers and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) makes cross-border tracing difficult. Despite these challenges, the fact that firms like Chainalysis can reportedly trace funds even after passing through mixers demonstrates that obfuscation is not foolproof and that the tools for combating crypto-enabled crime are improving. What Can We Learn? Actionable Insights This alleged Bitcoin donation offers several key takeaways for individuals, businesses, and regulators in the crypto space: For Individuals: Understand the risks associated with darknet markets and illicit activities. Be aware that funds originating from such sources can be tracked, albeit with difficulty. For Businesses (Exchanges, Wallets, etc.): Implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Utilize blockchain analytics tools to monitor transactions for suspicious activity, especially flows involving mixers or addresses linked to known illicit entities. Report suspicious transactions to relevant authorities. For Regulators and Law Enforcement: Continue investing in blockchain analysis capabilities. Develop clearer regulations regarding mixers and privacy-enhancing technologies to prevent their misuse for illicit purposes. Foster international cooperation to track cross-border crypto flows associated with crime. The incident underscores the importance of vigilance and proactive measures within the crypto ecosystem to prevent it from being exploited by criminals seeking to move or launder funds generated from activities on platforms like the AlphaBay darknet . Conclusion The alleged transfer of $31 million in Bitcoin from an AlphaBay-linked wallet to addresses associated with Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht is a significant event that shines a spotlight on the persistent challenges of illicit finance within the cryptocurrency world. The reported use of extensive crypto mixing highlights the efforts criminals take to hide their tracks, while the involvement of figures tied to notorious darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road underscores the long-term impact of these platforms. While blockchain technology offers transparency, sophisticated obfuscation techniques require equally sophisticated analytical tools and robust regulatory frameworks to combat misuse. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that the fight against crypto-enabled crime is ongoing and requires continuous effort from all stakeholders to maintain the integrity and reputation of the digital asset space.

Crypto analyst Master Ananda points this out in a post that shows a disturbing trend in the XRP price chart. If this continues, then the future of XRP, at least in the short term, has become even more uncertain, with bears fighting for more control. 4 Green Daily Closes Fall to Nothing After suffering a crash along with the rest of the crypto market, the XRP price had faced a recovery that seemed to have put it right back on track to rally again. This saw the first green daily close on the last day of May and then carried on into the new month of June. The first three days also closed in the green, leading to four consecutive daily green closes, which is usually bullish for the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings However, there was just another part of the trend that was not completed to show that this was a bullish move, and it has to do with volume. As Master Ananda pointed out, a spike in volume was expected as the XRP price put in a higher low. This would mean there is the momentum needed to push the price back up. But this was not the case as the volume plummeted and remained muted. The absence of this expected volume suggests there is weakness surrounding the XRP price, and this played out as the next day saw a red close for the altcoin for the first time in June. If this lack of momentum continues, then the price could continue to plummet. So far, there is now resistance mounting at the 0.382 Fibonacci level, which is $2.2959. This resistance would need to be cleared with a spike in volume if there is to be a recovery in the XRP price. Otherwise, it risks a fall back down to the 0.236 Fibonacci level, meaning the first steps toward falling below $2. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target XRP Price Could Fall As Volumes Suffer Data from Coinglass shows how bad the XRP volume has been recently. So far in June, daily volume has remained well below $5 billion, reminiscent of the bear market figures whenever the price was falling. This also shows reduced participation from investors who are wary of entering the market during such conditions. Interestingly, though, open interest remains rather high, $3.94 billion, showing that crypto traders are actively betting on the XRP price. However, the majority are betting that the XRP price will continue to fall from here, with Coinglass data showing 52.75% of all positions being short compared to only 47.25% betting the price will increase.

In a recent post, Musk pointed out how Trump’s tax cuts could add a whopping $2.4 trillion to the country’s already massive debt. His warning adds weight to the growing fear that America’s financial foundation isn’t as strong as it seems. If America goes broke, nothing else matters https://t.co/oKABYH2YZn — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 6, 2025 Mounting Debt, Growing Doubts The U.S. national debt now sits at $36 trillion, with $1.13 trillion in annual interest payments. Fiscal concerns have already driven investors toward alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold, as government borrowing spirals out of control. Musk’s warning comes as more analysts highlight how raising the debt ceiling repeatedly is simply masking long-standing insolvency. Fiscal hawks argue the U.S. is effectively bankrupt, something Bitcoiners have said for years. Is the Fiat System Broken?

With debt-to-GDP ratios in advanced nations now topping 100%, new borrowing no longer fuels real growth. Instead, it reduces the economy’s ability to recover, like eating too much ice cream until you get sick. Economists argue the system is unsustainable without drastic policy changes. Where Do We Go from Here? Experts like Russell Napier say governments could try inflating away the debt, implementing financial repression, or devaluing currencies, all of which could push more investors into crypto. With Musk now joining the conversation, the urgency of the issue feels more real. His influence could speed up the shift of big players into assets like Bitcoin, XRP, and gold. In short, if fiscal discipline isn’t restored soon, the world may be forced to rethink what “money” means, and crypto could play a starring role in that shift.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trumps-tax-cuts-could-add-2-4t-to-debt-says-elon-musk/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T11:22:00,"Bitcoin Accumulation Rises Despite Price Weakness— Is A Bullish Divergence in the Making?","The post Bitcoin Accumulation Rises Despite Price Weakness— Is A Bullish Divergence in the Making? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price is recovering after a strong bearish attempt to slash the prices below $100K. The selling pressure has been mounting over the token ever since the price failed to enter the pivotal resistance zone between $106K and $107K. As a result, the price developed weakness, causing a 5% drop from the local highs. However, the BTC price has begun to rise, but this appears to be a short-term gain as the local support below $100K still remains active. Now the question arises, why does Bitcoin appear to be fragile even in times when the accumulation is peaking? The BTC price has shown significant volatility since the start of the year, which has pushed it to new highs twice. Meanwhile, the realized profit of Bitcoin surged past $3 billion in the first few days of the year but dropped close to $250 million as the price dropped below $75,000 from the first ATH at $109,588. However, the profits have again begun to climb since the start of May, reaching close to $1.5 billion, which suggests the accumulation could have resumed. As per the data from Glassnode , the accumulation trend score shows most wallet cohorts shifting from strong distribution towards modest buying. It suggests that every coin sold still finds a buyer. Meanwhile, the recent sell-side was dominated by 1-year+ holders sitting on sizable profits and willing to exit, even at a discount. However, the buy-side has lost urgency, and hence, demand remains, but there’s less willingness to chase prices higher. As a result, the token experienced absorption without a breakout, due to which a rotation phase is still under pressure. What’s Next for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally? Despite the accumulation trend, Bitcoin’s price structure continues to exhibit bearish characteristics. The crypto has formed lower highs and lows on the daily and weekly charts, signaling that short-term momentum remains weak. Therefore, the Bitcoin price is believed to test the local support that lies below $100K in the coming days. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price is stuck within a descending parallel channel after breaking down from a rising parallel channel. Besides, the RSI is constantly forming lower lows and highs, hinting towards the dominance of the bears.

Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, half-jokingly suggested that Musk might be just two weeks away from buying $100 billion worth of Bitcoin. With Musk’s influence and Tesla already holding some Bitcoin, this playful prediction has everyone wondering: Could Musk be about to set a new standard for corporate crypto investment? At this rate, we are like two weeks away from @elonmusk buying $100B of Bitcoin and tanking the dollar — Robert Leshner (@rleshner) June 5, 2025 Musk’s Criticism of U.S. Deficit Spurs Bitcoin Speculation Leshner’s comment that Musk could “tank” the U.S. dollar with a Bitcoin buy comes after Musk slammed a recent House tax bill. The bill is expected to add trillions to the federal deficit over the next decade, and Musk didn’t hold back in calling out what he sees as fiscal irresponsibility. Leshner’s joke imagines Musk making a big move—putting billions into Bitcoin to hedge against a weakening dollar and the growing deficit. What Would a $100 Billion Bitcoin Buy Mean? Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, with about 19.87 million already circulating. A $100 billion purchase would seriously tighten supply on exchanges, likely pushing prices up as sellers ask for more. Beyond price, Musk making such a move would boost confidence across the board, encouraging more investors and companies to jump on board. Tesla could lead the charge in pushing Bitcoin further into the mainstream. Crypto Experts Weigh In on Musk’s Next Step Big names in crypto have shared their thoughts. Blockstream CEO Adam Back said Bitcoin is “a perfect fit” for Musk but doubts Musk will raise Tesla’s relatively small Bitcoin stake much. Back calls it “the smart money move,” but Musk’s cautious approach keeps everyone guessing. Samson Mow jumped in on X, urging Musk to go “all in” on Bitcoin as Tesla shares dip. He also suggested SpaceX offer discounts for paying launchpads in Bitcoin – highlighting how crypto could play a bigger role in Musk’s businesses. . @elonmusk it’s time to go all in on #Bitcoin . @Tesla can take BTC for payments again and implement a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. @SpaceX can give a discount on launches paid in Bitcoin. Force a hard money standard on the money printers. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) June 5, 2025 What’s Next? The Crypto World Waits While Musk hasn’t confirmed any plans to make a huge Bitcoin purchase, Leshner’s bold joke has sparked plenty of speculation. If Musk does drop $100 billion into Bitcoin, it could shake confidence in the dollar even more, especially given the rising U.S. deficit concerns. Now, all eyes are on Musk to see if he’ll make another game-changing move in the crypto space.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/could-elon-musk-tank-the-dollar-with-100b-bitcoin-buy/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

""In the short term, weak data may support BTC to continue the rebound. The market is concerned about Friday's non-farm payrolls report, if it again shows that the labor market cooling, will strengthen the year rate cut expectations,"" analysts at Bitunix said in an email. Other analysts expressed concerns about the public spat between President Donald Trump and his one-time ally and billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk over tax reforms and their impact on fiscal deficit. ""A public clash between Elon Musk and Donald Trump shook investor confidence, highlighting fractures within political and business leadership,"" said Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN. ""Traditional markets held relatively steady (−0.5%), but crypto saw a sharp reaction, with $830M in liquidations as leveraged traders got wiped out."" Fournier suggested maintaining a cautious, low-exposure stance, expecting sideways or further downside action over the weekend. ""Any near-term rebound will need a fundamental catalyst to be sustained,"" he noted. More buoyantly, USDC issuer Circle's shares surged 168% on their first day of NYSE trading to close at $83.23 from the IPO price of $31, lifting the market cap to $18.5 billion. The stock saw a trading volume of over 47.8 million shares, according to the exchange. The debut, however, revived memories of Coinbase's listing in April 2021, which marked an interim bitcoin market top. The number of large open interest holders of CME bitcoin futures reached an all-time high of 217 as of the end of May, signaling increased institutional participation. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the company is in the “study phase” of potentially using stablecoins as a payment method. In traditional markets, the U.S. Treasury called on the Bank of Japan t o hike rates to stall the weakness in the yen, a currency that's seen as a haven from risk. Stay alert!

Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has been trading above $103,000 lately , but a new signal is causing concern among traders. According to crypto analyst DonAlt, Bitcoin might be headed for a quick drop if it can’t hold an important support level that has been supporting its price since the start of May. Intresrtingly, bearish shift in the MVRV ratio even signaliing a temporary pullbacks in bitcoin price. Bitcoin At Make-Or-Break Moment In a recent analysis, DonAlt shared concerns about Bitcoin’s current daily chart, calling it shaky. He warned that if Bitcoin drops below the key support range of $98,000 to $101,000, it could trigger a sharp 15% decline. That would pull the price down to around $90,000 — a level not seen since early May. “It’s a risky area,” he said. “If this support gives way, things could turn around quickly.” What worries him the most is Bitcoin returned to retest this support area after briefly hitting an all-time high near $112K. He described this move as a “false breakout,” explaining that in a strong market, prices usually continue rising instead of falling back to old levels. Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Slips Adding bearish to sentiment another crypto anlayst ali martinez suggest that the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio has just dropped below its 200-day moving average, which historically suggests growing downside pressure. This isn’t the first time the MVRV has predicted major shifts. In past cycles, similar breaks below the 200-day moving average have led to temporary pullbacks or sideways movement for Bitcoin. While the current price still holds above $100,000, the shift in this key metric has made traders cautious. Long Term Outlook Still Positive Despite the short term volatility, DonAlt shared that Bitcoin still looks solid on the bigger weekly and monthly charts. “The weekly chart is good, and the monthly is even better,” he said. “We’re not in a bad spot long-term, but right now, the daily looks weak.” As of now Bitcoin is trading around $103,728, showing a 1% drop in the last 24 hours. At the same time, Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market continues to rise, now reaching 64.61% .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-traders-warn-of-bitcoin-price-crash-to-90k-heres-why/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T11:06:15,"Bitcoin Price Bounce to Near $104K, Though Encouraging, Falls Short of Bull Revival","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin's BTC broader outlook is constructive, but its short-term prospects remain bleak, according to technical analysis. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has bounced back to nearly $104,000 from its overnight low of $104.30, alongside positive action in U.S. equity futures. However, a closer look at the hourly price chart reveals that the bounce is likely a classic breakdown and retest play – the cryptocurrency dove out of a head-and-shoulders pattern on Thursday, signalling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change, and prices are now revisiting the breakdown point, called the neckline. This happens because early sellers – those who shorted at the time of the breakdown – are quick to take profits, consistent with the prospect theory of behavioral analysis. It leads to a bounce that usually runs into fresh selling at the neckline from those who missed the initial breakdown. These fresh shorts lead to the next leg lower. In other words, BTC is not out of the woods yet, and prices could turn lower from around $104,000, extending the pullback. The immediate support is at $100,000, followed by $95,500. The latter is arrived at by subtracting the height of the H&S pattern from the breakdown point. On the higher side, a move above $107,000 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup and shift focus to record highs.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/06/btc-price-bounce-to-near-usd104k-though-encouraging-is-still-short-of-bull-revival,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Technical Analysis|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

Suitable areas for profit-taking include:</p><ul><li><p>Initial partial profit: Around $2,492 (approximately 2.3% gain), just below the psychologically significant $2,500 round-number level.</p></li><li><p>Second partial profit: Around $2,611 (approximately 7% gain), strategically positioned above key candle highs where many short positions may have stops.</p></li></ul><p>Adjusting the stop-loss upwards after taking partial profits further solidifies the trade’s risk management strategy.</p><p>Defensive Strategy and Additional Buys, in Case ETH Does Another 'Fakie'</p><p>If Ethereum's price experiences fake-outs or tests additional lower key levels, the strategy allows for averaging into another position at a lower entry to improve the overall cost basis. The original stop-loss placement remains firm, ensuring clear maximum risk control.</p><p>Join Crypto Calls When The Happen, Buy at Better Prices</p><p>To receive timely updates and exclusive alerts, join our free Telegram channel:</p><ul><li><p>Crypto alerts: <a href=""https://t.me/investingLiveCrypto"">Investing Live Crypto</a></p></li><li><p>Stock alerts: <a href=""https://t.me/investingLiveStocks"">Investing Live Stocks</a></p></li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more insights, risk management updates, and strategic entry opportunities, ensuring you capitalize on optimal buy-the-dip scenarios.</p><p>ForexLive.com is evolving to become <a href=""https://www.investinglive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">investingLive.com</a> later this summer.
