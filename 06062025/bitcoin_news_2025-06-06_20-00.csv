2025-06-06T17:36:52,"Dow Jones, major indices surge on jobs data while Tesla recovers","Stocks are in recovery mode after the latest jobs report beat expectations, while Tesla regained some of its losses. U.S. stock indices rebounded on Friday, June 6, following stronger-than-expected jobs data. The Dow Jones rose 300 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.75%. At the same time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.97%, with major indices buoyed by encouraging figures on U.S. employment. According to Friday’s report, U.S. employers added 139,000 new jobs , lower than the revised April figure of 147,000 but still ahead of expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at a relatively low 4.2%. Overall, the report signaled that the U.S. job market remains resilient despite ongoing concerns over the trade war. Nonfarm payrolls data is a key metric for the Federal Reserve, which maintains a dual mandate of supporting employment and keeping inflation low. The stronger-than-expected figures are likely to keep the Fed cautious about cutting interest rates, as inflation remains a concern. Following the positive news on the job market, U.S. President Donald Trump once again launched an attack on the Fed. Trump urged Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. “Go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” Trump stated on social media.

2025-06-06T17:36:40,"The Crypto Wave Is Rising in Brazil, But LATAM’s Media Reach Is Fading — Outset PR’s Q1 Report Breaks It Down","Latin America’s crypto boom is the real deal, and in Brazil, it’s especially strong, but according to a new Q1 2025 report from Outset PR, the region’s crypto media landscape is collapsing just as adoption surges. From mid-2023 through mid-2024 this crypto-forward zone saw nearly $415 billion in crypto inflows, representing a 42.5% year-over-year increase . At this rate, LATAM ranks as the world’s second-fastest-growing market. Within Latin America, four countries rank among the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption, Brazil notably placing ninth. The country pairs strong user engagement with a regulatory environment that remains broadly constructive. While it’s often overshadowed by El Salvador – the world’s first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender – Brazil distinguishes itself through a more measured, infrastructure-driven approach. Its focus on fintech collaboration, institutional readiness, and regulatory progress positions it as a long-term leader in crypto integration. Lawmakers recently introduced a bill ( PL 957/2025 ) to allow up to 50% of wages to be paid in Bitcoin with the rest in the country’s native reais. This would make Brazil one of the first countries to officially accommodate crypto payrolls. The central bank has signaled a more open stance toward stablecoin usage by reconsidering a prior ban that limits transfers of stablecoins to self-custody wallets. Mercado Bitcoin, Brazil’s largest crypto exchange, has inked major partnerships: it is Ripple’s first Brazilian client for a blockchain-based payment solution, and it just announced a deal to tokenize $40 million of Brazilian assets on the Plume Network. Even traditional banks are catching up. Brazil’s BTG Pactual has launched blockchain investing tools, and a pilot digital-real/CBDC program has pushed banks like Itaú into crypto services. But with all this momentum, why is Brazil, along with much of Latin America, still lacking consistent, in-depth media coverage of these shifts? As recently highlighted by Outset PR , the region’s crypto media landscape is thinning at the very moment it’s needed most. Outset PR report: Media isn’t keeping pace The media ecosystem communicating these developments is shrinking, despite a thriving crypto economy. Outset PR’s Q1 2025 media-audit report reveals a sharp disconnect: despite clear signs of strong user interest, Latin America’s crypto news outlets aren't performing well. In the first quarter, only a handful of crypto sites managed growth while 73% of active crypto media lost traffic. January’s Bitcoin rally brought a short-term boost in crypto coverage on mainstream finance outlets, but niche crypto news sites and blogs suffered as market momentum shifted. By February, only 12 crypto outlets saw traffic growth, while the majority lost visibility due to market downturns and early algorithmic shifts. Google’s March core update then shuffled rankings further. Only about half of the 55 monitored outlets recaptured traffic by March. Outset PR tracked a steep and uneven recovery, with many outlets failing to regain January traffic levels. Six sites dominate a shrinking ecosystem In practical terms, Outset PR highlights that Latin American crypto media are highly concentrated and exclusive. There are just six top publishers that accounted for around 69% of all visits to crypto-focused outlets in Q1. Despite such a large market share concentrated across a small handful of players, none of these niche sites averaged more than 1 million monthly visits. The rest of the field is fragmented: many crypto outlets in the region struggle to reach even 10,000 visits per month, with the lowest tier capturing just 8% of total traffic. Several previously recognized sites, such as bitcoinmexico.net and latamblockchain.com, are now defunct, dormant, or largely irrelevant, according to the report. Mainstream media overshadows crypto-native press Adoption is surging, but discoverability isn’t. In Brazil, most web users learn about crypto from large general-media brands (Ámbito Financiero, InfoMoney, iProfesional, El Diario, Valor Econômico, etc.) rather than pure-crypto outlets. These legacy outlets cover crypto on occasion and often gear content to market hype. Their editorial focus can spike PR impressions during bull runs, but they offer no guarantee of engaged crypto readers or evergreen visibility. Outset PR’s data suggest that relying on broad “LATAM” press packages without context can backfire. Budgets get spent on clicks that vanish once Google’s algorithm changes or interest drops. Strategy must evolve with the market For crypto brands in Brazil and Latin America, the takeaway is clear: do not equate adoption with media reach. Campaigns must target the right mix of outlets – the few niche sites that actually have crypto-savvy audiences, plus mainstream portals at critical moments, such as around big regulatory or price news. And they must continuously update their playbook: Outset PR stresses using real traffic and search analytics—not just clippings or old rankings. In short, while Brazil’s crypto narrative is vibrant on the ground, PR teams need data-driven media strategies to ensure the message doesn’t get lost in a crowded and volatile landscape. The region’s next challenge for the industry isn’t building a viable crypto ecosystem, it’s being seen.",bitzo,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/the-crypto-wave-is-rising-in-brazil-but-latams-media-reach-is-fading-outset-prs-q1-report-breaks-it-down,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","More News|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T17:35:26,"Immutable price drops even as Guild of Guardians NFT sales jump","Immutable token retreated this week as market participants reacted to the broader crypto market crash. It also dropped despite welcoming a popular game to its platform and a surge in Guild of Guardians NFT sales. Immutable ( IMX ) fell to $0.495 on Friday, down 36% from its May peak and 86% from its high last year. The sharp decline has dragged its market capitalization from $4.6 billion in September to $958 million. The decline came even after developers announced that Legends of Elumia had migrated to the Immutable network from Ronin. This is notable, as Legends is a fast-growing title acquired by Triumph Games in April and boasts thousands of monthly active players. Legends of Elumia is now available on PC and Mobile.

Data indicates that Guild of Guardians Heroes generated $8.89 million in sales, a 61% increase from the same period last week. Guild of Guardians Avatars sales rose by 64% to $4.2 million. In total, Immutable processed $13.7 million in NFT sales this week, up 69% from the previous period.

It will release 24.52 million tokens, valued at over $12.7 million. Fortunately for investors, IMX unlocks will conclude in October, transitioning the token into a deflationary asset. Immutable price technical analysis IMX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the IMX price peaked at $0.8100 in May as most cryptocurrencies rallied. It then pulled back to $0.50, its lowest point since May 8. IMX has since dropped below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while both lines of the MACD have crossed below the zero line. The Relative Strength Index has also tilted downward and is approaching oversold territory. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target key support at $0.3458, its year-to-date low. A drop to this level would complete a double-bottom pattern, which could signal a rebound back to the neckline at $0.8100. However, a decisive move below that support would invalidate the bullish setup.

2025-06-06T17:33:00,"UK’s FCA Proposes Lifting Ban on Crypto ETNs for Retail Investors","The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed unwinding its ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, reflecting a more relaxed attitude towards digital assets. The FCA made it clear in a June 6 press release that retail investors would be able to access crypto ETNs if they are traded on an investment exchange that is approved by the FCA. This is a major policy shift since ETNs have not been accessible to retail consumers since 2021 due to risk perceptions. FCA’s payment and digital assets executive director David Geale said the move reflects a balanced approach: “Lifting the prohibition would allow people to make up their own minds whether such a high-risk investment is best for them, with a chance to lose all their possessions.” In Alignment with the UK’s Broader Crypto Goals Regulatory experts see the step as being in line with the UK’s strategic objectives in the crypto sector. Clifford Chance partner Diego Ballon Ossio called it a sign that the UK is set to “position itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction in the crypto space.” He pointed out that lifting the retail ban on ETNs could offer fresh avenues for investor access and indicate that the UK is becoming more crypto-friendly. Regulatory Momentum Dominates This comes following the FCA’s rapid acceleration of its crypto-regulatory push. In May, the regulator issued a call for public comments on fresh stablecoin and crypto custody service rules. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves pledged further recently to offer a “comprehensive regulatory regime” to allow the country to be at the forefront of digital asset innovation. According to reports, the UK is witnessing a sharp growth in crypto holdings, even surpassing adoption rates in the US. Crypto Donations Galvanize Political Row There was another row on June 5, in which UK parliamentarians expressed dismay at the growing application of crypto to political donations. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden stressed that fresh guidelines were required that offer transparency in election expenditure. MP Sarah Olney criticized parties accepting crypto, warning of potential loopholes in donation transparency. Her comments followed Nigel Farage’s June 4 announcement that Reform UK would accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from eligible donors. “We are the first political party in Britain to accept donations in Bitcoin,” said Farage. “We’re catching up with America.” Conclusion The FCA’s proposal to reintroduce crypto ETNs to retail investors can reshape the UK’s digital asset landscape, demonstrating enhanced interest and regulatory recognition of crypto’s mass appeal.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/uks-fca-proposes-lifting-ban-on-crypto-etns-for-retail-investors/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare

Crypto is no longer on the fringes of the financial world. On Friday, June 6, Binance Research released its weekly report , emphasizing that crypto is becoming increasingly integrated with traditional finance. Still, it noted that crypto was among the hardest-hit market segments last week, largely due to political turmoil. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered negative territory this week, weighed down by the public split between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Their public arguments have significant implications for crypto, as Musk has been a major advocate for the industry.

2025-06-06T17:10:01,"MicroStrategy’s Bold $979.7M Stock Offering Fuels Massive Bitcoin Purchase Plan","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy’s Bold $979.7M Stock Offering Fuels Massive Bitcoin Purchase Plan Are you following the latest moves by the corporate world’s biggest Bitcoin enthusiast? MicroStrategy, the software intelligence company that has become synonymous with institutional Bitcoin investment, is making headlines again. The company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has just finalized the pricing of a significant stock offering aimed squarely at boosting its already massive Bitcoin holdings. This move underscores their unwavering commitment to their unique Corporate Bitcoin strategy. MicroStrategy’s Latest Financial Maneuver: The STRD Stock Offering In a significant development for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market, MicroStrategy announced the pricing of its public offering of STRD preferred stock. According to a press release on their official website, the offering is valued at a substantial $979.7 million. The shares of STRD preferred stock were priced at $85 per share. This financial maneuver is not just about raising capital; it’s strategically aligned with MicroStrategy’s core business direction – accumulating Bitcoin. The press release explicitly states that the net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes, which notably includes the acquisition of additional Bitcoin. This continuous pursuit of Bitcoin distinguishes MicroStrategy from most other publicly traded companies. Key Details of the STRD Stock Offering: Total Offering Value: $979.7 million Price Per Share: $85 Stock Type: STRD Preferred Stock Dividend: 10% annually, non-cumulative Primary Use of Proceeds: General corporate purposes, including further Bitcoin Investment The non-cumulative nature of the dividend means that if the company doesn’t pay a dividend in a given year, that dividend obligation doesn’t carry over to future years. The 10% annual rate offers a fixed return to investors in this preferred stock, providing a different risk/reward profile compared to the company’s common stock or direct Bitcoin exposure. Why MicroStrategy Bets Big on Bitcoin? MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has pioneered the strategy of holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Their rationale is rooted in the belief that Bitcoin serves as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies, which they see as susceptible to inflation and devaluation. They view Bitcoin as a long-term investment that can protect and grow shareholder value in a macroeconomic environment they perceive as uncertain. Their approach is not without its critics, given the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. However, MicroStrategy has consistently doubled down on this strategy, using various methods – including debt offerings, stock sales, and convertible notes – to fund their MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisitions. Benefits of MicroStrategy’s Strategy (from their perspective): Inflation Hedge: Positioning Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin is a digital form of gold, a reliable long-term store of value. Shareholder Value: Aiming to enhance shareholder returns through potential Bitcoin price appreciation. Market Differentiation: Setting the company apart in the tech sector with a unique treasury strategy. What Does This STRD Stock Offering Mean for Bitcoin and Investors? This significant capital raise by MicroStrategy, explicitly earmarked for potential Bitcoin purchases, is generally viewed positively by the Bitcoin community. It represents continued institutional demand for the cryptocurrency, absorbing supply from the market. Given MicroStrategy’s track record as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, any substantial purchase could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, particularly in the short term. For investors, the offering of STRD Stock provides another way to gain exposure to MicroStrategy and indirectly to Bitcoin, albeit through a preferred stock structure with fixed dividends rather than direct equity appreciation tied solely to the company’s operational performance or Bitcoin price swings. This move also highlights the evolving landscape of corporate finance, where companies are exploring unconventional assets like Bitcoin for treasury management. While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example, its continued large-scale acquisitions could inspire other corporations to consider similar strategies, further driving Corporate Bitcoin adoption. Challenges and Considerations While the strategy has seen periods of significant success coinciding with Bitcoin bull runs, it also exposes MicroStrategy to the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility. Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price directly impact the company’s balance sheet and can influence its stock price, creating a unique risk profile for MicroStrategy Stock . Furthermore, raising nearly a billion dollars through a stock offering adds to the company’s capital structure. The long-term success of this particular offering, and MicroStrategy’s overall strategy, depends heavily on the future performance of Bitcoin and the company’s ability to manage its growing balance sheet and debt obligations. Actionable Insights for the Reader For those interested in this development, here are a few points to consider: Monitor MicroStrategy’s Filings: Keep an eye on SEC filings (like Form 8-K) for official confirmation of Bitcoin purchases made with the proceeds. Observe Bitcoin Price Action: While not the sole driver, MicroStrategy’s purchases can influence short-term market dynamics. Evaluate Your Own Strategy: MicroStrategy’s approach is aggressive. Consider if direct Bitcoin investment, investing in MSTR common stock, or potentially the STRD preferred stock aligns with your own risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed on Corporate Adoption: MicroStrategy’s actions are a bellwether for broader corporate interest in Bitcoin. Follow news on other companies exploring similar paths. In Conclusion: A Bold Bet Continues MicroStrategy’s decision to price a nearly billion-dollar STRD preferred stock offering to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions is a clear reaffirmation of their commitment to their unique treasury strategy. As the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, their actions send a strong signal to the market about continued institutional interest and belief in the long-term value of the cryptocurrency. This move provides capital for more Bitcoin Investment and offers investors another structured way to participate in the MicroStrategy story. While risks associated with Bitcoin volatility remain, MicroStrategy is forging ahead, betting big on a future where digital assets play a central role in corporate finance.

Its shares were priced at $110 at press time (up from $31 Wednesday), leading many to expect a summer and fall of crypto-themed IPOs. On the other, we saw HyperLiquid trader James Wynn go from having a $100 million BTC position one day to a massive loss the next. (Kids, beware the big, bad leverage monster).

2025-06-06T17:03:20,"Ark Invest Places $373M Bet on Circle Post IPO Launch","Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made headlines on Thursday after buying over 4.48 million shares in Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin. The shares were bought for $373.4 million and distributed across Ark’s Innovation, Next Generation Internet, and Fintech Innovation funds. This occurred shortly after Circle was listed on the New York Stock Exchange . Circle’s First Day on the Stock Market Draws Attention On June 5, Circle began trading under the symbol CRCL on the NYSE. Its share price jumped from $31 to a high of $96, closing at $83.23. The strong start shows investors are confident in the company and its future. Before its recent successful IPO this year, it had tried to go public two times before. The first time was through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021. However, the company faced delays in completing the SEC qualification process, which resulted in the postponement of its public listing . The company tried again in 2024 with a confidential filing. Concerns about market conditions, especially due to trade tensions under President Trump, raised doubts earlier this year. Nevertheless, the stablecoin issuer finally completed its initial public offering in June. Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, described this development as a sign that the world is ready to move toward a new financial system built on the internet. Ark Invest’s Strong Belief in Circle Ark Invest quickly acted on Circle’s debut by purchasing many shares across three of its most well-known funds. The size of this investment shows that Ark sees real value in Circle’s role in the digital finance world. Circle shares are now among the top holdings in Ark’s funds. However, Ark has a rule that no single company can make up more than 10% of a fund. This approach helps keep the funds balanced and lowers risk. This is important since Circle’s stock is still new and moving. Notably, Ark has done this with companies like Coinbase and eToro when these firms were newly made public. This pattern shows Ark’s plan to support new and innovative companies as they start trading publicly. Ark Adjusts Portfolio to Back Circle Ark made other moves on the same day it bought Circle shares as part of its portfolio management. The investment company sold some of its spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) from the Next Generation Internet fund, worth about $17.1 million. Even with this sale, Ark’s Bitcoin ETF remains its fund’s top holding. The firm also sold shares in Coinbase, Robinhood, and Block, founded by Jack Dorsey. Interestingly, the Robinhood sale came shortly after Ark bought $10 million worth of its shares in early May. These trades show that Ark is carefully adjusting its holdings to make space for new investments while keeping its funds in line with its rules.

2025-06-06T17:00:45,"Growth-focused investors ditch BTC for RUVI, here’s why timing matters now","Bitcoin, once the undeniable leader of the cryptocurrency market, is starting to see its dominance waver.

The Senate on Wednesday voted 48 to 46 in favor of Bowman assuming the new role after Michael Barr stepped down from the position on February 28th. In a post on the social media platform X, Lummis says the development signals a brighter future for crypto. “I’m thrilled that the Senate has confirmed Miki Bowman as Vice Chair of Supervision at the Federal Reserve. Her confirmation represents a turning point for digital assets and brings much-needed balance and accountability to Fed banking supervision. Miki’s commitment to evidence-based regulation over political considerations will strengthen America’s financial system.” During the nomination hearing in April, Bowman said that regulators must promote innovation in the banking system. “To remain viable and competitive, banks must be able to consider new technologies that can improve products and services, and lower costs. Regulators should adopt an approach that encourages and promotes sensible innovation.” The advocacy group Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI) supported the nomination of Bowman in March. Said CCI President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Ji Hun Kim, “Her willingness to explore and discuss the potential benefits and challenges of emerging technologies, including digital assets, reflects a commitment to informed policymaking. We believe that Governor Bowman’s experience, coupled with her strong support for responsible innovation, makes her an exceptional choice for Vice Chair.” Bowman will serve a term of four years.

2025-06-06T16:50:01,"UK Crypto ETNs: Unlocking Opportunity for Retail Investors","BitcoinWorld UK Crypto ETNs: Unlocking Opportunity for Retail Investors Are you a UK-based investor interested in cryptocurrencies but unsure about the regulatory landscape? A significant development has just unfolded that could change how you access digital assets. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced a pivotal decision, granting retail investors access to certain crypto investment products. This move, specifically concerning UK crypto ETNs , marks a shift in the country’s approach to digital asset investment for the general public. What Exactly Are UK Crypto ETNs and Why the Change? Understanding what crypto ETNs are is crucial to grasping the impact of the FCA’s decision. ETNs, or Exchange-Traded Notes, are a type of unsecured debt security that tracks an underlying index or benchmark. In the case of crypto ETNs, they track the performance of a specific cryptocurrency or a basket of cryptocurrencies. Unlike directly buying crypto, investors purchase shares in the ETN through traditional brokerage accounts. For years, the FCA maintained a ban on the sale of crypto derivatives and ETNs to retail consumers, citing concerns about volatility, complexity, and potential harm. However, the regulatory body has now softened its stance specifically on ETNs, albeit under strict conditions. The key points of the FCA’s updated position on UK crypto ETNs include: Permitted Access: Retail investors will now be allowed to buy and sell crypto ETNs. Approved Exchanges Only: This access is strictly limited to products listed on exchanges regulated by the FCA. This ensures a level of oversight and market integrity. Institutional Ban Remains: Interestingly, the existing ban on the sale of crypto derivatives to retail consumers remains in place. This distinction highlights the FCA’s view on the different risk profiles of these products. Risk Disclosures: The FCA emphasizes that strong risk warnings and consumer protection measures will still be mandatory for firms offering these products. This change is seen by many as a strategic move by the UK to foster growth within its nascent UK digital asset market , positioning the country as a more attractive hub for crypto-related financial activities. What Does This Mean for Retail Crypto UK Investors? For individual investors in the UK, this announcement opens up a new, potentially more accessible avenue to gain exposure to the price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without needing to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Previously, options for retail crypto UK investors were limited, often involving offshore platforms or more complex derivative products that were explicitly banned for retail. Here’s a breakdown of the implications for you as a UK retail investor: Increased Accessibility: You can now potentially invest in crypto via your existing brokerage account, making it as simple as buying shares in a company or a traditional ETF. Potential for Lower Barriers: ETNs can sometimes offer a way to invest in crypto with smaller amounts compared to direct purchases, depending on the product structure. Regulatory Oversight: By limiting access to FCA-approved exchanges, the regulator aims to provide a layer of investor protection that might be absent on unregulated platforms. Still Not Direct Ownership: Remember, when you buy a crypto ETN, you don’t own the underlying cryptocurrency itself. You own a security that tracks its price. Derivatives Ban Persists: The FCA is maintaining the ban on products like Contracts for Difference (CFDs) or futures based on crypto for retail, which are generally considered higher risk due to leverage. This distinction between ETNs and derivatives is key. The FCA appears to view ETNs, when listed on regulated exchanges, as having a different risk profile than leveraged derivative products, which can magnify losses rapidly. Navigating FCA Crypto Regulations : Protections and Pitfalls The FCA’s decision, while opening doors, comes with a strong emphasis on investor protection and risk awareness. This aligns with the broader trend of increasing FCA crypto regulations aimed at safeguarding consumers in this volatile market. Key aspects of the regulatory environment you need to be aware of include: Mandatory Risk Warnings: Expect prominent and clear warnings about the high risks associated with investing in crypto ETNs. Firms are required to make these risks explicit. Suitability Assessments: While not as stringent as for complex derivatives, some platforms might require you to confirm you understand the risks before investing. Approved Exchanges: Only ETNs listed on exchanges recognized by the FCA can be marketed and sold to UK retail investors. This includes exchanges like the London Stock Exchange (LSE). No Compensation Scheme Protection: It is highly likely that investments in crypto ETNs will not be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). If the issuer of the ETN goes bankrupt, you could lose your entire investment. This is a critical risk difference compared to some traditional investments. Market Volatility: Regardless of the investment vehicle, the underlying asset (cryptocurrency) remains highly volatile. Prices can go down as well as up, and you could lose all your capital. The FCA’s approach reflects a cautious step towards integration, acknowledging the growing interest in crypto while attempting to mitigate potential harm. Understanding these FCA crypto regulations is paramount before committing any capital. Boosting the UK Digital Asset Market : A Strategic Move? The decision to allow retail access to crypto ETNs is widely interpreted as a strategic move by the UK government and regulators to enhance the country’s position in the global digital asset space. By providing regulated pathways for investment, the UK aims to attract both investors and crypto businesses. How this decision could impact the UK digital asset market : Increased Liquidity: Allowing retail participation can potentially increase trading volumes and liquidity for crypto ETNs listed on UK exchanges. Attracting Issuers: This could incentivize more financial institutions to list crypto ETNs on UK exchanges, offering a wider variety of products. Fostering Innovation: A clearer regulatory stance, even if cautious, can provide more certainty for businesses operating in the crypto sector, potentially encouraging innovation and growth within the UK. Competing Globally: Other jurisdictions, like Germany and Switzerland, already have established markets for crypto ETNs accessible to retail investors. The UK’s move helps it compete on a more level playing field. Investor Confidence: Regulated access through familiar platforms might build greater confidence among mainstream investors who were previously hesitant to use unregulated crypto exchanges. This development signals a potential shift from a purely restrictive approach to one that seeks to balance innovation with necessary consumer protections, aiming to make the UK digital asset market a significant player internationally. Getting Started: Investing in Crypto UK via ETNs If you are considering investing in crypto UK through ETNs following this announcement, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Actionable Insights for Potential Investors: Check Your Brokerage: See if your existing stockbroker or investment platform plans to offer access to FCA-approved crypto ETNs. Many major platforms are expected to list these products. Research Available Products: Once available, research the specific ETNs. Which cryptocurrency do they track (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, a basket)? What are the fees (management fees can impact returns)? Who is the issuer? Understand the Risks: Reiterate your understanding of the risks. Crypto volatility is high. ETNs are debt instruments – understand the issuer risk. There is likely no FSCS protection. Start Small: If you’re new to crypto or ETNs, consider starting with a small amount you can afford to lose. Diversify (Carefully): Don’t put all your investment capital into crypto, even via ETNs. Consider crypto as part of a broader, diversified portfolio, and only allocate a small percentage that aligns with your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, regulatory changes, and the performance of the specific ETN you are interested in. Example (Illustrative Only): Imagine a hypothetical ‘UK Bitcoin ETN’ listed on the London Stock Exchange. You could log into your standard brokerage account, search for the ETN’s ticker symbol, and place an order just like buying shares in a company. The price of the ETN would aim to track the price of Bitcoin (minus fees and tracking differences). If Bitcoin’s price goes up, the ETN’s price should also go up, and vice versa. Comparison: ETNs vs. Direct Crypto vs. Derivatives (Retail UK) It’s helpful to see how ETNs compare to other ways of gaining crypto exposure for retail crypto UK investors: Method Accessibility (Retail UK) Direct Ownership of Crypto? Regulatory Status (FCA) FSCS Protection (Likely) Key Risk Considerations Direct Crypto Purchase (via FCA-registered exchange) Yes Yes Exchange registered for AML/CTF, but crypto asset activities largely unregulated No Volatility, platform security, losing keys, regulatory uncertainty Crypto ETNs (on FCA-approved exchange) Newly Permitted No (Debt Security) Product listed on FCA-regulated exchange, but underlying crypto unregulated No Volatility, issuer risk, tracking error, no FSCS protection Crypto Derivatives (e.g., CFDs, Futures) Banned for Retail No (Contract) Banned for retail consumers due to high risk No Volatility, leverage risk (magnified losses), counterparty risk This table highlights that while ETNs offer a regulated access point through familiar channels, they still carry significant risks inherent to the underlying crypto asset and the product structure itself. Investing in crypto UK , regardless of the method, requires careful consideration. Challenges and Considerations While the FCA’s decision is a positive step for many, it’s not without potential challenges: Limited Product Variety (Initially): It may take time for a wide range of crypto ETNs to be listed on UK exchanges. Fees: ETNs typically have management fees that can eat into returns over time, potentially making them more expensive than direct crypto ownership (though direct ownership has its own transaction costs). Tracking Error: The ETN’s price may not perfectly track the underlying crypto asset’s price due to fees, trading costs within the fund, or market inefficiencies. Issuer Risk: As ETNs are debt securities, there is a risk that the issuer could default, potentially leading to a total loss of investment, separate from the performance of the underlying crypto. Regulatory Uncertainty Remains: While this specific area is clarified, the broader UK crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving. These factors mean that while access is improving for retail crypto UK investors, due diligence is still essential. Conclusion: A Cautious Welcome to Regulated Crypto Access The FCA’s decision to allow retail investors access to UK crypto ETNs on approved exchanges marks a significant moment for the UK digital asset market . It provides a new, regulated pathway for investing in crypto UK , potentially increasing accessibility for retail crypto UK investors through familiar investment platforms. However, this is not a green light to invest without caution. The FCA has been clear that the inherent risks of crypto volatility remain, and strong consumer protection measures, including explicit risk warnings, will be enforced. The ban on retail access to crypto derivatives persists, highlighting the regulator’s differentiated view on risk. For UK investors, this development offers an opportunity to gain exposure to the crypto market through a more traditional and regulated structure. Yet, it is imperative to understand exactly what you are investing in – a debt security tracking crypto, not the crypto itself – and to be fully aware of the risks, including volatility, issuer risk, and the likely absence of FSCS protection. Approach this new access with education, caution, and a clear understanding of your own financial situation and risk tolerance.

2025-06-06T16:42:08,"Transportation Network Giant Uber Prepares to Use Stablecoins in Payments! Here Are the Details","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced in San Francisco that the company is exploring the potential of using stablecoins for payments. Uber Considers Using Stablecoins in Payments Stating that stablecoins go beyond cryptocurrencies being just a store of value, Khosrowshahi said, “Stablecoins are one of the most interesting applications of crypto that offer practical benefits.” Emphasizing that Uber is interested in stablecoin technology in order to optimize global payment systems, Khosrowshahi said that these assets have the potential to reduce costs, especially in international money transfers. The CEO also made it clear that his interest in stablecoins is higher than Bitcoin: “Stablecoins are proven instruments. There are different views on the future of Bitcoin.” Khosrowshahi said Uber has not yet decided on the transition to this technology, adding that the company is currently in the “research phase.” Since Uber is one of the most used services in the world, it is thought that such an integration could be effective on a global scale. Khosrowshahi's interest in cryptocurrencies is not new. In a statement he made in 2021, he said Uber was open to accepting payments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if sufficient benefits were provided. However, the company also made it clear at the time that it had no plans to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. He stated that Uber would “definitely” accept crypto in 2022, but expressed reservations about the high exchange costs and environmental impacts. Uber’s stablecoin move also coincides with growing regulatory efforts in the U.S. The regulatory efforts, which are being pushed forward with the open support of former President Donald Trump, aim to create a clear framework for stablecoin issuers. The most prominent regulation is the bill known as the Genius Act. In this process, stablecoin initiatives from the traditional finance world are also drawing attention. Major banks such as Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are reportedly discussing a joint stablecoin development plan through their subsidiaries. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-06T16:40:01,"Alex platform Halted: Critical Suspension After Security Incident","BitcoinWorld Alex platform Halted: Critical Suspension After Security Incident The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is often lauded for its innovation and potential to reshape financial systems. However, it’s not without its significant risks. A recent development has cast a spotlight on these vulnerabilities: the Alex platform , a prominent protocol built on the Stacks blockchain, has temporarily suspended its operations following a confirmed security incident. This news sent ripples through the Stacks DeFi ecosystem and served as a stark reminder of the challenges inherent in securing digital assets. What Happened to the Alex Platform? Confirmation of the incident came directly from the Alex team via their official X (formerly Twitter) account. They announced that they had detected a security breach impacting the platform. While initial details were limited, the immediate and necessary response was to halt all platform activities. This means users are currently unable to access services, trade assets, or interact with the protocol’s features. Suspending operations is a critical step taken by platforms during security events. It allows the team to contain the situation, investigate the extent of the damage, and prevent further potential losses. It’s a difficult decision, as it disrupts user access, but prioritizing the integrity of the protocol and the safety of user funds is paramount in such circumstances. Understanding Stacks DeFi and Alex’s Role To fully grasp the significance of this event, it helps to understand where Alex fits into the picture. Stacks is a blockchain designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin. It does this by connecting directly to the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build on top of Bitcoin’s security. Stacks DeFi refers to the ecosystem of decentralized finance applications built on the Stacks layer, leveraging its connection to Bitcoin. The Alex platform (stands for Automated Liquidity Exchange) is a cornerstone of this ecosystem. It aims to provide a comprehensive suite of DeFi services, including lending, borrowing, swapping, and yield farming, specifically tailored for the Stacks blockchain and assets like STX (the native token of Stacks) and wrapped Bitcoin (sBTC, once fully enabled). Its role is crucial for providing liquidity and financial tools within the Stacks environment, making this security incident particularly impactful for the network. The Nature of the Crypto Security Breach While specific technical details of the exploit were not immediately released, a security breach in a DeFi protocol often involves vulnerabilities in smart contracts, private key compromises, or issues with associated infrastructure like bridges or oracles. A crypto security breach can manifest as unauthorized access to funds, manipulation of protocol logic, or disruption of services. DeFi protocols, by their nature, manage significant amounts of user funds held within smart contracts. These contracts are immutable once deployed, making any flaw or vulnerability within them a potential target for malicious actors. The decentralized aspect, while offering benefits like transparency and censorship resistance, also means there’s no central authority to simply ‘turn off’ the system or reverse transactions easily, making security audits and robust code paramount. Tracing Stolen Crypto Funds: A Difficult Challenge One of the key actions the Alex team announced they are taking is working with centralized exchanges (CEXs) to trace any stolen crypto funds . This highlights a common strategy in the aftermath of a DeFi exploit. While blockchain transactions are public, identifying the real-world entities behind addresses is difficult. However, when attackers attempt to cash out or move large amounts of illicitly obtained funds, they often utilize centralized exchanges. CEXs require users to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. By cooperating with exchanges, protocol teams and law enforcement can potentially identify the attackers if they attempt to deposit or trade the stolen assets on these regulated platforms. Nevertheless, tracing and recovering stolen crypto funds is a complex and often challenging process. Attackers employ various techniques, such as mixing services, chain hopping, and utilizing decentralized platforms, to obscure the trail of funds. Success in recovery is never guaranteed. What Does This DeFi Exploit Mean for Users? For users of the Alex platform , the temporary suspension and the underlying DeFi exploit have immediate consequences: Inaccessible Funds: Assets deposited or locked within the Alex protocol are currently inaccessible. Users cannot withdraw, trade, or manage their positions. Uncertainty: There is natural concern about the safety of their funds and the future of the platform. Need for Information: Users are reliant on the Alex team for timely and transparent updates regarding the investigation, the extent of the losses (if any), and the plan for resolution. It is crucial for affected users to stay vigilant, rely only on official communication channels from Alex, and be wary of scams impersonating the platform or offering recovery services. Lessons from the Crypto Security Breach: Actionable Insights While the Alex incident is specific to one platform, it offers valuable lessons for anyone participating in Stacks DeFi or the broader DeFi space: Diversify Risk: Do not put all your funds into a single protocol, no matter how reputable it seems. Spread your investments across different platforms and asset types. Understand the Risks: DeFi involves smart contract risk, impermanent loss, oracle risk, and platform-specific risks. Educate yourself on how the protocols you use function and what could go wrong. Stay Informed: Follow official channels of the protocols you use. Security announcements, audits, and protocol upgrades are important to track. Use Reputable Platforms: While even audited platforms can have vulnerabilities, using well-established protocols with a track record and multiple audits can potentially reduce risk. Consider Hardware Wallets: For storing significant amounts of crypto, a hardware wallet offers better protection against private key compromises compared to software wallets or exchange storage. This crypto security breach serves as a stark reminder that the responsibility for security in decentralized systems often falls more heavily on the user. The Path Forward for Alex and Stacks DeFi The immediate priority for the Alex team is a thorough investigation into the DeFi exploit . This involves identifying the vulnerability, understanding how it was exploited, and assessing the full extent of any stolen crypto funds . Working with security experts and potentially law enforcement is part of this process. Once the investigation is complete and the vulnerability is addressed, the team will need to formulate a plan for resuming operations. This plan will likely involve: Communicating clearly with the community about what happened and the steps taken. Implementing fixes and potentially undergoing further security audits.

2025-06-06T16:30:03,"Dogecoin Ready To Blast Off? Historical Bullish Trend Sparks Hopes Of A Parabolic Surge","During the last hours of Thursday, Dogecoin experienced a notable decline as the broader crypto market retraced, causing its price to revisit the $0.16 mark, a level not seen in several months. Despite the worrying shift in trend, DOGE’s medium-term and long-term outlook remains bullish as crypto analysts advocate for an imminent parabolic surge. A Potential Moonshot For Dogecoin Around The Corner Dogecoin’s waning price action has intensified following the recent decline observed across the broader market. However, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned technical expert and investor, has outlined a key development on the DOGE’s chart that hints at a possible shift in the trend toward the upside trajectory. In his analysis shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Trader Tardigrade highlights that the dog-themed meme coin is showing signs of a major upswing even as prices waver. His analysis is backed by a historical bullish signal that preceded substantial price spikes for DOGE in the last two attempts within a yearly period. Following a period of relative strength, this bullish signal has resurfaced on the weekly time frame chart, increasing the likelihood of a notable impending parabolic surge. It is important to note that the trend often aligns with key signals from the DOGE/BTC chart. As seen on the weekly chart, lower lows are being formed by the DOGE/BTC pair prior to each Dogecoin huge pump within the past year. However, these significant bullish moves tend to be more effective once DOGE’s price begins to trend upward on the weekly chart. Presently, Dogecoin’s weekly price action reveals that the meme coin is at a pivotal juncture, and the DOGE/BTC pair seems to have formed new lower lows. With the signal repeating itself, the expert is confident that a massive pump is imminent, possibly pushing DOGE’s price beyond the $0.70 mark and toward a new all-time high . DOGE To Develop A Bullish Divergence As DOGE hovers near key support levels, key momentum indicators signal positive price movements, suggesting the current bearish movement may be brief. Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached a vital point that is likely to strengthen its upward outlook. According to Trader Tardigrade, DOGE is heading back to the previous swing low, while the RSI indicator displays a higher low after a sharp decline. The expert contends that this signal may result in a bullish divergence, which would suggest that the selling momentum has weakened. A bullish divergence that typically occurs when an oscillator falls to hit a new low and prices drop to a new low signals a potential upward trend reversal after a downtrend. As a result, Trader Tardigrade noted that DOGE is showing an early sign of a bullish reversal, triggering the beginning of another major rally.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-ready-to-blast-off/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|DOGE/BTC|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T16:30:00,"Bank of Russia Key Rate Cut: A Crucial Step for Russian Economy Stability","BitcoinWorld Bank of Russia Key Rate Cut: A Crucial Step for Russian Economy Stability For those monitoring global economic shifts and their potential ripple effects on the cryptocurrency landscape, a significant development from Eastern Europe warrants attention. The Bank of Russia recently made a key decision regarding its benchmark interest rate. Understanding the implications of this move is crucial, not just for the Russian economy, but potentially for broader market sentiment that can touch digital assets. What is the Bank of Russia Key Rate and Why Does it Matter? The Bank of Russia key rate is the main instrument the central bank uses to influence monetary conditions in the country. Think of it as the base rate for lending and borrowing within the Russian financial system. By setting this rate, the Bank of Russia impacts everything from consumer loans and mortgages to corporate borrowing costs and investment decisions. It’s a primary tool for controlling inflation and stimulating or cooling down economic activity. In times of high inflation or economic overheating, central banks typically raise this rate to make borrowing more expensive, thus reducing spending and investment. Conversely, during economic downturns or when inflation is low, they cut the rate to encourage borrowing and stimulate growth. Therefore, changes to the Bank of Russia key rate are closely watched indicators of the central bank’s assessment of the current economic health and future outlook. Analyzing the Russia Interest Rate Cut : The Details On June 6, the Bank of Russia announced a notable adjustment to its monetary policy. The central bank decided to lower its key interest rate by 100 basis points (bps). This brings the rate down from its previous level to 20% . According to the official statement released on the Bank of Russia’s website, the primary justifications for this Russia interest rate cut were twofold: Easing Inflation: The central bank observed signs that inflationary pressures were starting to subside. High inflation erodes purchasing power and creates economic uncertainty, so its potential easing is a positive signal. Economic Stabilization: The Bank of Russia also cited signs of economic stabilization. This suggests that the initial shock from recent geopolitical and economic events may be starting to settle, allowing for a reassessment of the previously tightened monetary stance. This move follows a period where the rate was significantly hiked to counter extreme volatility and inflationary risks. The decision to cut, even while the rate remains relatively high at 20%, signals a shift in the central bank’s immediate priorities and its assessment of the economic environment. What Does This Mean for the Russian Economy ? A lower key rate generally makes it cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow money. For the Russian economy , this could have several potential effects: Lower Borrowing Costs: Reduced interest rates can decrease the cost of loans for businesses, potentially encouraging investment in expansion, equipment, and projects. Stimulus for Consumption: Cheaper consumer credit (like mortgages and car loans) can boost household spending, a key component of economic growth. Support for Government Borrowing: Lower rates can also reduce the cost for the government to borrow money, providing more fiscal flexibility. However, the impact on the Russian economy is complex, heavily influenced by ongoing international sanctions and global economic conditions. While a rate cut provides conventional monetary stimulus, the unique challenges facing Russia mean the effects may not be as straightforward as in a typical economic environment. The central bank is navigating a difficult balance between supporting economic activity and maintaining financial stability amidst external pressures. Is Inflation Russia Finally Easing? One of the main reasons cited for the rate cut was easing inflation. Recent data points, according to the Bank of Russia, indicate that the peak of inflationary pressure might have passed, at least for now. High Inflation Russia experienced earlier in the year was a major concern, driven by supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations, and increased demand for certain goods. While the rate cut suggests the central bank sees a downward trend or stabilization in price increases, inflation remains a critical factor. The 20% key rate itself is still very high by international standards, reflecting the underlying inflationary risks and the need for a tight monetary stance compared to many other economies. The central bank will continue to monitor price dynamics closely, and future rate decisions will likely depend heavily on whether this easing trend in Inflation Russia proves sustainable. How Does Monetary Policy Russia Influence Global Markets (and Crypto)? Decisions on Monetary policy Russia , while focused internally, can have external relevance. In a globally interconnected financial system, significant economic shifts or policy changes in a major economy can influence investor sentiment and capital flows. While the direct link between the Bank of Russia’s rate and the global crypto market is not immediate or simple, there are indirect connections: Risk Appetite: Central bank actions, especially in times of crisis or uncertainty, can impact global risk appetite. If the cut is perceived as a sign of stabilizing conditions (despite challenges), it might contribute marginally to a more risk-on sentiment, which can sometimes benefit assets like cryptocurrencies. Global Liquidity: While not a major driver for global liquidity compared to central banks like the Fed or ECB, the cumulative effect of monetary policy changes in various countries contributes to the overall liquidity picture. Economic Spillover: The health of the Russian economy impacts global trade and commodity markets, which in turn can have broader economic consequences that eventually touch all asset classes, including digital ones. For crypto investors, the Bank of Russia’s move is another data point in a complex global economic puzzle. It highlights the ongoing adjustments by central banks worldwide as they grapple with inflation, economic slowdowns, and unique geopolitical factors. Understanding these macroeconomic undercurrents provides valuable context for navigating the volatile crypto markets. Potential Challenges and Opportunities While the rate cut is intended to support the Russian economy , significant challenges remain, including the impact of sanctions, potential for renewed inflationary pressures, and structural economic issues. For investors watching from outside, this situation presents both challenges in terms of uncertainty and potential opportunities if it leads to shifts in capital or economic activity that indirectly favor alternative assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should a crypto investor process this information? While you shouldn’t make investment decisions solely based on the Bank of Russia key rate , here are some insights: Stay Informed: Monitor global macroeconomic news, including significant monetary policy shifts like this Russia interest rate cut . These events are part of the larger picture influencing market sentiment. Understand Interconnectedness: Recognize that even seemingly distant economic events can have indirect effects on global markets and crypto. Focus on Fundamentals (Crypto): While macro matters, the fundamentals of the crypto projects you invest in are equally, if not more, important. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Global economic uncertainty underscores the need for a diversified portfolio. Summary: Navigating Global Economic Currents The decision by the Bank of Russia to cut its key interest rate to 20% is a significant development signaling the central bank’s assessment of easing Inflation Russia and signs of stabilization in the Russian economy . This move in Monetary policy Russia aims to provide stimulus by lowering borrowing costs following a period of aggressive rate hikes. While the direct impact on the crypto market is indirect, understanding this Bank of Russia key rate change and the underlying economic factors behind this Russia interest rate cut is crucial for crypto investors who wish to remain informed about the global economic currents that can influence the broader financial landscape and, by extension, digital asset markets. It’s a reminder that macroeconomic events worldwide play a role in shaping the environment in which cryptocurrencies operate.

2025-06-06T16:28:15,"Dogecoin price prediction June 2025: can DOGE recover from its 63% drop?","Dogecoin’s dramatic price correction has left investors questioning the future of the meme coin that once reached near $0.49 in late 2024. As of early June 2025, DOGE is trading at $0.17557, marking a steep 63.90% decline from its December highs. The wider altcoin market is also struggling, largely due to Bitcoin’s plunge to test the $101,000–$98,000 support zone. However, analysts suggest that if BTC stabilises at these levels, DOGE could stage a significant rebound. DOGE down 63.90% since December peak Dogecoin, currently the ninth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $26.22 billion, has seen better days. The coin soared to $0.48562 in December 2024, but investor sentiment quickly cooled as macroeconomic headwinds intensified and Bitcoin began retracing. The correction in BTC has had a cascading effect on altcoins, and DOGE is no exception. With the token now hovering around $0.17557, many are eyeing whether this price marks the bottom or if a further breakdown could occur. Notably, key support sits just above the $0.15 range, and multiple technical indicators suggest that DOGE could soon see an uptick if it holds above these levels. Short-term price forecast and analyst projections According to CoinCodex , Dogecoin could climb by 17.86% over the next month, potentially reaching $0.202433 by 6 July 2025. This projection aligns with technical signs that show bullish divergence on higher time frames, although shorter intervals remain bearish. Analysts tracking DOGE on X believe the coin is still on a bullish trajectory in the daily chart, with oversold RSI levels and strong buying activity at recent lows. Annie Leonheart° @annie_xbt · Follow $DOGE 1D-Internal and external both look bullish. H4- Bullish external but bearish internal. M15- external and internal is bearish. 7:45 AM · Jun 6, 2025 13 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter However, some argue that a bearish flag breakdown has already occurred, implying the potential for further declines unless DOGE reclaims higher support zones quickly. Chill Trader @Chill_trader99 · Follow 🚨 $DOGE has broken out from a bear flag pattern, signaling a potential price drop. To invalidate the current downtrend, $DOGE needs to flip the $0.192 level into support. 12:02 PM · Jun 5, 2025 4 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Immediate resistance lies in the $0.17185–$0.16363 and $0.15984–$0.15193 ranges. A strong bounce from these levels could push DOGE towards $0.19 or even $0.26 if Bitcoin stabilises. Macro environment and influencer impact Much of Dogecoin’s price action continues to be influenced by external political and economic developments, particularly tensions between key crypto influencers. A public disagreement between Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump over the tax bill has muddied investor confidence. This split in leadership sentiment has likely weighed on cryptocurrency enthusiasm across the board. Meanwhile, market-wide volatility—especially tied to Bitcoin’s struggle at the $100,500 level—adds another layer of risk. If BTC fails to regain upward momentum soon, DOGE may continue to struggle along with other altcoins. DOGE at critical technical level Despite the bearish pressure, DOGE appears to be sitting at a pivotal support level. Traders are watching for a decisive move past $0.19, which could pave the way for retests of $0.26 and potentially higher if bullish volume returns. Still, the road ahead remains uncertain. If DOGE loses its current support, a breakdown towards $0.14 or below cannot be ruled out. Much will depend on macroeconomic conditions, influencer activity, and the strength of the next BTC trend.

2025-06-06T16:17:13,"Here’s What Could Happen to XRP If BlackRock Drops an XRP ETF Today","In the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets, few developments carry the seismic weight of a potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by a major financial institution. The mere speculation that BlackRock might launch an XRP ETF has sent ripples across crypto communities and traditional finance circles alike. According to a recent post by the crypto influencer Pumpius on X, such an event wouldn’t just be another bullish headline, it could catalyze a systemic shift in global liquidity dynamics. The implications are staggering and demand careful examination. The Institutional Floodgates Could Open Overnight An XRP ETF by BlackRock would act as an instant green light for the world’s most conservative financial actors—pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and traditional banks, to engage with XRP. For years, regulatory uncertainty and reputational risk have kept many institutional investors on the sidelines. If BlackRock drops an $XRP ETF… Forget price predictions. The entire liquidity framework of global finance will shift. Overnight demand from pensions, banks, and sovereigns Instant credibility in tradfi circles A tsunami of capital hunting yield, utility, and speed… pic.twitter.com/wAvxRZ6AFz — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 5, 2025 However, BlackRock’s imprimatur carries exceptional weight. When the firm entered the Bitcoin ETF space, it triggered a flood of institutional inflows that lifted not only Bitcoin but the entire crypto market. An XRP ETF would likely do more than just replicate that phenomenon. XRP, unlike Bitcoin, was designed from inception to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border payments, a functionality that aligns with the strategic objectives of financial institutions and central banks. With the ETF acting as a compliant, accessible gateway, global financial players could shift massive pools of capital into XRP exposure, confident in the asset’s regulatory clarity and utility-driven narrative. TradFi Legitimacy: XRP’s Rebirth in Elite Financial Circles The legitimacy conferred by BlackRock cannot be overstated. Despite XRP’s longstanding partnership with banks and payment providers, it has often been dismissed by the broader financial media and institutional investors, largely due to the SEC lawsuit. A BlackRock ETF would effectively certify XRP as an institutional-grade asset. This move would silence skeptics who have long regarded XRP as peripheral or too risky for serious capital. Within days, major financial networks, analyst desks, and research arms at leading banks would begin publishing coverage and price models for XRP, reinforcing its presence in mainstream financial discourse. Just as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF normalized Bitcoin for Wall Street, an XRP ETF would do the same, possibly with even greater momentum due to XRP’s clearer real-world use case. A Tsunami of Capital Seeking Yield and Utility Beyond price speculation, the utility of XRP positions it uniquely to benefit from institutional inflows. Unlike passive assets such as gold or Bitcoin, XRP is integrated into the Ripple network to facilitate instantaneous, low-cost global payments. Financial institutions entering through an ETF would likely explore deeper integrations with RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), further enhancing demand for XRP in operational contexts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, yield-seeking institutions could leverage XRP in liquidity provisioning, payment corridors, and decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms as they mature on XRPL. The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and the development of the XRPL EVM sidechain further expand the DeFi possibilities around XRP. These elements transform XRP from a speculative token into a programmable asset with high-velocity capital utility. BlackRock’s ETF would essentially be the bridge between traditional capital and this multifaceted utility, accelerating adoption. Global Liquidity Frameworks Could Be Rewritten Pumpius rightly pointed out that the impact would extend far beyond a temporary price surge. The structure of global finance could begin to tilt toward blockchain-based settlement models. Sovereign wealth funds and reserve managers, always on the hunt for efficient and liquid instruments, would take note. The use of XRP for settlement across borders and across currencies , something Ripple has already proven at scale, would begin to be modeled at the highest levels of financial planning. The speed, transparency, and cost-efficiency offered by XRP-based systems could challenge SWIFT and correspondent banking models, drawing regulatory interest and public-private partnerships. Ripple’s existing engagements with central banks on CBDC offer a glimpse into how such transitions might unfold. With BlackRock’s ETF as the spark, these conversations could quickly escalate from pilot to implementation. The Market Isn’t Ready, But XRP Is Despite its proven utility, XRP remains undervalued in the eyes of many analysts relative to its potential global role. This has often been attributed to regulatory overhang, misinformation, and its early entanglement in crypto tribalism. Yet, behind the scenes, Ripple has meticulously built out the infrastructure, partnerships, and compliance frameworks to support institutional-grade use. As Pumpius noted, “The market’s not ready. But XRP is.” This statement encapsulates a paradox: while investors scramble to understand the implications of an XRP ETF, the foundations for such a future have already been laid. XRP is not a newcomer seeking validation; it is a seasoned digital asset waiting for the capital markets to catch up.

2025-06-06T16:13:03,"Metaplanet Launches Asia’s Largest Bitcoin-Focused Equity Raise","Metaplanet has started Asia’s most significant equity raise, which is dedicated to Bitcoin (BTC). The company plans to issue 555 million shares through special warrants in a capital raise worth about ¥770.9 billion, around $5.4 billion. This move aims to help the company grow its Bitcoin holdings and offer investors a new way to invest in the flagship crypto through the stock market. Metaplanet To Raise $5.4 Billion to Buy More Bitcoin Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, explained that the company will sell shares using moving strike warrants. These warrants are priced higher than the current market price, thanks to strong trading activity and Bitcoin’s price changes. The starting price for the new shares is ¥1,388, which is above recent closing prices. The company expects to finish this capital raise within six to ten months. On June 2, Metaplanet bought 1,088 Bitcoin for ¥16.9 billion, worth about $117.5 million. This purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin stash to 8,888 BTC. With this amount, Metaplanet has become one of the world’s top ten publicly traded companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings. This recent Bitcoin purchase follows a ¥50 billion, equivalent to $330 million, bond sale in May. Like many other Bitcoin-focused firms, Metaplanet is actively using different financial tools to buy more Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s “210 Million Plan” Boosts Bitcoin and Share Price Metaplanet’s current plan follows an earlier capital raise called the “210 Million Plan.” In 60 trading days, the company raised ¥93.3 billion, equivalent to $650 million, by issuing 210 million shares. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings increased from 1,762 BTC to 7,800 BTC during this time. This is a 189% increase in Bitcoin per share, which the company tracks using an internal measure called the “BTC yield.” The company’s share price also tripled during this period. The Japan-based firm said it bought its latest Bitcoin at an average price of about $93,354 per coin. All Bitcoin purchases were funded using non-dilutive debt and warrants, which means the company did not dilute existing shareholders too much. Metaplanet’s BTC yield, which shows how much Bitcoin is held per share, rose to 225.4% this year. Furthermore, the firm plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 30,000 BTC by 2025. It also aims to hold 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is about 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Metaplanet Brings Bitcoin to More Investors in Japan Metaplanet is making it easier for Japanese investors to access Bitcoin. Since Japan has strict crypto rules, buying Bitcoin directly is hard. Metaplanet solves this by holding Bitcoin as a public company. Investors can buy its shares for Bitcoin exposure with tax benefits, NISA eligibility, and access via the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Metaplanet is now Japan’s most traded stock and one of the fastest-growing by market value this year.

FCA said the proposed change would allow individual consumers to access crypto ETNs, provided the products are listed on FCA-recognized exchanges. The regulator revealed that the move aims to support the growth of the UK’s crypto industry. The agency also acknowledged that its promotion rules will still apply. The restriction has existed since 2021 and previously limited access to professional investors only. FCA’s proposal aims to support crypto in the UK 🇬🇧 The FCA will lift the ban on Bitcoin and crypto ETNs for retail investors in the UK! pic.twitter.com/WGXPqTx0Y8 — Jordan Walker (@JayW132) June 6, 2025 The FCA began prohibiting the selling, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and crypto ETNs to retail customers in 2019. The regulator updated its position in March 2024 to allow RIEs to list crypto asset-backed ETNs for professional investors only – restricted to entities such as investment firms and credit institutions. It also added stringent controls to ensure orderly trading and investor protection. Ian Taylor, board advisor at CryptoUK, noted that the UK had been an outlier on ETNs till its recent lift on the ban. He hopes the move will improve consumer protections and promised to continue making the case for lifting the ban on retail investors from accessing highly regulated derivative products. Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at British law firm Clifford Chance, argued that the agency’s initiative is aligned with the UK’s ambition to position itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction in the crypto sector. He also noted that the move will unlock exposure to crypto assets for retail investors and signal that the UK is embracing digital assets. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” -David Geale, Executive Director of Payments and Digital Assets at FCA. The UK Treasury acknowledged that crypto exchanges will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms under the proposed rules, with transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience requirements. The regulator also maintained that its rules aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value, irrespective of the value of the backing asset. FCA also urged customers to ensure they know how backing assets are managed. The agency is also working on a new version of its crypto regulatory framework. FCA requested public feedback on proposed stablecoins and cryptocurrency custody regulations last week. Geale said the regulator supports innovation while ensuring market integrity and trust. FCA also noted that the deadline for feedback is July 31, and it will publish the final rules in 2026 Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden noted that the Bank of England will publish a complimentary consultation paper later this year for stablecoins that expect to operate at a systemic scale. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves also suggested plans for a comprehensive regulatory regime to make the country a leader in the crypto space. UK wants to become a global crypto hub Data revealed that the UK is leading the world in increasing cryptocurrency ownership among its population in 2025, surpassing economies such as the U.S. Jamie Jefferson, senior associate at law firm Ashurst, mentioned that the FCA’s latest proposals are a bold step toward making the UK a hub for responsible crypto innovation. Another UK law firm, Wiggin, suggested that the UK is applying the full weight of securities regulation to digital assets rather than opting for a light-touch regime similar to the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA ). The government agency also introduced new requirements for companies providing crypto custody to ensure they are secured and can be easily accessed at any time. The proposal also seeks to reduce the likelihood and impact of firm failures across regulated companies offering stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody. The Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden argued during the UK House of Commons debate that as finance evolves, so must the rules to ensure transparency in elections. Member of Parliament Sarah Olney highlighted concerns over political parties accepting crypto donations. Olney stressed the need to ensure that donations that do not come from an identifiable source must be returned. Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, had previously announced that the party accepts cryptocurrency contributions from eligible donors.

This move, disclosed in a recent S-3 filing, marks another significant step for the company, which recently concluded a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury deal. The filing reveals plans to issue up to 84.6 million shares of common stock. However, the offering will not take effect until the SEC grants approval.Bitcoin Treasury Deal and Future AcquisitionsTrump Media’s decision to file for additional securities follows its recent involvement in acquiring Bitcoin. Last week, the company announced a Bitcoin treasury deal valued at $2.3 billion. This move aims to strengthen Trump Media’s capital position, as well as support its future expansion. Notably, the company had previously denied reports suggesting it would raise a larger $3 billion fund for Bitcoin investments. Despite this, the current filing indicates the company’s intention to continue acquiring the cryptocurrency. With this, it positions itself alongside other firms like Strategy , which have adopted similar Bitcoin acquisition strategies.Meanwhile, Trump Media’s growing interest in Bitcoin signals a broader trend among companies exploring ways to integrate the digital currency into their portfolios. Companies such as Marathon Digital and Metaplanet have also engaged in Bitcoin acquisitions.Interestingly, new entrants have emerged. Specifically, KULR Technology entered the scene in December 2024 with $21 million worth of Bitcoin. Acurx Pharmaceuticals and Hoth Therapeutics also announced plans to acquire BTC this year. In addition, gold mining firm Bluebird recently became the latest entrant.Expansion Plans and Capital Markets AccessDevin Nunes, the CEO and President of Trump Media, emphasized the company's focus on securing capital for rapid growth. He mentioned that the capital raised through these initiatives would provide the flexibility needed to acquire valuable assets and increase the company's customer base. This, in turn, is expected to enable Trump Media to tap into capital markets when most advantageous. Nunes highlighted that the company's goal is to ensure financial independence while accelerating its growth trajectory, which is increasingly dependent on acquiring digital assets like Bitcoin.Furthermore, Trump Media's involvement in crypto extends beyond just holding Bitcoin. The company is also exploring the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which could expand its presence in the crypto market. This is in line with other companies offering similar financial products related to Bitcoin.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/06/trump-media-registers-12-billion-in-new-securities-amid-bitcoin-acquisition-plans/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trump-media-registers-12-billion-in-new-securities-amid-bitcoin-acquisition-plans,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T15:49:59,"Ethereum forecast suggests rally to $10k, new DeFi coin poised to soar alongside Tron","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyst sees Ethereum hitting $10k, Tron surging to $1.2; Unilabs Finance gains traction with $2.3m ICO and $30m AUM. A top analyst has discovered a pattern that could propel the Ethereum price to $10,000. Also, the Tron price is expected to surge to $1.2 as user activity on its blockchain explodes. Meanwhile, the spotlight is now shifting toward Unilabs Finance (UNIL) for blending AI and smart investing. Its debut in the crypto space has been terrific: $2.3 million raised in crypto ICO and an AUM of more than $30 million. You might also like: Tron and Unilabs battle set to soar above the $1 mark, Binance Coin suffers volatility Analyst draws a parallel between Ethereum and Bitcoin Ted Pillows, a crypto investor, points out that the Ethereum price has formed four consecutive two-week green candles since its recent bottom. According to him, this pattern closely mirrors Bitcoin’s behavior following the March 2020 crash. Ted said there is a similarity between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025, calling it “mind-blowing.” If history repeats itself, the analyst says the price of Ethereum may follow the same upward trajectory that Bitcoin experienced during the 2020–2021 bull market cycle. Ted forecasts the Ethereum price may soar past $10,000 before the end of the year. MerlijnTrader also posted the same Ethereum price prediction. He noted the altcoin is a good crypto to buy for gains for those who missed out on Bitcoin in 2020. MerlijnTrader forecasts that Ethereum price may rise to $11,000 soon. In the meantime, CoinMarketCap data shows the ETH price has been trading between $2,400 and $2,750 in the past week. Tron Network activity skyrockets, price targets $1 The Tron price has been on an upward surge in the past few days, bouncing off the support level around $0.26. Currently, the Tron price is attempting to surpass the current weekly high of $0.2775. If the Tron price crosses it, the crypto could rise above the $0.28 region. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates the Tron coin price has rallied by 0.1% on the weekly timeframe and 10.1% on the monthly level. The Tron price continues to show strength amid the ongoing market correction. Data from CryptoQuant also shows Tron’s 50-SMA and 100-SMA active addresses have hit a new all-time high of over 2.4 million. This massive increase favors buying pressure, supporting a Tron price surge. Going forward, Altwolf forecasts the price of Tron could surge to $0.32 if it follows its current ascending channel. Lennaert Snyder, another market commentator, thinks the Tron price may go as high as $1.20 in the coming months. Unilabs Finance, the AI-based DeFi project gaining momentum The upcoming project, Unilabs Finance, is looking to take investment in the crypto space to a new level. The platform merges AI with crypto investment strategies, creating smart, adaptive portfolios. As the global DeFi market is expected to reach $232 billion by 2030, Unilabs is leading the charge as the next big thing in the DeFi space. What sets Unilabs apart is its AI-driven investment funds, which automate exposure to high-growth sectors like BTC, AI tokens, and real-world assets (RWAs), making portfolio management seamless for users. With real yield potential, AI-powered fund strategies, and a strong community push, Unilabs is a smart bet on the future of AI-integrated investment. Unilabs is currently in the cryptocurrency ICO phase, and its UNIL coin is trading at $0.0062. Thanks to a large influx of buyers, the project has raised over $2.3 million. Unilabs Finance has seen faster traction than ADA’s early ICO phase, offering utility, 122% APY staking rewards, and governance rights. Analysts predict that if adoption trends continue, UNIL could reach $0.10 by the end of 2025, driven by rising user demand, platform growth, and limited token supply. Why the new DeFi crypto is gaining investors’ attention While the Ethereum and Tron prices aim for ambitious price targets, Unilabs offers a rare opportunity for early adopters seeking exponential returns. Its AI-powered ecosystem, presale structure, and access to curated investment funds create a unique value proposition. As market attention intensifies, Unilabs could become the surprise giant of 2025. Getting in early might just be the smartest move in the DeFi market right now.

ADA Price dropped by more than 7% this week. Many analysts question a $100 billion run this year. A 400% jump seems hard. That’s why big investors, or “whales,” are looking elsewhere for better gains. They turn to Unilabs Finance , which offers AI-driven tools. Unilabs is managing over $30 million in assets. Whales are looking for new opportunities, and the ADA price is moving between $0.86 and $0.62. The Cardano market cap may remain low in 2025. However, Unilabs Finance provides a clear road to potential 2x gains. ADA Price Prediction: Will Cardano Market Cap Hit $100B? ADA prices have steadily fallen during the last week. It keeps falling after small rises. It dropped by more than 7% in seven days. For most of the month, the token traded between $0.86 and $0.62. The $0.66 level serves as strong support. The ADA price dropped by $0.66 three times in one week. Even with the drop, some experts think a bounce could come soon. If ADA stays above $0.66, it might rise again. Some trading tools are showing buy signals. Right now, ADA is at $0.69. But reaching a $100 billion market cap this year seems unlikely. Most experts only see a 2x or 3x gain. Source : TradingView Cardano market cap jump seems unlikely, so whales are moving to Unilabs. It allows investors to buy UNIL at a $0.0062 presale price.

2025-06-06T15:40:21,"Bitcoin Potential as a Store of Value Sets It Apart from Other Digital Assets: Fidelity","Prominent asset manager Fidelity has highlighted Bitcoin unique features and functionalities in comparison to other cryptocurrencies in a recent report. It buttressed Bitcoin’s exceptionalities in a recent Coin Report publication, shared in a Friday tweet . The $6 trillion asset manager discussed the facts, strengths, and weaknesses of the pioneering cryptocurrency, including its potential use case.Bitcoin As a Store of ValueFidelity branded Bitcoin as a potential store of value, a term used to classify assets that retain their purchasing power over time. Interestingly, this distinct quality is rare not just in the digital asset industry but in the global financial market, placing Bitcoin on an exclusive list.Bitcoin has continued to grow over the years, outperforming even the best asset classes globally. Notably, BTC has outpaced even gold, an asset considered the best store of value over the past five years. The leading cryptocurrency has increased by 951% within this timeframe compared to gold’s moderate 57% uptick.Meanwhile, Fidelity buttressed that Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value places it on a superior caliber than other cryptocurrencies. While others, like its closest competitor, Ethereum, have put in strong performances, none has done so on the same level and with the same conviction as the native token of the first fully decentralized electronic payment system.There Is Only One BitcoinFurthermore, the asset manager highlighted Bitcoin’s unique strengths of scarcity, decentralization, and security. For instance, there will only be 21 million of the asset that will ever exist, a demonstration of its finite nature.This limited cap, in addition to Bitcoin’s well-structured issuance rate, drives its value, establishing its role as an emerging store of value and aspiring monetary good. Meanwhile, with demand reaching insane levels, watchers have asserted that we will soon be out of Bitcoin to buy.Bitcoin is also decentralized, spurred by its proof-of-work consensus mechanism. With no singular or central control, the network achieves consensus through a voting process, thereby eliminating the need for intermediaries.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly difficult to attack or compromise. The growing number of nodes, miners, and the asset’s price have made it practically and cost-wise impossible for a single individual to control up to 51% of computing power. Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establishes Security Bitcoin Hashrate and Price Rally Establish Security Remarkably, this places Bitcoin on track to solve the blockchain trilemma, with its scalability drawdown being the only missing piece. For one, the Bitcoin network ranks as one of the slowest in the sector, with its decentralized nature playing a significant role in this regard. It can process just three to seven transactions per second compared to new chains like Solana, which has a TPS of 4,000.Essentially, Fidelity holds Bitcoin in high regard, projecting that its value will continue to rise in line with its growing utility and scarcity. While it did not predict the asset’s price trajectory, there are predictions that it would rally to $200,000 this year and $1.5 million in the next five years.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/06/bitcoin-potential-as-a-store-of-value-sets-it-apart-from-other-digital-assets-fidelity/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-potential-as-a-store-of-value-sets-it-apart-from-other-digital-assets-fidelity,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

We’re proposing to lift the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes (cETNs), to retail investors. Consumers would be informed of risks in the same way as when buying cryptoassets directly. https://t.co/myKza5dp9a #cryptoassets #CryptoETNs #CryptoRegulation #FCAGrowth pic.twitter.com/UbOXbhW2oc — Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) June 6, 2025 If the plan goes ahead, retail investors in the UK would once again be able to buy crypto ETNs—something they haven’t been allowed to do since the 2021 ban . The FCA has put the change out for comment as part of a broader look at how to encourage digital-finance innovation while still protecting consumers. ETNs tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether could then list on FCA-approved markets such as the London Stock Exchange, giving everyday investors the same access professionals already enjoy. A Shift From Past Caution to Measured Access When the FCA originally introduced the ban on crypto derivatives and ETNs for retail investors in 2021, it did so on the grounds of consumer protection. At the time, the regulator warned that cryptoassets were “ill-suited for retail consumers,” citing concerns about high volatility, market manipulation, and a lack of reliable valuation. However, in its latest statement, the FCA acknowledges that the market has evolved. “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry,” said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” The proposed changes would apply only to crypto ETNs traded on FCA-approved investment exchanges. The broader ban on crypto derivatives, such as options and futures, for retail customers will remain in place. Safeguards and Rules for Retail Access Should the FCA lift the ban, the sale of crypto ETNs to retail investors would still be subject to strict conditions. Only products listed on a recognised investment exchange (RIE) would be permitted, and all firms offering them would need to comply with financial promotion rules. The rules seek to ensure investors grasp the risks. They call for plain-language disclosures and ban gimmicky incentives or misleading ads, much like the safeguards that already cover direct crypto purchases. Crypto ETNs function as bank-issued debt notes that track digital-asset prices, letting investors follow the market without holding the coins themselves. They’re already traded in the EU and the US, where demand for regulated crypto products keeps rising. Boosting the UK’s Crypto Ambitions The FCA’s proposal supports the UK government’s broader ambition to become a global hub for cryptoasset technology and innovation. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly stated his commitment to fostering a more competitive regulatory environment for digital finance in the UK. Industry leaders have welcomed the FCA’s willingness to revisit earlier restrictions. “This is a step in the right direction for UK crypto policy,” said one digital asset fund manager. “It gives investors more choice and shows the FCA is willing to adapt to a changing market.” The consultation period will remain open until later this year, with a final decision expected in early 2026. If approved, crypto ETNs could return to the UK retail market soon after, opening new regulated investment pathways for everyday investors seeking exposure to digital assets.

The latest decline has managed to push this meme coin’s year-to-date losses to 41.5% again. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have surged by nearly 78% as the sell-off intensified yesterday afternoon. On-chain data indicates that a significant amount of tokens are held by investors are held by investors with a cost basis ranging from $0.000012 to $0.000013. Hence, this may be a heavily defended price zone where trading volumes may skyrocket. This favors a bullish Shiba Inu price forecast in the near term as bulls will do their best to keep their positions afloat and in green territory to avoid a long squeeze. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can the #ShibArmy Keep the Price Above $0.00001200? The #ShibArmy, the community that backs this meme coin, is one of the strongest in the crypto space. Its social media accounts are followed by millions and more than 1.5 million accounts hold $SHIB at press time. In addition, the project recently launched the ShibaDAO – a decentralized governance entity that has effectively surrendered the project’s reins to the community. If the army closes ranks at this point, they could manage to keep the price up through a concerted effort. The daily chart shows that SHIB broke its trend line support in the past few days and has also dropped below its short-term exponential moving averages (EMAs). The price has found support at $0.00001200 for now and rose strongly during the Asian session as bulls seem determined to hold their ground at this level. SHIB could be pushed to retest its former trend line support from below. If it rejects it, we could draft a Shiba Inu price prediction of $0.00001050 as this is the nearest area where the token has found support after a bearish breakout below $0.00001200. This meme coin’s upside potential seems capped at the moment. However, Bitcoin’s path to new all-time highs has been paved lately. One meme coin stands to gain if BTC rises to $125,000 in the next few weeks. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is the name of one of the hottest crypto presales of the year . Its innovative rewards system tied to the performance of the top crypto has attracted nearly $7 million from investors already. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Hands Out Rewards Every Time Bitcoin Hits a Price Milestone BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a fun and innovative way to profit from Bitcoin’s rally to new heights. The reward mechanism is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked for every additional $25,000 that BTC adds to its price. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. Next up, once the price rises to $150,000, token holders will receive a direct Bitcoin airdrop. To buy this meme coin and start generating passive income once Bitcoin reaches new milestones, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.
