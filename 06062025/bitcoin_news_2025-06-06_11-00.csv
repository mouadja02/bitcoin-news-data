2025-06-06T08:54:40,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 6, 2025","The crypto market cap slipped again today, down 4.1% to $3.33 trillion, while daily trading volume reached $142.2 billion. The market remains volatile, though some major coins are showing signs of resilience. TL;DR: The crypto market cap dropped 4.1% today to $3.33T, volatility remains high; BTC is holding above $103K after a pullback from $111.8K ATH; Profit-taking by long-term holders is capping short-term gains; Small caps like KILL BIG BEAUTIFUL and VICE see strong speculative interest; Institutional demand and ETF inflows could drive BTC toward $115K by early July; The U.S. jobs report may influence BTC’s next move, with $95K–$97K seen as key support. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $103,188, largely unchanged on the day. Ethereum (ETH) , however, fell another 5.8% to $2,455.79. XRP is stable at $2.13, up a slight 0.1% in the past hour. Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) remain anchored at $1. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) declined 3.5% to $147.26, continuing its recent downtrend. Dogecoin (DOGE) took a heavier hit, down 7.2% to $0.175. On the flip side, small-cap coin KILL BIG BEAUTIFUL surged 168.5%, followed by VICE up 35%, and GIZA up 17.7%, reflecting growing speculative activity in smaller tokens. $BTC has broken above the short-term holder realized price. If history repeats… Bitcoin is about to explode! pic.twitter.com/f5utqm1j1u — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) June 5, 2025 While top assets remain range-bound, on-chain metrics suggest that the market may be gearing up for a new move. BTC’s resilience above the $100K level remains key for broader sentiment. Macro factors such as ongoing U.S. debt concerns and global liquidity trends could shape the next leg of the cycle. For now, crypto investors are watching closely for confirmation of a breakout. Bitcoin’s Rally Faces a Test as Long-Term Holders Lead Profit-Taking Bitcoin recently surged to a new all-time high of $111.8k before retreating to $103.2k, as long-term holders began realizing profits, according to a report by Glassnode . The latest rally was largely spot-driven, with key accumulation zones now serving as support between $81k and $104k. However, older cohorts are now offloading, posing resistance to further upside. On-chain data shows that many previous accumulation zones have flipped into distribution zones, particularly those formed between $25k–31k and $60k–73k. These seasoned holders are shaping the current market structure, applying selling pressure that could cap Bitcoin’s short-term gains. Cost basis models highlight immediate support near $103.7k and $95.6k, with resistance sitting at $114.8k. The average entry price for short-term holders is now around $97.1k, with wider bands defining the market’s current sentiment range. A break of these levels could signal whether momentum is fading or reigniting. Profit realization has intensified, with daily profits spiking to $1.47B, marking the fifth such event this cycle. Importantly, this selling is being led by long-term holders—those holding for over a year—indicating mature capital rotation rather than speculative churn. In short, Bitcoin’s latest surge has entered a critical phase. Elevated profit-taking by veteran investors, coupled with cooling momentum, suggests that the market may be transitioning into a consolidation or top-formation phase. Whether support zones hold in the coming weeks will determine if the rally resumes or deeper corrections unfold. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC is currently trading at $103,450. It briefly touched an intraday high of $103,467 but could not break higher. From its recent all-time high of $111,814, the coin is now down approximately 7.5%. Over the past week, BTC has declined by around 3%, while still posting a monthly gain of roughly 8%. Bitcoin could climb to $115,000 or higher by early July, driven by institutional demand, ETF inflows, and broader macro catalysts, according to Bitfinex analysts . In their latest market outlook, they highlighted that Friday’s U.S. jobs report could further influence expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would benefit risk assets like BTC. While the labor data alone won’t dictate Bitcoin’s next move, weaker-than-expected figures could reinforce disinflation trends and support a dovish Fed stance. In this scenario, BTC could test the $120K–$125K range in June. On the downside, the $95K–$97K zone is seen as key for accumulation. SCENARIO FRAMEWORK: June 2025 BTC Forecast Bullish Breakout (Probability: 79%) •Range: $112K → $126K •Triggers: •Trump–Musk détente formalized as strategic alliance •U.S. jobs report confirms soft-landing illusion breaking •ETF inflows resume post-volatility flush… — SightBringer (@_The_Prophet__) June 6, 2025 Currently trading near $105,000, Bitcoin faces short-term risks if the jobs report surprises to the upside, which could push BTC back toward $102K or lower. However, Bitfinex analysts emphasize that Bitcoin’s trajectory remains shaped by a complex mix of institutional flows, macro factors, and evolving market sentiment.

2025-06-06T08:51:45,"Elon Musk Joins Bitcoin Maxis in Warning of ‘Potential’ U.S. Fiscal Collapse or Are We There Already?","Last month, CoinDesk discussed in detail how bond market activity is challenging the notion that the U.S. government is good for money, raising questions on the long-held ""kayfabe"" or illusion of fiscal stability . Now, billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has raised the alarm on X through his [perhaps rightful] diatribe against President Donald Donald Trump's big, beautiful tax bill, which is projected to boost the fiscal deficit by $2.4 trillion over ten years. That's happening at a time when mounting fiscal concerns are already driving investors away from U.S. assets and into alternatives, such as bitcoin and gold. As of FY 2024, the fiscal deficit stood at $1.8 trillion, and as of today, the national debt is already at $36 trillion, with a nnual interest payments amount to $1.13 trillion . Someone as influential and popular as Musk taking fiscal concerns public could result in two things: First, it could accelerate the shift away from U.S. assets. Is it merely a coincidence that at a time like this, corporate treasury adoption of bitcoin and other tokens, including XRP , has picked pace? Secondly, investors concerned about the government's fiscal health are likely to demand a higher inflation-adjusted yield to lend money to the government. So, expect yields to remain sticky on the higher side, further complicating the fiscal situation and economic growth. Government is bankrupt, at least in theory Bitcoin BTC believers, have been warning of this day for a long time. To paraphrase a former CoinDesk employee, ""Crypto may not have all the right answers, but it does ask correct questions."" The popular narrative has been that the U.S. government is bankrupt, and the dollar is headed for a collapse . According to Musk , the government risks bankruptcy if fiscal prudence isn't restored. In theory, the government has been bankrupt for decades. That's evident from the repeated debt ceiling lift-offs over the years. Congress set the first federal debt limit at $45 billion in 1939, granting the Treasury wide discretion over the use of borrowing instruments as long as the total debt does not exceed the self-imposed limit. Since then, the ceiling has been repeatedly hit and raised, a sign of fiscal crisis and, in many ways, form of hiding bankruptcy. As of 2025, the debt limit stands at $36 trillion! That's right trillion. This brings to my mind a joke by an Indian standup comedian about government officials artificially raising the danger mark during floods, to create the illusion of control and normalcy. Similarly, repeatedly raising the debt ceiling has been an attempt to mask the country's fiscal bankruptcy. The debt-based fiat system may be broken For at least a decade, Bitcoin believers have been saying that the monetary system is broken and we need to fix the ""money"" – essentially the debt-based fiat money. And they may be right, as the government debt-to-GDP ratios across the advanced world have risen past 100% , a sign that the debt-based fiat money's ability to generate growth has collapsed. A blog post on Mises Institute described the debt-based fiat money (paper money with a government stamp backed by nothing) as follows: ""The government and powerful bankers established a system in 1913 that typically works like this: Every dollar of the monetary base (or “narrow money” or “high-powered money”) comes into existence with a one-to-one increase in the public debt, collectively owed by the taxpayers. Then, private banks use that base to create more dollars (in “broad money”) that come into existence with a one-to-one increase in private debt."" ""Going the other way, if people in the private sector ever paid off all of their debts, and the federal government paid off all of its bondholders, then the supply of U.S. dollars would be virtually extinguished."" ""This is the sense in which our fiat-money, fractional-reserve system uses “debt-based money.” Although market prices are flexible and can react to deflation much better than most people realize, it is still true that our system is tragically absurd."" A debt-to-GDP ratio above 100% means that the total government debt exceeds the nation's annual economic output. In such a situation, for every additional dollar borrowed by the government and invested in the economy, the resulting impact (multiplier effect) is less than one dollar – that is, the return on additional borrowed funds diminishes. To explain in the context of the law of diminishing returns/utility, the marginal utility of each additional dollar spent in generating growth is negative. It also means that extra debt no longer generates productive economic growth and may actually be harmful. Imagine gorging on your favorite ice cream without a break (just as governments gorging on borrowed money for decades); eventually, at some stage, you will throw up. That's where we are in terms of fiscal finances and the debt-to-GDP ratios in the U.S. and other advanced nations. What next? Economist Russel Napier , known for his expertise on debt and fiscal policy, has discussed several steps governments are likely to take to reduce debt-to-GDP ratios. These include engineering higher nominal GDP growth through a structural level of inflation, which is what many countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., did to inflate away debt after World War II. Allowing moderate inflation to erode the real value of the debt, thereby reducing debt servicing and lowering the ratio, could galvanize demand for assets like gold and bitcoin. Other steps could include devaluing currencies and implementing capital controls and financial repression, all of which could bode well for alternative investments, such as cryptocurrencies. On a lighter note, reducing fiscal spending – a strategy initially promoted by Trump – might be the only way to get the economy back on track. Consider this medical analogy. When your body is exposed to excessive blood sugar over an extended period, cells tend to develop insulin resistance, leading to type 2 diabetes. Doctors often recommend fasting to help restore insulin sensitivity. Similarly, curbing fiscal spending could be the only way to meaningfully lower the debt-to-GDP ratio below 100%, thereby restoring the effectiveness of the debt-based fiat system's ability to generate growth. That said, what if governments fail? The debt-based fiat system may be truly over then, intensifying the search for alternatives, with blockchain and crypto as potential options. Let's see how things unfold.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/06/elon-musk-joins-bitcoin-maxis-in-warning-of-potential-us-fiscal-collapse-or-are-we-there-already,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Elon Musk|market analysis|Markets|Debt|Top Stories|Debt ceiling|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T08:48:28,"Ethereum price slides lower, nearing the $2,400 mark","Ethereum plummets near the $2,400 mark as the Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s fallout rocks the crypto market as more major tokens get dragged down. According to data from crypto.news, the Ethereum price has dropped nearly 6% in the past 24 hours of trading. The second-largest token by market cap has been seeing red in the past few hours, dropping from a peak of $2,634 to as low as $2,408. At press time, ETH ( ETH ) is trading hands at a price of $2,456, barely recovering from the sudden price drop at about 2:00 AM UTC. The recent Ethereum price dip has led to a sharp increase in trading activity for the token, with its daily trading volume rising by nearly 64% compared to the previous day of trading. In the past week, ETH has gone down by more than 6%, and even more so in the past two weeks. In the last 24 days, the token has fallen by 7.4%. Last month the token ignited optimism among traders hoping to see ETH jump towards the $3k mark, echoing Bitcoin ( BTC )’s leap to a new all-time high . Throughout May, the token experienced a rally that catapulted ETH up to $2,731 on May 29. Apparently ETH is not the only one suffering a decline. According to data from CoinGecko, the total crypto market cap has fallen nearly 4% from $4.1 trillion on June 5 to $3.29 trillion on June 6. Similar to ETH, Bitcoin is currently down by 1.2%, trading hands at $103,438.

According to data from DeFi Llama, Ethereum’s total value locked has also suffered from the price drop, falling by nearly 4% to $59.9 billion. Although it is still ahead of Solana ( SOL ) in terms of TVL, with Solana’s standing at only $8 billion, the ETH ecosystem has taken a harsher hit from the crypto market’s current plunge. On the other hand, Ethereum’s on-chain fees rose two-fold compared to the beginning of June. On June 6, ETH fees amounted to $2.26 million, rising more than 100% compared to $853,320 on June 1. Most recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that while Ethereum has a stronghold in aspects like censorship resistance and security, he admitted that Bitcoin is still ahead of them in terms of other areas.

The DEX liquidation engine has been used to disguise profits with risky bets. Chinese authorities have intercepted three cases of money laundering involving Hyperliquid leveraged positions. According to Mirror Tang, founder of the Web3 security company Salus, Hyperliquid was ideal for creating a surface loss, which was then offset by counter-trading on centralized markets. Tang explained the mechanism was similar to the trades of James Tang, who has been liquidated multiple times in the past two weeks. The authorities discovered the potential laundering during a period of constant growth of Hyperliquid’s trading volumes, reaching up to 50% of Binance’s derivative market. 自今年3月以来，中国执法机关已侦破3起使用 @HyperliquidX 进行加密货币洗钱的案件 操作手法是利用 Hyperliquid 的高杠杆爆仓机制，将非法所得对冲洗净：在 HL 上制造爆仓损失，在中心化交易所反向建仓获利，完成资金漂白 该策略结构与 @JamesWynnReal 操作路径高度相似 请 @chameleon_jeff … — Mirror Tang (@mirrorzk) June 6, 2025 Hyperliquid retains the ability to create big losses and gains, as it returned the 40X leverage with on-chain trading. The perpetual DEX has been growing its influence on the crypto market, especially after the involvement of high-profile whales and the risky trader James Wynn. The on-chain trading on Hyperliquid means all large positions are transparent, and can draw in counter-traders. This means some positions have been deliberately left to be liquidated, knowing it would cause a significant price move for BTC or other assets. Hyperliquid is still a no-KYC environment, allowing anyone to open anonymous, hard-to-identify positions. Unofficially, on-chain investigators have tracked suspicious clusters of liquidations , sometimes as high as $99M. The wallets used on Hyperliquid can also be entirely separate from other exchange accounts, with no direct transfer to KYC exchanges. This leaves whales with clean earnings from trading, with a provable origin from a centralized market. Previously, on-chain forensics by ZachXBT have shown that Hyperliquid has been used by hacker William Parker . In addition to laundering funds, Parker made $20M from shorting MELANIA . Hyperliquid remains outside regulators’ scrutiny Hyperliquid remains permissionless, despite the significant risk of losses. The DEX often uses USDC as collateral, which is the only asset that can be frozen on request. However, even for Circle, USDC freezes are rare. Hyperliquid has been drawing constant USDC inflows, though no token freezes have been called for, despite the high-risk trading and potential money laundering. | Source: Dune Analytics A total of $2.76B of USDC has been bridged to Hyperliquid, becoming the only tool to stop trading by request of authorities. The tokens are held in liquidity vaults and personal accounts. Most of the biggest liquidations come from the BTC and ETH markets, but even meme token positions offer significant leverage. Hyperliquid used to short TRUMP tokens The popularity of Hyperliquid means there are no limitations to trades, or even insider involvement. Recently, the advisor of World Liberty Fi opened a short position on Official Trump (TRUMP), after the asset started tanking in the past day. The advisor, known as @cryptogle, received a backlash from the community from seemingly showing disloyalty. He claimed World Liberty Fi and the TRUMP meme token were separate projects. The position has a liquidation price of $12.48, while TRUMP traded around $9.72. The whale’s entry at $9.48 put the position at over $60,000 in loss as the TRUMP price recovered from its lows.

2025-06-06T08:30:05,"Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?","Data shows the 14-day Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped into the oversold region. Here’s what this could mean for the asset. Bitcoin RSI Has Breached Below The 30 Mark In a new post on X, analyst Axel Adler Jr has talked about the latest trend in the RSI of Bitcoin. The “RSI” refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that measures the speed and magnitude of changes occurring in any given asset’s price over a specific period. In the current case, the period is 14 days. This metric is generally used for spotting oversold or overbought conditions for the asset. When the RSI is greater than 70, it can be a sign that the price is heating up and may be due a correction to the downside. On the other hand, it being under 30 can imply the asset is becoming underbought. Related Reading: Solana’s Old Hands Are Moving—Is Trouble Brewing? Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 14-day Bitcoin RSI over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the 14-day Bitcoin RSI has plummeted recently and is now below the 30 threshold. This naturally suggests the cryptocurrency is becoming oversold, at least from the perspective of this indicator. “Other metrics are also showing alerts,” notes Adler Jr. “I think now all conditions are in place to start testing the ATH.” Though, while bullish developments may have occurred on the RSI and other indicators, BTC has actually declined during the past day. On-chain data may provide hints about where the next potential support zone could be located for the asset. As the analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in its latest weekly report, the average cost basis of the short-term holders is located at $97,100. The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins during the past 155 days. The cost basis of this group has often been a relevant level for the cryptocurrency, taking turns as support and resistance. In the chart, the analytics firm has also shown two other levels: the +1 and -1 standard deviation bands. Currently, the latter is situated at $83,200, so it’s possible that if BTC’s bearish momentum lasts for long enough to push it under the STH cost basis, this value could prove significant. However, before this level, there is another on-chain level that could be important. The level in question is part of the Spent Supply Distribution (SSD) Quantiles model, which basically tells us which price levels the investors selling their coins right now initially purchased them. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Key Investors Double Down, Buy Another 79,000 BTC The 0.85 quantile is located at $95,600, which is quite close to the STH cost basis, so a retest of the zone could be a particularly vital one for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $101,000, down almost 5% in the last seven days.

2025-06-06T08:25:42,"Bitcoin Just Mined Its 900,000th Block – What It Means for Miners and the Next Halving","The post Bitcoin Just Mined Its 900,000th Block – What It Means for Miners and the Next Halving appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This is huge news! Bitcoin just crossed a new line in the sand. On Friday, the network hit block 900,000, a milestone that reflects the strength, consistency, and long-game design of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The block was mined by ViaBTC, one of the industry’s major mining pools, and included 1,562 transactions with relatively low fees (~3 sat/vB), generating 0.018 BTC in transaction rewards. Compared to the block before it – which packed fewer transactions but higher average fees – it was efficient, fast, and right on time. But the real story isn’t about this single block. It’s about what it represents. The Halving Is Coming: Where Do We Stand? Block 900,000 puts us exactly 150,000 blocks away from the next Bitcoin halving, projected to hit at block 1,050,000 around March 2028. That’s when miner rewards will shrink again – from 3.125 BTC to 1.5625 BTC. The Bitcoin Network Mines 900,000th Block pic.twitter.com/AEHJ29ojQU — Documenting ₿itcoin (@DocumentingBTC) June 6, 2025 It took Bitcoin nearly two years to climb from block 800,000 to 900,000. If that pace holds, the 1 million block mark will arrive sometime around May 2027. Yes, that’ll be a historic moment too, but from a network perspective, the countdown to the halving is where the real tension builds. The halving can be regarded as a supply shock baked into Bitcoin’s DNA. Each one tightens issuance, raises scarcity, and shifts the economics of mining. And that’s exactly why this matters so much. More Than 75% of Bitcoin Is Already Mined This milestone also brings us closer to Bitcoin’s hard-coded supply ceiling: 21 million coins. Right now, more than three-quarters of all BTC that will ever exist is already in circulation. Back in the early days, miners earned 50 BTC per block. That number has been cut in half four times now, down to 3.125 BTC post-2024 halving. Over the decades ahead, it will keep shrinking until it’s effectively zero – likely around the year 2140. At that point, miners won’t earn new BTC from block rewards. They’ll be working solely for transaction fees. The shift is not far. Mining Profits Just Got a Boost Interestingly, while block rewards are getting smaller, mining profitability actually climbed in May. A recent JPMorgan report shows that the total market cap of 13 U.S.-listed miners tracked by the bank jumped 19% month-over-month. Driving that growth? A rise in Bitcoin’s price and a boost in network activity.

Among the standouts: IREN posted a 37% jump, while Bitfarms (BITF) lagged behind with an 8% dip. In total, 7 out of 13 miners outperformed Bitcoin itself last month.

2025-06-06T08:21:16,"Metaplanet Announces $5.4B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin, Targets 210,000 BTC by 2027","Key Takeaways: Metaplanet plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, targeting 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. A new ¥770 billion share issuance will fund the aggressive expansion of its Bitcoin holdings. The firm has already climbed to tenth globally with 8,888 BTC and is pursuing a 600% BTC yield this year. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. The firm announced to raise $5.4 billion to accelerate its Bitcoin purchase by issuing 555 million shares of Moving-Strike Warrants, a first of its kind raise in Japan’s market of this size. The move, outlined in its updated “555 Million Plan,” would give the company ownership of roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. The announcement marks a major acceleration from Metaplanet’s prior “21 Million Plan,” under which it aimed for 21,000 BTC by 2026. Metaplanet Climbs to Global Top 10 Bitcoin Holder After surpassing interim goals and climbing to 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company is now setting its sights far higher. To fund this aggressive acquisition drive, Metaplanet will issue 555 million new shares through moving strike warrants, an innovative financing mechanism designed to optimize capital raising with minimal dilution. If fully exercised, this issuance could generate an estimated ¥770 billion (approximately $5.4 billion) at an initial strike price of ¥1,388 per share. The new plan is structured to gradually ramp up BTC holdings. This includes 30,000 BTC targeted by year-end 2025, 100,000 BTC by 2026, and 210,000 BTC by 2027. “Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin — again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our Bitcoin strategy. Our new target: 210,000 BTC by 2027,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in a post on X. Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin — again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our Bitcoin strategy. Our new target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. Details here: https://t.co/ahL27o9QBg pic.twitter.com/njYybVq1uu — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 6, 2025 Metaplanet’s strategy leverages Japan’s deep capital markets, where demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure remains strong. The company’s stock, one of Japan’s most liquid, offers domestic investors an accessible, tax-advantaged vehicle to gain BTC exposure—a notable advantage given Japan’s lack of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The firm’s execution to date has been swift. Its previous capital raise of ¥102.8 billion fueled a 225.4% increase in BTC holdings year-to-date. It now aims to deliver an even more aggressive 600% BTC yield by the end of 2025. Metaplanet’s move draws parallels to MicroStrategy’s pioneering Bitcoin-backed securities approach, which aims to position itself as a bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin-native capital formation. Public Companies Continue to Invest in Bitcoin Meanwhile, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. More recently, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint.

Investigators now say the funds are likely tied to Alphabay , another infamous dark web marketplace , reviving concerns over illicit crypto flows . Tracing the Bitcoin: Alphabay Connection According to a June 5 report by WIRED , blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis traced the donation—over 300 BTC —to a wallet associated with Alphabay. The firm suspects the sender may have been a former Alphabay vendor , although their identity remains unknown. Phil Larratt, Director at Chainalysis, noted that the funds were likely moved through crypto mixing services to obscure their origin before reaching Ulbricht’s donation address. ZachXBT Confirms Use of Mixing Services Independent blockchain investigator ZachXBT supported these claims, highlighting the use of common obfuscation tactics: Multiple crypto mixers Small, staggered cash-outs Transfers via various centralized exchanges One of the mixing tools used in this case was identified as Jambler , a centralized crypto mixer known for helping disguise illicit fund trails. Alphabay and Its Dark Legacy Alphabay gained notoriety as the largest darknet market following Silk Road’s shutdown in 2013. It was taken down during Operation Bayonet in 2017, a coordinated global effort involving law enforcement agencies and blockchain experts, including Chainalysis. Both Alphabay and Silk Road were known for enabling illegal activities such as drug sales and money laundering using cryptocurrency , especially Bitcoin. Ross Ulbricht’s Controversial Legacy Ross Ulbricht , creator of Silk Road, was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to double life imprisonment plus 40 years . However, in a dramatic turn of events, he was pardoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump on January 21, 2025 . The recent Bitcoin donation suggests that Ulbricht still commands support from darknet-linked actors , despite being behind bars for nearly a decade. What This Means for Crypto Regulation The incident underscores the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and darknet-linked crypto actors. It also highlights the persistent challenges of tracing illicit crypto transactions , especially with the rise of mixing services and privacy tools.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-mixers-used-to-send-31m-to-ross-ulbricht-says-zachxbt/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin|Hack",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T08:18:04,"US DOJ moves to seize $7.7m in crypto linked to North Korean IT infiltration scheme","United States authorities have launched a forfeiture action to seize millions in crypto funneled to North Korea through a global network of fake IT workers embedded in blockchain firms. According to a June 5 statement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the agency is seeking to confiscate over $7.74 million in digital assets allegedly earned through illicit employment and laundering schemes designed to evade U.S. sanctions. The funds were initially frozen in April 2023 following the indictment of Sim Hyon Sop , a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank representative based in China, accused of conspiring with DPRK IT workers to funnel crypto earnings back to the regime. Authorities allege these funds were part of a coordinated laundering effort that included chain hopping, token swaps, and fictitious identities to obscure their origin. In its complaint filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, the DOJ has targeted multiple forms of digital property, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, and Ethereum Name Service domains. You might also like: Crypto exchange Kraken flags North Korean infiltration attempt through fake job application Officials allege these operations were part of a broader effort by North Korea to sidestep international sanctions and fund its weapons programme through cyber-enabled revenue streams. “Sanctions are in place against North Korea for a reason, and we will diligently investigate and prosecute anyone who tries to evade them. We will halt your progress, strike back, and take hold of any proceeds you obtained illegally,” U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro said in an accompanying statement. With DPRK-linked hackers reportedly stealing over $1.6 billion from crypto firms in 2024 alone, U.S. officials say more aggressive action is required. The DOJ’s latest Action is part of the broader “DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative,” launched in March 2024 to disrupt North Korea’s revenue-generation networks. A growing threat to crypto North Korean operatives have been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency heists in recent years, with malicious IT workers increasingly playing a central role in breaching blockchain firms from the inside. Often operating under stolen or fabricated identities, these individuals secure remote jobs at crypto and tech companies, where they typically request payment in stablecoins like USDC and Tether, a tactic believed to help mask their true locations. Once employed, these positions provide a financial lifeline to the regime and, in some cases, access that can later be exploited. Illicit earnings from these roles are often funneled back to the regime through a web of laundering techniques, including fake accounts, small-value transfers, cross-chain swaps, and NFT purchases, before being rerouted, sometimes via sanctioned intermediaries like Chinyong , a company tied to North Korea’s Ministry of Defense. In recent years, North Korean IT workers have continued to expand their operations, adapting their tactics and shifting targets as enforcement efforts intensify . According to an April 2025 report from Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, North Korean IT operatives were increasingly targeting European blockchain firms after heightened scrutiny in the United States. The report detailed cases of DPRK workers building Solana smart contracts and job marketplaces in the UK, often using elaborate webs of fake references and identities to pass recruitment checks. Last month, cryptocurrency trading platform Kraken intercepted one such attempt when a job applicant raised red flags during the recruitment process. Further investigation revealed the candidate was a North Korean operative linked to a broader network of infiltrators who had already secured roles at other crypto firms.

In contrast, trading volumes have surged by 39.75%, reaching $144.4 billion, suggesting a wave of panic selling or forced exits. Amidst this volatility, crypto ETF outflows recorded a sizable $267.1 million withdrawal. Surprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index remains relatively stable at 46, indicating neutral sentiment despite sharp market reactions. Why Did the Crypto Market Crash Today? The following catalysts triggered a domino effect of selling across major tokens. Political & Social Sentiment : A public dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk around policy bills further rattled market confidence, sparking debate and confusion across social media. Mass Liquidation Events : High-leverage positions across multiple assets faced forced closures, exacerbating the downward momentum. Macroeconomic Headwinds : Investors are anxious ahead of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of non-farm payroll data and the unemployment rate later today. These figures could heavily influence Fed policy, prompting cautious sentiment. Crypto Liquidations Hit $1 Billion In the past 24 hours, the crypto market bore over $1 billion in liquidations, a majority of which were $900 million+ worth of long positions. Short liquidations made up just around $100 million, clearly reflecting the bull trap that caught over-leveraged buyers off guard. Bitcoin alone saw $341.76 million in liquidations, followed closely by Ethereum at $285.99 million. Source: Coin Glass Top exchanges like Bybit with $352M, and Binance with $248M led the tally in liquidated positions, with more than 89% of these being long trades. This steep wipeout not only intensified the sell-off but also hints at growing nervousness among traders, especially those relying on leveraged gains. Source: Coin Glass What to Expect Next? Despite today’s fall, the neutral score in the Fear & Greed Index suggests the market isn’t in a full-blown panic yet. Looking at the chart, the total crypto market cap has slipped from above $3.3 trillion to $3.17 trillion, signaling a break below key support. The 9-day SMA at $3.23T now acts as a resistance.

2025-06-06T07:38:08,"Analysis Firm Claims We Are at a “Historic Turning Point” for Bitcoin: “It Will Never Be Like This Again”","Bitcoin-focused financial services firm Swan has released a remarkable analysis of the cryptocurrency markets. The company warns that the current cycle is different from others and that we may be witnessing “the last Bitcoin rotation before everything changes.” Swan argued that despite being in the final year of the classic four-year cycle, price action has not generated as much excitement as expected. While past cycles have seen parabolic increases in Bitcoin’s third green year, 2025 has so far seen a slower, more measured, and sideways market. According to the analysis, a major shift is taking place under the surface in the Bitcoin market. Investors who have held BTC for a long time are selling above the $100,000 level, while BlackRock, Fidelity, large companies and institutional buyers who have established long-term strategic positions are taking their place. Swan states that this new class of investors is not for sale. Swan CIO Ben Werkman said: “These companies are not buying Bitcoin to trade, but to hold it in their long-term portfolios. They are simply buyers. Not sellers.” When long-term capital is combined with inelastic supply, market supply can dry up quickly, with “explosive” consequences for prices, according to Werkman. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also contributed to the analysis, stating: “People who are not committed to the long term are exiting the market… and they are being replaced by a completely different class of investors.” Related News: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping - Is the Trade War Coming to an End? Here Are the Details of the Call Swan notes that this transformation is not only happening among investor types, but also between generations. After the Silent Generation who trusted in gold, the Baby Boomers who accumulated their wealth in stocks, and the Generation X who grew up with technology, now the Millennials who are starting to inherit trillions of dollars are coming onto the scene and they are choosing Bitcoin. In the analysis, it was argued that the structural transformation in Bitcoin is also supported by the macroeconomic background. Swan noted that the rise in bond yields while the US dollar is depreciating is an unusual and dangerous signal for global capital. Swan's remarkable analysis concluded with the following warning: “If you're selling Bitcoin right now, you're probably giving it to an institution that plans to hold it forever. You may not get it back. This isn't just the next cycle, it's the end of an era. The supply is running out. The buyers are different. The macro structure is breaking. This could be the last Bitcoin rotation.” *This is not investment advice.

With Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum falling, XRP has also slipped over 4% as traders react to political tensions and a wider market sell-off. XRP Nears Key $2.40 Resistance Despite the recent drop, XRP appears to be gaining momentum. Analyst Dark Defender shared recently that XRP is nearing a major resistance level on the weekly chart. If it breaks this key level along with the RSI barrier, it could trigger a strong upward move. He shared that XRP has a strong price support at $2.22. If it holds above this support and breaks key resistance levels like $2.40, it could shoot up to as high as $5.85, an increase of about 144%. The market seems to be ticking toward a breakout, and excitement is building across the XRP community. Analysts Point to Crucial Resistance at $2.36 for Breakout Analyst Egrag Crypto also shared that for a short-term bullish breakout, XRP needs to first close above $2.30 to show buying interest, then surpass $2.35 to build momentum. The crucial level is $2.36, where XRP would break out of a major falling wedge pattern, which is a classic technical signal hinting at an upward trend. If it further closes above $2.45, then it shows strong bullish control, and crossing $2.65 is the key for a big upward move. XRP Could Follow 2017 Pattern, Rally Soon? If XRP follows its 2017 pattern , a final breakout could start in 2-4 weeks. It has already been consolidating for 190 days, close to the 210-day mark back then. So, a big move might be around the corner. But, it may first dip to $2 to grab liquidity before pumping. XRP is trading around $2.12, down 4% in 24 hours. It is now testing key support near $2.07. If it breaks lower, more losses could follow. Almost all of the moving averages are negative except the 200-day EMA at $2.08, which might act as support. Indicators like MACD remain bearish, and traders seem to be waiting for a clear move. All eyes are on June 16 next, as a major Ripple v. SEC update is expected, which could decide XRP’s course.

2025-06-06T07:19:30,"Making of Millionaires: Expert Reveals Why Bitcoin and XRP Are Just Getting Started","Coach JV, a well-known voice in the cryptocurrency space, has presented a detailed case for why Bitcoin and XRP remain two of the most promising assets for future millionaires. Although both digital assets have been available for over a decade, the crypto commentator insists that their most significant gains could still lie ahead. His analysis is centered on the long-term fundamentals of these cryptocurrencies, including supply constraints, increasing institutional demand, and geopolitical shifts that favor broader crypto adoption. Why Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Point to Massive Upside According to Coach JV, Bitcoin’s scarcity remains one of its strongest value drivers. He notes that 95% of all Bitcoin has already been mined and distributed, leaving only 5% of the supply available for future circulation. This limited supply, coupled with rising demand from both retail and institutional buyers, creates a high probability of price escalation. Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, recently remarked that Bitcoin is in high demand and few are willing to sell, reinforcing the argument that growing interest is colliding with limited supply. Trump, who backs conservative financial policies, placed his baseline price prediction for Bitcoin at $170,000 but acknowledged that the $1 million figure is within reason. Coach JV highlighted that global leaders and political figures are now aligning with pro-Bitcoin policies. He referenced President Donald Trump’s executive order directing the United States to retain its Bitcoin holdings and not liquidate them. This move aligns with several pro-crypto legislative proposals now circulating in Washington, signaling a shift in official sentiment toward digital assets. Institutional Interest and Global Policy Add Momentum Momentum is also building internationally. Zia Yusuf, chairman of Reform UK, warned in a Bloomberg interview that the UK could fall behind economically if it excludes Bitcoin from its sovereign wealth fund. Such warnings underscore the asset’s increasing relevance at a governmental level, a trend that Coach JV argues could support prolonged upward movement in Bitcoin’s price. Supporters of the bullish outlook claim that this global policy trend may move Bitcoin out of its traditional four-year bull-bear cycle into a longer-term growth phase. This new environment, they argue, could be the catalyst for a significant number of new millionaires who accumulate the asset early enough. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin Compared to Early Tech Stocks Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, provided further historical perspective by comparing Bitcoin’s current market position to Apple’s in the mid-1990s. He stated that investing in Bitcoin at $105,000 in 2025 would be similar to buying Apple stock in 1995. Youngelman emphasized that a $1,000 investment in Apple in 1995 would now be worth $63 million, implying that Bitcoin may offer a comparable trajectory over the coming decades. XRP’s Millionaire Potential Coach JV also underscored XRP’s potential as a wealth-building asset. He believes XRP is positioned to benefit from the same wave of financial transformation that is propelling Bitcoin. The analyst argued that as Bitcoin rises, XRP could follow, especially as regulatory clarity around XRP continues to improve. Support for this view comes from other notable voices in the crypto space. Edo Farina predicted that XRP could increase by over 4,000% to reach $100 if Bitcoin reaches the $500,000 mark. Under this scenario, an investment of 10,000 XRP tokens, valued around $20,000 today, could grow into a $1 million portfolio. In addition, BarriC, another market analyst, suggested that XRP could trade between $500 and $1,000 by the 2030s, depending on the broader crypto market’s growth. While these figures are speculative, they reflect the growing optimism about XRP’s potential to create substantial wealth for long-term holders. Coach JV’s analysis, supported by numerous voices in the financial and political space, presents a compelling case that Bitcoin and XRP could generate significant wealth in the years ahead. His perspective emphasizes that, despite their past gains, both assets may still be in the early stages of global adoption. As institutional interest, supply dynamics, and regulatory policies align in favor of crypto, the road to millionaire status may remain open to those who position themselves accordingly.

Now that it’s back, is it signaling latent momentum. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal Institutional investors are still buying the dip Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price has eased slightly since reaching a peak of $111,970 on May 22, pulling back to around $103,300 as of June 6, a decline of approx 8%. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Despite the drop, institutional appetite appears to remain intact. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded around $5.24 billion in net inflows during May, suggesting that investor interest has not diminished with the slowdown in price momentum. Meanwhile, sentiment indicators are showing a neutral picture. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 46, placing the market in the “Neutral” zone and waiting for further triggers. Amid this, on-chain analyst CryptoCon has highlighted a rare but historically consistent pattern known as the “Bitcoin Super Signal.” The signal is triggered when trading volumes fall to extremely low levels while prices remain in a broader uptrend. A new Bitcoin Super Signal has appeared, which happens when volume reaches extremely low levels inside a bull market. This is the lowest volume reading since 2014. The other super signal this cycle gave us a 200% run from October 2023 to March 2024. Before that, only two other… pic.twitter.com/Zkd4rzDaTi — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 4, 2025 Based on CryptoCon’s data, current trading volume is at its lowest level since 2014. Only three previous instances have met the same criteria. Each one was followed by a significant bull run. So far, there is no clear evidence that the current cycle has reached a peak. Bitcoin continues to trade within bullish territory, while volume continues to decline. Historically, this combination has preceded sharp upward moves, even if the market appears quiet on the surface. To make sense of what this signal could mean now, we need to look at its previous appearances, how each one played out, and why it tends to emerge when market conditions appear deceptively calm. Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal In Bitcoin’s chart history, sharp rallies often emerge after extended periods of low activity. The Volume Oscillator Super Signal is one of the few indicators that captures this pattern by using volume, rather than price, as the leading input. It highlights moments when trading activity drops to historically low levels while the broader trend remains upward. Only four such signals have appeared: December 2012, October 2016, September 2023, and most recently, June 2025. The indicator works by applying a volume oscillator to Bitcoin’s monthly chart. When volume dips below a defined threshold during a bull trend, it signals a shift in market structure. Most sellers have likely exited, and buyers may be accumulating with minimal resistance. From a liquidity perspective, this implies reduced supply pressure. As a result, even moderate demand can push prices higher once market momentum returns. In 2012, the signal appeared when Bitcoin was trading below $15. Over the following year, the price surged more than 10,600%, forming the 2013 bull cycle that brought Bitcoin into mainstream attention. The next instance came in October 2016, when Bitcoin stood near $700. The cycle that followed peaked around $20,000 in late 2017, marking a 3,461% increase from the signal to the cycle top. In both cases, the signal emerged during low-volume periods, not at moments of retail frenzy. Price was climbing steadily, but broader interest had not yet returned. The same pattern repeated in September 2023. Bitcoin was trading around $25,000, volume dropped into the “extreme low” zone, and the market remained cautious due to macro uncertainty. Within six months, Bitcoin reached $75,000, posting a 200% gain. Institutional investors are still buying the dip The latest Super Signal appeared in June 2025, as the Volume Oscillator dropped into its extreme low zone. Current readings show the lowest volume level since 2014, despite Bitcoin still trading above $100,000 and U.S. spot ETFs continuing to record multi-billion dollar inflows. The contrast may seem counterintuitive, but historically, low volume in a bullish setup often signals that sellers have exited and buyers are accumulating quietly. In such conditions, market depth shrinks. Even moderate inflows of capital can move prices significantly due to a lack of sell-side resistance. Chart data supports this pattern through color-coded volume zones. Red boxes, which mark volume blow-offs and often indicate market tops, have consistently appeared at the end of previous bull cycles, including in 2014, 2018, and 2021. None has appeared so far in this cycle. In contrast, blue-circled areas highlight the Super Signals — moments when volume reaches deeply suppressed levels while the trend remains upward. These signals have historically emerged at early or mid-stages of a rally, not at its end. The current chart closes with a question mark near today’s price, suggesting the current move may still be unfolding. It is important to distinguish between Super Signals and standard volume pivots. Not all volume dips lead to strong rallies. Green-circled pivots on the oscillator identify periods of moderately low volume followed by smaller upward moves. Super Signals occur only when volume is at unusually low levels and the broader price structure remains intact. Macroeconomic conditions add further context. The fiscal environment has shifted once again following the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which brought renewed government spending and added concerns about long-term liquidity. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain elevated, and risk assets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a softer global monetary stance. In that backdrop, Bitcoin holds a structurally favorable position. ETF flows continue to provide consistent demand. Sell-side pressure remains limited, and trading volumes are compressed, creating a setup where price can move quickly if fresh capital enters. On-chain behavior reflects a shift back toward accumulation. According to Glassnode, wallets holding between 10 and 100 BTC now show a perfect accumulation score of 1.0, indicating strong, sustained buying activity. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 The same score has been recorded in wallets holding less than 1 BTC, suggesting retail interest is also building. Accumulation during low-volume phases typically reflects optimism. Participants are not rushing in, but they are positioning quietly, waiting for confirmation before larger moves unfold.

Security researchers at ThreatFabric say Crocodilus, a new and sophisticated strain of malware that targets mobile banking apps and crypto wallets on Android phones. “Crocodilus enters the scene not as a simple clone, but as a fully-fledged threat from the outset, equipped with modern techniques such as remote control, black screen overlays, and advanced data harvesting via accessibility logging.” ThreatFabric says Crocodilus is emerging as a major threat since it first detected the malware in March. “Notably, its campaigns are no longer regionally confined; the malware has extended its reach to new geographical areas, underscoring its transition into a truly global threat.” One alarming evolution detected in Crocodilus is its ability to infiltrate the user’s contact list and add itself to it, bypassing fraud detection programs that flag callers not in a user’s contacts. “…Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats. Already observed targeting banks in Spain and Turkey and popular cryptocurrency wallets, Crocodilus is clearly engineered to go after high-value assets. The rise of new threats like Crocodilus shows that basic, signature-based detection methods are no longer enough—especially in the early stages when the malware first starts spreading. To stay protected, financial institutions should adopt a layered security approach that includes thorough device and behaviour-based risk analysis on their customers’ devices.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-06T07:00:54,"Trump-Backed World Liberty Foundation Sends Cease-and-Desist Over $TRUMP Wallet Plans","Key Takeaways: A Trump family-linked entity, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has issued a cease-and-desist to block the launch of a Trump-branded crypto wallet by Fight Fight Fight LLC. The wallet, promoted in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden, was announced without the approval of the Trump Organization or WLFI. Donald Trump Jr. and other family members have publicly disavowed the project and reaffirmed support for WLFI’s forthcoming official crypto product. Tensions are rising inside Donald Trump’s growing crypto orbit as a Trump family-backed organization moves to block a crypto wallet launch tied to the former president’s name. According to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a company linked to the Trump family, has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC. The letter challenges the firm’s plans to launch a Trump-branded crypto wallet in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden. Fight Fight Fight is the same company that helped launch the $TRUMP memecoin earlier this year. The firm is led by Bill Zanker, a longtime friend and promoter of Donald Trump. Zanker’s company also owns the website GetTrumpMemes.com, which promotes the TRUMP token. Trump Family Disavows $TRUMP Wallet Project as Legal Battle Erupts Over Crypto Branding The cease-and-desist comes after Fight Fight Fight and Magic Eden opened a waitlist for the Trump-branded wallet earlier this week. The project appeared to move forward without involvement from the Trump Organization or approval from WLFI.

That account has since been deleted. A cease-and-desist was also sent to Magic Eden , according to the Bloomberg report. Magic Eden’s Trump wallet launch sparks backlash as the Trump family denies ties and warns against unauthorized branding. #TrumpWallet #MagicEden https://t.co/aYRjHDwUzB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Other members of the Trump family, including Eric and Barron Trump, also posted messages distancing themselves from the wallet project and reaffirming support for WLFI’s version. The dispute indicates deepening divisions within Trump’s expanding digital asset efforts. While WLFI is directly linked to the Trump family, Fight Fight Fight maintains control of the memecoin that bears his name. Despite the pushback, the TRUMP token has seen massive financial success. According to Chainalysis, the project has generated over $300 million in fees for its owners. Fight Fight Fight reportedly shares 80% of the token’s supply with CIC Digital LLC, another Trump-affiliated group. Zanker’s company takes its name from Trump’s “Fight, fight, fight” slogan, coined after his first assassination attempt. But now, it finds itself at odds with Trump’s own inner circle. The cease-and-desist letters add legal weight to an increasingly public split over who controls the Trump brand in crypto and how far each side is willing to go to claim it. $TRUMP Token Tanks $130M as Cease-and-Desist Sparks Market Chaos Minutes after the World Liberty Foundation issued a cease-and-desist to the creators of the Trump Wallet, the meme coin $TRUMP lost over $130 million in market cap. The token dropped 11% in 24 hours and is now trading at $9.61, with a total market cap of $1.92 billion, according to Coingecko. Trading volume, however, surged 129% to over $713 million, reflecting a sudden spike in activity following the news.

Together, the two firms reportedly hold a majority of the $TRUMP supply. Bill Zanker, who helped launch the TRUMP memecoin and several Trump-branded NFT collections, is listed in documents for Fight Fight Fight LLC and also holds a large stake in TRUMP tokens through CIC Digital. He’s currently working on a crypto-themed, Monopoly-style game. This isn’t the first time Trump-linked crypto ventures have stirred confusion.

2025-06-06T07:00:21,"CME CEO Questions Cryptocurrency Use Case, Champions Stablecoin Potential","BitcoinWorld CME CEO Questions Cryptocurrency Use Case, Champions Stablecoin Potential In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, opinions from leaders in traditional finance carry significant weight. Terry Duffy, the influential CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), recently shared his perspective, offering a cautious view on the broader cryptocurrency space while highlighting a specific area he believes holds substantial promise: stablecoins. CME CEO’s View on Cryptocurrency Use Case Terry Duffy, at the helm of one of the world’s largest derivatives marketplaces, is no stranger to innovation in financial markets. However, when it comes to the general utility of cryptocurrencies beyond speculation, Duffy expressed reservations in a recent interview reported by BlockBeats. He stated that the ultimate use case for crypto has not yet been definitively established or confirmed. This perspective from a major player in traditional finance is noteworthy. While many proponents champion cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for various applications – from digital gold and decentralized finance (DeFi) to smart contracts and NFTs – Duffy’s comment suggests that from a traditional market infrastructure standpoint, a clear, widespread, and enduring practical application for many cryptocurrencies remains elusive or unproven on a large scale. What might contribute to this perceived lack of clarity regarding the ultimate Cryptocurrency Use Case ? Several factors could be at play: Volatility: The significant price swings inherent in many cryptocurrencies make them challenging for everyday transactions or as a stable store of value for many traditional businesses and consumers. Scalability Issues: Some blockchain networks face limitations in processing high volumes of transactions quickly and cheaply, hindering widespread adoption for payments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations creates a hesitant environment for large institutions and businesses to fully commit to integrating cryptocurrencies. Complexity: For the average person, understanding and securely using cryptocurrencies can be complex compared to traditional financial systems. Identifying Stablecoin Potential While expressing caution about the general cryptocurrency landscape, Duffy drew a clear distinction when discussing stablecoins. Specifically, he pointed to U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins as having significant Stablecoin Potential . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or sometimes to commodities or algorithms. Duffy believes these digital assets can play a crucial role in reducing friction within the existing financial system. What kind of friction are we talking about? Think about the inefficiencies, delays, and costs associated with traditional cross-border payments, interbank transfers, or even certain types of domestic transactions. Stablecoins, leveraging blockchain technology, offer the possibility of: Faster settlement times, potentially near-instantaneous. Lower transaction fees, especially for international transfers. Increased transparency on a distributed ledger. 24/7 availability, unlike traditional banking hours. This potential to streamline financial processes is where Duffy sees a clear and valuable application for digital assets, particularly those designed for price stability. Why Banks and Stablecoins Are a Natural Fit? Perhaps one of the most forward-looking comments from the CME CEO was his assertion that banks should possess the capability to issue stablecoins. This aligns with a growing trend where traditional financial institutions are exploring or developing their own digital currency initiatives, often referred to as institutional stablecoins or wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The idea of Banks and Stablecoins coexisting or with banks issuing them directly makes sense from several perspectives: Leveraging Existing Infrastructure & Trust: Banks already have the infrastructure, regulatory compliance frameworks, and customer trust necessary to issue and manage financial instruments reliably. Efficiency Gains: Banks could use stablecoins for more efficient interbank settlements, clearing, and potentially even retail payments, reducing operational costs and risks associated with legacy systems. Staying Relevant: As the financial world explores tokenization and digital assets, issuing stablecoins allows banks to remain central players in the evolving Digital Assets Future rather than being bypassed by new entrants. Enhanced Services: Banks could offer new services built on stablecoin rails, such as programmable payments or instant payroll. While the concept is compelling, the path for banks to widely issue stablecoins involves navigating complex regulatory hurdles, technological integration challenges, and ensuring interoperability with existing financial systems. The Broader Implications for the Digital Assets Future Terry Duffy’s comments underscore a key debate within the financial world: the distinction between speculative digital assets and utility-focused digital currencies. His view, coming from a leader in traditional derivatives markets which have listed Bitcoin and Ether futures, suggests that while there’s institutional interest in providing exposure to crypto volatility, the focus for practical, systemic integration might lean towards stable, regulated digital currencies. The emphasis on Stablecoin Potential and the role of Banks and Stablecoins highlights a potential path for digital assets to become more deeply embedded in mainstream finance. This isn’t necessarily about replacing fiat currency but creating a more efficient digital layer on top of it, facilitated by trusted financial institutions. What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are an investor, a business owner, or simply interested in the future of money, these insights offer valuable perspective: For Investors: Understand the difference between volatile cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Duffy’s comments suggest that the long-term value proposition for different types of digital assets might vary significantly, influenced by their practical application and regulatory treatment. For Businesses: Explore how stablecoins could potentially improve payment processing, supply chain finance, or treasury management efficiency in the future, especially as banks become more involved. For Policymakers & Regulators: Duffy’s call for banks to issue stablecoins implicitly advocates for a regulatory framework that allows and governs such activities, ensuring stability and consumer protection. Conclusion: A Pragmatic View on Digital Assets Terry Duffy’s perspective from the CME offers a pragmatic, institution-focused view on the digital asset space. While acknowledging that the ultimate, widespread Cryptocurrency Use Case for many digital assets remains under development or unclear from his vantage point, he clearly identifies significant Stablecoin Potential . His vision of Banks and Stablecoins working together, with banks issuing these digital currencies, points towards a future where regulated, stable digital assets play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the existing financial system. This focus on practical application and integration within established frameworks provides a compelling insight into how traditional finance leaders view the evolving Digital Assets Future .

2025-06-06T07:00:21,"SUI Rally At Risk? Analysts Warn Of 30% Dip If This Level Doesn’t Hold","SUI, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, has recorded an impressive price recovery over the past two months. However, as the cryptocurrency fails to hold some key levels, some analysts warn of a potential drop below the $3.00 support. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes 15% Move Amid Key Resistance Retest – Breakout Or Rejection Next? SUI Rally Risks Massive Price Drop Since hitting its four-month high of $4.29, SUI’s price has been moving sideways, hovering between $3.40-$4.00 throughout most of May. Amid last week’s market retrace, the altcoin recorded a 14.2% price drop, losing its range and hitting the $3.00 support over the weekend. At the start of this week, SUI saw a mild recovery alongside the rest of the market, surging to the $3.20 area. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has failed to hold this level over the past 24 hours and dropped to the $3.10-$3.15 area on Thursday morning. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt warned that the cryptocurrency’s rally could be in danger as it risks breaking down of a descending triangle pattern. Per the post, the altcoin has been trading within this formation for the past month, also displaying a potential Head & Shoulders setup forming inside of the triangle, and the pattern’s baseline sitting around the $3.10 support. To the analyst, “if it breaks out of this triangle to the downside, then the fall can be very hard,” forecasting a nearly 35% retrace toward the $2.00 mark. On the contrary, a breakout to the upside could propel SUI’s price toward the $4.20 resistance. Analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a “humongous” rising wedge pattern in the cryptocurrency’s chart, which eyes the $8-$10 area as the next major target. According to the chart, SUI has been moving within this pattern since early 2024, hovering between the upper and lower boundaries for over a year. Notably, the cryptocurrency hit the support trendline one more time during the April low, bouncing from this level. Based on this, the analyst considers that the current dip could be “the last opportunity to add to your bags before SUI makes a new ATH.” Can It Repeat Its Late 2024 Playbook? Analyst Rekt Capital noted that SUI was positioned for a bullish Monthly Candle Close in May, aiming to replicate its late 2024 performance. Last year, the cryptocurrency retested the $3.39 level and turned it into support, which acted as a springboard toward its January 2025 all-time high (ATH) of $5.35. This time, May closed below this crucial level, failing to confirm it as support and losing the recent price range. SUI is now “showcasing very early signs of upside wicking into said level to turn it into new resistance.” The analyst warned that June could see the cryptocurrency reject from this level “if things don’t change over the course of this month.” SUI is currently located inside the $2.33-$3.39 price range and is trying to position itself for a reclaim of the Range High to facilitate a breakout. However, it has unsuccessfully attempted to surge to that level, which could send the price toward lower levels if it “continues to float here without covering additional ground.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To Face ‘One Last Speed Bump’ Before Rally To $140,000 – Analyst Therefore, SUI risks dropping 10% toward the $2.81 mid-range area, which acted as support and weak resistance earlier this year, and falling 30% to the $2.33 range low if the previous level doesn’t hold. “If SUI fails to show signs of reclaiming $3.39 as support (at least on the Daily timeframe via Daily Closes above $3.39), then sub-$3 regions could be on the cards,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.08, a 2.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-06T07:00:04,"A New Era For Circle: CEO Jeremy Allaire Celebrates Historic IPO","Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, made a highly anticipated entrance onto the public market on Thursday, with its stock (CRCL) skyrocketing as much as 200% during trading. The shares opened at approximately $69 and closed at $83.23, marking a remarkable 168% increase from the initial public offering (IPO) price of $31. The volatility was so pronounced that trading was halted multiple times throughout the day. Circle’s Market Cap Surpasses $16 Billion Following Stellar Debut By the end of the session, Circle’s market capitalization exceeded $16 billion, positioning the company as a major player in the cryptocurrency sector. The surge in stock value comes as Circle continues to assert itself as the second-largest stablecoin issuer, trailing only Tether, which boasts around $150 billion in circulation. Circle’s success is underpinned by its USDC stablecoin, which is dollar-backed and had approximately $60 billion in circulation at the end of the first quarter. The company reported a substantial revenue increase, totaling $578.6 million in the first three months of the year—a 58.5% rise compared to the previous year. Much of its revenue stems from “reserve income,” which includes earnings on cash held in banks or invested in Treasury bills . Additionally, Circle reported an adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization (EBITA) of $122.4 million for the same quarter. CEO Hails Transformation Amid Cryptocurrency Revival The company previously attempted to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021 but ultimately abandoned those plans a year later. Now, with the cryptocurrency markets experiencing a revitalization—partly fueled by the political landscape and rising Bitcoin prices—Circle’s IPO has arrived at a propitious time. CEO Jeremy Allaire celebrated the company’s milestone on social media, expressing pride in Circle’s transformation into a public entity. “Twelve years ago, we set out to build a company that could help remake the global economic system,” he stated, emphasizing the mission to enhance global prosperity through seamless value exchange. Allaire also highlighted the commitment to transparency, compliance, and governance, which align with the high standards set by the New York Stock Exchange and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Allaire concluded by stating: To every single person, project and firm who’s been part of this journey, thank you. I am humbled and deeply grateful. This is not only a moment for each of us personally, I believe it’s a significant moment in the future development of our global economic system as it inexorably synthesizes with the internet. Despite Circle’s success, which is also a milestone for the broader cryptocurrency market, the digital asset market capitalization fell from $3.30 trillion to $3.12 trillion on Thursday. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), saw declines of 3% and 7% respectively, showcasing the current state of the market after a major uptrend over the past two weeks.

2025-06-06T06:53:21,"James Wynn: How A High-Risk Trader Lost His $100 Million Fortune","The post James Wynn: How A High-Risk Trader Lost His $100 Million Fortune appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News James Wynn, a high-risk trader, has taken the crypto world by storm: from turning a few million dollars into a $100 million Bitcoin fortune in just a month, to losing it all in a single week. His wild ride in the world of perpetual contracts (perps) and his confessions about how he handled that success have left many stunned and curious. Let’s dive in and see what happened behind the scenes of James Wynn’s rollercoaster journey. From Meme Coins to Millions In a recent tweet post, James Wynn said that he wasn’t always trading big. Before diving into Bitcoin perps, he was better known for calling out meme coins, where he made headlines by calling out Pepe Coin when it was worth only $600,000. His bet on Pepe turned into a huge success story, earning him an impressive eight-figure profit. This early win gave him confidence and a reputation as a risk-taker in the crypto community. I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in-fact never really traded properly before, I’ve just traded meme coins. (Before I was known for calling pepe at 600k and making 8 figures). In one month I turned about $3m into $100m and then lost it all in… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 6, 2025 In March, James took his trading game up a notch, shifting from meme coins to Bitcoin perpetuals. Surprisingly, in just one month, he turned a starting balance of around $3 million into a jaw-dropping $100 million . His success was widely visible thanks to blockchain tracking, and he quickly gathered hundreds of thousands of followers eager to watch his next move. When Hype Becomes a Trap As James Wynn’s fame grew, so did the pressure. He felt he had to prove himself after turning $3 million into $100 million. But instead of careful trading, he started gambling, trying to get back the money he lost. He didn’t see the huge numbers on the screen as real money anymore. On May 19, Wynn made a risky Bitcoin trade using 40x leverage, starting with 5,520 BTC. He later added more Bitcoin, ending up with over 9,300 BTC, worth over $1 billion. At one point, he was up by $10 million. But when the U.S. tariff news hit, prices dropped fast. Wynn lost $60 million in one day. Even though he still had $25 million from earlier, in just a week, all his $100 million gains were gone, lost on the HyperLiquid platform. Warning and a Wink Despite the pain of losing so much, Wynn hasn’t lost his sense of humor. He even joked about using his affiliate link for those still wanting to trade, but his story is a reminder of the risks and rewards that come with high-stakes trading.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-wynn-how-a-high-risk-trader-lost-his-100-million-fortune/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T06:52:14,"Why is Crypto Market Crashing Today?","The post Why is Crypto Market Crashing Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is crashing today as Elon Musk and President Donald Trump’s clash has taken a hard hit on the market. Tesla dropped 15%, Bitcoin keeps sliding, and altcoins are also dropping fast. The crypto market cap is down 4.8% in the last 24 hours and the U.S. stocks also dipped slightly amidst the chaos. Cryptocurrencies Take Big Hit Bitcoin was down over 4% to $100,500 earlier today, and is close to dropping below $100K for the first time in a month. It is currently trading at $102,995. Other coins like Solana and SUI took big hits, falling more than 7%. Ethereum dropped 7.25%, XRP was down 4.35%, and Solana lost 5.2%. However, they have slightly recovered at the time of writing. The TRUMP meme coin crashed 9.3% during the Musk-Trump fight. Crypto stocks like Coinbase also fell 4.6%, MicroStrategy dropped 2.4%, and miners like MARA, Riot, and Core Scientific also fell about 5%. $1 Billion in Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in 24 hours, mostly from long bets. Bitcoin alone saw $341M in daily liquidations, while Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $278M outflows as institutions pulled back. Data from Glassnode showed that many long-term Bitcoin holders started selling after BTC hit a record $111,970 in May, raising the chances of a short-term price drop. ETH futures also saw a 5.5% drop in open interest and $260M in long liquidations. The sudden sell-off shows investors are getting worried as bigger economic risks and U.S. politics shake the crypto market. Reports hint that the White House is even holding emergency talks to see how this might affect the economy. Politics Getting in the Way? With good news around rate cuts and rising institutional buys, politics is clouding the market mood. Bitcoin is hanging tough around $100K, but if long liquidations continue, it could drop to around $95,000–$98,000 before finding solid support. However, traders are confident that Bitcoin will hit $120,000 by the year-end. The strong corporate buying and low volatility have kept the optimism high, with a 69% chance on the Polymarket betting platform. Corporate investors now hold nearly 810,000 BTC worth $85 billion, almost double from last year. So, experts expect Bitcoin’s momentum to stay strong.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-crypto-market-crashing-today/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|SOL","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare
