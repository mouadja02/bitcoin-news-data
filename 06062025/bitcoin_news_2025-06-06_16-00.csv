2025-06-06T13:33:32,"Trump Wallet Project Halted After Cease-and-Desist Letter","A wallet project was promoted by Magic Eden and Trump-themed meme coin creators, but it very quickly drew sharp backlash from Trump’s inner circle. Donald Trump Jr. publicly denied any connection and teased an official Trump-backed crypto wallet. The controversy happened amid the increasing political tension over Trump’s crypto involvement. During a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Representative Maxine Waters warned that Trump’s digital asset ventures could undermine investor protections and exploit proposed legislation like the CLARITY Act. At the same time, the president’s recent meme coin fundraiser dinner raised $148 million, which further blurred lines between politics and crypto. Meanwhile, Trump’s feud with Elon Musk caused wider market jitters, and triggered $278 million in outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spat also flipped market sentiment from “Greed” to “Fear.” WLFI Issues Cease-and-Desist Over Trump Wallet World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto platform backed by US President Donald Trump and his family, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the creators of the TRUMP meme coin and operators of Gettrumpmemes.com. The legal action started after the announcement of a new Trump-branded crypto wallet, which WLFI claims was developed without the Trump Organization’s involvement. Magic Eden and the meme coin team recently promoted a waitlist for the wallet, which attracted immediate backlash from Trump’s inner circle. Donald Trump Jr., who serves as WLFI’s “Web3 ambassador,” publicly denied any affiliation with the wallet project and teased the official launch of a Trump-approved wallet in the near future. According to Bloomberg, the cease-and-desist notice is not yet publicly available, but sources familiar with the matter confirmed its existence. Despite the legal warning, the original promotional posts on X from Magic Eden and Gettrumpmemes are still live. However, the associated website, TrumpWallet.com, has gone offline. WLFI raised over $550 million through token sales as of March, and is already under scrutiny for its USD1 stablecoin. The token made headlines in May when an Abu Dhabi-based firm revealed plans to use USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance . The Trump family holds equity in WLFI and benefits financially through a company linked to the president that collects transaction fees. The political ramifications of Trump’s crypto ventures are intensifying. Some Democratic lawmakers accused the president of using his office to enrich himself through his digital asset businesses. These allegations could complicate efforts to pass key legislation in Congress, including bills that would regulate payment stablecoins and establish a market structure for digital assets. Lawmakers Clash Over Trump and Crypto Rules Lawmakers in the US House Financial Services Committee seem increasingly divided over how to regulate digital assets, and this could be due to the fact that President Donald Trump’s crypto affiliations are casting a shadow over bipartisan efforts. During a June 4 hearing , Representative Maxine Waters voiced her sharp concerns over Trump’s involvement in the crypto industry, and warned that the proposed Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act could be exploited by the president to further his financial interests. Waters pointed to Trump’s recent dinner with top meme coin holders, and warned that the bill could allow him to funnel Americans’ funds into his own digital wallet. The dinner itself attracted $148 million in contributions. By describing the CLARITY Act as rushed and dangerously permissive, Waters criticized its lack of protections for investors and absence of penalties for bad actors. The bill was introduced on May 29 with Republican support and three Democratic co-sponsors. Its main goal is to define clear jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, but it also ignited partisan debate over its implications. Waters and other Democrats called for a closer examination of Trump’s crypto ties, particularly those connected to his family-backed platform, World Liberty Financial. On the other hand, Committee Chair French Hill defended the bill’s intent by arguing that the current lack of federal oversight for digital assets is stifling innovation and creating confusion for investors. Still, none of the expert witnesses—including former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, former SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman, and Uniswap Labs' legal chief Katherine Minarik—touched on Trump’s involvement in their opening remarks. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, however, directly addressed the issue by saying Trump’s crypto dealings cast a “taint” on the entire industry and pose national security concerns. He questioned whether the president’s actions were aligned with national interests or personal gain. Waters’ bill Waters already introduced a separate bill aiming to bar the president, vice president, and members of Congress from participating in crypto ventures. That legislation came on the same day as Trump’s meme coin dinner, during which the president spoke from a podium bearing the presidential seal—despite claims it was a personal event. Overall, as both the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act continue to move through Congress, Democrats are still very hesitant to support any bill that fails to address the growing concerns over Trump’s influence on the digital asset space. Trump-Musk Feud Triggers Bitcoin ETF Outflows Just how much influence Trump and his actions have on the crypto market is becoming more and more clear. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States experienced a sharp downturn as market sentiment soured after a very public fallout between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) After briefly recovering on June 3 and 4, US spot Bitcoin ETFs suffered outflows totaling $278 million on June 5. This is according to data from Farside Investors . The shift coincided with the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index flipping from “Greed” to “Fear” on June 6, which proves that there is growing investor anxiety over the high-profile feud. The falling sentiment extended beyond the crypto market, with Tesla shares dropping 14% and Trump Media shares falling 8%. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) Bitcoin ETFs were under some pressure after cumulative outflows of $1.2 billion from May 29 to June 2, despite the short-lived recovery earlier in the week. On June 5, no US Bitcoin ETF recorded inflows, with ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF leading the outflows at $102 million. Globally, Bitcoin exchange-traded products saw $8 million in outflows over the past week. In contrast, Ether ETFs continued to show resilience. On June 5, US spot Ether ETFs brought in $11.3 million in inflows, extending a 14-day streak. Although, this was still a sharp decline from the previous two days, which saw inflows of $56.9 million and $109.4 million, respectively. Ethereum ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) Ether ETPs have drawn investor interest thanks to improving Ethereum network fundamentals and strength in ETH futures markets.

2025-06-06T13:33:23,"FCA may allow crypto ETNs for retail traders under new proposal","Retail investors may soon be able to buy crypto ETNs, as the country’s top financial regulator weighs investor protections with innovation. UK regulators are taking steps to boost growth in the country’s crypto industry. On Friday, June 6, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority proposed lifting a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes for retail customers. However, these notes will have to be issued by FCA-approved exchanges. You might also like: UK’s Farage push Trump-like crypto policy to make Britain a ‘crypto powerhouse’ David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, explained that the agency wants to promote the UK crypto industry while also ensuring investor protections. “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry. We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money,” David Geale, FCA. To balance risks, the rules on financial promotion will still apply. This means that institutions will have to provide investors with information about the risks involved with these assets. The FCA also explained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain in place. UK’s FCA moves to clarify rules on crypto The latest lift on the ETN trading ban for retail traders is part of a broader push to balance investor protection with innovation. On May 2, the FCA proposed banning retail investors from buying crypto assets with debt. Due to the volatility of crypto assets, debt-financed buying could expose investors to significant financial risk, the regulator argued. Unlike crypto exchange-traded funds, which are backed by the underlying asset, ETNs are unsecured debt notes tied to a specific index. This means they are higher-risk assets than ETFs, as they also expose traders to counterparty risk related to the issuer’s solvency.

Here Are the Details","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced a significant capital raise of ¥770.9 billion ($5.4 billion) that aims to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings and is a bold step in Japan’s growing institutional adoption of digital assets. Metaplanet Launches Historic ¥770.9 Billion Bitcoin-Focused Stock Market Rally, Targets 1% of Total BTC Supply by 2027 The capital will be raised through the issuance of 555 million shares through rolling strike warrants, a financial instrument rarely seen in the Japanese market. Notably, Metaplanet became the first company in Japan to issue such warrants at a higher premium than the current market price, signaling strong confidence in its long-term Bitcoin strategy. This ambitious increase is also in line with Metaplanet’s newly announced goals: to acquire 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. If these goals are met, the company will be able to control 1% of Bitcoin’s total final supply, capped at 21 million coins. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin purchasing plan follows a growing global trend for public companies to add digital assets to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation and to diversify reserves. Metaplanet’s move also positions Japan more prominently on the global Bitcoin investment map amid growing institutional interest in digital assets in Asia. Further details regarding the warrant structure and acquisition roadmap are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. *This is not investment advice.

Investors, however, should be wary, as tokens of this type are highly volatile and offer no real utility. The Winner Following the Conflict US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who were quite close during the former’s presidential campaign and even after his return to the White House, clashed in recent days. The feud escalated into a public exchange of sharp insults and accusations, and it seems to have erupted over disagreements concerning Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill. “ The legislative proposal introduced by the president aims to implement significant changes across various sectors, including tax policy, healthcare, and national security. Musk, though, described it as a “disgusting abomination “ and claimed it would harm America’s financial stability. The conflict between the two men had a negative impact on the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly plunging below $101,000 while Ethereum (ETH) lost the support level of $2,500. As it usually happens, though, some crypto enthusiasts took advantage of the chaos and launched a meme coin called KILL BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL (KBBB) on the Solana-based platform pump .fun . The asset’s logo resembles a satirical image of Elon Musk dressed in a yellow tracksuit and holding a sword in his right hand. KBBB’s price defied the ongoing market trend, experiencing a staggering 370% rally over a 24-hour period , while its market capitalization surged above $45 million. KBBB Price, Source: CoinGecko On the contrary, meme coins related to the American president, including Official Trump (TRUMP), Super Trump (STRUMP), MAGA (TRUMP), and others, have headed south following the confrontation. Beware of Such Tokens While KBBB’s price surge is undoubtedly impressive, investors looking to engage with it (or with similar meme coins) should keep several key points in mind. These tokens typically have no real utility or use cases and are driven purely by hype. They’re notorious for their enhanced volatility, and it wouldn’t be surprising if KBBB’s valuation drops sharply following the next twist in the Trump-Musk saga or when speculators lose interest when a new one emerges. There’s a golden rule of investing: always conduct thorough research before diving in, and invest only what you’re prepared to lose.

2025-06-06T13:29:43,"New Crypto Presale Bitcoin Hyper Goes Viral, Hits $500k Milestone - Next 100x Crypto?","The 2023 - 2025 crypto bull run will be remembered for Bitcoin’s outperformance. BTC continues to be at the top of every best-crypto-to-buy list, with many analysts anticipating it to peak between $150k and $200k. Among the altcoins, those showing the strongest correlation with Bitcoin, have largely outperformed others, further confirming BTC’s “king” status within the crypto market. Now, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , a new BTC-themed meme coin - with cutting-edge Layer-2 utility - is creating significant speculative frenzy in its presale, having already raised over $500k in short order. Crypto influencers and prominent analysts are already taking note, with many viewing it as the next 100x crypto. Bitcoin Hyper’s Value Proposition – Why This New BTC Layer-2 Is Going Viral? Bitcoin has already established itself as an excellent store of value, as well as one of the top-performing investments in the global financial markets. However, it is still far from realizing one of Satoshi Nakamoto ’s core visions - a viable electronic cash system. Take, for instance, the historic moment when Donald Trump became the first US President to do a Bitcoin transaction in September last year. Trump used the Strike app to settle his tab at the PubKey bar in New York, which works on the Lightning Protocol, the top BTC Layer-2 scaling solution. And yet, the moment was awkward as a few-dollar transaction took 45 seconds to settle. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump tried paying with #Bitcoin at a New York bar, and the transaction still hasn't settled yet due to massive liquidity issues.It took over 45 seconds for them to awkwardly smile and pretend the transaction was settled. Bitcoin is not fast or cost-effective pic.twitter.com/8KDcqdH3uP — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 18, 2024 Thankfully, the US President did not attempt to complete the transaction through Bitcoin’s mainnet. As per Blockchain.com , the average confirmation time for a BTC transaction was ~914 minutes on 18th September, or 15 hours and 14 minutes. Today, on 5th June, the Bitcoin mainnet appears to be working optimally and therefore, has an average confirmation time of 21 minutes. There is an evident demand for additional cutting-edge Layer-2 solutions, which explains why Bitcoin Hyper is seeing a warm reception in the first few days of its presale. As per the project’s whitepaper , “Bitcoin Hyper is designed to break through Bitcoin’s core limitations: slow transactions, high fees, and the lack of programmability.” It’s no surprise that the HYPER presale is attracting strong early demand. If the Bitcoin Hyper project delivers on its mission, it could emerge as the next billion-dollar crypto asset, much like other top-performing Layer-2 coins. Under The Hood: Bitcoin Hyper’s Cutting-Edge Technology Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring the performance and scalability of modern blockchains to the Bitcoin ecosystem, without compromising its decentralized nature or cryptographic security. In this regard, it is integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to its Layer-2 scaling solution, the same core engine which has made Solana one of the most popular blockchains on the market. As per the whitepaper, “By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper enables lightning-fast, low-latency execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications. This brings the performance and developer experience of Solana to the Bitcoin ecosystem—something previously impossible on native Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, like most stable and secure Layer-2s, it uses the Bitcoin mainnet for transaction settlement and security. The developer team is creating a Canonical Bridge - a non-custodial bridge that is tasked to manage Bitcoin Hyper’s interaction with the mainnet. Users lock their BTC via the bridge, receiving equivalent tokens on the Layer 2 network. These tokens can then be utilized across the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem and are redeemable back into native BTC whenever desired. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Relay Program, an SVM smart contract, verifies BTC block headers and transaction proofs. It aggregates and compresses transactions on Layer 2, using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to verify their validity. The Layer 2 state is regularly published to Bitcoin’s main chain, ensuring both security and alignment with Layer 1. Thanks to this hybrid approach, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast wrapped BTC payments, DeFi functionalities (swaps, lending, staking), NFT and gaming dApps, and supports Rust-based smart contracts via SDK and API. It also offers web and mobile access through an intuitive dashboard and wallet integrations. Is HYPER The Next 100x Crypto? There is a strong demand for BTC-correlated altcoins, as these tend to outperform others during a bull run. Considering that HYPER is new and has a small market cap, it could deliver outsized returns following its launch. Unsurprisingly, analysts and crypto influencers like Yellow Trader are beginning to take notice and are viewing it as one of the best new products on the market. Others are calling it the next 100x crypto as well. Besides the project’s Layer-2 scaling solution, HYPER has excellent fundamentals, which include community-centric tokenomics, transparent smart contract audits , and full issuer address and contact information. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper whitepaper for more information. Meanwhile, early HYPER buyers can also earn passive income through the project’s staking protocol, which is currently offering a reward rate of over 1300% per annum. However, the staking rewards are designed to decrease as more tokens are staked into the pool. In addition, the HYPE price itself will increase after the completion of each presale stage, both mechanisms designed to reward early buyers. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in its early presale stages and is likely available at a bargain. However, its strong demand means that the stages will sell out rather quickly, with sidelined investors leaving considerable money on the table. Interested buyers can visit the project’s presale and buy HYPE with just a few clicks using the OTC widget, either through a bank card or by swapping cryptos. Investors can also connect to the project’s X and Telegram accounts for more info. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-06T13:27:18,"Musk dragging Trump into the Epstein files has nothing to do with the crypto market — and everything to do with it","Are the Epstein files now a market variable, and if so, does that help answer why crypto is down when no macro trigger seems obvious? Table of Contents Elon Musk vs Trump saga turns ugly Elon Musk Epstein accusation dragged the feud into dangerous territory Why is crypto down right after Musk’s Epstein files remark? Crypto market prepares for uncertainty Elon Musk vs Trump saga turns ugly Tensions between tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated into a public and increasingly personal dispute with clear political and financial dimensions. Musk, who briefly served in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has emerged as a vocal critic of the president’s signature tax and spending package, the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Shortly after resigning from his role, Musk publicly condemned the proposal on X, calling it “a disgusting abomination ” and accusing Republican lawmakers of fiscal dishonesty. In a direct message aimed at supporters of the bill, he wrote, “You know you did wrong. You know it.” Since then, the dispute has turned chaotic. Statements from both sides have grown more pointed, and the widening rift between Musk and Trump is beginning to shape conversations in financial markets, particularly in crypto, where both figures carry notable influence. What are the facts behind this fallout? How are Trump-linked crypto assets reacting? And what can this political rift mean for the digital asset space going forward? Let’s find out. Elon Musk Epstein accusation dragged the feud into dangerous territory On June 5, Musk reignited his criticism of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” by resurfacing an old 2012 tweet from Trump’s now-defunct Twitter account. In the post, Trump had warned about rising U.S. deficits, a stance Musk used to highlight what he sees as a contradiction with the bill’s current spending-heavy approach. I couldn’t agree more! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/sZ6xgisZEA — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Trump responded hours later during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. When asked by reporters, the president defended the bill and accused Musk of changing his stance only after leaving the administration. Trump claimed Musk had been deeply involved in the legislation and voiced no objections while serving in government. “He knew every aspect of this bill, better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left,” Trump said. “He said the most beautiful things about me. He hasn’t said bad things about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.” The president continued, framing Musk’s criticism as part of a recurring pattern. “People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile,” he said. “I don’t know what it is. It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it… They leave and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour’s gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile.” Musk rejected the claims immediately. “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night,” he wrote on X, distancing himself from the bill’s development. False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it! https://t.co/V4ztekqd4g — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 He followed with a sharply worded post: “Without me, Republicans would’ve lost,” shifting the tone from policy disagreement to personal conflict. Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Trump responded with two posts on Truth Social. In the first, he wrote , “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” In the second, he added , “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Musk replied by calling the claims “such an obvious lie” and then escalated the exchange. After some time, Musk accused Trump of appearing in sealed Epstein-related documents and implied that this connection was behind the documents’ delay in public release. Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 He followed by reposting a 1990s video clip showing Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at a social event, signaling a shift in the feud toward more personal and damaging allegations. Trump did not directly respond to the Epstein accusation. Instead, he returned focus to the legislation later in the day. “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever… If this Bill doesn’t pass… 68% Tax Increase… I didn’t create this mess, I’m here to FIX IT,” he wrote on Truth Social. The White House issued a short statement through the press secretary, calling Musk’s remarks “unfortunate” and reaffirming the president’s commitment to passing the bill. Musk continued to press the issue. He announced on X that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately, citing the administration’s threats to cancel government contracts. In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 As the conflict deepened, investor Bill Ackman stepped in with a public appeal. “We need you both on the same side,” he wrote, urging cooperation for the country’s benefit. Musk acknowledged the message. “You’re not wrong,” he replied. I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart. — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) June 5, 2025 When another user suggested both sides cool down, Musk responded, “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon,” pulling back from his earlier statement and signaling a temporary pause in the escalation. Why is crypto down right after Musk’s Epstein files remark? The fallout between Elon Musk and President Trump, intensified by threats of canceled contracts and escalating political retaliation, created immediate uncertainty across financial markets. Investors responded quickly as the tone of the conflict sharpened. The most pronounced impact was seen in the tech sector. Tesla shares fell more than 15% in a single trading session, marking the company’s steepest decline since 2020. The drop reflected growing concern that Musk’s worsening ties with the administration could jeopardize federal support tied to electric vehicle infrastructure, tax credits, or regulatory treatment. That caution spread to crypto markets. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which had been trading above $105,000 on June 5, briefly fell below $101,000 amid the height of the news cycle. As of June 6, BTC had recovered slightly, trading around $103,800. Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum ( ETH ) has dropped by approximately 7%, while Solana ( SOL ) declined by 3%. Ripple ( XRP ) and Binance Coin ( BNB ) posted losses ranging between 2.5% and 3%. However, tokens associated with Trump experienced sharper volatility. The Official Trump ( TRUMP ) token, launched in January as part of the former president’s direct engagement with the crypto space, lost nearly 10% in 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading around $9.80 and ranked among the three worst-performing tokens of the day. Meanwhile, Trump’s family office moved to distance itself from a separate crypto initiative using the Trump name. WLFI’s legal team issued a cease-and-desist letter to a group that had launched a “Trump” wallet on Magic Eden. The wallet, tied to an entity called “Fight Fight Fight,” was accused of unauthorized brand use. Eric Trump posted a public statement clarifying that the family had no affiliation with the wallet project and suggested that their official crypto wallet remained under development. Trump’s presence in the crypto space has been unusually direct for a sitting president. In January, the TRUMP token reached a $9 billion market cap within hours of its launch, temporarily surpassing several meme coins including PEPE. That rally was short-lived. The token has since dropped around 85% from its peak. A similar trajectory followed Melania Trump’s token, Official Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), which saw strong early demand before declining by 96% following a wave of profit-taking and reduced trading activity. Crypto market prepares for uncertainty If the conflict between Musk and Trump continues to escalate, it may start to test real economic boundaries. Both men operate at the intersection of influence and power, one through the U.S. government, the other through high-impact private companies. Any prolonged conflict between them would likely have serious consequences for the economy, public policy, and investor confidence. Trump has already hinted at the possibility of ending federal subsidies and contracts connected to Musk’s businesses. If that materializes, the fallout could be substantial. SpaceX is a central player in the U.S. space strategy, working with both NASA and the Pentagon. Pulling back contracts from SpaceX could slow satellite deployments and delay critical space missions. Similarly, if Tesla’s access to electric vehicle tax credits is revoked, the impact could ripple through clean energy adoption and the broader automotive market. The market reaction to such moves would not be isolated. Tesla is deeply embedded in major equity indices and often moves in sync with broader tech sentiment. Any sharp decline in Tesla’s valuation could weigh heavily on technology stocks, potentially dragging down indexes and exchange-traded funds that have large Tesla exposure. That kind of shift tends to spill into crypto markets as well. Over the past several years, Bitcoin and other digital assets have shown high correlation with tech stocks. When tech leads a sell-off, crypto often follows. There is also the Trump-specific angle. Since early 2025, the president has openly embraced crypto. He has described himself as the “crypto president” and floated ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve and friendlier regulatory policies. Trump’s stance has helped shape retail enthusiasm and provided a layer of political legitimacy to the crypto sector. If political volatility leads to uncertainty around Trump’s policy consistency or long-term position, the market could respond with a fresh wave of risk aversion or sell-offs. For now, the worst-case scenarios remain hypothetical, but the signals are worth watching. If the conflict continues to escalate, the financial system may be forced to absorb not just economic shocks, but the consequences of two powerful players locked in a very public and personal standoff.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/why-is-crypto-down-after-musk-epstein-files-remark/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Feature|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|United States",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T13:25:41,"FCA moves to lift retail ban on crypto ETNs to boost UK market competitiveness","The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed lifting its longstanding ban on retail investors buying exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to cryptocurrencies. The move comes as part of an effort to revitalize Britain’s crypto competitiveness and better align the market with the United States, where crypto ETFs have surged in popularity under the Trump administration. If implemented, the new rules would allow retail investors access to exchange-traded notes (ETNs) backed by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, provided they are listed on FCA-approved exchanges. These products have so far been restricted to professional investors despite being tradable on venues like the London Stock Exchange since last year. US market pressure drives policy shift The FCA’s policy rethink comes as crypto investment products have gained rapid traction in the US. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, introduced there in early 2024, now manage over $130 billion in assets — a figure that dwarfs the combined $16 billion under management by European crypto ETPs. That disparity has intensified pressure on UK regulators to support innovation and prevent the country from falling further behind. Source : Bloomberg “This consultation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the growth and competitiveness of the UK’s crypto industry,” said David Geale, the FCA’s executive director of payments and digital assets. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk and allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them.” The FCA’s ban on retail access to cryptoasset derivatives will remain in place. FCA’s change in stance regarding crypto The proposal represents a notable departure from the regulator’s past messaging. In 2021, the FCA warned retail consumers that investing in cryptocurrencies and related products could lead to total financial loss. “Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money. If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money,” the FCA had said in a dire warning. At the time, the watchdog said such investments were too risky and not protected by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. While those warnings remain valid, the FCA now appears to be signaling a shift toward giving retail investors more autonomy, albeit with full awareness of the risks. Archax @ArchaxEx · Follow FCA to lift ban on crypto ETNsTremendous news today that since we first met with HMT several years ago, the FCA has now announced its intention to lift the ban on offering crypto ETNs to retail investors. Lifting the ban will enable ETNs to be sold to retail clients by FCA 5:52 pm · 6 Jun 2025 17 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Wider regulatory reform underway The proposal is part of a broader effort by the UK government to craft a comprehensive regulatory regime for digital assets. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves has said the country aims to become a “world leader in digital assets” and emphasized that regulation should support innovation rather than hinder it. Draft legislation introduced in April outlines a framework that would bring exchanges, brokers, and crypto service providers into the regulatory fold. The Treasury said the forthcoming rules would crack down on bad actors while offering legitimate firms a clearer path to compliance. The regulator has outlined its crypto roadmap and recently published proposals on stablecoins as well as other aspects of the regime. The FCA’s consultation on lifting the retail ETP ban is expected to conclude later this year, with final rules anticipated in 2025.

2025-06-06T13:23:25,"BTC News Overlooks Revolutionary Mobile Mining: Bitcoin Solaris Offers ‘Bitcoin 2010’ Investment Opportunity","The post BTC News Overlooks Revolutionary Mobile Mining: Bitcoin Solaris Offers ‘Bitcoin 2010’ Investment Opportunity appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2010, Bitcoin could be mined on a laptop by anyone, anywhere. Today? That window feels permanently shut. Expensive mining rigs, massive energy bills, and corporate mining farms have turned the dream into a distant memory—unless you’re paying attention to Bitcoin Solaris. This emerging crypto project is recreating that original magic with a revolutionary mobile-first mining platform that could change everything for the average person. And yet… major BTC headlines remain silent. Bitcoin Dominance Keeps Eyes Elsewhere Bitcoin is still the king, no doubt. Its long-term strength and institutional adoption keep it in the news cycle. But what news outlets rarely talk about is how inaccessible it has become to actually build wealth with BTC unless you’re already holding large bags. Mining it? Out of the question for most. That’s exactly why Bitcoin Solaris is striking such a chord. It doesn’t compete with Bitcoin—it gives you a second chance to live that 2010 experience in a more scalable, accessible, and profitable way. The Core Vision of Bitcoin Solaris Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) aims to merge Bitcoin’s foundational strengths with Solana-grade performance. The architecture is built on a dual-layer structure: Base Layer: Uses Proof-of-Work (SHA-256), fully compatible with existing Bitcoin mining rigs. Solaris Layer: Runs Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) with 21 rotating validators, allowing ultra-fast block times and scalability. With this, BTC-S reaches up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer with finality in just 2 seconds. It’s designed to be energy-efficient and secure, with validator rotation, slashing, and Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms baked in. But what really sets this apart? Mobile Mining Is Back—For Everyone At the heart of Bitcoin Solaris is the upcoming Solaris Nova App, a full-scale mining system designed for the everyday user . No tech skills. No expensive hardware. Key mobile mining features include: One-click mining for Android, iOS, and desktop users Smart algorithms that adapt to your device’s power Real-time earnings and performance analytics In-app wallet and security with biometric login Gamification: badges, leaderboards, and community challenges Whether you’re on a smartphone or an old laptop, you’re part of the mining revolution. Energy Efficient, Scalable, and Actually Fun BTC-S’s hybrid architecture isn’t just fast—it’s green. By using DPoS on its Solaris Layer and limiting PoW activity to the foundational layer, the system achieves 99.95% lower energy usage compared to Bitcoin. Add to that: Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy Smart contract support in Rust (compatible with Solana tools) Application potential across DeFi, gaming, healthcare, and IoT This isn’t just a mining token. It’s an entire ecosystem built for speed, simplicity, and real-world use. Presale: A $6 Ticket to a $20 Launch? The Bitcoin Solaris presale is in Phase 6 with over $3 million already raised. With just weeks to go before the July 31 launch, investors are flooding in, chasing a potential 1,900% return. Over 11,000 unique users have already joined, making this one of the shortest—and most explosive—presales in recent memory. And the clock is ticking: Current price is $6. Next stop? $7, before a full $20 launch. Tokenomics Snapshot: Built for Distribution, Not Whales The BTC-S model avoids centralization by design. Rewards are split as follows: 40% to PoW miners 25% to Solaris validators 20% to stakers 10% to the development fund 5% to the community fund This ensures miners, holders, and developers all grow together, no single entity dominating the ecosystem. Hype Is Building—Even Without the Headlines While major BTC outlets stay quiet, the community isn’t. Influencer buzz is growing fast, with Crypto Volt offering a detailed breakdown of why Bitcoin Solaris might be “the most important launch of 2025.” The audits by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , alongside a verified KYC , give further credibility. And the conversation continues in Telegram and on X , where updates drop daily. Conclusion: The Missed Millionaire Opportunity? Most people won’t notice Bitcoin Solaris until after the launch. That’s just the nature of crypto. But for those who remember what 2010 felt like—the excitement, the accessibility, the sense that anyone could participate—this might be the closest we ever get again. With a powerful, upcoming mobile mining platform, deep infrastructure, low energy use, and explosive presale momentum, BTC-S isn’t just another altcoin. It’s a system designed to make millionaires out of ordinary users, not institutions. The question is… will you be early this time?

This Korea-based media alliance has announced its plans to raise a whopping $500M for a Bitcoin reserve and adopt a Bitcoin-first strategy. The company plans to develop an entire ecosystem around $BTC, allowing users to buy concert tickets, albums, and even vote on the platform using Bitcoin. Keep reading to find out more about KWM’s Bitcoin love, why Asian corporations are bullish on the digital gold, and how you can make the most of the upcoming $BTC bull run by investing in BTC Bull Token , a hot new meme coin on presale . Buy and HODL Bitcoin, as Simple as It Gets KWM has called itself the ‘Metaplanet of Korea.’ Metaplanet, by the way, is a Japanese company that adopted a similar Bitcoin-first strategy in 2024, after which its stock increased around 4,000% . Following KWM’s announcement, its stock on NASDAQ, too, climbed over 155% in just a few hours . Other Asian companies, such as the Basel Medical Group Limited, based in Singapore, have also announced plans to buy $BTC worth $1B . Similarly, Matador Technologies Inc., a Canadian Bitcoin-focused company, has raised over $1.6M in the second tranche of its non-broker private placement with the aim of building a Bitcoin reserve. The company currently holds 68.14 $BTC and plans on inflating its reserve even further. It’s worth noting that ever since the announcement of the US Bitcoin reserve, corporate entities has been pushing hard to follow suit. Even outside North America, KWM and Matador have realized $BTC’s potential. With Strategy ( which has over 580K $BTC ) leading the way, several other multinational corporations are keen on building their own stash of Bitcoin. Combined with the fact that Bitcoin recently made a new all-time high around $112K and $BTC HODL levels are at record highs , it’s fair to say that investors are broadly bullish on the asset. If you want to ride the biggest crypto’s growth in the most profitable way possible, consider investing in a Bitcoin-inspired meme coin that has yet to go live on exchanges: BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . What Is BTC Bull Token? BTC Bull Token is one of the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its unique way of following Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Unlike other altcoins that reward their token holders through more of their own cryptos, $BTCBULL is the first-ever altcoin to distribute free $BTC in its giveaways. This new crypto coin , with an emphatic bull as its mascot, offers investors the opportunity to generate brain-melting gains and the chance to win real Bitcoin. Of course, you’ll get the typical crypto degen thrills along the way as well. All bases covered! That said, remember that you’ll only be eligible for BTC Bull Token’s free $BTC rewards if you store your purchased $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . The airdrop event will take place on social media, where you’ll have to opt in, and each participant will have a chance to win some genuine Bitcoins. Burn, Rise, and Repeat! There are two essential features that make BTC Bull Token what it is. First is its Bitcoin airdrops. These are slated to take place every time the king cryptocurrency reaches a new milestone ($150K and $200K) for the first time. Additionally, the developers have also planned a $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin reaches $250K. This means that if you’re in it for the digital gold, you should buy $BTCBULL before it’s too late. Second, BTC Bull Token’s bright price predictions, which we’ll come to in a second, are also a result of its commitment to follow a deflationary approach. Under this, the developers will burn a small percentage of the $BTCBULL token supply when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K for the first time. Doing so will reduce the number of $BTCBULL tokens in circulation, which, when combined with increasing $BTC prices and consequently rising demand for $BTCBULL, would ultimately drive up the token’s price. Speaking of price, our BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests that it could reach $0.0497 by 2030 – a 19x increase in your investment. $BTCBULL Is Currently in Presale Luckily for you, BTC Bull Token is currently in its presale stage, meaning it’s not yet listed on crypto exchanges. This then means you can buy the token for some of its lowest-ever prices. One $BTCBULL is currently priced at just $0.00255. You can buy $BTCBULL through either its official presale website or directly from within the Best Wallet App. For more information on the purchase process, here’s a guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token . Institutional Adoption Is Flying Bitcoin’s Flag With more and more companies adopting Bitcoin reserve strategies, the market is bound to receive a double dose of rocket fuel. And this could best translate to solid gains for the newest meme coins around, presales like BTC Bull Token . With real Bitcoin airdrops and a constant push upward due to token burns, $BTCBULL is positioned as potentially the biggest gainer of this bull run. But again, the meme coin market, too, is subject to risks, and you must only invest after doing your own research.

The reason? Elon Musk’s escalating feud with President Donald Trump. Now, Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow is stepping in with bold advice: it’s time for Musk to turn to Bitcoin. . @elonmusk it’s time to go all in on #Bitcoin . @Tesla can take BTC for payments again and implement a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. @SpaceX can give a discount on launches paid in Bitcoin.

He urged Musk to start accepting Bitcoin payments again at Tesla and adopt a Bitcoin Treasury strategy. He also suggested that SpaceX could offer discounts for launches paid in BTC – a move he says would push back against inflation and weakening fiat systems. “This is not financial advice. This is freedom advice,” Mow added, warning that Musk should act before his fiat assets are possibly frozen. Mow believes Bitcoin can serve as a safeguard, and a statement, against government overreach and economic uncertainty Tesla’s Worst Trading Day in Months Tesla shares closed at $284.68, marking their biggest one-day drop since March 10. The stock is now down nearly 20% in the past five days, and the market cap has slipped to $915.74 billion. Even after hours, the decline continued with another 2% dip. At the time of writing, Tesla is trading at $298.60. Musk vs. Trump: What Sparked the Crash? The market drop follows Musk’s public criticism of Trump’s proposed “Big Beautiful Bill,” a government spending plan that would increase U.S. debt. Musk slammed the bill in several X posts and even called for Trump’s impeachment, comments that clearly shook investor confidence and triggered the sell-off. Crypto Voices Back Mow’s Call Samson Mow isn’t the only one encouraging Musk to lean into Bitcoin. Jack Dorsey , Twitter’s co-founder, reposted Musk’s old 2020 comment: “Bitcoin is my safe word.” It was a subtle nudge at a time when Musk might need a financial safe haven. XRP lawyer John Deaton also chimed in, predicting that Tesla could buy even more Bitcoin. The company already holds over 11,000 BTC in its portfolio.

This isn’t just another small purchase; they’re talking about a substantial fundraising effort specifically aimed at increasing their BTC holdings dramatically. This development highlights the growing trend of companies viewing Bitcoin as a strategic asset, especially within the unique economic landscape of Japan. Metaplanet’s Strategic Vision: Betting Big on Bitcoin Acquisition The news broke directly from Simon Gerovich, the CEO of Metaplanet, via a post on X (formerly Twitter). He revealed the company’s ambitious plan to raise a staggering 770.9 billion yen, which translates to approximately $5.4 billion USD. The primary, stated purpose of this massive capital raise? To acquire more Bitcoin. This move isn’t Metaplanet’s first rodeo with BTC investment; they’ve been steadily accumulating the digital asset, positioning themselves as a pioneer for corporate Bitcoin adoption in Japan. Why such a significant commitment? Metaplanet operates in a challenging economic environment in Japan, characterized by persistent deflationary pressures and a weakening yen. In this context, traditional financial strategies often yield low or negative real returns. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, capped supply, and potential as a hedge against currency devaluation and inflation, presents an alternative store of value and a potential growth asset. Metaplanet’s strategy appears to be modeled, at least in part, on the approach taken by companies like MicroStrategy in the United States, which has aggressively pursued a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. By holding a significant portion of their treasury reserves in BTC, these companies aim to preserve and potentially grow their capital in a way that traditional assets might not allow in the current macroeconomic climate. Why is Japan Bitcoin Adoption Gaining Momentum? While the cryptocurrency market is global, Metaplanet’s aggressive posture is particularly noteworthy because it’s happening in Japan. Japan has a complex relationship with cryptocurrencies. It was one of the first countries to regulate exchanges but has also faced challenges, including major exchange hacks in the past. However, there’s a growing recognition among some businesses and investors in Japan about the potential benefits of digital assets. Economic Environment: As mentioned, Japan’s long-standing battle with deflation and ultra-low interest rates makes yield-generating investments scarce. This pushes investors and companies to look for alternative assets. Regulatory Clarity (Evolving): While regulations are strict, the presence of a framework, albeit evolving, provides some level of legitimacy and structure compared to completely unregulated markets. Technological Sophistication: Japan is a technologically advanced nation, with a population generally open to new technologies, including digital finance. Precedent Set by Pioneers: Companies like Metaplanet demonstrating a successful (or at least committed) strategy with Bitcoin can encourage others to explore similar paths. Metaplanet’s move could serve as a significant catalyst, potentially encouraging other Japanese corporations to seriously consider Bitcoin as part of their treasury management or investment strategies. This could unlock a new wave of institutional capital flowing into the BTC market from one of the world’s largest economies. The Mechanics and Implications of a $5.4 Billion Bitcoin Acquisition Raising $5.4 billion is no small feat for any company, let alone one whose market cap might be significantly smaller than the amount they intend to raise for a single asset class. The specifics of how Metaplanet plans to raise this capital (e.g., through debt issuance, equity offering, a combination) will be crucial details to watch. Each method has different implications for the company’s balance sheet, future earnings, and risk profile. Regardless of the method, a successful raise of this magnitude specifically earmarked for BTC investment would have several key implications: Impact on Metaplanet Balance Sheet Transformation: Their balance sheet would become heavily weighted towards Bitcoin, making the company’s value closely tied to BTC price fluctuations. Increased Visibility: Metaplanet would likely become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally, attracting significant attention from investors interested in both the company and BTC itself. Potential for Growth (and Volatility): If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, Metaplanet’s assets would grow significantly. However, they would also be exposed to substantial volatility risk. Pioneer Status Solidified: This move would cement their position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption in Japan and potentially Asia. Impact on the Bitcoin Market Significant Buying Pressure: Deploying $5.4 billion into BTC would create substantial demand, potentially impacting the price, especially if the purchases are made over a relatively short period. Positive Sentiment: Such a large, public commitment from a listed company, particularly one outside the typical early-adopter regions like North America, is a strong positive signal for institutional adoption. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As BTC is acquired and potentially moved into cold storage, the available supply on exchanges decreases, which can be bullish for the price over time. It’s important to note that raising the funds and actually deploying them can take time. Market conditions at the time of acquisition will also play a significant role in the average price Metaplanet pays for its Bitcoin. Challenges and Opportunities for Metaplanet’s BTC Investment While the potential upside of a large BTC investment is clear, Metaplanet faces significant challenges: Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. A significant downturn could negatively impact Metaplanet’s financial health and stock price. Regulatory Risk: Although Japan has a framework, future regulatory changes could impact the holding or trading of cryptocurrencies. Execution Risk: Successfully raising $5.4 billion and efficiently acquiring such a large amount of BTC without drastically moving the market against them requires careful planning and execution. Shareholder Perception: Not all shareholders may agree with such a concentrated bet on a volatile asset like Bitcoin, potentially leading to investor relations challenges. Opportunities: Capital Appreciation: If Bitcoin continues its long-term upward trend, the value of Metaplanet’s holdings could increase substantially. Hedge Against Yen Devaluation: In the face of potential continued weakening of the Japanese Yen, Bitcoin can serve as a non-sovereign store of value. Attracting New Investors: The focus on Bitcoin can attract a new class of investors interested in both traditional equity and the crypto space. Setting a Precedent: Success could pave the way for more corporate adoption in Japan and beyond. Metaplanet’s move is a high-stakes gamble, but one that reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a future reserve asset. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investment in Japan and Globally? Metaplanet’s announcement is a powerful signal. It indicates that even in a country with unique economic challenges and a sometimes cautious approach to new financial technologies, public companies are willing to make substantial commitments to Bitcoin. This could encourage other Japanese firms, from small businesses to large conglomerates, to explore how digital assets might fit into their own strategies. Globally, this reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional adoption. While MicroStrategy has been the most prominent example in the West, Metaplanet’s actions highlight that this trend is not confined to one region. As more diverse companies in different parts of the world allocate capital to Bitcoin, it strengthens its position as a legitimate asset class. For individual investors interested in the cryptocurrency Japan market or global BTC trends, keeping an eye on Metaplanet’s progress will be insightful. Their success or challenges in executing this plan could influence the strategies of other potential corporate buyers. Here’s a simplified look at the potential scale compared to Metaplanet’s previous holdings (Note: This is illustrative as the exact timing and previous holdings vary): Metric Metaplanet (Approximate Previous Holdings) Proposed New Acquisition Target Potential Total Holdings Funding Amount ~¥1 Billion (via prior raises) ¥770.9 Billion (~$5.4 Billion) N/A (Funding amount) Estimated BTC Acquired ~141 BTC (as of last reported figures) Likely tens of thousands of BTC (depending on price) Potentially tens of thousands of BTC + previous Scale of Move Initial foray Massive expansion Transformative (Note: Previous holdings and current BTC price are approximate and subject to change, making the exact number of BTC acquired with $5.4B variable). Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights Metaplanet’s plan to raise $5.4 billion for Bitcoin acquisition is a landmark event for corporate adoption, especially coming from Japan. It underscores the increasing conviction among some publicly traded companies that Bitcoin is a vital component of a forward-looking treasury strategy. Actionable Insights: Watch Metaplanet Closely: Monitor their progress in raising the funds and executing the BTC purchases. This will provide insights into the mechanics and challenges of large-scale corporate acquisition. Observe Japanese Market Trends: See if other Japanese companies follow Metaplanet’s lead. This could signal a broader shift in corporate finance within Japan. Consider the Macro Context: Metaplanet’s move is partly driven by Japan’s specific economic conditions. Understand how global macro trends might influence other companies’ decisions regarding BTC. Evaluate BTC as a Treasury Asset: For businesses, this highlights the ongoing discussion about Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional cash reserves. This development is more than just one company buying Bitcoin; it’s a potential signal of changing attitudes towards digital assets in a major global economy and reinforces the growing narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation as a corporate reserve asset. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Metaplanet and Japan’s Bitcoin Future Metaplanet’s announcement of a colossal $5.4 billion fundraising target specifically for Bitcoin acquisition marks a potentially defining moment. It’s a bold declaration of confidence in BTC’s long-term value and its role as a strategic asset, particularly pertinent in Japan’s unique economic climate. This move positions Metaplanet not just as a company that holds Bitcoin, but as one that is fundamentally reorienting its financial structure around it. As they navigate the complexities of raising and deploying such a vast sum, the global cryptocurrency community, and especially those watching the cryptocurrency Japan market, will be observing closely. This could very well be the catalyst that accelerates corporate Bitcoin adoption across Asia and beyond, proving that the trend of integrating digital assets into traditional finance is gaining unstoppable momentum.

2025-06-06T13:10:13,"Bitcoin ETFs See Major Outflows as Trump-Musk Feud Rattles Markets","U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a sharp return to outflows on June 5, shedding $278 million, according to data from SoSoValue. The negative momentum followed a brief two-day recovery and came amid growing unease in financial markets, sparked by a high-profile feud between former President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Sentiment Takes a Hit Market sentiment took a decisive turn as the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index dropped from “Greed” to “Fear” on June 6. This shift came after tensions escalated between Trump and Musk through a series of social media exchanges, damaging what had been perceived as a close relationship. The feud also had ripple effects beyond the crypto sector. Shares of Tesla fell 14%, while Trump Media dropped 8%, according to TradingView data. Persistent ETF Struggles The June 5 outflows came after U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $1.2 billion outflow between May 29 and June 2, also driven by cooling sentiment. Although June 3 and 4 showed brief signs of recovery, the pullback resumed forcefully. SoSoValue noted that ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) led the retreat, seeing $102 million in withdrawals on June 5. Notably, none of the Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows that day. Global Trends and Ether Inflows Over the past week, global Bitcoin exchange-traded products experienced $8 million in outflows. In contrast, Ethereum-based products (ETPs) saw significantly better investor interest. Spot Ether ETFs attracted $11.3 million in inflows on June 5, continuing a 14-day streak. However, these figures declined compared to the $56.9 million added on June 4 and $109.4 million on June 3. Ethereum Gains Institutional Traction Ether products are benefiting from stronger network fundamentals and sustained interest in futures markets. BlackRock, the world’s largest crypto ETF issuer, recently added $50 million worth of Ether to its portfolio on June 3, according to Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm. As uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin ETFs grows, Ethereum appears to be consolidating its position as a more stable alternative for now.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-etfs-see-major-outflows-as-trump-musk-feud-rattles-markets/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|ARKM","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

On June 6, a wave of liquidations totaling $972.22 million swept the market, according to data from CoinGlass. Over the last 48 hours, nearly $3 billion in long and short positions were liquidated. 24-hour liquidations heat map on June 6 | Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin and Ethereum led in total liquidation volume over the past 24 hours, accounting for 64% of the total. However, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) saw the most liquidations relative to their market caps, highlighting a high level of leverage in these assets. You might also like: Why is crypto down today? Trump-Musk fallout rattles sentiment, Dogecoin drops 20% Trump-Musk spat caught long Doge, Solana traders off guard The liquidation bias over the last 24 hours was overwhelmingly tilted against long positions. Of the total liquidations, $875 million, or 89%, came from longs. These highly leveraged positions were not able to withstand the spike in volatility driven by political developments in the U.S. The trigger for the sharp liquidation wave was a slump in crypto prices following a public fallout between U.S. President Donald Trump and his former political ally, Elon Musk. Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) touched a low of $100,437, Ethereum (ETH) fell 7% to $2,387, and Solana dropped to $142. Meanwhile, Musk’s favorite crypto, Dogecoin, plunged over 20%, hitting a daily low of $0.1692. Overall, the liquidation event appears to have stemmed from excessive long positioning amid a highly volatile market. Specifically, aggressive leveraged bets on Solana and Dogecoin, combined with stop-loss triggers during the slump, were enough to fuel the cascade of liquidations. Despite the outsized liquidations, Solana has shown relative resilience—even outperforming Ethereum on some metrics. Dogecoin, however, remains heavily tied to Musk’s influence. With Musk now falling out of favor politically, DOGE is likely to face increased volatility in the near term.

Bitcoin Rebounds But Faces Wedge Resistance From a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as long as it holds below the $ 106,000 mark. BTC remains in recovery mode after falling to $100,519 earlier this week. It has since bounced over 3%, climbing to $103,981, as bulls retest a key resistance level following a breakdown from a symmetrical triangle pattern. The breakdown was swift, triggered by high volume and a long-bodied bearish candle. However, dip buyers showed strength at the $100.5K zone, forming a bullish engulfing candle and pushing BTC above the 50-period EMA at $104,358. Bitcoin price chart – Source: Tradingview Technically, BTC still faces strong resistance: Horizontal zone: $104,547 to $106,308 200 EMA: $106,308 Wedge base: A key trendline turned resistance Momentum indicators, such as the MACD, have flipped bullish, signaling potential continuation; however, confirmation above $104,600 remains essential. Can Bitcoin Reach $200K? With rising institutional interest and now Trump-linked political exposure, the conversation around a six-figure Bitcoin is heating up again. BTC’s previous all-time high of nearly $69,000 was primarily driven by institutional FOMO and ETF anticipation. The Truth Social ETF, if approved, could reignite similar dynamics—but with even greater political visibility. For BTC to reach $200K, it needs: Sustained ETF inflows Global liquidity support Breakout above $110K macro resistance Trade Idea: A breakout above $104,600 could justify a long entry at $104,800, with a target of $106,300–$107,600. Stop-loss: $103,100. If BTC can reclaim the wedge structure and hold above the 200 EMA, mid-term bulls could set their sights beyond $110K, setting the stage for the $200K debate to gain real traction.

Senator Cynthia Lummis believes it can and she’s outlined a bold plan to make it happen. In a recent Bloomberg interview , Lummis revealed her proposal to create a U.S. Bitcoin reserve , aiming to secure one million BTC, around 5% of the total supply, over the next 20 years. Her vision goes beyond investing. It’s about turning Bitcoin into a strategic asset that could reshape the country’s financial future. Using Govt. Crypto to Kickstart the Reserve Lummis suggested starting the reserve with digital assets already held by the U.S. Marshals Service , specifically from asset forfeiture funds. These funds, some of which are in crypto, could lay the foundation for the first year, without needing new legislation right away. Still, she acknowledged that clear legal protections would be necessary later on to keep the reserve safe from political shifts. Why Only Bitcoin? Lummis Makes Her Case Lummis stressed that this reserve should focus only on Bitcoin. Why? Because of its proof-of-work mining model, which makes it more secure and reliable compared to other cryptocurrencies. In her view, Bitcoin stands out as the best choice for a long-term national reserve. The core of Lummis’ plan is to acquire and hold one million Bitcoin over 20 years. She believes that if Bitcoin’s value rises as expected, the U.S. could use the reserve to cut the national debt in half. Lummis also tied the idea to global strategy, saying a U.S. Bitcoin reserve could be just as important as oil reserves, especially in the ongoing economic rivalry with China. She mentioned that top U.S. military officials in Southeast Asia back the idea and see Bitcoin as a valuable strategic asset. A Nod to Trump Lummis went on to praise President Donald Trump for his early investments in Bitcoin. She called him a forward-thinker when it comes to digital assets and encouraged more Americans to see the value in early crypto adoption. As the digital economy grows, she believes this mindset will become increasingly important. If this plan takes off, it could mark a major shift in how the U.S. manages its economy and how Bitcoin is seen as a tool for national strength.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/senator-lummis-wants-1-million-bitcoin-to-slash-national-debt/,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T13:01:03,"Bitcoin price struggles at key resistance: is another leg down incoming?","Bitcoin is facing a tough battle at a critical resistance zone following a sharp correction. With weakening volume and a bearish retest in play, lower prices could be on the horizon. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has seen a notable correction that has shifted the local market structure. After breaking below key levels, BTC has bounced back into a strong resistance cluster, but is now struggling to reclaim it. The confluence of several technical factors at this zone suggests that this could be a bearish retest, signaling a potential continuation to the downside unless bulls step in with significant volume. Key technical points Major Resistance Cluster: $103,000 level aligned with the 200 Moving Average, daily resistance, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Bearish Market Structure: Clear lower high and lower low now established. Volume Weakness: Bounce into resistance is occurring on low volume, indicating lack of bullish conviction. Rejection Probability: Current region acting as strong resistance, hinting at further downside unless reclaimed. Trend Shift Confirmation: Failure to break above $103K will confirm bearish structure on local timeframes. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s recent bounce has taken price directly into a dense resistance zone that includes the 200 MA, a daily horizontal resistance at $103,000, and the golden ratio (0.618 Fibonacci). Historically, such confluence levels are difficult to break without strong conviction and volume, both of which are currently absent.| Volume analysis shows that the rally into this resistance zone has occurred on declining buy-side interest, raising red flags for a bullish continuation. Without a sudden spike in volume, this setup resembles a textbook bearish retest, a common pattern in downtrending markets, where price revisits former support turned resistance before continuing lower. You might also like: AAVE price bounces from $240 as whales accumulate, but momentum shows signs of weakness Market structure has now clearly shifted into a bearish state.

What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin fails to reclaim the $103,000 resistance cluster with strong volume in the near term, another leg down becomes increasingly likely.

2025-06-06T13:00:50,"Bitcoin Cycle Top Is In—$270,000 Delayed Until 2026, Says Analyst","Bitcoin’s majestic 2024-25 ascent may have stalled at the very moment many traders expected an early-summer melt-up, according to crypto analyst Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX). In an extended thread published today, the Ichimoku-focused technician argues that the market printed a “valid cycle high” on the weekly chart and has now slipped into neutral territory—potentially postponing the next decisive breakout until mid-July or, failing that, as late as the first quarter of 2026. Bitcoin Bottom Not In? “I warned multiple times that we can’t be bullish on the weekly before the 9th of June,” Dr Cat reminded followers. The Chiko Span (CS) “entered the candles” last week, he noted, stripping the weekly timeframe of its bullish bias even though the long-term monthly structure remains intact. “Because the monthly chart is bullish, things are still long-term bullish,” he conceded, yet the immediate path higher has narrowed to two clear windows. Related Reading: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History’s Turning The first window opens in the week beginning 16 June. If Bitcoin starts that week above $99,881 and closes with CS breaking cleanly above the candle range, Dr Cat believes “the moonshot, potentially to $270,000,” could ignite. Should price open below that threshold, a textbook CS tracing pattern would already be underway, pushing the next breakout target to the week commencing 14 July (or the one immediately after). “Simply because these are the places where CS can make a clear breakout above the candles terminating a CS tracing,” he explained. Below $93,200—the current position of the weekly Kijun Sen—the bullish countdown is voided. “If the Kijun Sen at 93.2K is lost, we consider much later breakout,” Dr Cat warned, pointing traders to a broad monthly window between November 2025 and April 2026 when the Kijun Sen itself is expected to slope upward again. Until then, he is “not confident that the bottom is in,” flagging $97–98 K as a short-term confluence zone in which the daily Kumo cloud, the weekly Tenkan Sen and the two-day Kijun Sen intersect. The analysis comes at a delicate moment for sentiment. Bitcoin’s April all-time high above $111,999 has so far resisted several retests, and funding rates on major derivatives venues have eased from euphoric to merely positive. For Dr Cat, such moderation is consistent with Ichimoku’s Kihon Suchi 17-period rhythm: “Time cycles … give a valid cycle high on the weekly. I think at this point it obviously printed,” he wrote, implying that a fresh consolidation phase is statistically favored. Altcoin Season Even Further Delayed Altcoins face an even steeper uphill battle. In a companion post dissecting the TOTAL3 index (the market capitalization of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum), Dr Cat argued that “altcoins are not ready to pump on the weekly and need minimum 1-2 months for that in the most bullish scenario.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 He cited four overlapping bearish ingredients: price below the weekly Kijun Sen, a negative Tenkan–Kijun cross, a Chiko Span trapped beneath the candle “forest,” and a Kijun Sen poised to turn down next week. “The chance for a bullish altcoins explosion in June is around 5 %,” he concluded, assigning a roughly equal probability that Bitcoin alone could rally while “dominance destroys alts.” That dour appraisal extends to Ethereum and other large caps. In Dr Cat’s view, “blindness … applies to anyone expecting a parabolic bull run above ATH in June for TOTAL3.” The first legitimate “window of opportunity for altcoin bulls,” he adds, does not open until August, when the weekly CS will encounter a thinner overhang of historic candles. Market implications hinge on whether Bitcoin can defend its higher-timeframe pivots long enough to align with those temporal windows. So far, the $93.200 Kijun Sen serves as the demarcation line between an orderly pause and a deeper retracement.

2025-06-06T13:00:32,"Massive Bitcoin Transfer: 6,857 BTC Moves from Kraken to Unknown Wallet","BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Transfer: 6,857 BTC Moves from Kraken to Unknown Wallet In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, large transactions often capture significant attention. A recent report from Whale Alert highlighted a massive Bitcoin transfer that sent ripples through the community: 6,857 BTC moved from the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet. Valued at approximately $711 million at the time of the transfer, this significant large crypto transaction immediately sparked speculation and analysis. Understanding Large Bitcoin Transfers When we talk about a Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude, it’s far more than just someone moving their personal funds. These movements typically involve entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, often referred to as ‘whales’. Understanding why these large transfers happen is crucial for anyone monitoring the market. They can signal various intentions, from accumulation or distribution to internal restructuring by exchanges or institutions. Why do large transfers matter? Market Impact: While not always indicative of immediate buying or selling, moving large sums can precede market actions. Signaling: It might signal confidence (moving to cold storage) or potential selling pressure (moving to an exchange). Institutional Activity: Large transfers are often associated with institutional investors, hedge funds, or large corporations. Exchange Activity: Exchanges themselves move funds for hot/cold wallet management, rebalancing, or facilitating large OTC deals. Exploring the Kraken Bitcoin Movement Kraken is one of the oldest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges globally. A large volume of Kraken Bitcoin moving off the platform naturally raises questions. Was this an individual investor? An institution? Or was it Kraken itself moving funds for operational reasons? Transfers from exchanges can mean several things: Withdrawal by a Large Client: A significant investor or institution might be taking custody of their assets, moving them to cold storage. Exchange Cold Storage Top-Up: Kraken might be consolidating funds from hot wallets into more secure cold storage. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The funds could be moving to facilitate a large, private transaction arranged off the public order books. Transfer to Another Exchange: Though less common for such large amounts directly, it’s a possibility for arbitrage or other strategies. Without direct confirmation from Kraken or the wallet owner, the exact reason remains speculative. Who is This Crypto Whale? The Mystery of the Unknown Wallet The destination of the 6,857 BTC was an ‘unknown wallet’. This term is commonly used by blockchain trackers like Whale Alert when the wallet address hasn’t been publicly linked to a known entity (like an exchange, custodian, or prominent fund). The owner of this wallet is, for now, a true crypto whale . Identifying the owner of an unknown wallet is challenging. Blockchain provides transparency regarding transactions, but wallet addresses are pseudonymous. Possible candidates for such a large holding could include: A major institutional investor or hedge fund. A large corporation adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. An early Bitcoin adopter or miner. A custodian service holding funds on behalf of multiple clients. Another cryptocurrency exchange consolidating assets. The mystery surrounding the identity of this crypto whale adds to the intrigue and fuels market speculation. The Significance of Large Crypto Transactions and BTC Movement Tracking large crypto transaction s is a key part of market analysis for many traders and analysts. While one transaction doesn’t define the market trend, a pattern of large movements can provide valuable insights into the sentiment and actions of major players. This particular BTC movement , worth over $700 million, is large enough to potentially influence market psychology, if not immediate price action. Consider the potential implications: If the BTC is moving to cold storage, it could signal a long-term holding strategy, potentially bullish. If it’s moving to another exchange or an OTC desk, it could potentially precede selling activity, which might be seen as bearish or neutral depending on the context. If it’s an internal exchange transfer, it might have no direct market impact. Blockchain analysis tools allow observers to monitor the destination wallet’s future activity. Will the funds sit idle? Will they be moved again? Will they be dispersed to other wallets? These subsequent actions can help paint a clearer picture of the whale’s intentions. Monitoring BTC Movement: Tools and Insights How do we even know about these massive transfers? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. By monitoring large movements of assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, they provide real-time alerts that inform the crypto community. Beyond alert services, anyone can use blockchain explorers (like Blockchain.com, Etherscan, etc.) to look up transaction details, view wallet balances, and trace the flow of funds. While the identity behind an address often remains hidden, the transactional data is public and verifiable. Actionable Insight: For those interested in tracking whale activity, following services like Whale Alert and learning how to use blockchain explorers can provide valuable data points, though interpreting the data requires context and caution. Conclusion: A Mysterious BTC Movement The transfer of 6,857 Kraken Bitcoin to an unknown wallet is a prime example of the kind of significant large crypto transaction s that happen regularly on the blockchain. While the identity of this particular crypto whale and their exact intentions remain shrouded in mystery, this substantial Bitcoin transfer highlights the presence of major players in the market and the importance of monitoring significant BTC movement for potential insights into market dynamics. Whether this transfer precedes a significant market event or is simply routine operational activity remains to be seen, but it serves as a powerful reminder of the scale of value being transacted on decentralized networks every day.

2025-06-06T12:51:36,"Ethereum ETFs extend inflow streak despite token bleed","Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) defy broader market downturn, holding steady with fresh inflows despite token’s struggles. On June 5, 2024, Ethereum ETFs recorded total inflows of $11.3 million, according to data from SosoValue. This marked the continuation of a positive trend that began earlier in the week, pushing their inflow streak to 14 consecutive days. However, the latest numbers reflected a notable drop from previous days. BlackRock’s ETHA was solely responsible for all the inflows, pulling in approximately $34.7 million. Offsetting the gains, Fidelity’s FETH recorded outflows of $23.4 million, while other issuers saw no activity. Still, the performance marked a win for the funds, especially when compared to ETH’s recent price action . Trading at hands at $2,478 at press time, the token is down approximately 6% in the past two weeks. ETH now sits roughly 33% below its 2025 high of around $3,700, reached earlier in January. You might also like: Vitalik Buterin admits Bitcoin’s dominance in certain areas of crypto Despite a few short-lived rallies sparking hopes of a recovery, the token has largely struggled as macroeconomic factors and fading investor confidence threaten its upward momentum. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs failed to mirror their ETH counterparts, shedding $278 million in outflows on the same day. This was likely triggered by Thursday’s sharp price drop, which followed the headline-grabbing feud between US President Donald Trump and tech CEO Elon Musk. BTC led a broader market decline , slipping 3% and falling back to the $100,000 price range. In the bigger picture, Bitcoin ETF flows have swung inconsistently between inflows and outflows in the past weeks, reflecting continued investor uncertainty around the token’s performance. As Ether ETFs uphold their positive performance, issuers are loading up on the token. On June 3, on-chain analytics revealed that BlackRock purchased $50 million worth of Ether. Additionally, market confidence hasn’t completely waned despite the token’s price woes, and recent remarks by co-founder Vitalk Buterin chart a positive outlook for the broader ecosystem.

2025-06-06T12:50:12,"US Crypto Lobby Pushes for Protecting Developers in Upcoming Legislation","Leading U.S. crypto advocacy groups have united to push lawmakers for the inclusion of legal protections for software developers and infrastructure providers in a bill designed to regulate the digital asset space. In a joint statement on June 5, several major organizations—including the DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, the Blockchain Association, and the Bitcoin Policy Institute— urged Congress to append the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) to the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act of 2025. The proposal comes amid a flurry of legislative activity aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi). The BRCA, recently reintroduced by Representatives Tom Emmer and Ritchie Torres, seeks to exempt developers of non-custodial platforms—who do not handle user funds directly—from being classified as money transmitters. Protecting Developers, Not Just Institutions The coalition emphasized that creators of decentralized protocols and those maintaining blockchain infrastructure are fundamentally different from traditional financial intermediaries. “It is critically important to remember that developers creating peer-to-peer, non-custodial software and the infrastructure providers who enable decentralized networks have little in common with traditional financial institutions and should not be treated as such,” the joint statement further read. Their concern lies in the potential for regulatory overreach . Without the BRCA, developers of non-custodial systems—such as decentralized exchanges or wallets—could face legal ambiguity and penalties akin to banks or custodians. Coin Center’s communications director Neeraj Agrawal noted that the organizations are also monitoring for “unconstitutional surveillance requirements” that could be attached to crypto legislation, raising further alarm for privacy advocates. Shifting Government Tone on Crypto The push for protective legislation follows a noticeable shift in how U.S. authorities are approaching crypto space. On June 3, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins also told the Senate that the era of “regulation by enforcement” is ending . Moving forward, the SEC intends to work with stakeholders in the crypto industry to build more transparent and inclusive policy frameworks. Adding to the industry’s optimism is the upcoming Senate vote on Brian Quintenz—President Trump’s nominee to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz, a long-time crypto supporter with $3.4 million in disclosed assets including digital assets, is expected to usher in more industry-friendly oversight if appointed. Together, these developments could signal a turning point in U.S. crypto regulation—one where innovation is not only tolerated but encouraged under a clearer and fairer legal framework.

2025-06-06T12:45:52,"Strategy increases Stride fundraising goal to $1B","Strategy announced the initial price for its Stride preferred stock, while expanding the intended offering from $250M to $1B. The new preferred shares will contribute to its general BTC purchases, though the funds will come from selected investors this time. Strategy (MSTR) announced new details of its Stride (STRD) preferred stock, a new tool for fundraising. The STRD offering will be expanded from $250M to $1B, giving the company more leeway for BTC purchases and partially covering other operating costs. Initially, STRD was supposed to sell just 2.5M shares to a smaller circle of investors. This is Strategy’s biggest IPO upsize compared to previous share sales. STRD launches with a discount The initial sale price of STRD will be $85 , with the issuance and sale scheduled for June 10, depending on the completion of final closing conditions. STRD may see demand based on the previous performance of STRK and STRF, which rallied above their IPO prices. The performance may also hinge on the price of BTC and general market sentiment. The offering will place 11,764,700 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride preferred stock. The shares will have a liquidation preference price of $100, as previously stated. Initially, the STRD price was also expected to be $100, so the discount at the initial sale is considered a bid to increase funding. Strategy expects proceeds of $979.7M, excluding discounts and commissions for the underwriters. The proceeds will go toward new BTC acquisitions, as well as general corporate purposes, announced the company. The new STRD asset will offer a 10% dividend, which is not mandatory and depends on favorable market conditions. If declared, dividends will be paid out quarterly. The new sale arrived after Strategy added a small weekly purchase , bringing its total treasury to 580,250 BTC. Strategy bets on STRD to revive its stock growth The proposed placement of $1B in new preferred shares far surpasses previous STRK and STRF placements. On the one hand, the ability to raise more funds would be good news for Strategy and its appeal to investors. However, there are ongoing doubts that Michael Saylor needs to get more creative with fundraising to continue his BTC purchasing strategy. If successful, the offering will give Strategy a leeway to acquire close to 10,000 BTC. The company has no fixed limit to buying BTC on a weekly basis, with purchases depending on demand for its other stock types. Usually, purchases were financed with a mix of MSTR common stock, as well as STRF and STRK. Following the pricing announcement, MSTR common stock traded at $386.60. STRF shares fell to exactly $100, from a recent peak at $107. STRK traded at $101.64. All three share types have sunk below their 2025 peaks as BTC also slid from its recent record at $112,000. The risk profile of STRD also makes the other assets look safer and more attractive. For some potential investors, STRD is the equivalent of a junk bond tranche. The discount price and potential passive income make STRD akin to a high-risk bond. The new IPO coming in a few days will measure institutional demand for Strategy’s BTC maximalism.

Created in 2009 by an unknown person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money directly between people without a bank or middleman. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin is a digital system where everyone shares the same record of transactions. This shared system ensures everyone agrees on who owns what, making it secure and trustworthy. Over the years, Bitcoin's value has seen big ups and downs. By 2025, it has reached new milestones, surpassing previous all-time highs. Many early investors have seen significant returns. Some experts believe Bitcoin will continue to rise. Predictions suggest it could reach prices as high as $1.5 million by 2030, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Others are less optimistic, like Warren Buffett, who doubts its long-term value. Whether Bitcoin will keep climbing depends on many factors, like demand and adoption by big institutions. While some are hopeful about its future, it's important to consider the risks. Bitcoin's journey is ongoing, and only time will tell if it will reach new heights. Conclusion Despite Bitcoin's impressive gains surpassing giants like Amazon, Tesla, and Meta, some analysts see limited short-term potential compared to emerging AI-driven altcoins. Codename:Pepe crypto is one such altcoin that aims to leverage artificial intelligence to maximize profits, setting itself apart in the crowded crypto market.

Nonfarm payrolls grew 139,000 last month, according to the a report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts called for gains of 130,000 and April's job growth was 147,000 (revised from an originally reported 177,000). The unemployment rate for May was 4.2% against expectations for 4.2% and April's 4.2%. In the midst of a strong rebound following yesterday's sharp declines, the price of bitcoin BTC rose a small bit further following the news to just above $104,000. Always a closely-followed print, the May payrolls data was of particular import this time around as a string of economic reports this week pointed to growing economic weakness. Among them were the slowest ADP jobs growth in more than two years, ISM Services slipping into levels suggesting economic contraction and a rise in initial jobless claims to the highest level since October. Nearing 4.50% as the week began, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to as low as 4.32% and the odds of a summer Fed rate cut(s) had risen appreciably ahead of this morning's report. In the minutes after the print, the 10-year yield shot back up to 4.44% and the odds of a July Fed rate cut tumbled to just 16% from 30%, according to CME FedWatch . Looking further out, the odds of one or more rate cuts by the Fed's September meeting fell to 65% from 75%. U.S. stock index futures added to earlier gains, the Nasdaq ahead 0.8% and S&P 500 0.75%. Checking other report details, average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in May against estimates for 0.3% and April's 0.2%.

In a Reuters poll, the market expectation was 130,000, a significant drop from the 177,000 figure released in April. The unemployment rate was expected to remain stable at 4.2%. Bank of America (BofA) had expected a 150,000-plus increase, above expectations, anticipating resilience in the labor market. The bank says this could prompt the Fed to keep interest rates steady for an extended period. BofA analysts say markets are more focused on the “recession side of stagflation.” Related News: There is a $4 Billion Options Earthquake in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Today - Here are the Details On the other hand, UBS Chief Economist Paul Donovan said that many forecasts were below market expectations. “Companies may have slowed hiring due to uncertainty about trade policies. However, this is unlikely to lead to an increase in layoffs. This means that rate cuts will have limited impact at the moment.

2025-06-06T12:32:15,"Trump–Musk Feud Triggers $1B Crypto Liquidations in Hours","It was a typical day in the cryptocurrency markets, until the world's two most influential men in tech and politics, Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, ignited a social-media firestorm. By Thursday night, what began as heated tweets about Trump's ”Big, Beautiful Bill” had turned into a very public brawl, with Musk unleashing a string of messages on X and Trump fighting back on Truth Social. Musk's audience and prolific posting quickly surpassed Trump's, who, despite all his presidential pulpit, could not keep pace with the Tesla CEO's rapid-fire shots. Social media was left agog over the drama, with one observer commenting, ”This is honestly a wild amount of drama, if you remember we're running a country here.” But the backlash was not just online drama. As Musk called Trump ungrateful and even invoked the Epstein documents, Trump retaliated by vowing to pull government contracts from Musk's companies and calling him ”crazy”. The impact was immediate: Tesla shares plunged 14%, erasing over $150 billion in market value, and the crypto market went into a tailspin. Bitcoin dropped below $101,000, Ethereum dropped 7%, and Dogecoin, long fueled by Musk tweets, dropped nearly 10% within a day. On-chain data showed that more than $988 million in leveraged positions were liquidated over 24 hours, $888 million of which were long positions. Bybit and Binance suffered the most, with Bybit alone seeing $354 million in liquidations. Altcoins like Solana and meme tokens like DOGE and PEPE were also not spared the bloodbath, with DOGE holders particularly suffering as Musk's support evaporated. CoinGlass liquidation heatmaps painted a vivid picture: clusters of forced liquidations stacked up at $105,900 and $100,600, showing how extremely leveraged longs were vaporized as prices fell lower. Twitter was ablaze with memes of the Musk–Trump feud and screenshots of traders' losses. One viral post summed up the mood: ”The Elon Musk vs Donald Trump drama has escalated to a full on war.”. Trump is going to lose this one and it won't be particularly close.” On-chain sentiment metrics like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index also tanked, reflecting a race from ”greed” to ”fear” as traders scrambled to close out positions. The carnage also exposed deeper vulnerabilities in the market. Glassnode analytics pointed to long-term holders taking profit after Bitcoin's all-time high, with previous areas of accumulation becoming active selling zones. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $278 million in outflows, and institutional momentum appeared to wane as even MicroStrategy's latest purchase was a portion of previous ones. Meme coins, which had been riding retail euphoria, were the biggest losers. DOGE, PEPE, and Solana-based tokens all posted double-digit losses, their volatility fueled by Musk's shifting allegiances and Trump's capricious rhetoric. As the dust settles, the questions linger: Will the feud still stoke volatility? Is this a bottom, or the dawn of a new era in which political theatre trumps fundamentals? With nearly a billion dollars in liquidations and sentiment shaken, the Trump–Musk saga is a jarring reminder that in crypto, a single tweet can vaporize fortunes overnight.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9469/trump-musk-feud-triggers-1-b-crypto-liquidations-in-hours,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|PEPE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T12:24:43,"How Low Could Bitcoin Price Go in This Crypto Market Crash?","The post How Low Could Bitcoin Price Go in This Crypto Market Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market crash gained steam overnight as its top crypto, “Bitcoin price,” fell 5.2% to a low of $100,345. This fall was seen due to the liquidation of leveraged trades, geopolitics, and the Elon Musk-Donald Trump feud. Keep reading, as this article will shed light on the main reasons for the overnight crash and whether the bull run in BTC is over or not. Aggregated Reasons For Yesterday’s Bitcoin Price Decline The primary reason for the decline was Trump signing a new executive order, which has fueled volatility in major financial instruments, and that has affected BTC’s sentiment too. His EO this time has throwed lightning on steel and aluminium tariffs, which have jumped by 50%, to promote American in-house factories’ production to scale up. Similarly, arguments with China have once again started to heat up, and no resolution has been worked out between China and the US yet. As a result of these global pessimistic factors, the crypto market went into bearish mode last night, the growing uncertainty is creating delays in major technological advancements, too. The result of the bearish mode caused liquidations of 215,593 traders in the past 24 hours, and the total liquidations come in at $967.63 million, per Coinglass. It said the largest single liquidation order happened on Bitmex – XBTUSD, valued at $10.00 million. Meanwhile, a popular whale, James Wynn, had long positions worth $16.14 million liquidated. As a result, he had to close all his running long positions, as reported by Lookonchain. Joining the bearish facts, the fallout between Trump and his ex-best buddy, Elon Musk, is also adding bearish pressure on the market. This feud is caused by “big, beautiful bill”, Musk asked that it end EV subsidies and advance debt on the country. This combination of factors is having a strong impact on the crypto market, as Donald Trump and Elon Musk are known among the top crypto advocates for the crypto space, and the feud between them is affecting investors ‘ sentiment. Should We Be Concerned About Bitcoin Price? After the catastrophic last night for top crypto and altcoins, June 6th has shown a 3% rise to $103,976, also the recent 12-hour Rekt shows rising short liquidation compared to longs. This sudden optimism happened as the long-disputed and most argued trade talks between the US and China are set to restart , which has turned yesterday’s bearish situation, and kept the price of BTC above the previous month’s support zone. As per price action, it appears on the daily chart that this daily move took market liquidity by hitting several stop losses, and this could be a trigger point for an upcoming move northwards. Therefore, if things go south and pressure grows, then by June end the price could go as low as $92917. However, if things go north then this time $130K mark is the target for June-end.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-low-could-bitcoin-price-go-in-this-crypto-market-crash/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T12:20:18,"Best crypto presales to buy as Metaplanet plans major Bitcoin acquisition","Bitcoin dropped sharply on Thursday amid a broader market retreat, triggered by an unexpected and highly public spat between two of the most influential figures in tech and politics — US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The fallout, stemming from a series of political barbs and policy disagreements aired across social media and public appearances, caught markets off guard. Crypto assets were among the hardest hit, as risk sentiment deteriorated. Bitcoin (BTC), which had shown signs of stabilizing earlier in the week, plunged to a session low of $100,501 — a roughly 6% decline from this week’s high near $106,000. The drop effectively erased gains built on recent bullish momentum and renewed speculation about mainstream institutional adoption. As Bitcoin grapples with fresh bouts of volatility, retail traders are turning their attention toward high-risk, high-reward assets like Bitcoin Pepe , which has entered the closing stages of its presale. Capital chasing speculative upside is increasingly moving into nascent tokens, with investors positioning for gains in segments driven by momentum and the promise of outsized returns. In this shift, Bitcoin Pepe has gained prominence as a go-to option for those looking to ride market swings and capitalize on current sentiment. Metaplanet reveals major bet on Bitcoin Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced an ambitious $5.4 billion capital raise aimed at increasing its Bitcoin holdings, marking what it claims to be Asia’s largest equity financing to date for Bitcoin acquisition. The funding will be secured through the issuance of 555 million shares—equivalent to 92.4% of Metaplanet’s total shares outstanding—via moving strike warrants, Japan’s version of an at-the-market equity facility. The structure allows the company to incrementally sell shares over a two-year period to reduce market disruption. EVO FUND is the allottee, while Evolution Japan Securities serves as the arranger. “Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy bitcoin — again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our bitcoin strategy,” CEO Simon Gerovich said in a post on X. Simon Gerovich @gerovich · Follow Metaplanet has launched Asia’s largest-ever equity raise dedicated to Bitcoin:🚀 ¥770.9 billion (~$5.4B) capital raise📈 555 million shares via moving strike warrants🥇 First in Japan: issued at a premium to market — enabled by Metaplanet’s high volatility and deep liquidity 1:00 pm · 6 Jun 2025 695 Reply Copy link Read 51 replies Branded the “555 Million Plan,” this latest effort follows Metaplanet’s previous “210 Million Plan” and underscores its shift into a full-fledged Bitcoin treasury operation. The firm now aims to hold 30,000 BTC by end-2025 (up from 10,000), 100,000 BTC by end-2026 (from 21,000), and 210,000 BTC by end-2027—targeting ownership of 1% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin supply. To reach this goal, Metaplanet will use a mix of instruments beyond equity, including convertible bonds, preferred shares, and ordinary bonds, signaling a long-term, diversified approach to Bitcoin accumulation. Bitcoin Pepe is catching the market’s attention While Bitcoin weathers short-term price swings, its deepening integration into institutional finance is helping lay the groundwork for renewed market-wide momentum. Against this backdrop, investor interest is once again shifting toward speculative niches, with meme coins quickly drawing inflows. Among the names gaining traction is Bitcoin Pepe, which has captured attention for blending meme-driven appeal with blockchain infrastructure ambitions. Touted as one of 2025’s most closely followed presales, Bitcoin Pepe has stood out for its goal to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” aiming to combine Bitcoin’s robust security layer with the scalability associated with Solana. Unlike many meme tokens that rely primarily on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself with a technical roadmap. It has raised over $13.9 million during its ongoing presale, ahead of a listing announcement set for June 17. The project has also outlined several partnerships to bolster its Layer 2 ecosystem, teaming up with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. As capital continues to rotate into early-stage plays, Bitcoin Pepe is aiming to ride this momentum as it enters the final stretch of its token sale.
