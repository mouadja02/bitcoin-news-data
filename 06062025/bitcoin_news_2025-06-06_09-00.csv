His wild ride in the world of perpetual contracts (perps) and his confessions about how he handled that success have left many stunned and curious. Let‚Äôs dive in and see what happened behind the scenes of James Wynn‚Äôs rollercoaster journey. From Meme Coins to Millions In a recent tweet post, James Wynn said that he wasn‚Äôt always trading big. Before diving into Bitcoin perps, he was better known for calling out meme coins, where he made headlines by calling out Pepe Coin when it was worth only $600,000. His bet on Pepe turned into a huge success story, earning him an impressive eight-figure profit. This early win gave him confidence and a reputation as a risk-taker in the crypto community. I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in-fact never really traded properly before, I‚Äôve just traded meme coins. (Before I was known for calling pepe at 600k and making 8 figures). In one month I turned about $3m into $100m and then lost it all in‚Ä¶ ‚Äî James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 6, 2025 In March, James took his trading game up a notch, shifting from meme coins to Bitcoin perpetuals. Surprisingly, in just one month, he turned a starting balance of around $3 million into a jaw-dropping $100 million . His success was widely visible thanks to blockchain tracking, and he quickly gathered hundreds of thousands of followers eager to watch his next move. When Hype Becomes a Trap As James Wynn‚Äôs fame grew, so did the pressure. He felt he had to prove himself after turning $3 million into $100 million. But instead of careful trading, he started gambling, trying to get back the money he lost. He didn‚Äôt see the huge numbers on the screen as real money anymore. On May 19, Wynn made a risky Bitcoin trade using 40x leverage, starting with 5,520 BTC. He later added more Bitcoin, ending up with over 9,300 BTC, worth over $1 billion. At one point, he was up by $10 million. But when the U.S. tariff news hit, prices dropped fast. Wynn lost $60 million in one day. Even though he still had $25 million from earlier, in just a week, all his $100 million gains were gone, lost on the HyperLiquid platform. Warning and a Wink Despite the pain of losing so much, Wynn hasn‚Äôt lost his sense of humor. He even joked about using his affiliate link for those still wanting to trade, but his story is a reminder of the risks and rewards that come with high-stakes trading.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-wynn-how-a-high-risk-trader-lost-his-100-million-fortune/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare

Tesla dropped 15%, Bitcoin keeps sliding, and altcoins are also dropping fast. The crypto market cap is down 4.8% in the last 24 hours and the U.S. stocks also dipped slightly amidst the chaos. Cryptocurrencies Take Big Hit Bitcoin was down over 4% to $100,500 earlier today, and is close to dropping below $100K for the first time in a month. It is currently trading at $102,995. Other coins like Solana and SUI took big hits, falling more than 7%. Ethereum dropped 7.25%, XRP was down 4.35%, and Solana lost 5.2%. However, they have slightly recovered at the time of writing. The TRUMP meme coin crashed 9.3% during the Musk-Trump fight. Crypto stocks like Coinbase also fell 4.6%, MicroStrategy dropped 2.4%, and miners like MARA, Riot, and Core Scientific also fell about 5%. $1 Billion in Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in 24 hours, mostly from long bets. Bitcoin alone saw $341M in daily liquidations, while Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $278M outflows as institutions pulled back. Data from Glassnode showed that many long-term Bitcoin holders started selling after BTC hit a record $111,970 in May, raising the chances of a short-term price drop. ETH futures also saw a 5.5% drop in open interest and $260M in long liquidations. The sudden sell-off shows investors are getting worried as bigger economic risks and U.S. politics shake the crypto market. Reports hint that the White House is even holding emergency talks to see how this might affect the economy. Politics Getting in the Way? With good news around rate cuts and rising institutional buys, politics is clouding the market mood. Bitcoin is hanging tough around $100K, but if long liquidations continue, it could drop to around $95,000‚Äì$98,000 before finding solid support. However, traders are confident that Bitcoin will hit $120,000 by the year-end. The strong corporate buying and low volatility have kept the optimism high, with a 69% chance on the Polymarket betting platform. Corporate investors now hold nearly 810,000 BTC worth $85 billion, almost double from last year.

U.S. President Donald Trump and the world‚Äôs richest person, Elon Musk, hurled deeply personal insults over matters significant and insignificant. The President argued that it all started after he took away Elon‚Äôs EV Mandate, which forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted. Trump noted that the easiest way to save money in the U.S. budget was to terminate Elon‚Äôs Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed with Elon. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we‚Äôre going to cut the EV mandate.‚Äù -U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said the bill was one of the greatest ever presented to Congress, with a record cut in expenses of $1.6 trillion. He says there will be a 68% tax increase if the legislation doesn‚Äôt pass. Musk called for Trump‚Äôs impeachment and mocked his connections to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump also claimed that Tesla‚Äôs mogul had gone ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and threatened to cancel his multi-billion dollar federal contracts and tax subsidies for Musk‚Äôs companies. The tech billionaire had complained for weeks about the budget bill, using the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to estimate the legislation would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Musk condemned the bill as a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination.‚Äù The SpaceX owner responded to Trump‚Äôs claims, accusing the President of lying about the bill and being ungrateful for the millions he spent to get elected. Musk argued that Trump would have lost the election without him, Democrats would have controlled the House, and the Republicans would have been 51-49 in the Senate. Trump acknowledged that Musk‚Äôs contributions did not affect his winning the battleground in Pennsylvania. He also posted on Truth Social that he had fired Musk from his role as a special adviser because he was ‚Äúwearing thin‚Äù at the White House. The Tesla mogul retaliated, saying the reason the Trump administration had not released the files into Epstein was because they implicated the President. Musk also quote-tweeted a post calling for Trump to be removed from office and said his tariffs would cause a recession. Shares in Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle company, Tesla, dropped almost 15% on Thursday afternoon,n coinciding with when Trump‚Äôs remarks began. The tech billionaire‚Äôs rocket company, SpaceX, is not publicly traded, but competitors to the firm surged on the news. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-06T06:42:01,"RichMiner announced: XRP achieved new financial heights through BTC and DOGE new energy cloud mining","The carbon compliance requirements of the EU Crypto-Asset Market Regulation Act (MiCA) are like the sword of Damocles hanging high, and traditional mining farms are struggling between closure and sky-high fines. RichMiner has torn a crack of counter-trend growth-in the first quarter of 2025, its global user revenue soared 58% year-on-year, and some American investors‚Äô carbon certificate premium income even exceeded the basic mining income. This article focuses on how RichMiner uses green electricity and low-carbon mining and guides new users on how to join RichMiner to obtain higher mining income. Why is green electricity + cloud mining an inevitable trend? The European Union (MiCA) requires the disclosure of mining carbon footprints and the comprehensive withdrawal of thermal power mines-ending high energy consumption mode. The premise for companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy to hold Bitcoin is ‚Äúclean energy mining‚Äù, and ESG ratings have become a capital entry pass. Surveys show that 73% of investors are willing to pay a premium for ‚Äúlow-carbon cryptocurrencies‚Äù. RichMiner‚Äôs secret to achieving soaring returns for holders: Dynamic green electricity + AI scheduling system to maximize returns; Technical essence ‚Äì Dynamic optimization of mining energy consumption through AI matching grid load troughs with renewable energy (wind power/photovoltaic) production peaks. Automatic operation and maintenance monitoring ‚Äì AI monitors the operating status of mining machines around the clock, automatically repairs abnormalities, and ensures stable operation. Dynamic switching: The platform‚Äôs AI algorithm analyzes the market (coin price, computing power demand) in real time, and automatically allocates computing power to the highest-yielding currency (such as BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.) to protect your income. AI + cloud computing power = a new generation of smart mining experience Join RichMiner, let technology make money for you, and let intelligence change the future! Compliance and stability foundation, peace of mind investment protection; Data encryption transmission: Adopt SSL/TLS encryption protocol to ensure the absolute security of user data during transmission. Cold wallet asset storage: Most of the platform‚Äôs digital assets use a cold wallet storage mechanism to isolate network risks and prevent hacker attacks. Regular security audits: Regular platform audits are conducted through a third-party security team to promptly fix vulnerabilities and continuously improve the platform‚Äôs defense capabilities. Green enhancement of the revenue cycle; Users do not need to bear the surge in electricity prices caused by fossil energy prices or policy regulation, and the revenue is more stable. The platform deploys renewable energy mines around the world, directly using solar and wind power to generate electricity, and the electricity cost is only 60% of that of traditional mines. In response to global regulatory trends, new regulations such as the EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúMarkets in Crypto-Assets Act‚Äù (MiCA) set limits on high-carbon emission mining, green mining has become a compliance requirement, and platform qualifications are protected from policy shocks. Mining Guide: Three steps from registration to revenue; Register and start: If you register, you will receive a computing power bonus of $15. Choose to purchase contracts to obtain revenue: RichMine‚Äôs contracts focus on efficiency-short term, fast return, and full return. The following chart shows the potential revenue; The platform has launched a series of stable and high-yield contracts, which you can view on the RichMiner official website). Withdrawal and reinvestment: Daily income can be withdrawn to the wallet or invested in higher-level contracts to obtain more mining income. Conclusion: With the deep integration of green energy and blockchain technology, ‚Äúlow-carbon cloud mining‚Äù is moving from concept to practice. RichMiner has opened up a sustainable passive income path for investors through three core strategies: clean power deployment, zero hardware operation and maintenance, and intelligent income reinvestment.

Despite all the talk about crypto changing payments, most businesses still won‚Äôt take digital money. SpacePay , a London startup, wants to change that by working with the card machines shops already have. The platform supports hundreds of crypto wallets and gives merchants their money in regular currency right away. What really catches attention is their 0.5% transaction fee. Compare that to the 2.5% to 3.5% that credit card companies usually charge, and you start to see why merchants might be interested. They‚Äôve raised over $1.1 million so far in their presale, with $SPY tokens going for $0.003181 each. Why Shop Owners Hate Credit Card Fees Anyone who‚Äôs run a small business knows the pain of payment processing fees. Every time someone swipes a card, the payment companies take their cut. It adds up fast. Think about your local pizza place. If they‚Äôre doing $25,000 in sales each month and paying the typical 3% in processing fees, that‚Äôs $750 disappearing every month. Over a year, they‚Äôre handing over $9,000 to payment processors. Now imagine if they could cut that down to just $125 per month with SpacePay‚Äôs 0.5% fee. That extra $625 monthly could pay for better ingredients, cover utilities, or help during slow months. For small businesses running tight budgets, savings like this actually matter. The reason SpacePay can offer such low fees comes down to cutting out the middlemen. When you pay with a regular credit card, your money bounces between several different companies before reaching the store owner. Each one takes a piece. SpacePay uses blockchain tech to create a shorter path from customer to merchant. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1928029812762841119 The Crypto Presale Numbers Tell a Story SpacePay‚Äôs presale has pulled in over $1.1 million, which suggests people see potential in what they‚Äôre building. Unlike a lot of crypto projects that exist mainly on paper, SpacePay tackles problems that actually exist in the real world. Their token setup looks pretty reasonable too. Out of 34 billion total $SPY tokens, they‚Äôre only keeping 5% for the founding team. That‚Äôs way less than the 20% or 30% that many crypto founders grab for themselves. The biggest chunk ‚Äì 20% ‚Äì goes to regular people in the public presale. The rest gets spread around for partnerships, marketing, user rewards, and keeping the lights on. It‚Äôs the kind of distribution you‚Äôd expect from a team thinking long-term instead of looking for a quick cash grab. Token holders get some decent perks. Monthly rewards for active users, voting rights on platform decisions, early access to new features, and a cut of the revenue. As more businesses start using SpacePay, token holders could see benefits from that growth. Visit SpacePay Presale Fixing Crypto‚Äôs Biggest Problem for Merchants Here‚Äôs why most store owners won‚Äôt touch crypto: the prices jump around like crazy. Accept $100 worth of Bitcoin in the morning, and by afternoon it might only be worth $85. No business can operate that way. SpacePay solved this with a pretty clever system. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets regular money deposited instantly. The shop owner doesn‚Äôt have to worry about Bitcoin crashing or soaring ‚Äì they just get their $100, period. The system locks in the exchange rate for those few seconds it takes to process the payment. If crypto prices go wild during that time, SpacePay absorbs the difference. The merchant sees a normal payment hitting their account, no drama. This takes away the biggest excuse merchants use to avoid crypto. They don‚Äôt need to become traders or watch price charts. They just run their business and get paid predictably. Working with What‚Äôs Already There Most crypto payment systems want merchants to buy expensive new equipment and train their staff on complicated new processes. That‚Äôs a hard sell for busy business owners. SpacePay went the other direction. Their system works with those Android card readers you see everywhere. Just install some software, and suddenly that same machine can take crypto payments from hundreds of different wallets. For customers, paying feels totally normal. Scan a QR code, tap confirm, done. No typing long wallet addresses where one wrong character loses your money forever. The whole thing takes seconds. Since it works with over 325 different crypto wallets, customers can use whatever app they already have. Whether they‚Äôre into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other coin, chances are SpacePay supports it. Getting In on the Action People interested in SpacePay can join their presale by heading to the official website and connecting a crypto wallet. The current price sits at $0.003181 per token, and they accept payments in ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDT, USDC, or even regular bank cards for people new to crypto.

The bounce reflects an early effort by bulls to reclaim lost ground, but the overall structure remains fragile following the recent break below the short-term channel support.

2025-06-06T06:06:05,"Institutional Demand for Bitcoin ETFs Cools for First Time","CoinShares reported a 23% drop in institutional Bitcoin ETF exposure, which fell from $27.4 billion in Q4 of 2024 to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025. Price depreciation and active sell-offs both played a role. Interestingly, financial advisers slightly increased their holdings, but overall sentiment shifted toward corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT saw record outflows in late May, while treasury-focused firms like Strategy ramped up accumulation. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group filed for a new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with Crypto.com as custodian, but raised concerns over a clause allowing affiliated parties to front-run trades. In Romania, the postal service installed its first Bitcoin ATM. Despite positive momentum, only 4% of the global population owns Bitcoin, which means that there is still a lot of room for the crypto king to grow. Bitcoin ETF Activity Dips Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by institutional investors experienced the first quarterly decline since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. A recent report from CoinShares revealed that institutional exposure to Bitcoin fell to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025, down from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024. This is a 23% drop. Institutions decreased their Bitcoin exposure (Source: CoinShares ) While the majority of this decrease was attributed to an 11% decline in Bitcoin's price over the period, the report also revealed that many investors actively reduced their holdings. This indicates a combination of valuation loss and deliberate selling. Interestingly, financial advisers emerged as an exception by modestly increasing their Bitcoin ETF holdings during the quarter. The broader trend, however, pointed to a shift away from ETF-driven strategies toward corporate-level adoption of Bitcoin for treasury reserves. This transition means that there is a growing preference for long-term savings and value preservation over short-term trading opportunities. Financial advisers increased their Bitcoin holdings in Q1 2025 (Source: CoinShares ) This changing investment behavior was noticed with major developments in Q2 as well. On May 30, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its largest single-day outflow to date, with over $430 million withdrawn after a streak of 31 consecutive days of inflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin treasury companies increased their holdings considerably. CoinShares data indicates that these companies held over 1.98 million BTC by the end of Q1, an 18.6% increase year-to-date. Strategy, the leading corporate holder, acquired 15,355 BTC on April 28 alone and has been consistently buying in 17 of the past 20 weeks through June 2025, according to SaylorTracker . ETF flows remained volatile during the first half of the year, and were heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic narratives. While many institutional players looked for safety in US government bonds due to uncertain market conditions, rising bond yields suggest that confidence in these traditional havens may be diminishing. Analysts now speculate that Bitcoin's long-term growth may be fueled more by declining demand for US bonds than by continued inflows into ETFs. Trump‚Äôs Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF Despite these findings from CoinShares, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company majority-owned by US President Donald Trump and parent firm of the Truth Social platform, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF. The proposed product is called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, and was formally introduced through an initial registration statement on Form S-1 filed on June 5. According to the company‚Äôs filing, the ETF will primarily hold Bitcoin through a custodian and is designed to reflect the performance of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs market price. Announcement from TMTG This move follows a separate submission by NYSE Arca, which proposed listing the ETF on its exchange on behalf of Yorkville America Digital, a crypto asset manager and partner of TMTG. The product, if approved, will enter the very competitive landscape of US-based Bitcoin ETFs seeking to capture institutional and retail investor interest in digital assets. One key structural feature of the proposed ETF is its partnership with Crypto.com , which is set to serve as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider for the trust. The filing shared that Crypto.com agreed to offer certain services exclusively to the ETF‚Äôs trust, although specific management and transaction fees for the fund have not been revealed yet. The filing also contains a clause that raises eyebrows: it permits the ETF sponsor and related parties to potentially front-run the fund‚Äôs Bitcoin transactions. While such language is typically softened or accompanied by conflict-of-interest mitigation in other filings, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF explicitly warns prospective shareholders that affiliated entities may take positions in Bitcoin that are ahead of or opposite to those of the fund, which could negatively impact the ETF‚Äôs performance. Additionally, the filing confirms that shareholders will not receive the benefits of any new assets resulting from blockchain forks. In the event of such an event, the trust will forfeit the Incidental Rights and any corresponding forked assets, essentially removing any future claim for holders. Romanian Post Installs First Bitcoin ATM Meanwhile, Po»ôta Rom√¢nƒÉ, Romania‚Äôs national postal service, recently took a big step toward digital innovation by installing its first Bitcoin ATM in a branch located in the city of Tulcea. This initiative was launched in partnership with the local crypto exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR), and it is the beginning of a broader plan to integrate cryptocurrency services across the country. According to the official announcement , more Bitcoin ATMs are set to be deployed in other cities, including Alexandria, Piatra Neam»õ, Boto»ôani, and NƒÉdlac. The move is part of a plan by the postal service to modernize its infrastructure and extend digital financial services to underserved and remote communities. Despite the positive momentum, Bitcoin adoption worldwide is still relatively limited. While enthusiasm continues to grow, especially among retail users and businesses adopting BTC as a payment method or a treasury reserve asset, the total number of global Bitcoin holders is still a very small fraction of the population. According to a Q1 2025 report from Bitcoin financial services firm River, only about 4% of the world‚Äôs population currently owns Bitcoin. In the United States, the figure is a bit higher at an estimated 14%. Overall, these results show that adoption is progressing unevenly across regions. River‚Äôs report also pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than $100 increased to almost 30 million in January, which was a 25% year-over-year rise. However, analysts warn that Bitcoin‚Äôs total addressable market remains under 1%, with limited retail penetration and institutional allocation. BTC‚Äôs market cap compared to the global market (Source: River ) Assuming Bitcoin could eventually secure a 50% share of the global store-of-value market‚Äîan estimated $225 trillion in assets such as cash, real estate, equities, precious metals, and art‚Äîits current $2 trillion market cap suggests that there is still a lot of room for long-term growth.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9462/institutional-demand-for-bitcoin-et-fs-cools-for-first-time,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T06:04:48,"Crypto Markets See Red as Trump-Musk Bromance Ends in Flames","Total crypto market capitalization declined by around $170 billion in a fall to $3.26 trillion on June 5, its lowest level since May 8, almost a month ago. Markets are now poised for a further fall below longer-term levels if current support levels break down. However, the decline slowed during early trading in Asia on Friday morning, with a minor recovery to $3.3 trillion. Donald vs Elon The sharp decline appears to have been driven by a spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who said the former‚Äôs tariffs ‚Äúwill cause a recession in the second half of this year,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCongress is spending America into bankruptcy!‚Äù on June 5. As the war of words on each of their respective social media networks escalated, and the bromance collapsed, Musk also said : ‚ÄúIn light of the President‚Äôs statement about the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.‚Äù In light of the President‚Äôs statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 For more than a week, Elon Musk has been trashing Trump‚Äôs signature piece of legislation, a spending bill called One Big Beautiful Bill. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago.

Around 228,000 traders were wrecked, almost 90% of them in BTC long positions, and the total liquidations were around $988 million, it noted. However, analysts had predicted that a leverage flushout was overdue, with open interest on Bitcoin futures markets hitting all-time highs recently. Bitcoin lost almost $5,000 in a matter of hours, falling to a 4-week low just below $101,000 in late trading on Thursday. However, it found support there and recovered marginally to reach $102,800 during Asian trading on Friday. Analyst ‚ÄúCrypNuevo‚Äù said that a quick bounce from this level was unlikely and more consolidation could occur, unless the sell-off accelerates. $BTC update: Plan is playing out so far!

2025-06-06T06:04:41,"Uber signals interest in stablecoins to streamline global payments","Ride-hailing company Uber is exploring the use of stablecoins to streamline global payments and reduce transaction costs associated with cross-border transactions. During his appearance at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on 5 June, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed the company is in the ‚Äústudy phase‚Äù of evaluating stablecoins as a potential tool for international money movement. Stablecoins offer ‚Äúa practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,‚Äù describing the technology as ‚Äúsuper interesting‚Äù for global businesses. According to Khosrowshahi, while opinions on Bitcoin vary, stablecoins stand out for their utility in payments. ‚ÄúEspecially for global companies that are moving money around globally, stablecoin is quite promising,‚Äù he added. Stablecoins are digital tokens engineered to mirror the value of traditional currencies, most often the US dollar. Anchored by reserves such as cash or short-term government bonds, they blend the rapid settlement and borderless nature of crypto with the trust and stability of fiat. You might also like: Circle IPO debuts strong as CRCL gains over 120% on day 1 As digital commerce scales globally, stablecoins are becoming essential infrastructure , with an increasing number of enterprises treating them as tools for financial operations . As previously reported by crypto.news, Fireblocks‚Äô 2025 ‚ÄúState of Stablecoins‚Äù survey found that 90% of the surveyed financial institutions were actively integrating stablecoins into their systems. These include major banks, payment processors, and fintech platforms, many of which now process millions of stablecoin transactions each month. Speed was cited as the top advantage by nearly half the respondents, with cost savings and liquidity also ranking high on the list of strategic benefits driving adoption. Besides Uber, other major companies have also shown interest recently. Stripe‚Äôs co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the company has been in early discussions with banks on stablecoin integration. Much of the momentum behind stablecoins can be traced to a global shift toward clearer, more supportive policy frameworks. For instance, in the U.S., lawmakers introduced the bipartisan GENIUS Act , establishing a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins by outlining various requirements for stablecoin issuers. Elsewhere, in Europe, the rollout of MiCA has set a new standard for how digital assets are treated, giving companies firmer ground to build on. At the same time, regulatory developments have also been observed across Asia, in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong , Singapore , and Pakistan , among others. Read more: Why is crypto down today?

ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle - something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. By Elior Manier Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) had a rough beginning of 2025 - failing to reach new all-time highs, while Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) smashed through its own ATH multiple times. Solana ( SOL-USD ), providing a cheaper alternative to ETH services, also held stronger than the Ether throughout the latter part of 2024 and beginning 2025. ETH performance is key to the overall crypto market performance; the past Altcoin cycles have always been led by ETH performance over BTC. ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. Through this crypto market update, you will see how ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle, something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. ETH/BTC and its Correlation to total Market Performance ETH/BTC and Total Crypto Market Cap, 2017 to End 2021 (Source: TradingView) This 2017-2021 chart of ETH/BTC contains essential information about understanding the crypto market. Through 1 and 2, we observe how the first bull run in ETH and ETH/BTC led to the 2017 total crypto market bull run - taking the market cap from $20-30B average to highs of $620B in November 2017. Number 3 on the chart shows how a drop in ETH/BTC leads to a significant cooldown of the crypto market, going back towards a total market cap between $100 and $250B from 2018 to the end of 2020. From end-2020 to the end of 2021, number 4 shows the same correlation of ETH/BTC and crypto markets rallying. This Covid-era bull run introduced crypto for an ever-bigger number of investors, and led to the flurry of altcoins and cryptocurrency projects such as Doge, Avax, Solana. The crypto market cap went from $300B to $2.86T, and this level only got reached again in November 2024. Finally, number 5 shows similarly to number 3 how the drop in market cap correlates with a drop in the ETH/BTC spread. ETH/BTC from 2020 to Today ETH/BTC and Bitcoin, 2020 to June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) We take a closer look at the 2021 Bull Run and how the December 2021 top in ETH/BTC led again a significant correction in the crypto market. 2023 was all about Bitcoin Dominance as its rally from $14,475 to its record highs of $112,030 left Ethereum and all other altcoins lagging. We are seeing a breakout from the descent that started at the same level as the 2020 ETH/BTC bullish breakout - we will see if the spread continues upward and if it generates another bull run for altcoins. ETH Daily Chart ETH Daily Chart, June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) ETH had a consequent rally after a significant drop between $4,000 highs in December 2024 to $1,363 lows in April 2025. Prices are consolidating between $2,300 and $2,600.

2025-06-06T05:42:56,"Lone Bitcoin Miner Strikes Gold: Earns $330,000 by Mining a Full Block Solo","In an incredible event of fortune and timing, a lone Bitcoin miner has successfully mined a whole block all by themselves, with no help from a mining pool or a sponsor like a bank or corporation. They earned a reward of 3.151 BTC, a windfall presently worth over $330,000. These underdog events shine a light on the resilient decentralization of the Bitcoin network, even if some may now use that phrase as a euphemism for its security flaws. In the early morning hours, a rare event took place that caught the crypto community‚Äôs eye and kicked off discussions about whether solo mining is a feasible option these days, given that the mining landscape seems dominated by industrial-scale mining operations. A One-in-a-Million Moment The block, officially mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC, was verified as valid and included in the Bitcoin blockchain. The total reward of 3.151 BTC consisted of the standard extbf{3.125 BTC block subsidy}, plus an additional extbf{0.026 BTC in transaction fees} amounting to roughly $2,761. The block itself measured 1.66 megabytes in size and included a standard assortment of transactions. This achievement was accomplished by a solo miner even while the Bitcoin network‚Äôs total hashrate was over 600 exahashes per second. Most of the computational work that was assembled from the many mining operations that were running at that time was directed towards solving the puzzles that, when solved, would produce valid Bitcoin blocks. The odds of a single miner successfully completing one of those puzzles and finding a valid block were, of course, exceedingly low. **Bitcoin Miner Hits the Jackpot!** Solo CK mined block 899,826 on June 5, 2025, scoring 3.151 BTC (~$330,386)! Here's the breakdown: ‚Ä¢ Mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC ‚Ä¢ Reward: 3.125 BTC subsidy + 0.026 BTC fees ($2,761) ‚Ä¢ Block size: 1.66 MB pic.twitter.com/vJuQoh4YAW ‚Äî Ahmed Osman (@Ahmedot2Osman) June 5, 2025 Though the exact hardware used by the miner remains unspecified, the consensus among experts is that the conditions‚Äîsuccessful mining, that is‚Äîwould necessitate powerful rigs like the Antminer S21 or WhatsMiner M60, both well-regarded for not just their efficiency, but their sheer output of hash power. Even so, elite equipment alone doesn‚Äôt tip the scales toward success; the miner has to have a significant chunk of the global hasrate under his influence. Why Solo Mining Is Rare ‚Äî and Risky In the domain of Bitcoin mining, the majority of players opt to associate themselves with mining pools, for instance, F2Pool, AntPool, or ViaBTC. These mining assemble the computational might of thousands of miners, dishing out smaller, consistent rewards instead of the solitary, do-or-die nature of mining all by oneself. Mining alone means doing everything a miner must do to find a block and then submitting that block to the network. If a solo miner finds a block, the reward is theirs and theirs alone. Obviously, this is a tremendous payday. And for us to even talk about it here, it must happen in the real world. So, let‚Äôs look at what it takes to mine alone, and after that, we‚Äôll consider what it means to have a real-life payday scenario. These infrequent solo victories do happen, though, as demonstrated by the most recent case of a miner using Solo CK, a known solo mining pool that still preserves the spirit of decentralized mining by enabling individuals to point their hardware toward block discovery without profit sharing. A Testament to Bitcoin‚Äôs Decentralization Even though industrial mining farms and large, centralized pools of hashing power are on the rise, the occasional story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner is a powerful reminder that the Bitcoin network‚Äôs decentralized architecture is alive and well. This is a story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner. By ‚Äúsuccessful,‚Äù I mean this individual consistently brings in Bitcoin rewards (‚Äúmined‚Äù a few himself, but has ‚Äúearned‚Äù quite a few more through participating in the Bitcoin network). By ‚Äúnetwork,‚Äù I mean the assemblage of many computers all over the planet, doing many computations. By ‚Äúdecentralized architecture,‚Äù I mean a system of many nodes by which no one node, or set of nodes, can control the whole system. The miner‚Äôs triumph has unleashed torrents of excitement and admiration throughout online spaces. It also resurrects a vital discussion: even in a massively parallel, technologically state-of-the-art mining world, Bitcoin remains a theoretically level playing field. It is yet to be seen whether more people will be encouraged to take a stab at solo mining. But this moment serves as evidence that the solo mining dream is not dead. It‚Äôs just incredibly hard. The global mining landscape is evolving rapidly. This makes it all the more crucial to illuminate why Bitcoin inspires and captivates people all around the world. It‚Äôs not simply about the cash that‚Äôs involved. It‚Äôs about the very ethos of this network: permissionless participation and decentralized opportunity.

2025-06-06T05:41:27,"Ether Trader Bets Millions on ETH Blasting Above $3.4K by June-End","Last month, CoinDesk reported that big money is becoming increasingly bullish on ether ETH, with price charts indicating a potential rally above $3,000. New evidence has now emerged, supporting those claims. On Thursday, a trader paid a premium of over $2 million to purchase a total of 61,000 contracts of June-end expiry ether call options at strikes $3,200 and $3,400, according to data source crypto options exchange Deribit. Theoretically, the $3,200 call is a bet that ether's price will rise from the current $2,460 to over $3,200 by the end of the month. The purchase of the $3,400 call indicates expectations for a move above that level. In other words, the trader anticipates a price surge of over 30% in three weeks. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium for the asymmetric upside exposure. The premium paid, in this case, $2 million, is the maximum amount the buyer stands to lose in case the market doesn't rise as expected. Stars align for bulls The bullish flow is consistent with the renewed optimism among some analysts about ether's price prospects. According to Youwei Yang,¬†Ph.D.,¬†chief economist at¬†BIT Mining, protocol upgrades, institutional moves, and anticipation around new financial products have all come together to restore investor confidence in ether. Ether's parent blockchain, Ethereum, recently implemented the Pectra upgrade to enhance scalability, validator flexibility, and user experience, introducing key features like EIP-7702 to enable regular wallets to leverage smart contract capabilities. ""The Pectra upgrade , which went live on May 7, has been a key turning point. By raising the validator cap from 32 to 2,048¬†ETH¬†and doubling blob throughput,¬†Ethereum¬†took a major step forward in both staking efficiency and Layer-2 scalability,"" Yang said in an email to CoinDesk. ""It‚Äôs a clear signal that the network is serious about scaling and improving its core infrastructure. That‚Äôs the kind of technical progress that brings not just developers, but also users and capital, back into the ecosystem,"" Yang added. Yang cited SharpLink Gaming‚Äôs announcement that it would move $425 million into¬†Ethereum¬†as a treasury reserve asbold endorsement of ether as the corporate Treasury asset. ""It reminds us of the early wave of Bitcoin treasury adoption by corporates, and it could be just the beginning of something similar for¬†ETH,"" Yang noted. Lastly, speaking of institutional adoption, speculation has been circulating that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot ether ETF with a staking mechanism, opening doors for institutions to take exposure to both the price and the staking yield, a feature missing in BTC ETFs.

2025-06-06T05:34:50,"Bitcoin Whales Return to Accumulation as On-Chain Activity Surges","The on-chain Bitcoin metrics are showing once more that they are pleased with what they see‚Äîthat hefty investors and little ones are both accumulating again in the face of a network that is waking up from its slumber and starting to do all sorts of things halt and signal traffic on the blockchain. After a slight divergence in the direction of the wallets, the balance making up the distribution cohort has fallen off, and it seems like the path of least resistance with Bitcoin is up, back over the $100,000 mark. The renewed on-chain interaction is feeding the engine of market optimism. Meanwhile, the institutional flows into spot bitcoin ETFs seem to have stabilized. BlackRock‚Äôs fund in particular has captured the attention of investors. Wallet Activity Signals Growing Market Confidence On-chain analytics data show us that all main wallet groups are in accumulation mode right now. The main event, though, is taking place at two very different ends of the spectrum: We have wallets that hold less than 1 BTC, and we have wallets that hold between 10 and 100 BTC. Both of these groups have hit an accumulation score of 1.0‚Äîbasically the highest score you can get‚Äîand it indicates that they are both very widespread and also doing some pretty well-synchronized buying. This development shows a strong contrast with prior weeks, in which it seemed that bigger investors were cutting back on their exposure or remaining on the sidelines in response to the presence of market uncertainty. This renewed activity now seems to imply that these larger holders are either positioning for a potential breakout or, more probably, expressing confidence that Bitcoin‚Äôs current levels are a buying opportunity. What is especially remarkable is that accumulation is not confined to whales. Lesser retail holders are also amassing a considerable amount and showing very strong buying behavior. This, most often, is a signal that these small retail holders are long-term holders and is also a signal that grassroots adoption is taking place. On-Chain Activity Hits Multi-Month Highs Momentum is building in the network activity of Bitcoin, with multiple metrics registering their most robust performances in months. The most recent day for which we have data, May 29, saw over 556,830 new Bitcoin wallets created‚Äîno day since December 2, 2023, has been even close to that in terms of sheer amount. And the reason I find this most interesting is because (now, I‚Äôm going to speak more generally about all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin) a growing number of wallet-holders is a very good sign for the overall health of a cryptocurrency‚Äôs ecosystem. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10‚Äì100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 ‚Äì the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 Adding to the feel-good factor, June 2 saw 241,360 BTC move across the blockchain‚Äîthe most coins sent since December 8, 2024. We typically don‚Äôt like to draw too many conclusions from single days, but this is a sizeable figure and could indicate that the Bitcoin network is seeing an uptick in user activity‚Äîwhether trading, transferring, or otherwise moving assets around. Although price often rules market sentiment, these developments really show what direction the network is headed in. If they‚Äôre building a price bottom, then user and developer activity is much more desirable than just the network being used temporarily for price speculation. A close watch is being kept by investors because rising on-chain engagement, with prices being relatively stable, can often be a hint of an underlying build-up of momentum that precedes breakout movements‚Äîupward or downward. Institutional Flows Remain Focused on BlackRock‚Äôs ETF Even with the overall uncertainty of the traditional markets, the sector of Bitcoin ETFs available for direct investment is attracting a not-too-shabby amount of institutional inflows. As of June 4, the combined net inflow across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs was $86.92 million. Even ETF skeptics like Bloomberg‚Äôs James Seyffart have been warming up to the idea that, in 2023, the Bitcoin ETF sector has the look of a legitimate business. Interestingly, on the day, the only fund to see a net inflow was BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Others either stayed even or experienced slight outflows. Continued preference for IBIT further consolidates BlackRock‚Äôs presence in the Bitcoin ETF space and also is a nice little shot of credibility for the digital asset sector. The net positive flows coming back‚Äîconcentrated in just one issuer, it must be noted‚Äîsignal that institutional investors aren‚Äôt pulling back entirely. They‚Äôre still in the market but seem to be doing a more refined, selective kind of allocation. And when you see selective allocation by big, smart money, it‚Äôs usually to what‚Äôs perceived as the safest and most credible holdings. With Bitcoin holding steady at just below $105,000, renewed wallet accumulation, record highs in on-chain activity, and an ETF flow that can only be described as resilient combine to present an intricate but optimistic look for the market. We are in a period right now, however, where the market has not yet broken out and up decisively. Consequently, it seems wise to stay vigilant, perhaps even bearish for now, until we do see that break. But from where we sit, the combination of these various factors likely means the market has a good shot at getting up and over, rather than back down under, the $100,000 line with Bitcoin. How long it takes and how close we edge up to the actual line figure before the breakout occurs is the present mystery. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin BTC dropped below $101,000 overnight before bouncing modestly, with DOGE and ADA among the worst hit, down over 6% each in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest crypto assets, shed over 5%. Data from CoinGlass shows that traders lost $988 million in liquidations ‚Äî of which $888 million were long positions ‚Äî indicative of a wipeout in bullish positions. Exchanges like Bybit and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Bybit alone accounting for nearly $354 million in liquidations. The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $342 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Ether ETH followed with $286 million, reflecting the sharp sell-offs across the broader market. Other tokens like Solana's SOL and Dogecoin DOGE saw $51 million and $27 million liquidated, respectively, as altcoin traders found themselves on the wrong side of the sudden downturn. XRP XRP wasn‚Äôt spared either, with $23 million in positions wiped out. The data also shows that high-leverage plays on memecoins, such as 1000PEPE, added to the volatility, as traders rushed to exit. Liquidations to the forced closure of a trader's leveraged position when they can no longer meet the margin requirements. This typically occurs when the price of the underlying asset moves against their position, causing them to lose a large portion, or all, of their initial investment. A cascade of liquidations often indicates market extremes, where a price reversal could be imminent as market sentiment overshoots in one direction. The sell-off comes as Trump accused Musk of going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and threatened to terminate government contracts with his companies, while Musk lashed back by linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs files. The clash overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, intensifying a profit-taking bout from the start of this week.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/06/bitcoin-ether-bulls-hit-with-800m-liquidation-as-trump-musk-tussle-rattles-btc-eth,"BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|XRP|Dogecoin|Liquidations|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|market analysis|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare

The TMTG has yet to file official documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Nevada registration may be the legal foundation for a potential spot or futures-based crypto ETF under the Truth Social brand. TMTG registered its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF first According to Nevada‚Äôs public business records filed on June 3, Trump‚Äôs media company registered its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. Shortly after, NYSE Arca submitted Form 19b-4 to the SEC on behalf of Florida-based Yorkville America Digital, requesting approval to list and trade shares of the ETF. Per the filing, Yorkville America Digital will manage the ETF‚Äôs operations and the fund listed on NYSE Arca on approval. Later, on June 5, Yorkville America Digital filed an S-1 registration statement with the commission for the Bitcoin fund. On the same day, the TMTG registered its Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in Nevada. The ETF offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading crypto assets by market cap, and thus may draw in a number of investors. Some have speculated that the fund could eventually include spot- and futures-based investments. Critics, however, believe the company‚Äôs crypto assets, if approved, will not offer long-term stability. Dave Nadig, an independent ETF expert, remarked, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs extraordinarily unlikely that products like [Truth Social Bitcoin ETF] gain long-term assets.‚Äù The media company‚Äôs growing interest in ETF coincides with the increasing optimism over Bitcoin, which has traded above $100,000 in the last few weeks. In May, the media company also said‚ÄÇit planned to raise $1.5 billion in equity and another $1 billion in convertible notes for a ‚Äúbitcoin treasury.‚Äù Addressing a BTC conference in Las Vegas one week later, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. touted cryptocurrencies as a cheaper, faster, and transparent alternative to fiat currency. Trump Jr added that crypto is now a ‚Äúhuge part‚Äù of all they do. He later distanced himself and his family from a Trump-themed Bitcoin trading app, saying the Trump Organization had nothing to do with the project. Nonetheless, the Trump family‚Äôs World Liberty Financial is set to introduce a crypto wallet soon. TMTG DJT shares fell 8% on Thursday after Trump and Musk‚Äôs fallout. Meanwhile, TMTG shares under the ticker DJT dropped 8% Thursday after President Donald Trump‚Äôs fallout with billionaire Elon Musk. Their feud began with their difference over a tax and spending bill. Later, the president openly declared that he would cut off all government contracts with Musk-owned companies, while Musk suggested he should be impeached on his social media platform X. Since then, in just a few hours, Tesla lost about $150 billion and closed down 14.3% on Thursday. Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group, commented on their fallout: Billionaire spats rarely have any lasting impacts on markets, but this fallout was more than predictable. At some point, there was bound to be some divergence in priorities that led to a split between Trump and Musk. Jamie Cox Mark Malek, Chief Investment Officer at Siebert Financial, also argued that the public is more worried about how the Senate will ‚Äúskinny down this big beautiful bill.‚Äù than the potential deficit.

The rift came to a head on June 5 during a White House meeting with the German chancellor, where Trump voiced his displeasure with Musk , who until recently had been one of his closest advisers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed in Elon,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve helped Elon a lot.‚Äù Musk wasted no time responding.

His sudden departure from that inner circle has left a noticeable void in tech-policy alignment, with markets now unsure of how the administration will proceed on key issues such as electric vehicles and space infrastructure. Adding to the uncertainty, Musk has hinted at launching a new political movement altogether.

Bitcoin is down by more than 3% and this shift in sentiment is partly due to an unexpected clash between Elon Musk and the U.S. President Donald Trump, which has been making headlines. While it‚Äôs not a full-blown financial crisis, the uncertainty is enough to make investors a bit jittery ‚Äî and markets generally don‚Äôt react well to surprises. On the technical front, Bitcoin‚Äôs RSI (Relative Strength Index) is trending downward, hinting that it might soon enter the oversold territory. Bitcoin could test the $98,000 support level if the downward trend continues. Although this drop is worrying for some, it‚Äôs also a typical part of the market cycle. The bull market isn‚Äôt finished yet ‚Äî Bitcoin is still above its crucial 200-day moving average, and a price recovery could be on the horizon after a bit of consolidation. Adding to the pressure, over $285 million in long positions were liquidated across the crypto market in the past 24 hours, pushing prices down further. However, global liquidity metrics ‚Äî which measure the flow of money in financial markets ‚Äî remain robust. That‚Äôs a promising sign for a potential recovery in the weeks ahead. As for XRP, there‚Äôs some good news on the regulatory side. New documents confirm that XRP will be recognized as a utility token under Europe‚Äôs MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation. This clarification strengthens Ripple‚Äôs long-term strategy in cross-border payments. Yet, like the rest of the market, XRP‚Äôs price is also caught in the broader downtrend. It‚Äôs currently holding key support levels around $2, and technical analysis shows that there might be a possible rebound. Some believe that if XRP can maintain its position above this zone and replicate a pattern seen during its last major rally, it could see a climb.

The filing relates to 56 million shares of common stock and 29 million shares underlying convertible notes purchased by approximately fifty investors under debt and equity subscription agreements.

2025-06-06T04:19:03,"Crypto Trader James Wynn Confesses He ‚ÄòLost Control‚Äô After Losing $100M in a Month","James Wynn, a pseudonymous crypto trader who rose to online fame for turning meme coin bets into millions, has revealed he lost $100m in a matter of days after an aggressive string of leveraged trades on Hyperliquid. Wynn, who first gained attention for turning a $7,000 position in the meme coin PEPE into over $25m, shared his story Friday on X. In a candid post, he said he began trading perpetual futures in March, despite having no prior experience with derivatives. ‚ÄúI started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in fact never really traded properly before. I‚Äôve just traded meme coins,‚Äù he wrote. I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in-fact never really traded properly before, I‚Äôve just traded meme coins.

Within a month, Wynn said he turned a $3m position into $100m through a series of high-leverage trades. His success, all trackable on-chain, attracted attention fast. His social media following ballooned as crypto traders scrambled to replicate or monitor his positions. But the newfound visibility proved double-edged. Wynn admitted that the pressure of being in the spotlight warped his judgment. ‚ÄúWith all this new attention the trading spiraled out of control. I was basically gambling,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got greedy. I wasn‚Äôt taking the numbers on the screen seriously.‚Äù Transparency Made Wynn a Star‚ÄîThen a Cautionary Tale In mid-May, Wynn had amassed a $1.25b long position on Bitcoin , betting big at an average entry price of around $108,243. The position, built with as much as 40x leverage, left little margin for error. When US President Donald Trump posted a tweet threatening tariffs on the European Union, global markets turned sharply. Bitcoin dipped below Wynn‚Äôs liquidation price, wiping out nearly his entire position in a series of cascading losses. The rapid reversal shocked many in the crypto community, where Wynn had become a divisive figure. Some hailed him as a modern trading icon, while others accused him of reckless gambling or even market manipulation.

2025-06-06T04:00:13,"Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market‚ÄîData","Bitcoin‚Äôs price has barely moved in the last week, but other signs point to growing activity on the network. On June 5, Bitcoin traded around $104,300, down 0.50% in 24 hours and off 2.5% over the past seven days. Yet data shows more people are joining the network, and more coins are being passed around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Wallet Creation Jump According to Santiment, on May 29 nearly 557,000 new wallets appeared. That was the highest number since December 2023. It means thousands of people are opening wallets even though price has stayed just under $105,000. People normally open new wallets to send and receive bitcoins but they somehow come across the idea through new sources, increased talks among friends or create simple curiosity. In any case, an increased wallet holding indeed indicates a much wider usage. üìä Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain activity has seen sharp rises this week as its price hovers just below $105K: üìà May 29th: 556,830 new $BTC wallets created (Highest since December 2, 2023) üîÑ June 2nd: 241,360 coins circulated (Highest since December 8, 2024) Growth in a network‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2DxknVXrKT ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 5, 2025 Increased Token Movement On June 2, over 241,360 BTC changed hands. This was deemed the busiest day since December 2024. Reports from Santiment suggest that high coin turnover usually coincides with increased traffic. Traders might be moving coins in and out of exchanges, or investors could be shifting wallets. Big swings in daily token movement can point to a shift in sentiment‚Äîpeople either getting ready to buy or sell. Right now, it mostly looks like more users are sending coins to each other, which keeps the network busy even when price sits still. Big Holders Step In Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large holders‚Äîoften called ‚Äúwhales‚Äù‚Äîare stocking up. Their coin inflows jumped by 145% over the last seven days, and by 214% over the past 30 days. When big players load up, it can tighten supply on exchanges. That makes it tougher for new buyers to get in without driving price higher. If whales keep buying at this rate, it could lead to more upward pressure on price once everyday investors step in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows Mid Tier Investors Buy It‚Äôs not just the really big holders adding coins. Wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC added more than 79,000 BTC in just one week. That means these mid-tier holders picked up around 11,320 BTC per day on average. As of June 2, they held over 13 million BTC in total. When both big whales and these mid-level holders keep stacking, it further cuts down the number of coins floating on exchanges. Fewer coins available often mean any shift in demand could move price more.
