2025-06-05T22:30:55,"Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flashes A Buy Signal – Long-Term Opportunity Brewing","Bitcoin is entering a pivotal week, consolidating below its all-time high of $112,000 while holding firm above the psychological $100,000 level. Despite increasing macroeconomic tensions—rising US Treasury yields, trade disputes between major economies, and growing geopolitical friction—Bitcoin has demonstrated relative strength, maintaining support above key demand zones. This resilience has fueled debate among analysts, with some anticipating a deeper correction and others forecasting a breakout into price discovery. Market sentiment remains mixed, with volatility picking up and on-chain data showing signs of caution among retail participants. However, a potential turning point has emerged. According to top analyst Darkfost, the Hash Ribbons indicator—a tool that tracks miner stress and has historically signaled strong buy opportunities—has just flashed a new buy signal. This development is notable given that Bitcoin’s hashrate recently hit new all-time highs, reflecting growing network strength despite price consolidation. The Hash Ribbons signal suggests that short-term miner capitulation may be over, and that long-term investors could see a favorable entry point. With BTC now coiling for a decisive move , this signal could act as a catalyst, reigniting momentum as traders watch closely for a push toward new highs in the days ahead. Key Signal Suggests Bitcoin Is Ready To Move Bitcoin could be on the verge of a major move as it consolidates below its all-time high of $112,000. The market remains tense, with bulls holding control but facing pressure from rising macroeconomic risks, including the ongoing bond market stress and escalating global trade tensions. If BTC fails to reclaim momentum and drops below critical demand levels, it could trigger a deeper correction. However, a breakout above $112K would likely reignite bullish sentiment across the crypto space. Darkfost highlighted a key technical signal that’s flying under the radar—a new buy signal from the Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric assesses stress levels in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of the network hashrate. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average after a period of capitulation, it typically signals that miner sell pressure is easing and accumulation may follow. While these periods of miner stress can be short-term bearish—since some miners are forced to liquidate BTC to stay solvent—they often present high-quality entry points for long-term investors. Notably, the recent Hash Ribbons buy signal aligns with Bitcoin’s hashrate reaching new all-time highs, reflecting network resilience despite price stagnation. If bulls take advantage of this setup, the market could see a strong push toward a new price discovery phase. But failure to hold above key support levels may open the door for a retest of the sub-$100K zone. As always, the next few sessions will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s trajectory for the weeks ahead. Daily Chart Analysis: Support Holds, Momentum Awaits Confirmation Bitcoin continues to consolidate between the $103,600 support and $109,300 resistance zone, as seen on the daily chart. After reaching a new all-time high near $112,000, the price retraced and is now holding slightly above the 34-day EMA at $103,298. This moving average, alongside the $103,600 horizontal level, acts as the key demand zone bulls must defend to maintain the current bullish structure. Despite the recent pullback, BTC remains in a broader uptrend, supported by higher lows since the March bottom. However, momentum is clearly fading as daily candles show lower highs and declining volume. A break above $109,300 would likely re-ignite bullish momentum and pave the way for a potential push toward new all-time highs. On the downside, a confirmed break below $103,600 could trigger a sharper correction, with the next key support at the 100-day SMA near $92,245. Traders should watch for a daily close outside of this range to determine the next directional move.

2025-06-05T22:30:32,"Bitcoin and Trump memecoin plunge further amid Trump online feuds","Bitcoin has crashed to $100,423 after falling 4% in the past day, while the TRUMP meme coin slid 12% to $9.67, according to CoinGecko. The drop hit during a brutal week for Donald Trump, who’s been fighting battles on multiple fronts—including a messy falling out with Elon Musk and a legal clash inside his own crypto camp. The timing couldn’t be worse. The market’s bleeding and every major piece of Trump’s crypto operation is now in conflict. Trump and Musk’s relationship fully collapsed Thursday when the President slammed Musk over his opposition to a Republican-backed tax bill that’s currently stuck in the Senate. Trump accused Musk—his former economic advisor—of being “crazy” and told reporters at the White House he was considering terminating federal contracts with Musk’s companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. The president said Musk was “upset” about the proposed removal of EV tax credits and Trump’s decision to block his NASA nominee. Elon didn’t take that lightly. Hours later, he posted, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” on his personal X account, adding fuel to the fire. The tension exploded publicly, with both sides now openly discrediting each other. That beef alone hit the price of crypto hard, but things got even messier inside the Trump family’s own crypto empire. Trump family sues trump coin project over wallet At the same time as the Musk feud, Trump’s sons have launched a legal war against the company that created the TRUMP meme coin. The company—Fight Fight Fight, led by Trump’s longtime associate Bill Zanker—received a cease-and-desist letter from World Liberty Financial, a firm that holds major Trump family investments. The conflict started Tuesday after Fight Fight Fight unveiled a product called the $TRUMP Wallet, a new crypto wallet built in partnership with Magic Eden. The project, meant to allow users to hold and trade the TRUMP coin and other tokens, went live without getting the greenlight from Trump’s actual family. World Liberty Financial moved fast to stop it. The company also sent a legal notice to Magic Eden, saying the Trump name was being used without consent. Donald Trump Jr. attacked the project online, and Eric Trump wrote, “I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization.” Both brothers made it clear they had no idea who approved the wallet or the campaign around it. Behind the scenes, World Liberty Financial had been developing its own wallet, one that would allow users to earn yield on their tokens. Both Trump wallet projects scramble for control The turf war got uglier when the $TRUMP Wallet website and social media went live, then mysteriously disappeared, then came back online. The X account linked to the wallet was later suspended, just hours after launching. Despite the chaos, Fight Fight Fight kept pushing, offering TRUMP coin giveaways to people who signed up for early access. Zanker’s company isn’t new to the Trump crypto scene. In January, they launched the TRUMP meme coin, which has since earned more than $300 million in fees for its creators. Fight Fight Fight and another Trump-linked company, CIC Digital LLC, hold 80% of the token supply, which is now valued at $1.7 billion on CoinMarketCap. Zanker has promoted the token’s use in online shopping and organized a private dinner near Washington last month where Trump addressed top holders. While Zanker pushes one vision for the TRUMP token, the Trump family is pushing another. World Liberty Financial has already raised $550 million in token sales. It also launched a stablecoin called USD1, pegged to the U.S. dollar, with a market cap of $2.2 billion. Financial docs show a Trump-linked company gets 75% of the net revenue, including token sale proceeds. The Trump family holds 60% equity in World Liberty through their entity DT Marks DeFi LLC.

2025-06-05T22:30:07,"Massive Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge to $85 Billion: What’s Driving the Boom?","BitcoinWorld Massive Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge to $85 Billion: What’s Driving the Boom? Are you tracking the seismic shifts happening in corporate finance? A quiet revolution has been underway, and it involves a digital asset that many once dismissed: Bitcoin. Recent data reveals a dramatic surge in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings , signaling a significant pivot in how businesses manage their treasury reserves and view digital assets. How Have Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Exploded? The numbers tell a compelling story. By the close of May, a reported 116 public companies had amassed a staggering 809,100 BTC. At Bitcoin’s market value around that time, this hoard was worth approximately $85 billion. This figure represents more than double the total corporate holdings recorded just a year prior, which stood at around 312,200 BTC. The pace of accumulation has been particularly brisk recently, with nearly 100,000 BTC being added to corporate balance sheets since April alone. This rapid increase highlights a growing confidence and strategic intent among publicly traded companies. While the overall market cap of Bitcoin is vastly larger, the concentration of over 800,000 BTC in the hands of a relatively small group of companies underscores the impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption on the market structure. What’s Fueling This Institutional Bitcoin Adoption ? Several powerful factors are converging to drive this corporate embrace of Bitcoin. It’s not just a single catalyst but a combination of market dynamics, regulatory evolution, and critical changes in financial reporting: Bitcoin’s Price Performance: While volatility remains a characteristic, Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation and recent price rallies have certainly caught the attention of corporate finance departments looking for growth opportunities beyond traditional low-yield assets. The surge in value itself makes existing holdings worth more, contributing to the overall dollar value reported. Macroeconomic Environment: Concerns about inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty in the traditional financial system are pushing companies to explore alternative store-of-value assets. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly seen as a potential hedge. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While still complex, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin is gradually becoming clearer in many jurisdictions. Anticipation of more favorable regulations or increased clarity reduces perceived risks for corporations. Shifts in Accounting Rules: Perhaps one of the most significant recent drivers is the change in accounting standards, particularly in the United States. Understanding the New Bitcoin Accounting Standards Historically, accounting for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets was a major hurdle. Under previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the U.S., Bitcoin was typically treated as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. This meant companies had to record impairment losses if the market price dropped below their cost basis, but they could not record gains unless they sold the asset. This ‘impairment-only’ model created a lopsided view, discouraging companies from holding crypto long-term as price drops would hit earnings, while price increases were invisible until a sale. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently approved new rules (specifically ASU 2023-08, which amends ASC 842) that require companies to measure crypto assets at fair value through net income. This means companies must now adjust the value of their crypto holdings up or down based on market price changes each reporting period, reflecting gains and losses directly on the income statement. This change, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 (though early adoption is permitted), removes the disincentive of the impairment-only model and provides a more accurate, real-time reflection of the value of crypto holdings. This clarity and the ability to recognize gains is a powerful incentive for corporate treasuries considering Bitcoin. How Do US Bitcoin Regulations Play a Role? The regulatory stance in major economies, particularly the United States, significantly influences corporate decision-making. While a comprehensive federal framework is still under development, signals from policymakers and potential shifts in approach under different administrations can impact corporate confidence. The article mentions favorable U.S. policies under President Trump as a driver. This could refer to a less adversarial stance compared to some other political viewpoints or expectations regarding future clarity and acceptance of digital assets. Anticipation of clearer rules regarding custody, taxation, and classification of digital assets reduces the regulatory uncertainty that has historically deterred risk-averse corporations. As the path towards regulation becomes clearer, even if not always perfectly favorable, it provides a framework within which companies can operate with greater certainty. Which Public Companies Buying Bitcoin Are Leading the Charge? While the source data cited by CoinDesk from Binance Research doesn’t list the specific 116 companies, we know that pioneers like MicroStrategy have long championed holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Other companies, primarily in the tech and finance sectors, have also disclosed Bitcoin holdings. The increase from 116 companies suggests that adoption is broadening beyond the early movers. These companies are likely evaluating Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a component of a diversified treasury strategy aimed at preserving capital and potentially achieving growth in a challenging economic climate. Factors influencing a company’s decision to become one of the Public Companies Buying Bitcoin include: Company size and risk tolerance Industry sector (tech and finance often lead) Management’s view on digital assets Investor sentiment and demand Availability of secure custody solutions Beyond Bitcoin: Are Companies Exploring Other Crypto Assets? While Bitcoin overwhelmingly dominates corporate crypto holdings, the article notes that some companies have begun exploring other digital assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP. However, these holdings remain relatively limited compared to Bitcoin. This suggests that while interest in the broader digital asset space is growing, corporations are primarily focused on Bitcoin, likely viewing it as the most established, liquid, and widely recognized digital store of value. Exploration of other assets might be for specific use cases, investment diversification, or simply dipping a toe into the wider crypto ecosystem. The dominance of Bitcoin in corporate treasuries highlights its current position as the ‘safe’ or primary choice in this emerging asset class for businesses. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Crypto Holdings? Holding Bitcoin and other crypto assets isn’t without its complexities. Companies weigh potential benefits against significant challenges: Benefits: Potential for Appreciation: Offers higher potential returns than traditional cash reserves in a low-interest-rate environment. Inflation Hedge: Viewed by some as a hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply. Diversification: Provides diversification away from traditional financial assets. Treasury Management Innovation: Positions the company as forward-thinking and innovative. Attracting Talent/Investors: Can appeal to employees and investors interested in the digital asset space. Challenges: Price Volatility: Significant price swings can impact balance sheets and earnings reports (though new accounting rules make this more transparent). Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving nature of regulations can pose compliance risks. Security Risks: Requires robust security protocols to protect private keys and assets from cyber threats. Accounting Complexity: While improving, requires specialized knowledge for accurate reporting. Public Perception: Still viewed with skepticism by some stakeholders. Custody Solutions: Requires secure and reliable third-party custodians or internal expertise. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors For businesses considering joining the ranks of companies holding crypto, careful due diligence is paramount. This includes understanding the specific accounting and tax implications, evaluating secure custody solutions, assessing risk tolerance, and developing a clear investment strategy. Consulting with financial and legal experts specializing in digital assets is essential. For investors, the surge in corporate adoption can be seen as a bullish signal, indicating growing mainstream acceptance and demand for Bitcoin. However, it’s crucial to remember that corporate strategies can change, and market volatility remains a factor. Understanding which companies hold Bitcoin and why can provide insights into their long-term vision and risk appetite. A Defining Moment for Corporate Finance The leap in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings to $85 billion is more than just a number; it represents a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world. Driven by factors like Bitcoin’s market performance, a shifting macroeconomic landscape, clearer Bitcoin Accounting Standards , and evolving US Bitcoin Policy , more and more Public Companies Buying Bitcoin are reshaping their treasury strategies. While challenges exist, the trend suggests that digital assets, led by Bitcoin, are increasingly being recognized as legitimate components of corporate balance sheets. This evolution is likely to continue, influencing market dynamics and potentially paving the way for broader corporate engagement with the crypto ecosystem.

2025-06-05T22:20:15,"Bitcoin Mining: IREN Limited Achieves Record-Breaking May Performance","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining: IREN Limited Achieves Record-Breaking May Performance Get ready for some exciting news from the world of digital asset mining! IREN Limited , a prominent player in the sector, has just announced a truly remarkable achievement for the month of May. This isn’t just another operational update; it’s a significant milestone that underscores their growing efficiency and scale in the competitive realm of Bitcoin mining . IREN Limited Sets New Benchmark in Bitcoin Mining The headline speaks volumes: IREN Limited successfully mined 627 BTC in May. This figure represents their highest monthly output to date, setting a new record for the company. It’s a clear indicator of strong operational performance and strategic execution paying off. Let’s break down the numbers: May 2024 BTC Mined: 627 BTC Increase from April 2024: 8.3% April 2024 BTC Mined: 579 BTC This consistent month-over-month growth, culminating in a record performance, highlights the company’s ability to navigate the complexities of the Bitcoin mining environment. Understanding the Significance for Crypto Mining For those following the crypto mining space, a record like this from a company like IREN Limited is noteworthy. It reflects not only the company’s internal capabilities but can also offer insights into the broader mining ecosystem. Several factors contribute to a mining company’s success, and achieving a record output often points to: Increased Hash Rate: Deploying more powerful or efficient mining hardware. Operational Efficiency: High uptime for their machines, minimizing downtime. Favorable Energy Costs: Securing cost-effective power, which is a major expense for Bitcoin miners . Optimized Strategy: Effectively managing their fleet and adapting to network conditions. While the press release specifically mentions record revenue and hardware profits alongside the mining output, this strong BTC mining performance is the foundation for those financial results. What Drives Success for Bitcoin Miners? Becoming a successful Bitcoin miner in today’s market is a complex endeavor that goes far beyond simply plugging in machines. It requires a sophisticated blend of technological prowess, financial acumen, and operational excellence. Let’s delve into some of the key drivers that likely contributed to IREN Limited’s record-breaking May: Hardware and Infrastructure The heart of any crypto mining operation is its hardware. State-of-the-art Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners are essential for competing effectively. Companies must constantly evaluate and upgrade their fleets to maintain a competitive hash rate – the total computational power being used. But it’s not just about the machines; the infrastructure housing them is equally critical. This includes reliable power supply, efficient cooling systems, and robust internet connectivity. High-quality infrastructure ensures maximum uptime, directly translating to more blocks mined and thus more BTC mining rewards. Energy Strategy: A Core Advantage for IREN Limited? Energy costs are the single largest operational expense for most Bitcoin miners . Securing low-cost, reliable, and ideally sustainable energy sources is paramount. Companies that can establish operations in regions with abundant and cheap power, or those that have innovative energy procurement strategies (like utilizing flare gas or partnering with renewable energy producers), gain a significant competitive edge. While the IREN release doesn’t detail their energy strategy for May, achieving record revenue and hardware profits alongside record mining output strongly suggests they managed their energy costs effectively during this period. Operational Efficiency and Uptime Even the most powerful miners are useless if they aren’t running. Maximizing operational uptime is crucial. This involves rigorous maintenance schedules, quick response to technical issues, and resilient infrastructure that can withstand environmental factors or grid fluctuations. A high percentage of operational hash rate directly contributes to the amount of Bitcoin mining a company can achieve. IREN’s 8.3% increase in BTC mined from April to May indicates improved efficiency or expanded capacity came online effectively. Navigating Network Difficulty and Halving Cycles The Bitcoin mining network difficulty adjusts roughly every two weeks, based on the total hash rate pointed at the network. As more miners join or deploy more powerful hardware, difficulty increases, meaning individual miners receive a smaller share of the rewards unless they also increase their hash rate. Furthermore, the Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the block reward for miners by half, presents a significant challenge. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, just before IREN’s record May. Achieving a record output *after* the halving is particularly impressive, suggesting IREN Limited significantly increased their operational hash rate or efficiency to counteract the reduced block reward per hash. Financial Implications: Record Revenue and Hardware Profits The news of record revenue and hardware profits tied to the record BTC mining output is highly significant for investors and analysts. The amount of Bitcoin mined is a key performance indicator, but profitability depends heavily on the cost of mining that Bitcoin (primarily energy and operational expenses) and the price of Bitcoin when it is sold or held. Revenue: Derived primarily from the value of the 627 BTC mined, potentially supplemented by transaction fees. Record revenue suggests either a high average Bitcoin price during May, very low operational costs, or a combination of both, leveraged by the record mining volume. Hardware Profits: This could refer to profits generated from the sale of older generation mining equipment being replaced by newer, more efficient models. Many large-scale Bitcoin miners strategically cycle their hardware, selling older rigs to offset the cost of new ones. This indicates effective asset management and fleet modernization by IREN Limited . These financial results underscore that the record mining performance wasn’t achieved at an unsustainable cost but translated into tangible profitability for the company. IREN Limited’s Position Among Bitcoin Miners The competitive landscape for Bitcoin miners is constantly evolving. Large, publicly traded companies like IREN Limited compete on scale, efficiency, and strategic advantages like energy sourcing. Comparing performance metrics across different mining companies can be challenging due to variations in fleet mix, energy contracts, and reporting standards. However, a record month for a company of IREN’s size is a strong signal of positive momentum and effective management relative to their own historical performance and potentially positioning them favorably within the sector. Challenges Still Facing Crypto Mining Despite IREN’s success, the crypto mining industry faces ongoing challenges: Post-Halving Economics: Miners must now earn revenue from a smaller block reward, increasing pressure on efficiency and cost management. Bitcoin Price Volatility: Fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin directly impact the value of mined BTC and, therefore, revenue. Regulatory Environment: Governments around the world are still determining how to regulate Bitcoin mining , which can introduce uncertainty. Energy Debate: The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining remains a topic of discussion and scrutiny. Navigating these challenges effectively is key to sustained success for any Bitcoin miner . What’s Next for IREN Limited and Bitcoin Mining? Following a record month, the focus for IREN Limited will likely be on maintaining or building upon this momentum. This could involve further expansion of their mining fleet, optimizing existing operations, or exploring new energy initiatives. The broader Bitcoin mining industry will continue to see innovation in hardware, energy solutions, and operational strategies as companies adapt to the post-halving era and the ever-changing market dynamics. Conclusion: A Milestone for IREN Limited IREN Limited’s achievement of mining 627 BTC in May marks a significant milestone. This record performance, coupled with reported record revenue and hardware profits, demonstrates strong operational health and strategic success in a challenging market environment, particularly following the recent Bitcoin halving. It highlights the company’s position as an efficient and growing player among Bitcoin miners and provides a positive data point for the resilience and potential profitability achievable in the crypto mining sector.

2025-06-05T22:00:59,"Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says","Bitcoin (BTC) remains range-bound in the mid-$100,000s, showing no clear directional bias. However, the Hash Ribbons indicator is now flashing a fresh buy signal, suggesting that the top cryptocurrency may be gearing up for its next upward move. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbons are signalling a potential prime buying opportunity for the leading digital asset. This signal coincides with Bitcoin’s hashrate reaching new all-time highs (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Mining Giant Abandons Full-Hold Strategy, Unloads $40M In Crypto For the uninitiated, Bitcoin Hash Ribbons is an on-chain indicator that analyzes miner stress by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of Bitcoin’s hashrate. When the short-term average crosses above the long-term average after a period of decline, it signals that miner capitulation is ending – often marking a strong long-term buying opportunity. Such signals can emerge when mining becomes unprofitable for certain miners, forcing them to sell their BTC holdings to stay afloat. These sell-offs may temporarily pressure the price, but historically they have created attractive long-term buying opportunities. In their analysis, Darkfost notes that while the current signal is bullish from a long-term perspective, it could lead to a short-term pullback in BTC price. However, he emphasizes that any dip should be viewed as a chance to accumulate. Darkfost also pointed out that the Hash Ribbons indicator has historically been reliable, with the exception of 2021 during the China mining ban. They shared the following chart illustrating how the indicator is currently showing a strong buy signal. Is BTC Headed For A Crash? While the Hash Ribbons suggest a favorable long-term setup, some analysts warn that the short-term correction could be deeper than expected. For instance, crypto analyst Xanrox used the Fibonacci levels to forecast that BTC may tumble as low as $98,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning Signs? Long-Term Holders Exit While Retail Buyers Rush In Similarly, analyst Jelle noted that Bitcoin may face “one last speed bump” before launching a major rally to $140,000. Meanwhile, more pessimistic voices continue to warn of a dramatic crash, with some speculating that BTC could fall below $10,000 – a view seen as increasingly unlikely by most market participants. Despite the varying predictions, fresh on-chain data points to a healthy BTC market in the near to medium term. For instance, CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha recently highlighted that the derivatives market has undergone a reset, with funding rates stabilizing around neutral levels. Similarly, Fundstrat’s Head of Research, Tom Lee foresees BTC surging to as high as $250,000 by the end of the year. At press time, BTC trades at $105,367, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-05T22:00:23,"Bitcoin Investors Achieve Astonishing $1B/Day Realized Profit","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investors Achieve Astonishing $1B/Day Realized Profit The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and recent data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has sent a clear signal: Bitcoin investors who have held onto their assets for the long haul are cashing in big time. According to a recent report shared on X, investors who held their Bitcoin for at least 12 months collectively realized over $1 billion in profit per day last week. This astonishing figure highlights the significant gains accumulated by dedicated holders and provides valuable insight into current market dynamics. This isn’t just random selling; Glassnode’s analysis points out that this recent wave of profit-taking is largely being driven by long-term holders – those seasoned investors who navigated previous market cycles and patiently waited for opportune moments. Understanding what this realized profit means and its potential impact on the BTC market is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. What Does $1 Billion in Realized Profit Tell Us? When we talk about realized profit in the context of Bitcoin, we’re referring to the profit an investor makes when they sell BTC for a price higher than the price they bought it for. Glassnode tracks this by analyzing on-chain transactions, specifically looking at when coins that haven’t moved for a significant period (in this case, over 12 months) are transferred, likely to an exchange or another wallet for sale. The fact that Bitcoin investors , specifically those holding for over a year, are realizing $1 billion in profit daily signifies several key points: Significant Accumulated Gains: It indicates that a large amount of Bitcoin bought at much lower prices is now being sold. This group of long-term holders includes those who bought during the bear markets of 2022 or even earlier cycles. Market Maturity: It shows a level of market maturity where participants are willing and able to take profits after substantial price appreciation, rather than solely HODLing indefinitely. Potential Supply Increase: The act of realizing profit involves selling, which adds supply to the market. While demand might be absorbing this supply, a consistent high level of realized profit suggests potential selling pressure. This surge in realized profit by long-term holders is a metric closely watched by analysts using Glassnode data to gauge market sentiment and potential future movements in the BTC market . Why Are Long-Term Holders Selling Now? The decision for long-term holders to sell after patiently holding through volatile periods is multifaceted. Several factors likely contribute to this behavior: Reaching Price Targets: Many experienced Bitcoin investors set price targets for their holdings. The recent price rally may have triggered these targets, prompting them to take some chips off the table. Risk Management: After substantial gains, selling a portion of their holdings allows investors to de-risk their portfolios and secure profits, especially considering the historical volatility of the BTC market . Market Cycle Behavior: Historically, significant selling by long-term holders often occurs during strong bull runs or as prices approach previous all-time highs. This behavior is characteristic of late-stage bull markets or periods of price discovery. External Factors: Personal financial needs or diversification strategies can also play a role in an investor’s decision to realize profits. Glassnode’s observation that seasoned investors are driving this selling reinforces the idea that this isn’t panic selling, but rather calculated profit-taking by those who have seen multiple cycles. Their actions are significant because they hold a substantial portion of the circulating Bitcoin supply. Benefits and Challenges of Long-Term Holder Selling The increased selling activity by long-term holders presents both benefits and challenges for the broader BTC market . Benefits: Liquidity: Increased selling provides liquidity to the market, allowing new buyers to enter or existing investors to increase their positions. Healthy Correction Potential: While selling can cause price dips, it can also lead to healthy corrections, preventing the market from becoming overly overheated and potentially setting the stage for future sustainable growth. Confirmation of Strategy: For those who advocate for long-term holding, the ability of these investors to realize such massive profits validates the HODLing strategy over multiple years. Challenges: Selling Pressure: A large volume of selling, even by patient investors, can exert downward pressure on the price, potentially leading to corrections or consolidation periods in the BTC market . Market Sentiment: If selling accelerates or is perceived as a mass exodus, it could negatively impact market sentiment, causing concern among newer Bitcoin investors . Determining Market Top: Historically, peak selling by long-term holders has sometimes coincided with market tops. Analyzing this Glassnode data is crucial, but it’s not a perfect predictor and must be considered alongside other metrics. Understanding the balance between profit realization and new demand is key to interpreting the current state of the BTC market based on this Glassnode data . Comparing Long-Term vs. Short-Term Holder Behavior The behavior of long-term holders often contrasts sharply with that of short-term holders (those holding for less than 155 days). While long-term holders tend to accumulate during bear markets and sell into strength during bull markets, short-term holders are often more reactive to immediate price movements, buying during rallies and selling during dips (often at a loss). Glassnode’s analysis often separates these cohorts to provide a clearer picture of market dynamics. The fact that long-term holders are the primary drivers of this recent selling wave, according to Glassnode data , suggests a deliberate, strategic move rather than panic selling by newer participants. Investor Type Holding Period Typical Behavior During Bull Run Current Activity (Based on Data) Short-Term Holder Buy during rallies, sell during dips (often at loss) Variable, often reactive to price changes Long-Term Holder > 155 days (Glassnode defines >1 year here) Accumulate during bear markets, sell into strength Realizing significant realized profit ($1B+/day) This table simplifies the distinction, but the core takeaway is that the current selling pressure is coming from a cohort known for strategic timing based on accumulated experience in the BTC market . Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors So, what does this significant realized profit by long-term holders mean for you as a Bitcoin investor ? Don’t Panic: High levels of realized profit by experienced investors are a normal part of a market cycle. It doesn’t automatically signal the end of the bull run, but rather a phase where profits are being distributed. Analyze Your Own Strategy: Are you a long-term holder? Have you set profit targets? This data might prompt you to review your own investment plan and decide if now is the time to take some profits or if you plan to hold for even longer. Monitor On-Chain Data: Following insights from firms like Glassnode can provide valuable context beyond just price charts. Keep an eye on metrics like MVRV, SOPR, and HODL waves to understand the behavior of different investor cohorts. Understand Supply Dynamics: Increased selling adds supply. Pay attention to how the market absorbs this supply. Strong demand can counteract selling pressure, while weak demand could lead to price declines. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If market volatility increases due to profit-taking, DCA can be a strategy to average into a position over time, reducing the risk of buying at a potential local top. Ultimately, the actions of long-term holders provide valuable signals, but every investor’s situation and strategy are unique. Use this Glassnode data as one piece of the puzzle in making informed decisions about your participation in the BTC market . Examples from Previous Cycles This phenomenon of long-term holders realizing significant realized profit during strong price rallies is not new. We saw similar patterns in the 2017 and 2021 bull markets. During these periods, as Bitcoin reached new highs, the wallets that had held coins for several years began to offload portions of their holdings, distributing coins to newer market entrants. Analyzing historical Glassnode data from these cycles shows that peak selling by long-term holders often precedes significant price corrections or consolidation phases. However, the duration and depth of these corrections vary greatly depending on overall market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and the influx of new demand. Understanding these historical precedents helps contextualize the current data and provides a framework for potential future scenarios in the BTC market . Conclusion: A Healthy Sign of Profit Distribution The report from Glassnode highlighting over $1 billion per day in realized profit by long-term holders is a significant data point for the BTC market . It confirms that patient Bitcoin investors who held through challenging times are now reaping substantial rewards. While this selling adds supply to the market and could contribute to price volatility, it is also a sign of a functioning market where gains are being distributed. This isn’t necessarily a red flag signaling an imminent crash, but rather a phase that requires careful observation. The behavior of these experienced investors, informed by years in the market, offers valuable clues. As a Bitcoin investor , staying informed through data like that provided by Glassnode, understanding the difference between long-term and short-term holder behavior, and having a clear investment strategy are your best tools for navigating these dynamics. The ability for dedicated holders to realize such astonishing profits underscores the potential rewards of a long-term perspective in the volatile, yet potentially lucrative, world of cryptocurrency.

In the last several hours, Trump has threatened to cut Musk’s government subsidies and contracts, while Musk claimed the President is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. The turmoil pushed US markets slightly lower, triggered a 14% drop for Tesla (TSLA), and fueled a sharp drop in the price of Bitcoin, from a 24-hour high of $105,733 down to $100,900 at time of publishing. According to the crypto data aggregator Coinglass , a total of $621.55 million has been liquidated from the crypto markets in just the last four hours alone. The Trump-Musk meltdown was initially sparked by Musk’s opposition to the Republican tax and spending bill, which passed the House two weeks ago. Musk called the bill a “disgusting abomination” that would balloon the federal deficit. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the legislation would add $2.4 to $5 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over a decade.

2025-06-05T21:40:29,"Bitcoin ETF: Truth Social Files Bold S-1 with SEC for Crypto Investment Product","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF: Truth Social Files Bold S-1 with SEC for Crypto Investment Product In a move that has captured the attention of both the financial and political worlds, Truth Social , the social media platform associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, has formally signaled its intent to enter the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF market. This development comes via a recent S-1 filing submitted to the U.S. SEC , outlining plans for a new Crypto Investment product. Think of an S-1 filing as the initial registration statement required by the SEC for public companies based in the U.S. when they propose to offer securities to the public for the first time. It’s a detailed document that provides potential investors with essential information about the company, its business, its management, and the securities being offered. In this case, the ‘security’ isn’t company stock, but shares in a proposed Bitcoin ETF. Understanding the Proposed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF According to the filing submitted on June 5, Truth Social aims to launch the “Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, B.T.” The filing confirms the company’s formal entry into the Bitcoin ETF market under the Securities Act of 1933, a key piece of legislation governing the issuance of securities in the U.S. But what exactly is a Bitcoin ETF ? At its core, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds assets (in this case, Bitcoin) and divides ownership of those assets into shares. These shares trade on stock exchanges throughout the day, much like regular stocks. For investors, buying shares in a Bitcoin ETF is an indirect way to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without the need to directly buy, hold, and secure the cryptocurrency itself. Key aspects of this proposal: The Asset: Primarily focused on providing exposure to Bitcoin. The Structure: An ETF that would trade on a regulated stock exchange. The Sponsor: Yorkville America Digital, LLC is listed as the sponsor behind this specific ETF proposal. The sponsor is typically responsible for the management and operations of the fund. The Filer: Truth Social (or its parent entity, Trump Media & Technology Group – TMTG) is the entity filing the S-1, indicating their involvement in bringing this product to market. This filing places Truth Social alongside major financial players who have recently launched successful spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, albeit with a unique corporate identity. Why is Truth Social Venturing into Crypto Investment? This move raises intriguing questions about Truth Social’s strategic direction. While primarily known as a social media platform, a foray into Crypto Investment products suggests a potential diversification strategy. Several factors could be at play: Tapping into Audience Interest: A segment of Truth Social’s user base may have a strong interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Offering an accessible investment vehicle could appeal directly to this demographic. Revenue Diversification: Expanding beyond advertising and subscription models could open new revenue streams through management fees associated with the ETF. Alignment with Ideology: Some proponents of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, view them as alternatives to traditional financial systems or government-controlled currencies. This perspective might resonate with certain political ideologies often discussed on the platform. Market Opportunity: The recent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in attracting significant inflows may present a compelling business opportunity that Truth Social wants to capitalize on. The decision to file for a Bitcoin ETF is a significant step, requiring navigation of complex financial regulations and a clear articulation of the fund’s strategy and risks to the SEC and potential investors. The SEC and the S-1 Filing Process The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial role in protecting investors and maintaining fair and orderly markets. Any company wishing to offer securities to the public in the U.S. must register with the SEC, typically through the S-1 filing process. Here’s a simplified look at the process after an S-1 is filed: Initial Submission: The company submits the draft S-1 filing to the SEC. This document is comprehensive, covering the proposed offering, the company’s financials, risk factors, and more. SEC Review: SEC staff review the filing for completeness and compliance with regulations. They often issue comments or requests for additional information. Amendments: The company responds to SEC comments by filing amendments to the S-1. This back-and-forth can happen multiple times. Effectiveness: Once the SEC is satisfied that the filing meets all requirements and provides adequate disclosure, they declare the registration statement “effective.” This allows the securities (the ETF shares, in this case) to be offered to the public. The process can take months, depending on the complexity of the filing and the SEC’s workload. For a Bitcoin ETF , the SEC scrutinizes aspects like custody of the underlying Bitcoin, valuation methods, and investor protection measures. Benefits and Challenges of a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Launching a Bitcoin ETF presents both potential upsides and significant hurdles. Potential Benefits: Accessibility: Makes investing in Bitcoin easier for individuals who prefer using traditional brokerage accounts over crypto exchanges. Familiarity: Operates within a familiar regulatory and trading framework (the stock market). Custody Handled: Investors don’t have to worry about the technical complexities and security risks of holding Bitcoin directly. Potential for Wider Adoption: Could introduce Bitcoin investment to a new segment of investors who are active on the Truth Social platform but haven’t yet entered the crypto market. Potential Challenges: SEC Approval: While spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, the SEC’s review process is rigorous, and approval is not guaranteed. Competition: The U.S. market already has several established and large spot Bitcoin ETFs managed by major financial institutions. Attracting assets will be competitive. Market Volatility: The value of the ETF shares will directly track the volatile price of Bitcoin, exposing investors to significant potential losses. Management Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios), which can eat into investor returns over time, unlike holding Bitcoin directly. Association Risk: Given Truth Social’s high-profile and often politically charged identity, the ETF might face unique scrutiny or investor sentiment challenges not typically associated with other financial products. The success of the “Truth Social Bitcoin ETF , B.T.” will depend on navigating these challenges effectively and convincing both the SEC and potential investors of its viability and value proposition. Comparing Direct Bitcoin Ownership vs. ETF Investment For those interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin, the Truth Social ETF (if approved) would offer an alternative to buying Bitcoin directly on a cryptocurrency exchange. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Direct Bitcoin Ownership Bitcoin ETF (Proposed) Access Method Crypto Exchanges Stock Brokerage Accounts Custody Your Responsibility (Wallets) Handled by Fund Sponsor/Custodian Trading Hours 24/7 Standard Stock Market Hours Fees Exchange Fees, Network Fees Management Fees (Expense Ratio) Taxation Complex (Capital Gains on Transactions) Generally Simpler (Capital Gains on Selling ETF Shares) Regulatory Framework Less Mature (Varies by Jurisdiction) Highly Regulated (SEC Oversight) Each method has its pros and cons, and the best choice depends on an individual investor’s comfort level with technology, custody, regulation, and trading platforms. The Truth Social ETF aims to provide the regulated, brokerage-accessible option for its target audience interested in Crypto Investment . What Actionable Insights Can We Draw? For readers following this development, here are some key takeaways and potential actions: Monitor the SEC Process: Keep an eye on further filings and communications from both Truth Social and the SEC regarding the S-1. The SEC’s comments and the company’s responses will provide more details about the proposed ETF’s structure and strategy. Understand the Specifics: If the ETF gets closer to launch, carefully review the final prospectus. This document will detail the ETF’s investment objective, fees, risks, and how the underlying Bitcoin is held. Assess Your Investment Goals: Consider if a Bitcoin ETF fits into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Bitcoin is a volatile asset class. Compare Options: If you’re interested in Bitcoin exposure, compare the Truth Social ETF (if approved) with other existing spot Bitcoin ETFs, direct Bitcoin ownership, or other crypto-related investment products. Look at expense ratios, trading volume, and the reputation of the sponsor. This S-1 filing is just the beginning of a potentially long process. It signals intent but does not guarantee that the “Truth Social Bitcoin ETF , B.T.” will ever trade on an exchange. The Potential Impact of a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF If approved and launched, a Truth Social Bitcoin ETF could have several interesting impacts: For Truth Social: Could provide a new revenue stream and potentially increase engagement on the platform if it becomes a hub for discussing the ETF and Crypto Investment . For the Crypto Market: While unlikely to move the market significantly on its own compared to the launch of major financial institution ETFs, it adds another regulated investment option and potentially brings Bitcoin exposure to a unique demographic. For the Political Landscape: Given the association with Donald Trump, the ETF could become a point of discussion in political circles, potentially further intertwining cryptocurrency with political discourse. The success and impact will ultimately depend on investor uptake, which will be influenced by market conditions, the ETF’s performance, and how it is perceived by the public. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Bitcoin Arena Truth Social’s filing for a Bitcoin ETF is a bold declaration of its interest in the cryptocurrency space and the broader Crypto Investment market. By submitting the S-1 filing to the SEC , the company has initiated the formal process required to potentially offer a regulated Bitcoin investment product to the public. While challenges remain, including navigating the SEC’s rigorous review and competing in an increasingly crowded market, this move highlights the growing mainstream interest in Bitcoin and the diverse ways companies are seeking to engage with this asset class. Investors and observers will be watching closely to see how the SEC responds and whether the “Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, B.T.” ultimately makes it to market.

The Fight for A Digital Asset Regulatory Framework Continues Introduced by Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY), this congressional session, the bipartisan legislation would prohibit blockchain software developers from being treated as money-transmitting services under the Bank Secrecy Act. Proponents of BRCA argue that it should be folded into larger digital asset market structure legislation in hopes of preventing unfair enforcement against blockchain developers, particularly as U.S. lawmakers bring forth ideas for a new crypto policy framework . Just last month, Reps. French Hill (AR-R), G.T. Thompson (PA-R), Bryan Steil (R-WI), and Dusty Johnson (SD-R) released a discussion draft of a bill set to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. However, with increased political polarization emerging over cryptocurrencies, it is still unclear how far any such legislation will be able to advance.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T21:20:36,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Astounding $150K Target Revealed by Foresight Ventures CEO","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Astounding $150K Target Revealed by Foresight Ventures CEO Could Bitcoin really reach heights many only dream of in this market cycle? That’s the exciting prospect put forward by a leading voice in the venture capital space. Alice Li, the U.S. CEO of Foresight Ventures, shared a compelling vision during a recent Cointelegraph discussion, suggesting that a significant catalyst could propel Bitcoin (BTC) well past the $100,000 mark, potentially hitting an astounding $150,000. Why is US Crypto Regulation Key to Bitcoin’s Future? According to Li, the primary driver for this potential massive surge isn’t just market sentiment or technological adoption alone, but something more foundational: regulatory clarity in the United States. For years, the lack of clear rules has been a significant hurdle, creating uncertainty for investors and businesses alike. A clear regulatory framework could unlock substantial institutional capital and provide a stable environment for growth. Li specifically highlighted recent shifts in U.S. policy and political stances as crucial indicators. The mention of U.S. President Donald Trump’s more favorable approach towards Bitcoin and crypto, including indications of potential support for Bitcoin reserves or at least a less adversarial stance compared to previous years, signals a changing tide in Washington D.C. This political shift, regardless of party, can have a profound impact on market confidence. Furthermore, developments around stablecoins are seen as intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s trajectory. Stablecoins act as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Clear rules for stablecoins could legitimize a significant part of the market, making it easier for large players to enter and interact with digital assets, including Bitcoin. The GENIUS Act: How Stablecoins Impact the Bitcoin Rally Alice Li also pointed to specific legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act. While primarily focused on stablecoin regulation, particularly concerning collateralization and reserve requirements, such legislation has broader implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. By setting standards and providing transparency for stablecoins, the GENIUS Act could: Increase Trust: Clear rules reduce risks associated with stablecoin issuers, building confidence among users and institutions. Foster Innovation: Regulatory certainty allows companies to build and innovate using stablecoins without fear of sudden legal challenges. Promote Global Progress: As a major financial market, U.S. regulatory action often sets a precedent or influences regulatory approaches in other countries. This global regulatory progress, spurred by U.S. action, creates a more mature and reliable market environment, which is highly attractive to large-scale investment. This increased confidence and accessibility are vital components for fueling a significant Bitcoin rally. Could Bitcoin Hit $150K by 2025? Analyzing the Factors The $150,000 Bitcoin price prediction for the 2025 market cycle is ambitious, but not without potential justification when considering the factors Li mentioned alongside other known market dynamics. Here’s a look at what could support this target and some potential challenges: Factors Supporting a Potential $150K+ Target: U.S. Regulatory Clarity: As highlighted by Alice Li, this is perhaps the most significant potential catalyst for unlocking institutional capital. Bitcoin Halving: The recent Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 reduced the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically a bullish factor for price over the following 12-18 months. Institutional Adoption: The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have already brought significant new capital into the market and paved the way for broader institutional participation. Macroeconomic Factors: Potential shifts in global monetary policy, such as interest rate cuts, could make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Increasing Global Demand: Adoption continues to grow worldwide, both from retail and institutional investors seeking a store of value or speculative asset. Potential Challenges and Risks: Lingering Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite positive signs, actual implementation and enforcement of regulations can still be complex and potentially restrictive. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected economic downturns or persistent inflation could dampen investor enthusiasm. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its sharp price swings, and a prediction like $150K implies significant volatility along the way. External Shocks: Geopolitical events or unforeseen black swan events can negatively impact the market. While a $150,000 Bitcoin price prediction remains a bold forecast, the confluence of favorable regulatory developments, supply mechanics from the halving, and growing institutional interest provides a foundation for such optimism looking towards Bitcoin 2025. What Does This Mean for Investors? Insights from Foresight Ventures The insights shared by the Foresight Ventures CEO offer valuable perspective for anyone navigating the crypto market. The emphasis on regulatory clarity underscores its importance not just as a compliance issue, but as a fundamental driver of market maturity and potential price appreciation. For investors, this highlights the need to pay close attention to legislative developments and political stances, particularly concerning crypto regulation US. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of regulatory news from the U.S. and other major jurisdictions. Understand the Risks: While predictions like $150K are exciting, remember that they are not guarantees. Market volatility is inherent. Consider Long-Term Trends: Regulatory clarity and institutional adoption are long-term trends that could support sustained growth beyond short-term price targets. Evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess how potential regulatory shifts and market growth could impact your existing crypto holdings. The perspective from Alice Li and Foresight Ventures suggests that while technical analysis and market sentiment are important, the evolving regulatory landscape is a critical, perhaps underestimated, factor that could significantly influence the trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market in the coming years. Summary: Alice Li, CEO of Foresight Ventures U.S., has offered a compelling Bitcoin price prediction, suggesting BTC could surge past $150,000 in the current market cycle, potentially by 2025. Her analysis emphasizes the transformative power of regulatory clarity in the U.S., citing shifts in political sentiment and progress on stablecoin legislation like the GENIUS Act as key catalysts. While acknowledging inherent market volatility and risks, the confluence of favorable regulatory winds, the recent halving, and increasing institutional adoption provides a basis for this optimistic outlook. Investors are encouraged to monitor regulatory developments closely as a significant factor influencing Bitcoin’s future.

2025-06-05T21:10:42,"Solo Bitcoin Miner Strikes Gold: Earns $330K Mining Block Alone","BitcoinWorld Solo Bitcoin Miner Strikes Gold: Earns $330K Mining Block Alone Imagine hitting the jackpot in the world of cryptocurrency. That’s exactly what happened to one incredibly lucky solo Bitcoin miner recently, achieving a feat so rare it captured the attention of the entire crypto community. This individual successfully mined a full Bitcoin block entirely on their own, walking away with a reward worth approximately $330,000. What Happened with This Lucky Solo Bitcoin Miner ? The details of this remarkable event come from data on the Bitcoin blockchain explorer mempool. According to the records, a single, independent miner was responsible for successfully finding and adding block 899,826 to the Bitcoin blockchain. For this effort, the miner received the standard block reward, which is currently 3.15 Bitcoin (BTC). At the time the news broke, this amount was valued at around $330,000. This is particularly noteworthy because mining a Bitcoin block requires immense computational power to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. The difficulty is so high that individual miners, especially those without massive mining farms, have an incredibly low probability of solving a block on their own. Most miners pool their resources together in mining pools to increase their chances of earning rewards, which are then split among participants. How Does Someone Mine Bitcoin Block Alone? Mining a Bitcoin block solo means you are competing against the entire global network of Bitcoin miners with only your own hardware. The process involves using powerful computers (ASICs – Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) to guess a specific number (the nonce) that, when combined with the block data and hashed, results in a hash below a certain target set by the network difficulty. The first miner to find the correct nonce gets to add the block and claim the reward. In a solo setup, if your hardware finds the solution, you keep the entire block reward. In a mining pool, the pool’s collective power finds the solution, and the reward is distributed proportionally based on the amount of work (hashrate) each miner contributed. Was Renting Power Key to This Bitcoin Mining Profit ? While the miner was technically ‘solo’ in that they weren’t part of a traditional mining pool sharing rewards, speculation suggests they might have employed strategies to boost their chances. According to The Block, citing software engineer and administrator at the well-known solo mining pool ckpool, Con Kolivas, the miner likely rented additional computing power. Renting hashrate allows individuals to temporarily acquire significant computational power, increasing their odds for a limited time, though it comes at a cost. Kolivas’s insight points to a potential method this miner might have used to improve their statistical probability without owning a massive mining operation themselves. However, even with rented power, successfully mining a block solo remains an extremely low-probability event, akin to winning a significant lottery prize. The Reality of Bitcoin Solo Mining vs. Pool Mining This story highlights the stark contrast between solo mining and joining a mining pool: Solo Mining: High risk, high reward (if successful). You compete alone. If you find a block, you get the full reward (minus transaction fees). The probability of success is extremely low for average miners. Pool Mining: Lower risk, consistent smaller rewards. You combine your hashrate with others. Rewards from blocks found by the pool are shared based on contribution. You pay a small fee to the pool operator. For the vast majority of miners, joining a pool is the only realistic way to see regular returns on their investment in hardware and electricity. Solo mining is often seen as a gamble, typically only feasible for those with access to enormous amounts of hashrate, or for smaller miners hoping for a one-in-a-million stroke of luck. Why This Crypto Mining News is So Significant While not impacting the overall Bitcoin network significantly, this news is a major talking point in the mining community. It serves as a reminder that the dream of hitting the solo mining jackpot, though incredibly improbable, is still technically possible. It inspires discussions about the economics of mining, the role of luck, and the effectiveness of different mining strategies. It also potentially encourages more people to try solo mining, despite the overwhelming odds. However, it’s crucial for anyone considering this path to understand the immense difficulty and the high likelihood of spending significant resources (electricity, hardware, potentially rented power) without ever finding a block. Key Takeaways from This Solo Success A single miner successfully mined Bitcoin block 899,826. The reward was 3.15 BTC, worth around $330,000 at the time. This is an extremely rare event due to the high Bitcoin network difficulty. Speculation suggests the miner may have rented additional hashrate to increase their odds. The story highlights the lottery-like nature of solo mining compared to the consistent, smaller payouts from mining pools. Conclusion: A Rare Win in the Mining Lottery The story of the solo Bitcoin miner who earned $330K is a fascinating outlier in the world of cryptocurrency mining. It’s a testament to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, where anyone, theoretically, can participate in the block validation process and earn rewards. However, it’s essential to frame this success within the context of the millions of miners globally and the near-zero probability for most individuals mining alone. This miner achieved a remarkable feat, proving that sometimes, against all odds, luck can indeed strike in the digital gold rush. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin mining trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

2025-06-05T21:09:06,"Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation: New Cohort Adds 3.1% of BTC Supply Since March","Bitcoin continues to consolidate near its all-time highs. As market participants remain cautious, fresh accumulation activity is stirring among major wallet clusters. In fact, a new wave of whales – wallets holding at least 1,000 BTC with coins aged under six months – has emerged, and these have been accumulating at an unprecedented rate. New Whales Hoard 1.1 Million BTC According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant, the metric “Supply Held by New-Whales” reveals that between March 1 and June 4, 2025, these fresh entrants more than doubled their holdings from approximately 500,000 BTC to 1.1 million BTC. This 600,000 BTC increase, which is worth roughly $63 billion, represented a significant shift in market structure. The cohort’s share of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply surged from 2.5% to 5.6%, effectively removing the equivalent of ten months of mining output from active circulation. Unlike dormant cold wallets, CryptoQuant analyst explained that this indicator specifically tracks new balance-sheet commitments, and hence, offers a clear signal of renewed conviction and fresh capital entering the market. The report interpreted this accumulation as a potential precursor to a supply squeeze, often linked with increased upside volatility. The young average coin age further confirms these are recent buys, and not reactivated legacy holdings. All eyes are now on exchange flow trends from this group of BTC holders, ETF basket activity, and divergences between derivatives funding and whale movement for clues on market direction. With aggressive, well-capitalized buyers entering ahead of macro catalysts such as potential rate cuts or ETF inflows, the current trend may significantly alter Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. The latest observation aligns with Glassnode’s findings , which revealed that Bitcoin’s largest holders have resumed accumulation after a brief period of distribution. This is a major shift in on-chain behavior, with renewed buying activity seen across all wallet cohorts. The trend signals growing market confidence following recent price consolidation and macro uncertainty. Bitcoin’s Tightening Supply Bitcoin’s supply is shrinking as institutional demand surges, according to Sygnum Bank’s latest report . With ETF inflows driving a 30% drop in exchange balances, the bank views this trend as a sign of long-term accumulation. Additionally, government interest in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset is accelerating, with the US, UK, Pakistan, and even China exploring options. Sygnum stated that these important factors could spark demand shocks and price volatility.

2025-06-05T21:01:37,"Bitcoin Threatens $100K, Crypto Losses Grow as Musk/Trump Feud Goes Nuclear","The crypto market is getting redder by the minute as the spat between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk intensifies. Late in the U.S. day, bitcoin BTC was down more than 4% to $100,500, threatening to dip back into five digits for the first time in a month. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for exchange coins, memecoins and stablecoins — is down more than 5% in the same period of time. SOL and SUI are notable underperformers, printing losses of more than 7%. Coinbase (COIN) lost 4.6%, Strategy (MSTR) slid 2.4% on Thursday, while a few miners including MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Core Scientific (CORZ) suffered 5% losses. Musk and Trump’s argument, initially triggered by the potential effects of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” on U.S. national debt, quickly escalated on Thursday afternoon, with the President saying that the SpaceX founder had gone “crazy” and threatening to terminate government contracts for all Musk-led companies. The world’s richest man, for his part, wrote that Trump was implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein files, stated that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon aircraft, and agreed with a social media post calling on Trump to be impeached and replaced by Vice President J.D. Vance. Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 14% on Thursday. Circle IPO day Crypto prices were already under pressure on Thursday amid the euphoria surrounding the IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL). Those with memories were recalling similar excitement surrounding Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO, which at the time marked an historic top for crypto markets.

2025-06-05T20:58:24,"India U.S. Tariff Pact Races Toward 10% Deal Before Trump’s July 9 Deadline","Key Takeaways: Indian and U.S. officials began trade talks in New Delhi ahead of Trump’s July 9 deadline. Negotiations focus on tariff reductions in the agriculture and automobile sectors. India is offering a 10% average tariff rate contingent on reciprocal concessions. Industry advocates say tax clarity could align crypto growth with India’s global trade goals. Indian and U.S. officials began two days of closed-door trade negotiations in New Delhi on Thursday, with both sides working to finalize an interim deal before a July 9 deadline set by President Donald Trump. According to Reuters , two Indian government officials revealed that talks are focused on reducing tariffs in sectors such as agriculture and automobiles, alongside provisions for enhanced market access. Tariff Alignment and Market Access Top Priorities One official said the proposed measures include “tariff alignment and quota-based concessions,” with an announcement expected before the end of June. The U.S. delegation is led by senior staff from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, while India’s team is headed by chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal. Trade Minister Piyush Goyal may join the talks upon his return from Italy, according to a third source. Washington is requesting broader access to India’s farm and dairy markets, while Indian negotiators are pushing for more favorable treatment of domestic exports and supply chain partnerships. One official said India has proposed to lower average tariffs to match the U.S. base rate of 10%, contingent on reciprocal commitments. The talks follow a February agreement to pursue a phased trade roadmap with the goal of raising bilateral trade volumes to $500 billion by 2030. India recorded a $45.7 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week that discussions were moving forward and that a resolution could be finalized soon. Neither country has officially commented on the current round of talks. India Considers Crypto Policy as Part of Wider Strategy India’s evolving approach to crypto regulation is beginning to intersect with its broader trade and investment strategy. As the country negotiates tariff agreements with the U.S. and other partners, officials are weighing how digital asset policy could factor into future market access and capital flows. India’s Supreme Court compares unregulated Bitcoin trading to a “refined Hawala” amid ongoing regulatory uncertainty, urging the government to clarify crypto laws and protect investors. #Crypto #India #Bitcoin https://t.co/Wou7XATWTq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 Industry groups argue that tax reform and regulatory clarity could make India a more attractive destination for crypto-related investment. They point to the return of firms like Binance and Coinbase as a cue that clearer rules could draw capital back onshore and complement India’s trade ambitions. While formal relief has not yet materialized, the Finance Ministry is reviewing a discussion paper on virtual assets. Executives say aligning crypto policy with broader economic goals could support India’s $500 billion trade target with the U.S. and position it more competitively in global digital markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is Trump’s July 9 deadline relevant? It is a self-imposed milestone tied to his administration’s trade agenda. Both governments are trying to reach a deliverable before that political window closes. What are quota-based concessions? These are agreements where specific quantities of goods can enter a market at reduced or zero tariffs. India may offer these to protect sensitive sectors while expanding access selectively. What would a 10% average tariff mean for India-U.S. trade? It would bring India’s rates closer to U.S. levels and could reduce friction in sectors like manufacturing and agribusiness, where tariff disparities remain a hurdle.

2025-06-05T20:40:12,"Market Strategist Explains Why Holding 5,589 XRP Is Important","A respected voice within the XRP community, known as J4b1, has advised investors to consider holding exactly 5,589 XRP tokens in preparation for what he believes may be a significant market development. He identified May 19 as a possible inflection point for the asset’s trajectory, suggesting that changes in XRP’s institutional accessibility could signal a broader shift in momentum. On May 19, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) officially introduced XRP futures, expanding the asset’s reach into the institutional investment space. While platforms such as Bitnomial and Coinbase had previously listed XRP derivatives, CME’s participation lends added credibility due to its established role in global finance. The futures launch is seen as a step toward mainstream financial integration and may serve as a foundation for further regulatory progress. #XRP is about to enter one of the most important moments in its history. Imagine holding 5589 XRP before the market explodes. Let me explain in this why May 19 could change everything pic.twitter.com/fS4GaWXENC — J4b1 (@XRPJ4b1) April 27, 2025 ETF Approval Could Follow Futures Milestone J4b1 emphasized that the introduction of XRP futures could lead to the eventual approval of spot-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), referencing a similar timeline followed by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. These assets saw ETF approval only after their futures markets became active and widely used. XRP appears to be progressing along a comparable path. Currently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing an XRP ETF proposal submitted by asset manager WisdomTree . Although the agency has postponed its decision, XRP advocates argue that such delays are common in ETF review processes and do not necessarily signal rejection. Many believe approval is likely in the long term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Value of Holding 5,589 XRP Tokens J4b1’s specific recommendation to hold 5,589 XRP is based on potential future valuations. At the current price of approximately $2.20, such a position would require an investment of around $12,295. However, if XRP experiences substantial appreciation following ETF approval and broader adoption, the return on this investment could be significant. Analysts Offer Bullish Long-Term Projections Several market analysts have issued optimistic forecasts. Crypto analyst Cryptominder predicts that XRP could climb to $50, raising the value of 5,589 tokens to $279,450. Another analyst, BarriC, has projected a potential price of $100, which would increase the investment’s value to over $558,000. With XRP futures now trading on the CME and ETF applications under regulatory review, many in the crypto community view this moment as pivotal. J4b1’s call to accumulate 5,589 XRP reflects growing sentiment that the asset may soon enter a new phase of institutional adoption and price growth.

Webus International wants to set aside $300 million in XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge VivoPower plans to use roughly $121 million. Wellgistics Health has earmarked $50 million. This marks a shift in how some firms think about keeping reserves, and it could change how they handle payments down the road. Webus International Plans Huge Reserve According to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Webus International aims to raise $300 million through non-equity funding. The company will tap its existing cash, credit lines backed by institutions, and support from shareholders. Companies are exploring the XRP treasury strategy: – Webus International: $300M – VivoPower: $121M – Wellgistics: $50M pic.twitter.com/C9rldXDdDG — Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 4, 2025 Once the money is in hand, Webus intends to buy XRP and hold it as part of its treasury. The plan comes with a partner: Samara Alpha Management. Webus says the altcoin will help the firm with global payment services. They think it can move value quickly across borders, and this treasury could back that. VivoPower’s XRP Ambition Based on reports, VivoPower is setting aside about $121 million to build its own XRP stash. The public announcement highlights a recent private placement led by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. Most of the $121 million raised will go straight into the coin. VivoPower even wants to rebrand itself as the world’s first company focused on XRP. That’s a bold goal for a firm listed on Nasdaq. If everything goes to plan, XRP would play a big role in how VivoPower manages money and transactions. Wellgistics Health Joins Trend Wellgistics Health, a healthcare company you might not expect to dive into cryptocurrency, has its own $50 million set aside for XRP. The cash came in last month and is meant for PX (purchase and hold XRP) and to use XRP for real-time payments. Wellgistics says it wants to cut out delays and fees that come with old‐school payment methods. By sending and receiving XRP, the company believes it can move money faster when it pays vendors or gets paid by customers. It’s a sign that even outside tech or finance, firms see value in holding crypto.

Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto mining now consumes more energy than the Philippines, but RichMiner’s AI + green power model promises to deliver 1.61% daily returns. Table of Contents Three technical pillars for soaring returns Investor strategy with a daily return of 1.61% Future layout: DePIN+AI reconstructs energy network Conclusion The global energy consumption of crypto mining has exceeded the national electricity consumption of the Philippines, and 60% of the income of traditional mines is swallowed up by energy costs. When Musk suspended Bitcoin payments due to “carbon emissions” and the EU’s Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA) imposed a 30% carbon tax on non-green electricity mining, a cloud mining platform called RichMiner, relying on its “AI + green electricity” dual engines, set an industry record of 1.61% daily returns, opening up a new blue ocean of passive income for investors. Three technical pillars for soaring returns RichMiner’s core competitiveness stems from its hard-core architecture that deeply integrates AI algorithms, renewable energy and compliant financial frameworks: AI intelligent mining engine – the center for maximizing returns. Zero threshold dynamic switching: The platform’ AI analyzes the prices and computing power requirements of currencies such as BTC, ETH, and DOGE in real time, and automatically switches the user’s computing power to the currency with the highest return, with more than a thousand optimizations per day. Fully automated operation and maintenance: 24/7 monitoring of mining machine status, with a self-repair rate of 95%, ensuring continuous and uninterrupted operation of equipment. Anti-volatility strategy: When the halving of Bitcoin causes computing power fluctuations, the system automatically transfers 30% of computing power to emerging high-yield currencies (such as Dogecoin) to buffer the decline in revenue. Green power network – the cornerstone of low-cost mining: RichMiner deploys mining farms in renewable energy-rich areas such as plateaus and global deserts. Direct connection to power plants reduces costs by 40%: By building solar farms and wind farms, the electricity cost is only 60% of that of traditional mines. Zero-carbon certificate traceability: Every kilowatt-hour of electricity is matched with an international renewable energy certificate (REC), and carbon emissions are more than 75% lower than coal-fired power plants. Avoid electricity price fluctuations: Users do not need to bear the risk of fossil energy price increases (such as a 200% surge in electricity prices during the European gas crisis in 2024), and the stability of income is increased by 50%. Green data center diagram: RichMiner’s distributed green mines use solar and wind energy to directly supply electricity, reducing energy costs by 40%. Investor strategy with a daily return of 1.61% In 2025, RichMiner launched the “Short-term High Turnover Contract Matrix” to break through the traditional mining payback period limit with scientific calculations: Key strategies for explosive returns: Compound interest reinvestment: Daily returns (such as $8,800 contracts earning $141.68 per day) can be invested in higher-level contracts to increase returns; Newcomer benefits: Register and receive a $15 reward, with daily returns of $0.6.

2025-06-05T20:11:38,"XRP Proponent Connects the Dots Between Ripple and BlackRock, Sets Timeline for $25 – $75 Price","A prominent XRP advocate, known as The Real Remi Relief on X, has stirred significant attention in the digital asset community with a bold post connecting influential names and institutions in a narrative that could have monumental implications for XRP’s valuation. The post outlines key relationships and recent developments involving Ripple, BlackRock, and former U.S. President Donald Trump, hinting at the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and projecting a dramatic price surge between $25.00 and $75.00 by June or July 2025. The Ripple-BlackRock Connection: Robert Mitchnick’s Role At the heart of Remi Relief’s post is Robert Mitchnick, a former Ripple employee who now serves as the head of digital assets at BlackRock. Mitchnick’s position at the world’s largest asset manager is not new, but his Ripple ties have gained renewed scrutiny amid growing speculation that BlackRock could soon enter the XRP ETF space . Ripple “ex”-employee is the head of digital assets at BlackRock Ladies and Gentlemen Do NOT forget: 1) Ripple “ex”-employee Robert Mitchnick is the head of digital assets at BlackRock 2) Larry Fink (BlackRock), Trump and Ripple were all in the Middle East together… pic.twitter.com/SFjK4Hzv8g — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 5, 2025 Mitchnick, whose career includes a brief but strategic stint at Ripple, has led BlackRock’s digital asset initiatives since 2020. While BlackRock has been cautious in its crypto engagement, it made headlines in 2023 by securing SEC approval for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The firm has since expanded into Ethereum, fueling market speculation that XRP could be next. The XRP community sees Mitchnick’s past association with Ripple as a potential strategic bridge, especially given Ripple’s efforts to establish XRP as a key liquidity solution for institutional finance. The possibility that BlackRock might harness XRP in future offerings, whether through ETFs, tokenized finance, or cross-border settlement, has ignited discussions across the digital asset space. BlackRock, Ripple, and Trump in the Middle East Another intriguing point raised by Remi Relief is the reported convergence of Larry Fink (CEO of BlackRock), Ripple representatives, and former President Donald Trump in the Middle East last month. While exact details of this gathering remain speculative and largely unreported by mainstream media, several crypto commentators have noted overlapping international appearances during the period, especially surrounding events in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh that focused on digital asset innovation and tokenized finance. Ripple has made no secret of its ambitions in the Middle East, where it has deepened ties with central banks and financial institutions. The region is also a growing focus for BlackRock, particularly in light of the Gulf states’ vision to diversify away from oil dependence and embrace fintech innovation. Trump’s presence, possibly tied to private investment discussions or speaking engagements, adds another layer of intrigue, though no direct link to XRP has been confirmed. While it is difficult to verify the specifics of the meeting alluded to in Remi Relief’s post, the overlapping presence of these powerful entities in the same geopolitical space at a time of accelerating crypto institutionalization cannot be easily dismissed. The BlackRock XRP ETF Rumor and Its Lingering Shadow Adding fuel to the fire is the memory of the so-called “false” XRP ETF filing that surfaced in 2023 . The application, which was publicly visible on the Delaware Department of State’s website, listed BlackRock as the issuer of an XRP Trust. BlackRock swiftly denied involvement and claimed no knowledge of the filing, prompting headlines and regulatory scrutiny. Despite the denial, the document was never officially removed. The filing remains publicly accessible, leading many in the XRP community to speculate that it may have been a strategic trial balloon or an internal filing prematurely leaked. Remi Relief references this episode as a potential breadcrumb pointing to future action. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The persistence of the XRP Trust filing, combined with BlackRock’s ongoing crypto exploration, continues to raise eyebrows. Institutional ETF filings often move behind closed doors until strategic moments of announcement. Some analysts believe BlackRock may be quietly gauging regulatory sentiment toward XRP, especially given Ripple’s partial legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023. Institutional Floodgate Theory and the Hurricane Metaphor Perhaps the most striking part of Remi Relief’s post is the metaphor of ETFs arriving like a “hurricane… wiping everything off the exchanges.” This imagery captures a widely held belief in the XRP community: that institutional approval and capital influx will rapidly drain liquidity from retail exchanges and reallocate it into custodial ETF products. Remi Relief suggests that once BlackRock officially files for an XRP ETF, a domino effect will ensue, prompting other asset managers to follow suit. This is a scenario similar to what unfolded in the Bitcoin ETF space, where BlackRock’s entry was followed by a wave of applications and approvals from Fidelity, VanEck, and others. In the case of XRP, such a cascade would not only validate the asset’s regulatory standing but could also fuel a parabolic price move, especially if supply constraints, such as Ripple’s large escrow holdings and delisting on major U.S. exchanges, intersect with sudden institutional demand. The $25.00 – $75.00 Price Projection: Hope or Hype? The most headline-grabbing aspect of Remi Relief’s post is his projection that XRP could reach between $25.00 and $75.00 within the June–July 2025 window. For context, XRP is currently trading at approximately $2.15, making this forecast extremely ambitious. However, skeptics argue that such a price would require trillions in new capital and significant real-world utility adoption. While the $75.00 mark may seem extreme, many in the XRP community believe that a multi-dollar price is inevitable, especially if XRP becomes a foundational asset in global finance.

The company is working with an advisor to gauge buyer interest, the report said. CoinFlip could seek at least $1 billion in a deal, though the valuation is far from guaranteed. Discussions are still in early stages and may not result in a transaction. CoinFlip’s move follows a wave of high-profile crypto acquisitions in 2025, driven by a rally in bitcoin’s BTC price. Players like Kraken, Ripple and Coinbase have inked deals worth over billions of dollars this year, with others eyeing acquisitions to bolster their balance sheets or prepare for public listings. Founded in 2015, CoinFlip has expanded its footprint beyond the U.S. to markets like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

2025-06-05T20:03:51,"Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million, Calls it the Only “True Hard Money”","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) will soar to $1 million per coin, cementing its position as “the only true hard money.” Speaking on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Austin, Texas, last week, Hoskinson outlined a bold new vision for Bitcoin’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), highlighting a future in which BTC not only serves as a store of value but also powers a vast, scalable financial ecosystem. “In the next few years, Bitcoin could grow to $500,000 or even a million per coin,” Hoskinson said. “ We’re talking about a $10 trillion ecosystem, comparable to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin can move, earn yield, and power new systems. That’s the difference.” Notbaly, the session brought together key teams from Input Output, Lace, Fairgate, Babylon, and others, who showcased pioneering cross-chain integrations. The centerpiece was a live demonstration of a seamless on-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano within the Lace wallet, a technical milestone that enables Bitcoin to interact with DeFi protocols without centralized intermediaries. Hoskinson emphasized that the infrastructure being built is designed not only for Bitcoin, but also for its forks like Litecoin and Dogecoin. Central to this innovation is BitVMX, a groundbreaking virtual machine developed on the open-source RISC-V instruction set. BitVMX allows smart contracts, traditionally limited to networks like Ethereum and Cardano, to run on Bitcoin’s base layer using zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain computation. “This isn’t about replacing Bitcoin,” he noted. “ It’s about expanding what Bitcoin can do while preserving its core values, decentralization, immutability, and user sovereignty.” In a follow-up interview published Wednesday, Hoskinson likened the user experience of Bitcoin DeFi to a toggle in a wallet. “You turn DeFi mode on, and suddenly you can lend, borrow, swap-all while paying fees in Bitcoin and maintaining custody. When you’re done, turn it off. Your BTC goes back where it came from.” He further stressed that the underlying technology may be complex, but the user experience is designed to be intuitive and straightforward. Trustless bridges, smart contracts on Cardano, and BitVMX ’s taproot-based execution model all work under the hood to ensure security and transparency. Hoskinson concluded by reaffirming his long-standing belief in Bitcoin’s foundational role in crypto. “There is only one god in this space, and it’s Bitcoin. What we’re doing now is giving it the ecosystem it deserves.” He added. BTC traded at $101,966 at press time, reflecting a 2.92% drop in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-predicts-bitcoin-will-hit-1-million-calls-it-the-only-true-hard-money/,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|ETH|FIAT","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson",cryptocompare

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could replace gold as “hard money” and could consequently go up 188x in two decades. “My long-term target for BTC price is not dollars as that continues to be debased. My target is World GDP/21 million. Give or take +/- 50%. It will take the good part of two decades to get there… …If it takes 20 years to get to equilibrium and the US dollar is still a leading currency, then $20 million per coin +/- 50%.” In 20 years, the analyst says the global nominal GDP could nearly quadruple from the current level. “Real GDP growth is 2%, while debasement is 5%. So if we inflate GDP at 7% per year for 20 years measured in debasing US dollar, that would be $425 trillion or $20 million per coin give or take 50%.” Over the shorter term, the analyst says Bitcoin is finding it “hard to move up” as there’s a high level of speculative activity in the market. “NOW is a BAD TIME to take paper bets on BTC. It’s open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting. BTC is waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time highs.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,074 at time of writing.

While Uber is not currently planning to add digital assets such as Bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet, Khosrowshahi confirmed Bitcoin’s status as a “proven store of value.” BREAKING: $176 BILLION UBER CEO TELLS BLOOMBERG #BITCOIN IS A ""PROVEN"" STORE OF VALUE AND THAT IT'S EXPLORING ACCEPTING CRYPTO PAYMENTS BTC IS GOING MAINSTREAM.

That’s good for business, that’s good for our riders and our eaters,” he explained in earlier interviews. Stablecoins are gaining traction as a tool for cross-border payments due to their ability to provide faster, lower-cost transfers compared to conventional banking systems. For global companies like Uber, the adoption of stablecoins could greatly improve international fund management. Uber stock was also up by 1.11% at the time of writing, according to Google Finance.
