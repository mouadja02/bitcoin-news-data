In contrast, trading volumes have surged by 39.75%, reaching $144.4 billion, suggesting a wave of panic selling or forced exits. Amidst this volatility, crypto ETF outflows recorded a sizable $267.1 million withdrawal. Surprisingly, the Fear & Greed Index remains relatively stable at 46, indicating neutral sentiment despite sharp market reactions. Why Did the Crypto Market Crash Today? The following catalysts triggered a domino effect of selling across major tokens. Political & Social Sentiment : A public dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk around policy bills further rattled market confidence, sparking debate and confusion across social media. Mass Liquidation Events : High-leverage positions across multiple assets faced forced closures, exacerbating the downward momentum. Macroeconomic Headwinds : Investors are anxious ahead of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ release of non-farm payroll data and the unemployment rate later today. These figures could heavily influence Fed policy, prompting cautious sentiment. Crypto Liquidations Hit $1 Billion In the past 24 hours, the crypto market bore over $1 billion in liquidations, a majority of which were $900 million+ worth of long positions. Short liquidations made up just around $100 million, clearly reflecting the bull trap that caught over-leveraged buyers off guard. Bitcoin alone saw $341.76 million in liquidations, followed closely by Ethereum at $285.99 million. Source: Coin Glass Top exchanges like Bybit with $352M, and Binance with $248M led the tally in liquidated positions, with more than 89% of these being long trades. This steep wipeout not only intensified the sell-off but also hints at growing nervousness among traders, especially those relying on leveraged gains. Source: Coin Glass What to Expect Next? Despite today’s fall, the neutral score in the Fear & Greed Index suggests the market isn’t in a full-blown panic yet. Looking at the chart, the total crypto market cap has slipped from above $3.3 trillion to $3.17 trillion, signaling a break below key support. The 9-day SMA at $3.23T now acts as a resistance. If the market fails to reclaim this level soon, further downside toward $3T is likely. If you are keen on Bitcoin’s future, our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is a must-read!

2025-06-06T07:38:08,"Analysis Firm Claims We Are at a “Historic Turning Point” for Bitcoin: “It Will Never Be Like This Again”","Bitcoin-focused financial services firm Swan has released a remarkable analysis of the cryptocurrency markets. The company warns that the current cycle is different from others and that we may be witnessing “the last Bitcoin rotation before everything changes.” Swan argued that despite being in the final year of the classic four-year cycle, price action has not generated as much excitement as expected. While past cycles have seen parabolic increases in Bitcoin’s third green year, 2025 has so far seen a slower, more measured, and sideways market. According to the analysis, a major shift is taking place under the surface in the Bitcoin market. Investors who have held BTC for a long time are selling above the $100,000 level, while BlackRock, Fidelity, large companies and institutional buyers who have established long-term strategic positions are taking their place. Swan states that this new class of investors is not for sale. Swan CIO Ben Werkman said: “These companies are not buying Bitcoin to trade, but to hold it in their long-term portfolios. They are simply buyers. Not sellers.” When long-term capital is combined with inelastic supply, market supply can dry up quickly, with “explosive” consequences for prices, according to Werkman. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also contributed to the analysis, stating: “People who are not committed to the long term are exiting the market… and they are being replaced by a completely different class of investors.” Related News: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping - Is the Trade War Coming to an End? Here Are the Details of the Call Swan notes that this transformation is not only happening among investor types, but also between generations. After the Silent Generation who trusted in gold, the Baby Boomers who accumulated their wealth in stocks, and the Generation X who grew up with technology, now the Millennials who are starting to inherit trillions of dollars are coming onto the scene and they are choosing Bitcoin. In the analysis, it was argued that the structural transformation in Bitcoin is also supported by the macroeconomic background. Swan noted that the rise in bond yields while the US dollar is depreciating is an unusual and dangerous signal for global capital. Swan's remarkable analysis concluded with the following warning: “If you're selling Bitcoin right now, you're probably giving it to an institution that plans to hold it forever. You may not get it back. This isn't just the next cycle, it's the end of an era. The supply is running out. The buyers are different. The macro structure is breaking. This could be the last Bitcoin rotation.” *This is not investment advice.

With Bitcoin nearing $100K and Ethereum falling, XRP has also slipped over 4% as traders react to political tensions and a wider market sell-off. XRP Nears Key $2.40 Resistance Despite the recent drop, XRP appears to be gaining momentum. Analyst Dark Defender shared recently that XRP is nearing a major resistance level at $2.40 on the weekly chart. If it breaks this key level along with the RSI barrier, it could trigger a strong upward move. He shared that XRP has a strong price support at $2.22. If it holds above this support and breaks key resistance levels like $2.40, it could shoot up to as high as $5.85. The market seems to be ticking toward a breakout, and excitement is building across the XRP community. Analysts Point to Crucial Resistance at $2.36 for Breakout Analyst Egrag Crypto believes that for XRP to have a short-term bullish breakout, it needs to close above several key price levels. First, surpassing $2.30 would show early buying interest, followed by clearing $2.35 to strengthen the momentum. The most important level is $2.36, where XRP would break out from a major falling wedge pattern, which is a classic technical signal hinting at an upward trend. If it further closes above $2.45, then it shows strong bullish control, and crossing $2.65 is the key signal for a big upward move. XRP Could Follow 2017 Pattern, Rally Soon? Another analyst believes that if XRP is repeating its 2017 pattern, the final breakout could start in just 2 to 4 weeks. Back then, it had consolidated for 210 days, and this time, it has already been 190 days. So, a big move might be around the corner. However, XRP may first dip to $2 to grab liquidity before pumping. XRP is trading around $2.12, down 4% in 24 hours. It is now testing key support near $2.07. If it breaks lower, more losses could follow. Almost all of the moving averages are negative except the 200-day EMA at $2.08, which might act as support. Indicators like MACD remain bearish, and traders seem to be waiting for a clear move. All eyes are on June 16 next, as a major Ripple v. SEC update is expected which could decide XRP’s course. Institutional interest in XRP is also growing as VivoPower, Webus, and ACG are making major investments.

2025-06-06T07:19:30,"Making of Millionaires: Expert Reveals Why Bitcoin and XRP Are Just Getting Started","Coach JV, a well-known voice in the cryptocurrency space, has presented a detailed case for why Bitcoin and XRP remain two of the most promising assets for future millionaires. Although both digital assets have been available for over a decade, the crypto commentator insists that their most significant gains could still lie ahead. His analysis is centered on the long-term fundamentals of these cryptocurrencies, including supply constraints, increasing institutional demand, and geopolitical shifts that favor broader crypto adoption. Why Bitcoin’s Supply Dynamics Point to Massive Upside According to Coach JV, Bitcoin’s scarcity remains one of its strongest value drivers. He notes that 95% of all Bitcoin has already been mined and distributed, leaving only 5% of the supply available for future circulation. This limited supply, coupled with rising demand from both retail and institutional buyers, creates a high probability of price escalation. Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, recently remarked that Bitcoin is in high demand and few are willing to sell, reinforcing the argument that growing interest is colliding with limited supply. Trump, who backs conservative financial policies, placed his baseline price prediction for Bitcoin at $170,000 but acknowledged that the $1 million figure is within reason. Coach JV highlighted that global leaders and political figures are now aligning with pro-Bitcoin policies. He referenced President Donald Trump’s executive order directing the United States to retain its Bitcoin holdings and not liquidate them. This move aligns with several pro-crypto legislative proposals now circulating in Washington, signaling a shift in official sentiment toward digital assets. Institutional Interest and Global Policy Add Momentum Momentum is also building internationally. Zia Yusuf, chairman of Reform UK, warned in a Bloomberg interview that the UK could fall behind economically if it excludes Bitcoin from its sovereign wealth fund. Such warnings underscore the asset’s increasing relevance at a governmental level, a trend that Coach JV argues could support prolonged upward movement in Bitcoin’s price. Supporters of the bullish outlook claim that this global policy trend may move Bitcoin out of its traditional four-year bull-bear cycle into a longer-term growth phase. This new environment, they argue, could be the catalyst for a significant number of new millionaires who accumulate the asset early enough. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin Compared to Early Tech Stocks Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, provided further historical perspective by comparing Bitcoin’s current market position to Apple’s in the mid-1990s. He stated that investing in Bitcoin at $105,000 in 2025 would be similar to buying Apple stock in 1995. Youngelman emphasized that a $1,000 investment in Apple in 1995 would now be worth $63 million, implying that Bitcoin may offer a comparable trajectory over the coming decades. XRP’s Millionaire Potential Coach JV also underscored XRP’s potential as a wealth-building asset. He believes XRP is positioned to benefit from the same wave of financial transformation that is propelling Bitcoin. The analyst argued that as Bitcoin rises, XRP could follow, especially as regulatory clarity around XRP continues to improve. Support for this view comes from other notable voices in the crypto space. Edo Farina predicted that XRP could increase by over 4,000% to reach $100 if Bitcoin reaches the $500,000 mark. Under this scenario, an investment of 10,000 XRP tokens, valued around $20,000 today, could grow into a $1 million portfolio. In addition, BarriC, another market analyst, suggested that XRP could trade between $500 and $1,000 by the 2030s, depending on the broader crypto market’s growth. While these figures are speculative, they reflect the growing optimism about XRP’s potential to create substantial wealth for long-term holders. Coach JV’s analysis, supported by numerous voices in the financial and political space, presents a compelling case that Bitcoin and XRP could generate significant wealth in the years ahead. His perspective emphasizes that, despite their past gains, both assets may still be in the early stages of global adoption. As institutional interest, supply dynamics, and regulatory policies align in favor of crypto, the road to millionaire status may remain open to those who position themselves accordingly.

Now that it’s back, is it signaling latent momentum. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal Institutional investors are still buying the dip Bitcoin’s quiet volume may be its loudest signal yet Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price has eased slightly since reaching a peak of $111,970 on May 22, pulling back to around $103,300 as of June 6, a decline of approx 8%. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Despite the drop, institutional appetite appears to remain intact. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded around $5.24 billion in net inflows during May, suggesting that investor interest has not diminished with the slowdown in price momentum. Meanwhile, sentiment indicators are showing a neutral picture. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index stands at 46, placing the market in the “Neutral” zone and waiting for further triggers. Amid this, on-chain analyst CryptoCon has highlighted a rare but historically consistent pattern known as the “Bitcoin Super Signal.” The signal is triggered when trading volumes fall to extremely low levels while prices remain in a broader uptrend. A new Bitcoin Super Signal has appeared, which happens when volume reaches extremely low levels inside a bull market. This is the lowest volume reading since 2014. The other super signal this cycle gave us a 200% run from October 2023 to March 2024. Before that, only two other… pic.twitter.com/Zkd4rzDaTi — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 4, 2025 Based on CryptoCon’s data, current trading volume is at its lowest level since 2014. Only three previous instances have met the same criteria. Each one was followed by a significant bull run. So far, there is no clear evidence that the current cycle has reached a peak. Bitcoin continues to trade within bullish territory, while volume continues to decline. Historically, this combination has preceded sharp upward moves, even if the market appears quiet on the surface. To make sense of what this signal could mean now, we need to look at its previous appearances, how each one played out, and why it tends to emerge when market conditions appear deceptively calm. Decoding Bitcoin’s Super Signal In Bitcoin’s chart history, sharp rallies often emerge after extended periods of low activity. The Volume Oscillator Super Signal is one of the few indicators that captures this pattern by using volume, rather than price, as the leading input. It highlights moments when trading activity drops to historically low levels while the broader trend remains upward. Only four such signals have appeared: December 2012, October 2016, September 2023, and most recently, June 2025. The indicator works by applying a volume oscillator to Bitcoin’s monthly chart. When volume dips below a defined threshold during a bull trend, it signals a shift in market structure. Most sellers have likely exited, and buyers may be accumulating with minimal resistance. From a liquidity perspective, this implies reduced supply pressure. As a result, even moderate demand can push prices higher once market momentum returns. In 2012, the signal appeared when Bitcoin was trading below $15. Over the following year, the price surged more than 10,600%, forming the 2013 bull cycle that brought Bitcoin into mainstream attention. The next instance came in October 2016, when Bitcoin stood near $700. The cycle that followed peaked around $20,000 in late 2017, marking a 3,461% increase from the signal to the cycle top. In both cases, the signal emerged during low-volume periods, not at moments of retail frenzy. Price was climbing steadily, but broader interest had not yet returned. The same pattern repeated in September 2023. Bitcoin was trading around $25,000, volume dropped into the “extreme low” zone, and the market remained cautious due to macro uncertainty. Within six months, Bitcoin reached $75,000, posting a 200% gain. Institutional investors are still buying the dip The latest Super Signal appeared in June 2025, as the Volume Oscillator dropped into its extreme low zone. Current readings show the lowest volume level since 2014, despite Bitcoin still trading above $100,000 and U.S. spot ETFs continuing to record multi-billion dollar inflows. The contrast may seem counterintuitive, but historically, low volume in a bullish setup often signals that sellers have exited and buyers are accumulating quietly. In such conditions, market depth shrinks. Even moderate inflows of capital can move prices significantly due to a lack of sell-side resistance. Chart data supports this pattern through color-coded volume zones. Red boxes, which mark volume blow-offs and often indicate market tops, have consistently appeared at the end of previous bull cycles, including in 2014, 2018, and 2021. None has appeared so far in this cycle. In contrast, blue-circled areas highlight the Super Signals — moments when volume reaches deeply suppressed levels while the trend remains upward. These signals have historically emerged at early or mid-stages of a rally, not at its end. The current chart closes with a question mark near today’s price, suggesting the current move may still be unfolding. It is important to distinguish between Super Signals and standard volume pivots. Not all volume dips lead to strong rallies. Green-circled pivots on the oscillator identify periods of moderately low volume followed by smaller upward moves. Super Signals occur only when volume is at unusually low levels and the broader price structure remains intact. Macroeconomic conditions add further context. The fiscal environment has shifted once again following the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which brought renewed government spending and added concerns about long-term liquidity. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain elevated, and risk assets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a softer global monetary stance. In that backdrop, Bitcoin holds a structurally favorable position. ETF flows continue to provide consistent demand. Sell-side pressure remains limited, and trading volumes are compressed, creating a setup where price can move quickly if fresh capital enters. On-chain behavior reflects a shift back toward accumulation. According to Glassnode, wallets holding between 10 and 100 BTC now show a perfect accumulation score of 1.0, indicating strong, sustained buying activity. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 The same score has been recorded in wallets holding less than 1 BTC, suggesting retail interest is also building. Accumulation during low-volume phases typically reflects optimism. Participants are not rushing in, but they are positioning quietly, waiting for confirmation before larger moves unfold.

Security researchers at ThreatFabric say Crocodilus, a new and sophisticated strain of malware that targets mobile banking apps and crypto wallets on Android phones. “Crocodilus enters the scene not as a simple clone, but as a fully-fledged threat from the outset, equipped with modern techniques such as remote control, black screen overlays, and advanced data harvesting via accessibility logging.” ThreatFabric says Crocodilus is emerging as a major threat since it first detected the malware in March. “Notably, its campaigns are no longer regionally confined; the malware has extended its reach to new geographical areas, underscoring its transition into a truly global threat.” One alarming evolution detected in Crocodilus is its ability to infiltrate the user’s contact list and add itself to it, bypassing fraud detection programs that flag callers not in a user’s contacts. “…Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats. Already observed targeting banks in Spain and Turkey and popular cryptocurrency wallets, Crocodilus is clearly engineered to go after high-value assets. The rise of new threats like Crocodilus shows that basic, signature-based detection methods are no longer enough—especially in the early stages when the malware first starts spreading. To stay protected, financial institutions should adopt a layered security approach that includes thorough device and behaviour-based risk analysis on their customers’ devices.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-06T07:00:54,"Trump-Backed World Liberty Foundation Sends Cease-and-Desist Over $TRUMP Wallet Plans","Key Takeaways: A Trump family-linked entity, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), has issued a cease-and-desist to block the launch of a Trump-branded crypto wallet by Fight Fight Fight LLC. The wallet, promoted in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden, was announced without the approval of the Trump Organization or WLFI. Donald Trump Jr. and other family members have publicly disavowed the project and reaffirmed support for WLFI’s forthcoming official crypto product. Tensions are rising inside Donald Trump’s growing crypto orbit as a Trump family-backed organization moves to block a crypto wallet launch tied to the former president’s name. According to a Bloomberg report published Thursday, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a company linked to the Trump family, has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC. The letter challenges the firm’s plans to launch a Trump-branded crypto wallet in partnership with NFT marketplace Magic Eden. Fight Fight Fight is the same company that helped launch the $TRUMP memecoin earlier this year. The firm is led by Bill Zanker, a longtime friend and promoter of Donald Trump. Zanker’s company also owns the website GetTrumpMemes.com, which promotes the TRUMP token. Trump Family Disavows $TRUMP Wallet Project as Legal Battle Erupts Over Crypto Branding The cease-and-desist comes after Fight Fight Fight and Magic Eden opened a waitlist for the Trump-branded wallet earlier this week. The project appeared to move forward without involvement from the Trump Organization or approval from WLFI.

That account has since been deleted. A cease-and-desist was also sent to Magic Eden , according to the Bloomberg report. Magic Eden’s Trump wallet launch sparks backlash as the Trump family denies ties and warns against unauthorized branding. #TrumpWallet #MagicEden https://t.co/aYRjHDwUzB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Other members of the Trump family, including Eric and Barron Trump, also posted messages distancing themselves from the wallet project and reaffirming support for WLFI’s version. The dispute indicates deepening divisions within Trump’s expanding digital asset efforts. While WLFI is directly linked to the Trump family, Fight Fight Fight maintains control of the memecoin that bears his name. Despite the pushback, the TRUMP token has seen massive financial success. According to Chainalysis, the project has generated over $300 million in fees for its owners. Fight Fight Fight reportedly shares 80% of the token’s supply with CIC Digital LLC, another Trump-affiliated group. Zanker’s company takes its name from Trump’s “Fight, fight, fight” slogan, coined after his first assassination attempt. But now, it finds itself at odds with Trump’s own inner circle. The cease-and-desist letters add legal weight to an increasingly public split over who controls the Trump brand in crypto and how far each side is willing to go to claim it. $TRUMP Token Tanks $130M as Cease-and-Desist Sparks Market Chaos Minutes after the World Liberty Foundation issued a cease-and-desist to the creators of the Trump Wallet, the meme coin $TRUMP lost over $130 million in market cap. The token dropped 11% in 24 hours and is now trading at $9.61, with a total market cap of $1.92 billion, according to Coingecko. Trading volume, however, surged 129% to over $713 million, reflecting a sudden spike in activity following the news.

Analysts Warn Of 30% Dip If This Level Doesn’t Hold","SUI, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, has recorded an impressive price recovery over the past two months. However, as the cryptocurrency fails to hold some key levels, some analysts warn of a potential drop below the $3.00 support. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes 15% Move Amid Key Resistance Retest – Breakout Or Rejection Next? SUI Rally Risks Massive Price Drop Since hitting its four-month high of $4.29, SUI’s price has been moving sideways, hovering between $3.40-$4.00 throughout most of May. Amid last week’s market retrace, the altcoin recorded a 14.2% price drop, losing its range and hitting the $3.00 support over the weekend. At the start of this week, SUI saw a mild recovery alongside the rest of the market, surging to the $3.20 area. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has failed to hold this level over the past 24 hours and dropped to the $3.10-$3.15 area on Thursday morning. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt warned that the cryptocurrency’s rally could be in danger as it risks breaking down of a descending triangle pattern. Per the post, the altcoin has been trading within this formation for the past month, also displaying a potential Head & Shoulders setup forming inside of the triangle, and the pattern’s baseline sitting around the $3.10 support. To the analyst, “if it breaks out of this triangle to the downside, then the fall can be very hard,” forecasting a nearly 35% retrace toward the $2.00 mark. On the contrary, a breakout to the upside could propel SUI’s price toward the $4.20 resistance. Analyst Crypto Bullet recently highlighted a “humongous” rising wedge pattern in the cryptocurrency’s chart, which eyes the $8-$10 area as the next major target. According to the chart, SUI has been moving within this pattern since early 2024, hovering between the upper and lower boundaries for over a year. Notably, the cryptocurrency hit the support trendline one more time during the April low, bouncing from this level. Based on this, the analyst considers that the current dip could be “the last opportunity to add to your bags before SUI makes a new ATH.” Can It Repeat Its Late 2024 Playbook? Analyst Rekt Capital noted that SUI was positioned for a bullish Monthly Candle Close in May, aiming to replicate its late 2024 performance. Last year, the cryptocurrency retested the $3.39 level and turned it into support, which acted as a springboard toward its January 2025 all-time high (ATH) of $5.35. This time, May closed below this crucial level, failing to confirm it as support and losing the recent price range. SUI is now “showcasing very early signs of upside wicking into said level to turn it into new resistance.” The analyst warned that June could see the cryptocurrency reject from this level “if things don’t change over the course of this month.” SUI is currently located inside the $2.33-$3.39 price range and is trying to position itself for a reclaim of the Range High to facilitate a breakout. However, it has unsuccessfully attempted to surge to that level, which could send the price toward lower levels if it “continues to float here without covering additional ground.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To Face ‘One Last Speed Bump’ Before Rally To $140,000 – Analyst Therefore, SUI risks dropping 10% toward the $2.81 mid-range area, which acted as support and weak resistance earlier this year, and falling 30% to the $2.33 range low if the previous level doesn’t hold. “If SUI fails to show signs of reclaiming $3.39 as support (at least on the Daily timeframe via Daily Closes above $3.39), then sub-$3 regions could be on the cards,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.08, a 2.3% decline in the daily timeframe.

2025-06-06T07:00:21,"CME CEO Questions Cryptocurrency Use Case, Champions Stablecoin Potential","BitcoinWorld CME CEO Questions Cryptocurrency Use Case, Champions Stablecoin Potential In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets, opinions from leaders in traditional finance carry significant weight. Terry Duffy, the influential CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), recently shared his perspective, offering a cautious view on the broader cryptocurrency space while highlighting a specific area he believes holds substantial promise: stablecoins. CME CEO’s View on Cryptocurrency Use Case Terry Duffy, at the helm of one of the world’s largest derivatives marketplaces, is no stranger to innovation in financial markets. However, when it comes to the general utility of cryptocurrencies beyond speculation, Duffy expressed reservations in a recent interview reported by BlockBeats. He stated that the ultimate use case for crypto has not yet been definitively established or confirmed. This perspective from a major player in traditional finance is noteworthy. While many proponents champion cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for various applications – from digital gold and decentralized finance (DeFi) to smart contracts and NFTs – Duffy’s comment suggests that from a traditional market infrastructure standpoint, a clear, widespread, and enduring practical application for many cryptocurrencies remains elusive or unproven on a large scale. What might contribute to this perceived lack of clarity regarding the ultimate Cryptocurrency Use Case ? Several factors could be at play: Volatility: The significant price swings inherent in many cryptocurrencies make them challenging for everyday transactions or as a stable store of value for many traditional businesses and consumers. Scalability Issues: Some blockchain networks face limitations in processing high volumes of transactions quickly and cheaply, hindering widespread adoption for payments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations creates a hesitant environment for large institutions and businesses to fully commit to integrating cryptocurrencies. Complexity: For the average person, understanding and securely using cryptocurrencies can be complex compared to traditional financial systems. Identifying Stablecoin Potential While expressing caution about the general cryptocurrency landscape, Duffy drew a clear distinction when discussing stablecoins. Specifically, he pointed to U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins as having significant Stablecoin Potential . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or sometimes to commodities or algorithms. Duffy believes these digital assets can play a crucial role in reducing friction within the existing financial system. What kind of friction are we talking about? Think about the inefficiencies, delays, and costs associated with traditional cross-border payments, interbank transfers, or even certain types of domestic transactions. Stablecoins, leveraging blockchain technology, offer the possibility of: Faster settlement times, potentially near-instantaneous. Lower transaction fees, especially for international transfers. Increased transparency on a distributed ledger. 24/7 availability, unlike traditional banking hours. This potential to streamline financial processes is where Duffy sees a clear and valuable application for digital assets, particularly those designed for price stability. Why Banks and Stablecoins Are a Natural Fit? Perhaps one of the most forward-looking comments from the CME CEO was his assertion that banks should possess the capability to issue stablecoins. This aligns with a growing trend where traditional financial institutions are exploring or developing their own digital currency initiatives, often referred to as institutional stablecoins or wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The idea of Banks and Stablecoins coexisting or with banks issuing them directly makes sense from several perspectives: Leveraging Existing Infrastructure & Trust: Banks already have the infrastructure, regulatory compliance frameworks, and customer trust necessary to issue and manage financial instruments reliably. Efficiency Gains: Banks could use stablecoins for more efficient interbank settlements, clearing, and potentially even retail payments, reducing operational costs and risks associated with legacy systems. Staying Relevant: As the financial world explores tokenization and digital assets, issuing stablecoins allows banks to remain central players in the evolving Digital Assets Future rather than being bypassed by new entrants. Enhanced Services: Banks could offer new services built on stablecoin rails, such as programmable payments or instant payroll. While the concept is compelling, the path for banks to widely issue stablecoins involves navigating complex regulatory hurdles, technological integration challenges, and ensuring interoperability with existing financial systems. The Broader Implications for the Digital Assets Future Terry Duffy’s comments underscore a key debate within the financial world: the distinction between speculative digital assets and utility-focused digital currencies. His view, coming from a leader in traditional derivatives markets which have listed Bitcoin and Ether futures, suggests that while there’s institutional interest in providing exposure to crypto volatility, the focus for practical, systemic integration might lean towards stable, regulated digital currencies. The emphasis on Stablecoin Potential and the role of Banks and Stablecoins highlights a potential path for digital assets to become more deeply embedded in mainstream finance. This isn’t necessarily about replacing fiat currency but creating a more efficient digital layer on top of it, facilitated by trusted financial institutions. What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are an investor, a business owner, or simply interested in the future of money, these insights offer valuable perspective: For Investors: Understand the difference between volatile cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Duffy’s comments suggest that the long-term value proposition for different types of digital assets might vary significantly, influenced by their practical application and regulatory treatment. For Businesses: Explore how stablecoins could potentially improve payment processing, supply chain finance, or treasury management efficiency in the future, especially as banks become more involved. For Policymakers & Regulators: Duffy’s call for banks to issue stablecoins implicitly advocates for a regulatory framework that allows and governs such activities, ensuring stability and consumer protection. Conclusion: A Pragmatic View on Digital Assets Terry Duffy’s perspective from the CME offers a pragmatic, institution-focused view on the digital asset space. While acknowledging that the ultimate, widespread Cryptocurrency Use Case for many digital assets remains under development or unclear from his vantage point, he clearly identifies significant Stablecoin Potential . His vision of Banks and Stablecoins working together, with banks issuing these digital currencies, points towards a future where regulated, stable digital assets play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the existing financial system. This focus on practical application and integration within established frameworks provides a compelling insight into how traditional finance leaders view the evolving Digital Assets Future .

His wild ride in the world of perpetual contracts (perps) and his confessions about how he handled that success have left many stunned and curious. Let’s dive in and see what happened behind the scenes of James Wynn’s rollercoaster journey. From Meme Coins to Millions In a recent tweet post, James Wynn said that he wasn’t always trading big. Before diving into Bitcoin perps, he was better known for calling out meme coins, where he made headlines by calling out Pepe Coin when it was worth only $600,000. His bet on Pepe turned into a huge success story, earning him an impressive eight-figure profit. This early win gave him confidence and a reputation as a risk-taker in the crypto community. I started trading on perps in March, had never traded perps before, in-fact never really traded properly before, I’ve just traded meme coins. (Before I was known for calling pepe at 600k and making 8 figures). In one month I turned about $3m into $100m and then lost it all in… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 6, 2025 In March, James took his trading game up a notch, shifting from meme coins to Bitcoin perpetuals. Surprisingly, in just one month, he turned a starting balance of around $3 million into a jaw-dropping $100 million . His success was widely visible thanks to blockchain tracking, and he quickly gathered hundreds of thousands of followers eager to watch his next move. When Hype Becomes a Trap As James Wynn’s fame grew, so did the pressure. He felt he had to prove himself after turning $3 million into $100 million. But instead of careful trading, he started gambling, trying to get back the money he lost. He didn’t see the huge numbers on the screen as real money anymore. On May 19, Wynn made a risky Bitcoin trade using 40x leverage, starting with 5,520 BTC. He later added more Bitcoin, ending up with over 9,300 BTC, worth over $1 billion. At one point, he was up by $10 million. But when the U.S. tariff news hit, prices dropped fast. Wynn lost $60 million in one day. Even though he still had $25 million from earlier, in just a week, all his $100 million gains were gone, lost on the HyperLiquid platform. Warning and a Wink Despite the pain of losing so much, Wynn hasn’t lost his sense of humor. He even joked about using his affiliate link for those still wanting to trade, but his story is a reminder of the risks and rewards that come with high-stakes trading.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-wynn-how-a-high-risk-trader-lost-his-100-million-fortune/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare

Tesla dropped 15%, Bitcoin keeps sliding, and altcoins are also dropping fast. The crypto market cap is down 4.8% in the last 24 hours and the U.S. stocks also dipped slightly amidst the chaos. Cryptocurrencies Take Big Hit Bitcoin was down over 4% to $100,500 earlier today, and is close to dropping below $100K for the first time in a month. It is currently trading at $102,995.

The TRUMP meme coin crashed 9.3% during the Musk-Trump fight. Crypto stocks like Coinbase also fell 4.6%, MicroStrategy dropped 2.4%, and miners like MARA, Riot, and Core Scientific also fell about 5%. $1 Billion in Crypto Liquidations Nearly $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in 24 hours, mostly from long bets. Bitcoin alone saw $341M in daily liquidations, while Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $278M outflows as institutions pulled back. Data from Glassnode showed that many long-term Bitcoin holders started selling after BTC hit a record $111,970 in May, raising the chances of a short-term price drop. ETH futures also saw a 5.5% drop in open interest and $260M in long liquidations.

Reports hint that the White House is even holding emergency talks to see how this might affect the economy. Politics Getting in the Way? With good news around rate cuts and rising institutional buys, politics is clouding the market mood. Bitcoin is hanging tough around $100K, but if long liquidations continue, it could drop to around $95,000–$98,000 before finding solid support. However, traders are confident that Bitcoin will hit $120,000 by the year-end. The strong corporate buying and low volatility have kept the optimism high, with a 69% chance on the Polymarket betting platform.

The bromance is cracking. When even your biggest fanboy billionaire backs away from your fiscal fantasyland, you know the house of cards is… pic.twitter.com/8E5j6cjZVc — Brian Allen (@allenanalysis) June 5, 2025 An extraordinary social media feud erupted on Thursday, causing a deterioration in the once close relationship between the former allies over several hours. U.S. President Donald Trump and the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, hurled deeply personal insults over matters significant and insignificant. The President argued that it all started after he took away Elon’s EV Mandate, which forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted. Trump noted that the easiest way to save money in the U.S. budget was to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. “I’m very disappointed with Elon. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we’re going to cut the EV mandate.” -U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump said the bill was one of the greatest ever presented to Congress, with a record cut in expenses of $1.6 trillion. He says there will be a 68% tax increase if the legislation doesn’t pass. Musk called for Trump’s impeachment and mocked his connections to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump also claimed that Tesla’s mogul had gone “crazy” and threatened to cancel his multi-billion dollar federal contracts and tax subsidies for Musk’s companies. The tech billionaire had complained for weeks about the budget bill, using the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to estimate the legislation would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Musk condemned the bill as a “disgusting abomination.” The SpaceX owner responded to Trump’s claims, accusing the President of lying about the bill and being ungrateful for the millions he spent to get elected. Musk argued that Trump would have lost the election without him, Democrats would have controlled the House, and the Republicans would have been 51-49 in the Senate. Trump acknowledged that Musk’s contributions did not affect his winning the battleground in Pennsylvania. He also posted on Truth Social that he had fired Musk from his role as a special adviser because he was “wearing thin” at the White House. The Tesla mogul retaliated, saying the reason the Trump administration had not released the files into Epstein was because they implicated the President. Musk also quote-tweeted a post calling for Trump to be removed from office and said his tariffs would cause a recession. Shares in Musk’s electric vehicle company, Tesla, dropped almost 15% on Thursday afternoon,n coinciding with when Trump’s remarks began. The tech billionaire’s rocket company, SpaceX, is not publicly traded, but competitors to the firm surged on the news.

2025-06-06T06:42:01,"RichMiner announced: XRP achieved new financial heights through BTC and DOGE new energy cloud mining","The carbon compliance requirements of the EU Crypto-Asset Market Regulation Act (MiCA) are like the sword of Damocles hanging high, and traditional mining farms are struggling between closure and sky-high fines. RichMiner has torn a crack of counter-trend growth-in the first quarter of 2025, its global user revenue soared 58% year-on-year, and some American investors’ carbon certificate premium income even exceeded the basic mining income. This article focuses on how RichMiner uses green electricity and low-carbon mining and guides new users on how to join RichMiner to obtain higher mining income. Why is green electricity + cloud mining an inevitable trend? The European Union (MiCA) requires the disclosure of mining carbon footprints and the comprehensive withdrawal of thermal power mines-ending high energy consumption mode. The premise for companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy to hold Bitcoin is “clean energy mining”, and ESG ratings have become a capital entry pass. Surveys show that 73% of investors are willing to pay a premium for “low-carbon cryptocurrencies”. RichMiner’s secret to achieving soaring returns for holders: Dynamic green electricity + AI scheduling system to maximize returns; Technical essence – Dynamic optimization of mining energy consumption through AI matching grid load troughs with renewable energy (wind power/photovoltaic) production peaks. Automatic operation and maintenance monitoring – AI monitors the operating status of mining machines around the clock, automatically repairs abnormalities, and ensures stable operation. Dynamic switching: The platform’s AI algorithm analyzes the market (coin price, computing power demand) in real time, and automatically allocates computing power to the highest-yielding currency (such as BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.) to protect your income. AI + cloud computing power = a new generation of smart mining experience Join RichMiner, let technology make money for you, and let intelligence change the future! Compliance and stability foundation, peace of mind investment protection; Data encryption transmission: Adopt SSL/TLS encryption protocol to ensure the absolute security of user data during transmission. Cold wallet asset storage: Most of the platform’s digital assets use a cold wallet storage mechanism to isolate network risks and prevent hacker attacks. Regular security audits: Regular platform audits are conducted through a third-party security team to promptly fix vulnerabilities and continuously improve the platform’s defense capabilities. Green enhancement of the revenue cycle; Users do not need to bear the surge in electricity prices caused by fossil energy prices or policy regulation, and the revenue is more stable. The platform deploys renewable energy mines around the world, directly using solar and wind power to generate electricity, and the electricity cost is only 60% of that of traditional mines. In response to global regulatory trends, new regulations such as the EU’s “Markets in Crypto-Assets Act” (MiCA) set limits on high-carbon emission mining, green mining has become a compliance requirement, and platform qualifications are protected from policy shocks. Mining Guide: Three steps from registration to revenue; Register and start: If you register, you will receive a computing power bonus of $15. Choose to purchase contracts to obtain revenue: RichMine’s contracts focus on efficiency-short term, fast return, and full return. The following chart shows the potential revenue; The platform has launched a series of stable and high-yield contracts, which you can view on the RichMiner official website). Withdrawal and reinvestment: Daily income can be withdrawn to the wallet or invested in higher-level contracts to obtain more mining income. Conclusion: With the deep integration of green energy and blockchain technology, “low-carbon cloud mining” is moving from concept to practice. RichMiner has opened up a sustainable passive income path for investors through three core strategies: clean power deployment, zero hardware operation and maintenance, and intelligent income reinvestment. Under the wave of the crypto industry embracing ESG, choosing a win-win model with the ecosystem may be the key footnote to future wealth growth-start cloud mining now and take control of your financial future!

Despite all the talk about crypto changing payments, most businesses still won’t take digital money. SpacePay , a London startup, wants to change that by working with the card machines shops already have. The platform supports hundreds of crypto wallets and gives merchants their money in regular currency right away. What really catches attention is their 0.5% transaction fee. Compare that to the 2.5% to 3.5% that credit card companies usually charge, and you start to see why merchants might be interested. They’ve raised over $1.1 million so far in their presale, with $SPY tokens going for $0.003181 each. Why Shop Owners Hate Credit Card Fees Anyone who’s run a small business knows the pain of payment processing fees. Every time someone swipes a card, the payment companies take their cut. It adds up fast. Think about your local pizza place. If they’re doing $25,000 in sales each month and paying the typical 3% in processing fees, that’s $750 disappearing every month. Over a year, they’re handing over $9,000 to payment processors. Now imagine if they could cut that down to just $125 per month with SpacePay’s 0.5% fee. That extra $625 monthly could pay for better ingredients, cover utilities, or help during slow months. For small businesses running tight budgets, savings like this actually matter. The reason SpacePay can offer such low fees comes down to cutting out the middlemen. When you pay with a regular credit card, your money bounces between several different companies before reaching the store owner. Each one takes a piece. SpacePay uses blockchain tech to create a shorter path from customer to merchant. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1928029812762841119 The Crypto Presale Numbers Tell a Story SpacePay’s presale has pulled in over $1.1 million, which suggests people see potential in what they’re building. Unlike a lot of crypto projects that exist mainly on paper, SpacePay tackles problems that actually exist in the real world. Their token setup looks pretty reasonable too. Out of 34 billion total $SPY tokens, they’re only keeping 5% for the founding team. That’s way less than the 20% or 30% that many crypto founders grab for themselves. The biggest chunk – 20% – goes to regular people in the public presale. The rest gets spread around for partnerships, marketing, user rewards, and keeping the lights on. It’s the kind of distribution you’d expect from a team thinking long-term instead of looking for a quick cash grab. Token holders get some decent perks. Monthly rewards for active users, voting rights on platform decisions, early access to new features, and a cut of the revenue. As more businesses start using SpacePay, token holders could see benefits from that growth. Visit SpacePay Presale Fixing Crypto’s Biggest Problem for Merchants Here’s why most store owners won’t touch crypto: the prices jump around like crazy. Accept $100 worth of Bitcoin in the morning, and by afternoon it might only be worth $85. No business can operate that way. SpacePay solved this with a pretty clever system. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets regular money deposited instantly. The shop owner doesn’t have to worry about Bitcoin crashing or soaring – they just get their $100, period. The system locks in the exchange rate for those few seconds it takes to process the payment. If crypto prices go wild during that time, SpacePay absorbs the difference. The merchant sees a normal payment hitting their account, no drama. This takes away the biggest excuse merchants use to avoid crypto. They don’t need to become traders or watch price charts. They just run their business and get paid predictably. Working with What’s Already There Most crypto payment systems want merchants to buy expensive new equipment and train their staff on complicated new processes. That’s a hard sell for busy business owners. SpacePay went the other direction. Their system works with those Android card readers you see everywhere. Just install some software, and suddenly that same machine can take crypto payments from hundreds of different wallets. For customers, paying feels totally normal. Scan a QR code, tap confirm, done. No typing long wallet addresses where one wrong character loses your money forever. The whole thing takes seconds. Since it works with over 325 different crypto wallets, customers can use whatever app they already have. Whether they’re into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other coin, chances are SpacePay supports it. Getting In on the Action People interested in SpacePay can join their presale by heading to the official website and connecting a crypto wallet. The current price sits at $0.003181 per token, and they accept payments in ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, USDT, USDC, or even regular bank cards for people new to crypto.

The company said it immediately replenished the stolen funds and moved assets to new wallets to prevent further losses. The breach, which occurred on May 8 during a wallet system upgrade, was first flagged by blockchain sleuth ZachXBT . He revealed that the stolen funds were laundered through decentralized exchanges and privacy protocols before being deposited into Wasabi Wallet, a popular Bitcoin mixer. “BitoPro recently experienced a cyberattack on an old hot wallet during a wallet system upgrade,” the exchange shared with CoinDesk. “Upon detection, we quickly launched an emergency response, securing assets by moving them to new wallets and blocking the attacker.” The company emphasized that user assets were unaffected, with all deposits, withdrawals, and trading functions continuing as normal. “BitoPro's virtual asset reserves are ample, and user assets remain completely unaffected,” a spokesperson added. The exchange said it is working with a third-party cybersecurity firm to investigate the hack and will soon publish new hot wallet addresses to improve transparency. It added that the majority of its assets are held in offline cold wallets to protect against similar incidents in the future. BitoPro, which is operated by BitoGroup, has served Taiwan’s crypto market since 2018. It supports major cryptocurrencies paired with the Taiwanese dollar and processed over $20 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours, according to data.

It’s a dramatic shift in the organization’s attitude towards crypto. It also marks a growing need for a secure crypto wallet like Best Wallet to secure your digital assets. Largest US Bank Enters the Cryptoverse According to a Bloomberg report , the largest bank in the US will begin offering its trading and wealth-management clients loans backed by crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF). BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust will be the first crypto ETF to be accepted, with more to be added eventually. It may also start to consider the crypto holdings of its wealth-management clients when calculating their net worth and liquid assets. The announcement marks a significant change in the organization’s approach to crypto, particularly for CEO Jamie Dimon, who has said he ‘is not a fan’ of Bitcoin. In May, he expressed his unchanged opinion , but that he won’t stop his clients from buying Bitcoin. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” Best Wallet: The Keys to Your Digital Fortress As mainstream banks begin accepting cryptocurrencies on the same level as cash and other traditional assets, the need to secure these digital assets responsibly becomes paramount.

The bounce reflects an early effort by bulls to reclaim lost ground, but the overall structure remains fragile following the recent break below the short-term channel support. Market volatility persists, and traders are watching closely for whether the rebound has enough strength to invalidate the recent pullback. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) After falling sharply from its June high above $107,000, Bitcoin price found support near the 0.382 Fibonacci level of $97,663 before reversing higher. On the 4-hour chart, BTC staged a quick recovery after tagging the lower Bollinger Band at $102,007. The price is now hovering just above $102,800, attempting to reclaim the 20-EMA cluster around $104,180. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) A breakdown below that cluster earlier had triggered cascading stops, pulling Bitcoin price action into a high-volume demand zone near $101,500–$102,000.

Price depreciation and active sell-offs both played a role. Interestingly, financial advisers slightly increased their holdings, but overall sentiment shifted toward corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin. Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT saw record outflows in late May, while treasury-focused firms like Strategy ramped up accumulation. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group filed for a new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with Crypto.com as custodian, but raised concerns over a clause allowing affiliated parties to front-run trades. In Romania, the postal service installed its first Bitcoin ATM. Despite positive momentum, only 4% of the global population owns Bitcoin, which means that there is still a lot of room for the crypto king to grow. Bitcoin ETF Activity Dips Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by institutional investors experienced the first quarterly decline since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. A recent report from CoinShares revealed that institutional exposure to Bitcoin fell to $21.2 billion in Q1 of 2025, down from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024. This is a 23% drop. Institutions decreased their Bitcoin exposure (Source: CoinShares ) While the majority of this decrease was attributed to an 11% decline in Bitcoin's price over the period, the report also revealed that many investors actively reduced their holdings. This indicates a combination of valuation loss and deliberate selling. Interestingly, financial advisers emerged as an exception by modestly increasing their Bitcoin ETF holdings during the quarter. The broader trend, however, pointed to a shift away from ETF-driven strategies toward corporate-level adoption of Bitcoin for treasury reserves. This transition means that there is a growing preference for long-term savings and value preservation over short-term trading opportunities. Financial advisers increased their Bitcoin holdings in Q1 2025 (Source: CoinShares ) This changing investment behavior was noticed with major developments in Q2 as well. On May 30, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its largest single-day outflow to date, with over $430 million withdrawn after a streak of 31 consecutive days of inflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin treasury companies increased their holdings considerably. CoinShares data indicates that these companies held over 1.98 million BTC by the end of Q1, an 18.6% increase year-to-date. Strategy, the leading corporate holder, acquired 15,355 BTC on April 28 alone and has been consistently buying in 17 of the past 20 weeks through June 2025, according to SaylorTracker . ETF flows remained volatile during the first half of the year, and were heavily influenced by shifting macroeconomic narratives. While many institutional players looked for safety in US government bonds due to uncertain market conditions, rising bond yields suggest that confidence in these traditional havens may be diminishing. Analysts now speculate that Bitcoin's long-term growth may be fueled more by declining demand for US bonds than by continued inflows into ETFs. Trump’s Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF Despite these findings from CoinShares, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company majority-owned by US President Donald Trump and parent firm of the Truth Social platform, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF. The proposed product is called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, and was formally introduced through an initial registration statement on Form S-1 filed on June 5. According to the company’s filing, the ETF will primarily hold Bitcoin through a custodian and is designed to reflect the performance of the cryptocurrency’s market price. Announcement from TMTG This move follows a separate submission by NYSE Arca, which proposed listing the ETF on its exchange on behalf of Yorkville America Digital, a crypto asset manager and partner of TMTG. The product, if approved, will enter the very competitive landscape of US-based Bitcoin ETFs seeking to capture institutional and retail investor interest in digital assets. One key structural feature of the proposed ETF is its partnership with Crypto.com , which is set to serve as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider for the trust. The filing shared that Crypto.com agreed to offer certain services exclusively to the ETF’s trust, although specific management and transaction fees for the fund have not been revealed yet. The filing also contains a clause that raises eyebrows: it permits the ETF sponsor and related parties to potentially front-run the fund’s Bitcoin transactions. While such language is typically softened or accompanied by conflict-of-interest mitigation in other filings, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF explicitly warns prospective shareholders that affiliated entities may take positions in Bitcoin that are ahead of or opposite to those of the fund, which could negatively impact the ETF’s performance. Additionally, the filing confirms that shareholders will not receive the benefits of any new assets resulting from blockchain forks. In the event of such an event, the trust will forfeit the Incidental Rights and any corresponding forked assets, essentially removing any future claim for holders. Romanian Post Installs First Bitcoin ATM Meanwhile, Poșta Română, Romania’s national postal service, recently took a big step toward digital innovation by installing its first Bitcoin ATM in a branch located in the city of Tulcea. This initiative was launched in partnership with the local crypto exchange Bitcoin Romania (BTR), and it is the beginning of a broader plan to integrate cryptocurrency services across the country. According to the official announcement , more Bitcoin ATMs are set to be deployed in other cities, including Alexandria, Piatra Neamț, Botoșani, and Nădlac. The move is part of a plan by the postal service to modernize its infrastructure and extend digital financial services to underserved and remote communities. Despite the positive momentum, Bitcoin adoption worldwide is still relatively limited. While enthusiasm continues to grow, especially among retail users and businesses adopting BTC as a payment method or a treasury reserve asset, the total number of global Bitcoin holders is still a very small fraction of the population. According to a Q1 2025 report from Bitcoin financial services firm River, only about 4% of the world’s population currently owns Bitcoin. In the United States, the figure is a bit higher at an estimated 14%. Overall, these results show that adoption is progressing unevenly across regions. River’s report also pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than $100 increased to almost 30 million in January, which was a 25% year-over-year rise. However, analysts warn that Bitcoin’s total addressable market remains under 1%, with limited retail penetration and institutional allocation. BTC’s market cap compared to the global market (Source: River ) Assuming Bitcoin could eventually secure a 50% share of the global store-of-value market—an estimated $225 trillion in assets such as cash, real estate, equities, precious metals, and art—its current $2 trillion market cap suggests that there is still a lot of room for long-term growth.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9462/institutional-demand-for-bitcoin-et-fs-cools-for-first-time,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T06:04:48,"Crypto Markets See Red as Trump-Musk Bromance Ends in Flames","Total crypto market capitalization declined by around $170 billion in a fall to $3.26 trillion on June 5, its lowest level since May 8, almost a month ago. Markets are now poised for a further fall below longer-term levels if current support levels break down. However, the decline slowed during early trading in Asia on Friday morning, with a minor recovery to $3.3 trillion. Donald vs Elon The sharp decline appears to have been driven by a spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who said the former’s tariffs “will cause a recession in the second half of this year,” and “Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!” on June 5. As the war of words on each of their respective social media networks escalated, and the bromance collapsed, Musk also said : “In light of the President’s statement about the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.” In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately pic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 For more than a week, Elon Musk has been trashing Trump’s signature piece of legislation, a spending bill called One Big Beautiful Bill. “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,” said Trump on Truth Social. However, the clearly riled billionaire Tesla CEO didn’t stop there, stating on X that it was “time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files.” “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” BREAKING: President Trump’s former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon calls for Elon Musk to be deported, per NY Times. https://t.co/Q82Pbhzppt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 5, 2025 The pair started to cool off late on Thursday with Musk’s admissions that it may be time to reconcile. $1B in Liquidations There has been almost $1 billion in crypto liquidations over the last 24 hours, according to Coinglass. Around 228,000 traders were wrecked, almost 90% of them in BTC long positions, and the total liquidations were around $988 million, it noted. However, analysts had predicted that a leverage flushout was overdue, with open interest on Bitcoin futures markets hitting all-time highs recently. Bitcoin lost almost $5,000 in a matter of hours, falling to a 4-week low just below $101,000 in late trading on Thursday. However, it found support there and recovered marginally to reach $102,800 during Asian trading on Friday. Analyst “CrypNuevo” said that a quick bounce from this level was unlikely and more consolidation could occur, unless the sell-off accelerates. $BTC update: Plan is playing out so far! Let’s see if this psychological support ($100k) can hold. A quick bounce is unlikely imo. I’d expect that, at best, a small consolidation in this area before any interesting move could be the case – unless if we break below it fast. https://t.co/iWql8N6SW7 pic.twitter.com/CIb1KpJt8i — CrypNuevo (@CrypNuevo) June 5, 2025 The post Crypto Markets See Red as Trump-Musk Bromance Ends in Flames appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-markets-see-red-as-trump-musk-bromance-ends-in-flames/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Crypto News|featured1|Donald Trump|Elon Musk",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T06:04:41,"Uber signals interest in stablecoins to streamline global payments","Ride-hailing company Uber is exploring the use of stablecoins to streamline global payments and reduce transaction costs associated with cross-border transactions. During his appearance at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on 5 June, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed the company is in the “study phase” of evaluating stablecoins as a potential tool for international money movement. Stablecoins offer “a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” describing the technology as “super interesting” for global businesses. According to Khosrowshahi, while opinions on Bitcoin vary, stablecoins stand out for their utility in payments. “Especially for global companies that are moving money around globally, stablecoin is quite promising,” he added. Stablecoins are digital tokens engineered to mirror the value of traditional currencies, most often the US dollar. Anchored by reserves such as cash or short-term government bonds, they blend the rapid settlement and borderless nature of crypto with the trust and stability of fiat. You might also like: Circle IPO debuts strong as CRCL gains over 120% on day 1 As digital commerce scales globally, stablecoins are becoming essential infrastructure , with an increasing number of enterprises treating them as tools for financial operations . As previously reported by crypto.news, Fireblocks’ 2025 “State of Stablecoins” survey found that 90% of the surveyed financial institutions were actively integrating stablecoins into their systems. These include major banks, payment processors, and fintech platforms, many of which now process millions of stablecoin transactions each month. Speed was cited as the top advantage by nearly half the respondents, with cost savings and liquidity also ranking high on the list of strategic benefits driving adoption. Besides Uber, other major companies have also shown interest recently. Stripe’s co-founder John Collison revealed in May that the company has been in early discussions with banks on stablecoin integration. Much of the momentum behind stablecoins can be traced to a global shift toward clearer, more supportive policy frameworks. For instance, in the U.S., lawmakers introduced the bipartisan GENIUS Act , establishing a comprehensive framework for payment stablecoins by outlining various requirements for stablecoin issuers. Elsewhere, in Europe, the rollout of MiCA has set a new standard for how digital assets are treated, giving companies firmer ground to build on. At the same time, regulatory developments have also been observed across Asia, in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong , Singapore , and Pakistan , among others. Read more: Why is crypto down today?

2025-06-06T05:45:00,"Is It Ethereum's Time Again? ETH And ETH/BTC Technical Outlook","Summary Ethereum had a rough beginning of 2025 - failing to reach new all-time highs, while Bitcoin smashed through its own ATH multiple times. ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle - something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. By Elior Manier Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) had a rough beginning of 2025 - failing to reach new all-time highs, while Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) smashed through its own ATH multiple times. Solana ( SOL-USD ), providing a cheaper alternative to ETH services, also held stronger than the Ether throughout the latter part of 2024 and beginning 2025. ETH performance is key to the overall crypto market performance; the past Altcoin cycles have always been led by ETH performance over BTC. ETH/BTC is a great cryptocurrency spread for a crypto trader to spot relative performance, provide a direction for which crypto to choose, and track the appetite for altcoins. Through this crypto market update, you will see how ETH/BTC rising helped altcoin bull runs in the past cycle, something that many crypto traders have been awaiting and is yet to materialize again. ETH/BTC and its Correlation to total Market Performance ETH/BTC and Total Crypto Market Cap, 2017 to End 2021 (Source: TradingView) This 2017-2021 chart of ETH/BTC contains essential information about understanding the crypto market. Through 1 and 2, we observe how the first bull run in ETH and ETH/BTC led to the 2017 total crypto market bull run - taking the market cap from $20-30B average to highs of $620B in November 2017. Number 3 on the chart shows how a drop in ETH/BTC leads to a significant cooldown of the crypto market, going back towards a total market cap between $100 and $250B from 2018 to the end of 2020. From end-2020 to the end of 2021, number 4 shows the same correlation of ETH/BTC and crypto markets rallying. This Covid-era bull run introduced crypto for an ever-bigger number of investors, and led to the flurry of altcoins and cryptocurrency projects such as Doge, Avax, Solana. The crypto market cap went from $300B to $2.86T, and this level only got reached again in November 2024. Finally, number 5 shows similarly to number 3 how the drop in market cap correlates with a drop in the ETH/BTC spread. ETH/BTC from 2020 to Today ETH/BTC and Bitcoin, 2020 to June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) We take a closer look at the 2021 Bull Run and how the December 2021 top in ETH/BTC led again a significant correction in the crypto market. 2023 was all about Bitcoin Dominance as its rally from $14,475 to its record highs of $112,030 left Ethereum and all other altcoins lagging. We are seeing a breakout from the descent that started at the same level as the 2020 ETH/BTC bullish breakout - we will see if the spread continues upward and if it generates another bull run for altcoins. ETH Daily Chart ETH Daily Chart, June 5, 2025 (Source: TradingView) ETH had a consequent rally after a significant drop between $4,000 highs in December 2024 to $1,363 lows in April 2025. Prices are consolidating between $2,300 and $2,600. The key is to see if Bitcoin prices that are also stagnating above the $100,000 Mark leads to rallies in other cryptos as the same phenomenon happened in past bull cycles.

2025-06-06T05:42:56,"Lone Bitcoin Miner Strikes Gold: Earns $330,000 by Mining a Full Block Solo","In an incredible event of fortune and timing, a lone Bitcoin miner has successfully mined a whole block all by themselves, with no help from a mining pool or a sponsor like a bank or corporation. They earned a reward of 3.151 BTC, a windfall presently worth over $330,000. These underdog events shine a light on the resilient decentralization of the Bitcoin network, even if some may now use that phrase as a euphemism for its security flaws. In the early morning hours, a rare event took place that caught the crypto community’s eye and kicked off discussions about whether solo mining is a feasible option these days, given that the mining landscape seems dominated by industrial-scale mining operations. A One-in-a-Million Moment The block, officially mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC, was verified as valid and included in the Bitcoin blockchain. The total reward of 3.151 BTC consisted of the standard extbf{3.125 BTC block subsidy}, plus an additional extbf{0.026 BTC in transaction fees} amounting to roughly $2,761. The block itself measured 1.66 megabytes in size and included a standard assortment of transactions. This achievement was accomplished by a solo miner even while the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate was over 600 exahashes per second. Most of the computational work that was assembled from the many mining operations that were running at that time was directed towards solving the puzzles that, when solved, would produce valid Bitcoin blocks. The odds of a single miner successfully completing one of those puzzles and finding a valid block were, of course, exceedingly low. **Bitcoin Miner Hits the Jackpot!** Solo CK mined block 899,826 on June 5, 2025, scoring 3.151 BTC (~$330,386)! Here's the breakdown: • Mined at 4:48:18 a.m. UTC • Reward: 3.125 BTC subsidy + 0.026 BTC fees ($2,761) • Block size: 1.66 MB pic.twitter.com/vJuQoh4YAW — Ahmed Osman (@Ahmedot2Osman) June 5, 2025 Though the exact hardware used by the miner remains unspecified, the consensus among experts is that the conditions—successful mining, that is—would necessitate powerful rigs like the Antminer S21 or WhatsMiner M60, both well-regarded for not just their efficiency, but their sheer output of hash power. Even so, elite equipment alone doesn’t tip the scales toward success; the miner has to have a significant chunk of the global hasrate under his influence. Why Solo Mining Is Rare — and Risky In the domain of Bitcoin mining, the majority of players opt to associate themselves with mining pools, for instance, F2Pool, AntPool, or ViaBTC. These mining assemble the computational might of thousands of miners, dishing out smaller, consistent rewards instead of the solitary, do-or-die nature of mining all by oneself. Mining alone means doing everything a miner must do to find a block and then submitting that block to the network. If a solo miner finds a block, the reward is theirs and theirs alone. Obviously, this is a tremendous payday. And for us to even talk about it here, it must happen in the real world. So, let’s look at what it takes to mine alone, and after that, we’ll consider what it means to have a real-life payday scenario. These infrequent solo victories do happen, though, as demonstrated by the most recent case of a miner using Solo CK, a known solo mining pool that still preserves the spirit of decentralized mining by enabling individuals to point their hardware toward block discovery without profit sharing. A Testament to Bitcoin’s Decentralization Even though industrial mining farms and large, centralized pools of hashing power are on the rise, the occasional story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner is a powerful reminder that the Bitcoin network’s decentralized architecture is alive and well. This is a story of a successful solo Bitcoin miner. By “successful,” I mean this individual consistently brings in Bitcoin rewards (“mined” a few himself, but has “earned” quite a few more through participating in the Bitcoin network). By “network,” I mean the assemblage of many computers all over the planet, doing many computations. By “decentralized architecture,” I mean a system of many nodes by which no one node, or set of nodes, can control the whole system. The miner’s triumph has unleashed torrents of excitement and admiration throughout online spaces. It also resurrects a vital discussion: even in a massively parallel, technologically state-of-the-art mining world, Bitcoin remains a theoretically level playing field. It is yet to be seen whether more people will be encouraged to take a stab at solo mining. But this moment serves as evidence that the solo mining dream is not dead. It’s just incredibly hard. The global mining landscape is evolving rapidly. This makes it all the more crucial to illuminate why Bitcoin inspires and captivates people all around the world. It’s not simply about the cash that’s involved. It’s about the very ethos of this network: permissionless participation and decentralized opportunity.

2025-06-06T05:41:27,"Ether Trader Bets Millions on ETH Blasting Above $3.4K by June-End","Last month, CoinDesk reported that big money is becoming increasingly bullish on ether ETH, with price charts indicating a potential rally above $3,000. New evidence has now emerged, supporting those claims. On Thursday, a trader paid a premium of over $2 million to purchase a total of 61,000 contracts of June-end expiry ether call options at strikes $3,200 and $3,400, according to data source crypto options exchange Deribit. Theoretically, the $3,200 call is a bet that ether's price will rise from the current $2,460 to over $3,200 by the end of the month. The purchase of the $3,400 call indicates expectations for a move above that level. In other words, the trader anticipates a price surge of over 30% in three weeks. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium for the asymmetric upside exposure. The premium paid, in this case, $2 million, is the maximum amount the buyer stands to lose in case the market doesn't rise as expected. Stars align for bulls The bullish flow is consistent with the renewed optimism among some analysts about ether's price prospects. According to Youwei Yang, Ph.D., chief economist at BIT Mining, protocol upgrades, institutional moves, and anticipation around new financial products have all come together to restore investor confidence in ether. Ether's parent blockchain, Ethereum, recently implemented the Pectra upgrade to enhance scalability, validator flexibility, and user experience, introducing key features like EIP-7702 to enable regular wallets to leverage smart contract capabilities. ""The Pectra upgrade , which went live on May 7, has been a key turning point. By raising the validator cap from 32 to 2,048 ETH and doubling blob throughput, Ethereum took a major step forward in both staking efficiency and Layer-2 scalability,"" Yang said in an email to CoinDesk. ""It’s a clear signal that the network is serious about scaling and improving its core infrastructure. That’s the kind of technical progress that brings not just developers, but also users and capital, back into the ecosystem,"" Yang added. Yang cited SharpLink Gaming’s announcement that it would move $425 million into Ethereum as a treasury reserve asbold endorsement of ether as the corporate Treasury asset. ""It reminds us of the early wave of Bitcoin treasury adoption by corporates, and it could be just the beginning of something similar for ETH,"" Yang noted. Lastly, speaking of institutional adoption, speculation has been circulating that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot ether ETF with a staking mechanism, opening doors for institutions to take exposure to both the price and the staking yield, a feature missing in BTC ETFs.

2025-06-06T05:34:50,"Bitcoin Whales Return to Accumulation as On-Chain Activity Surges","The on-chain Bitcoin metrics are showing once more that they are pleased with what they see—that hefty investors and little ones are both accumulating again in the face of a network that is waking up from its slumber and starting to do all sorts of things halt and signal traffic on the blockchain. After a slight divergence in the direction of the wallets, the balance making up the distribution cohort has fallen off, and it seems like the path of least resistance with Bitcoin is up, back over the $100,000 mark. The renewed on-chain interaction is feeding the engine of market optimism. Meanwhile, the institutional flows into spot bitcoin ETFs seem to have stabilized. BlackRock’s fund in particular has captured the attention of investors. Wallet Activity Signals Growing Market Confidence On-chain analytics data show us that all main wallet groups are in accumulation mode right now. The main event, though, is taking place at two very different ends of the spectrum: We have wallets that hold less than 1 BTC, and we have wallets that hold between 10 and 100 BTC. Both of these groups have hit an accumulation score of 1.0—basically the highest score you can get—and it indicates that they are both very widespread and also doing some pretty well-synchronized buying. This development shows a strong contrast with prior weeks, in which it seemed that bigger investors were cutting back on their exposure or remaining on the sidelines in response to the presence of market uncertainty. This renewed activity now seems to imply that these larger holders are either positioning for a potential breakout or, more probably, expressing confidence that Bitcoin’s current levels are a buying opportunity. What is especially remarkable is that accumulation is not confined to whales. Lesser retail holders are also amassing a considerable amount and showing very strong buying behavior. This, most often, is a signal that these small retail holders are long-term holders and is also a signal that grassroots adoption is taking place. On-Chain Activity Hits Multi-Month Highs Momentum is building in the network activity of Bitcoin, with multiple metrics registering their most robust performances in months. The most recent day for which we have data, May 29, saw over 556,830 new Bitcoin wallets created—no day since December 2, 2023, has been even close to that in terms of sheer amount. And the reason I find this most interesting is because (now, I’m going to speak more generally about all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin) a growing number of wallet-holders is a very good sign for the overall health of a cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 Adding to the feel-good factor, June 2 saw 241,360 BTC move across the blockchain—the most coins sent since December 8, 2024. We typically don’t like to draw too many conclusions from single days, but this is a sizeable figure and could indicate that the Bitcoin network is seeing an uptick in user activity—whether trading, transferring, or otherwise moving assets around. Although price often rules market sentiment, these developments really show what direction the network is headed in. If they’re building a price bottom, then user and developer activity is much more desirable than just the network being used temporarily for price speculation. A close watch is being kept by investors because rising on-chain engagement, with prices being relatively stable, can often be a hint of an underlying build-up of momentum that precedes breakout movements—upward or downward. Institutional Flows Remain Focused on BlackRock’s ETF Even with the overall uncertainty of the traditional markets, the sector of Bitcoin ETFs available for direct investment is attracting a not-too-shabby amount of institutional inflows. As of June 4, the combined net inflow across all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs was $86.92 million. Even ETF skeptics like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart have been warming up to the idea that, in 2023, the Bitcoin ETF sector has the look of a legitimate business. Interestingly, on the day, the only fund to see a net inflow was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Others either stayed even or experienced slight outflows. Continued preference for IBIT further consolidates BlackRock’s presence in the Bitcoin ETF space and also is a nice little shot of credibility for the digital asset sector. The net positive flows coming back—concentrated in just one issuer, it must be noted—signal that institutional investors aren’t pulling back entirely. They’re still in the market but seem to be doing a more refined, selective kind of allocation. And when you see selective allocation by big, smart money, it’s usually to what’s perceived as the safest and most credible holdings. With Bitcoin holding steady at just below $105,000, renewed wallet accumulation, record highs in on-chain activity, and an ETF flow that can only be described as resilient combine to present an intricate but optimistic look for the market. We are in a period right now, however, where the market has not yet broken out and up decisively. Consequently, it seems wise to stay vigilant, perhaps even bearish for now, until we do see that break. But from where we sit, the combination of these various factors likely means the market has a good shot at getting up and over, rather than back down under, the $100,000 line with Bitcoin. How long it takes and how close we edge up to the actual line figure before the breakout occurs is the present mystery. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.
