2025-06-06T19:55:56,"‘Crunch Time’: Crypto Trader Justin Bennett Outlines Two Possible Scenarios for Bitcoin After BTC Bounces From Major Support Level","A widely followed crypto analyst is outlining two possible routes Bitcoin ( BTC ) could take after bouncing off a major support level. In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers on the social media platform X that it’s “crunch time” for the top crypto asset by market cap after recovering from a dip, noting that it could plunge below $100,000 if BTC bulls don’t step up. “Recap: BTC failed at $110,000 and $106,600 in May [and hit] $100,000 on Thursday. We had the Asia session bounce back to $104,000 as anticipated. Now, does Bitcoin fill the $97,000/$98,000 imbalance? Or can bulls reclaim this $104,000-$105,000 area? Crunch time.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett also said that the flagship digital asset bouncing off $100,000 to hit $104,000 was a bullish scenario that would likely send BTC above $106,000. “There you go. Nice bounce from $100,000 support. Looking pretty bullish so far. $104,000-$105,000 is resistance today. A reclaim would be bullish back to $106,600, but it’s resistance until proven otherwise.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett goes on to note that other factors could influence the price of BTC, such as how the US stock market is doing and the dominance levels of Tether ( USDT ), the largest stablecoin in the world by volume. “Almost there, fam. Same target and path I shared for crypto on May 21st. I’m not saying Tether dominance at 5% will be the bottom for BTC, but there should be a strong reaction in that area if tested. Remember that USDT [dominance] moves inversely to Bitcoin.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,202 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

2025-06-06T19:54:07,"Switzerland to Swap Crypto Holder Data with 74 Countries Under the OECD’s CARF","Key Takeaways: The Federal Council approved automatic crypto-asset data exchange with 74 jurisdictions under OECD’s CARF, starting in 2027. The list includes EU states, the UK, and most G20 countries but excludes the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Exchanges will only occur if partner countries meet reciprocity and compliance benchmarks. Switzerland’s Federal Council has approved a proposal to begin automatically exchanging data on crypto-asset holdings with 74 partner states starting in 2027, according to a statement issued on June 6. The exchange will be based on the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The framework mandates information sharing between jurisdictions to detect offshore digital asset holdings and ensure tax compliance. Reciprocity and Compliance Conditions For Data Exchange The approved list includes all EU countries, the United Kingdom , and most G20 members, but excludes the United States and Saudi Arabia. Exchange of data will only proceed if partner jurisdictions agree to reciprocity and meet technical and legal standards set out under CARF. The Swiss parliament is currently reviewing the legal foundation for this data-sharing regime, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. The first data transmission will take place in 2027. The Federal Council stated that the same review mechanisms used for financial account data exchanges will be applied to crypto-asset reporting. Partner states must undergo periodic assessments to verify continued compliance. The update positions Switzerland among the first countries preparing to implement the OECD’s global reporting framework. Authorities said the scope of the exchange may expand, depending on the evolving interest of other countries and future updates to international standards. Drawing on lessons from the Credit Suisse crisis, the Swiss government is calling for measures like stricter capital requirements for big banks with branches abroad + additional powers for financial market supervisor @FINMA_media . https://t.co/zuWKbuyY5t @efd_dff @sif_sfi pic.twitter.com/n0z3Hvk5hE — Swiss Federal Government (@SwissGov) June 6, 2025 Global Compliance and Local Crypto Use in Switzerland Spar Switzerland recently announced plans to accept Bitcoin payments at all store locations following pilot programs in Zug and Kreuzlingen. The system uses QR codes from DFX Swiss’s OpenCryptoPay platform, allowing Lightning Network payments to settle instantly at checkout. Spar is the first major grocer in the country to adopt Bitcoin at full scale. While regulators are aligning with international reporting standards, merchants and consumers are advancing on separate terms, using Bitcoin for everyday payments without waiting for central bank endorsement. Switzerland now faces a dual trajectory: international compliance through frameworks like the OECD’s CARF, and internal normalization of crypto through market use. This parallel movement could test how governments balance transparency obligations abroad with decentralized payment activity at home. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is CARF, and how does it differ from previous financial reporting standards? Unlike traditional financial account standards, it includes digital tokens and requires identifying wallet holders and transaction data, even when no intermediaries are involved. Why are the U.S. and Saudi Arabia not included in the approved list? The statement does not detail specific exclusions. However, both countries have taken distinct positions on global tax data-sharing and may not currently meet CARF participation or reciprocity requirements. Are more countries expected to join Switzerland’s data-sharing agreements? Authorities indicated that the scope of exchange could expand based on evolving interest and future changes to OECD standards. Regular assessments will determine which partner states remain eligible.

2025-06-06T19:40:45,"Czech Minister of Finance will not resign over the recent Bitcoin scandal","Czech Republic’s Minister of Finance, Zbyněk Stanjura, has refused to resign in response to calls from the opposition to share responsibility over a controversial Bitcoin donation that already cost his colleague Pavel Blažek the post of Minister of Justice. A parliamentary session devoted to the politically damaging incident was adjourned without completing the debate. Opponents of the government have threatened a no-confidence vote and urged for Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s resignation, too. Finance Ministry has nothing to do with Blažek’s Bitcoin, says Stanjura The Czech Republic was rattled by an unprecedented scandal, charged enough to bring down the cabinet of the center-right SPOLU (“Together”) coalition, or at the very least negatively affect its chances in the upcoming elections in October. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek was forced to quit his seat over his key role in the case. It was revealed that his department had accepted 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in cryptocurrency as a donation from a former darknet market operator and convicted drug dealer, Tomáš Jiřikovský. Another member of the government in Prague, Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura, has now rejected calls for his resignation. Quoted by the Czech news agency CTK, he emphasized he had not violated the law and insisted that the Ministry of Justice was responsible for handling the gifted Bitcoin. On Thursday, Stanjura took to X to explain his take on Blažek’s embarrassing move, stressing that his own department was not involved in the decision to accept the crypto. Kauzu bitcoin vnímám jako selhání ministra Blažka a jeho úřadu. A znovu opakuji, že @MinFinCZ s celým procesem ani rozhodnutím @SpravedlnostCZ přijmout miliardu od drogového dealera nemělo nic společného – a ani nemá žádnou pravomoc takové kroky jiného resortu schvalovat nebo… — Zbyněk Stanjura (@Zbynek_Stanjura) June 5, 2025 However, commenting for Czech media, the finance minister admitted he knew about Blažek’s intentions to take the coins, claiming he tried to convince him not to do it. Speaking to the Seznam Zprávy news website, Stanjura stated he “saw the potential political problem” but could not prevent it. In an address to lawmakers earlier this week, Czech President Petr Pavel also described the scandal as a “major problem” which tarnishes the country’s reputation abroad. According to a report by the public radio broadcaster Český Rozhlas ( ČRo ), the Ministry of Justice has already sold part of the donated crypto assets in auctions held between March and May this year, the first such sale conducted by a public body in the country. Czech parliament holds extraordinary session over controversial crypto donation On Thursday, the Bitcoin scandal hit the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Czechia’s parliament, but the prolonged debate, abundant with political statements and clashes, produced little results. Attempts to continue the extraordinary session on Friday failed and it’s unclear when it will resume. Political forces challenging the government, including the largest opposition party, the right-wing populist ANO (“Yes”), called for the resignation of the whole Fiala cabinet. Led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, ANO has already gathered enough signatures to initiate a vote of no confidence . Both the current head of government and his outgoing justice minister acknowledged that taking the Bitcoin was a “mistake.” Petr Fiala said accepting the donation without verification was “at least ethically problematic,” while Pavel Blazek apologized but rejected accusations of corruption. This wasn’t enough for the opposition and the Mayors and Independents (STAN) faction demanded that the incoming Minister of Justice Eva Decroix, from Fiala’s Civic Democratic Party (ODS), describe in detail how the cryptocurrency was transferred to the state and identify all responsible persons. Meanwhile, the Czech Cryptocurrency Association took the opportunity to slam the government for the misstep. It said in a statement that by accepting the coins, “the state failed to comply with the basic requirements that any entity subject to the European MiCA regulation or the Anti-Money Laundering Act must follow.” Czech authorities neglected all precautionary measures that should apply to donations of any size, such as identifying the donor and their motives, establishing the origin of the funds as well as assessing the potential risk of links to crime, the industry organization stressed.

The analyst earlier alluded to the Fibonacci levels in previous cycles as the reason why the altcoin can record such a parabolic surge in this market cycle. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $27 In This Cycle In an X post , ChartNerd declared that an XRP price rally to between $8 and $27 is still loading. He made this statement while alluding to a previous analysis , in which he noted that the altcoin met both of its 1.272 and 1.1618 Fibonacci levels . The analyst then remarked that this cycle’s Fib 1.272 and 1.618 levels are $8.40 and $27. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has also predicted that the XRP price can rally to as high as $27 in this market cycle. The analyst had previously highlighted several reasons why the altcoin can reach this target, including alluding to the 2017 market cycle when XRP recorded a legendary gain of around 63,000%. The analyst is confident that the altcoin can replicate this run. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Accumulation Phase – Why $2.08 Must Hold Or Risk A Crash Meanwhile, in one of his most recent analyses, Egrag Crypto stated that the signal points to a target of $10, $18, and $27 for the XRP price. His accompanying chart showed that the altcoin can reach this target in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the analyst also recently highlighted a bullish candle formation, which showed that XRP can at least reach $22. Crypto analyst Dark Defender predicted that the XRP price is about to witness an upcoming surge to $23. He noted that the altcoin is forming another Wave Structure in the weekly timeframe, creating the potential rally to this target. The analyst added that this new wave structure aligns with the previous targets and historical pattern in November 2024. What To Expect In The Short Term In an X post , Dark Defender provided insights into what to expect from the XRP price action in the short term. The analyst stated that, on the weekly chart, XRP is moving towards the primary resistance level at around $2.40. The support level to watch on this move is $2.2222, while $5.85 is the target as the altcoin eyes a rally to the upside. Commenting on the short-term move for the XRP price, Egrag Crypto stated that XRP has to close above $2.30, $2.35, $2.36, $2.45, and $2.65 to have a bullish breakout. The analyst claimed that $2.65 is the ‘Go-Go’ signal as the altcoin eyes a rally to a new all-time high (ATH). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.12, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-could-reach-27/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Altcoin|ChartNerd|Coinmarketcap|Dark Defender|Egrag Crypto|Fibonacci Levels|Wave Structure|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

Strategy Upsizes Stock Offering To $1 Billion According to a June 6 press release , the Bitcoin treasury company will sell 11.76 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD), expecting to bring in an estimated $979.7 million after fees and expenses. STRD, which comes after Strategy’s other preferred offerings STRF and STRK, will be offered to the public at $85 per share, with the sale set to close on June 10. Strategy said the product will pay professional and institutional investors a 10% non-cumulative dividend. The company plans to use the almost $1 billion in net proceeds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” “It’s our high-yield credit instrument,” Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said in a video that he posted on X earlier this week while referencing STRD. “Compared to STRK or STRF, it should be a higher-yielding preferred instrument.” During a presentation, Saylor shared a graphic indicating that STRD, which is listed on the Nasdaq, has “limited” sensitivity to the price of Bitcoin. In terms of senior status, STRD investors rank behind STRF and STRK’s holders, but they come before common shareholders. “STRD represents the fourth gear in our Bitcoin engine,” he continued. “The point of our engine is to generate BTC torque via surgical management of our [at-the-money offering programs].” Strategy now holds an eye-popping 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, bought at an average price of $70,023 per coin. That’s the equivalent of almost 3% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. At the apex crypto’s current price of $105,063, the $1 billion would allow the Bitcoin development company to purchase an additional 9,518 BTC, considerably more than its latest purchase of 705 Bitcoin for $75.1 million announced on June 2.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-strategy-takes-a-shot-at-the-moon-with-latest-1-billion-bitcoin-buying-tactic/,"BTC|BUSINESS|SPONSORED|TRADING|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare
2025-06-06T19:30:00,"Peter Schiff’s Call for Traditional Economics Clashes with US Bitcoin Reserve Policy","Peter Schiff criticized the May jobs report, warning about poor quality job growth. He advocates for rate hikes and spending cuts to boost the manufacturing sector. His advice contrasts with a new US policy to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, a figure that beat market expectations but drew sharp criticism from economist Peter Schiff, who warned the growth is occurring in the wrong sectors. As Schiff advocates for a return to traditional economic principles, his views now stand in stark contrast to a new government strategy that embraces Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. Schiff pointed to Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing that job gains were concentrated in non-productive sectors, with healthcare adding 62,000 jobs and hospitality adding 48,000. Meanwhile, the domestic manufacturing sector shed 8,000 jobs, its largest decline this year.

A pennant formation on the daily chart may signal the next leg higher, if volume confirms the breakout. After a sustained uptrend marked by higher highs and higher lows, Hyperliquid ( Hype ) has entered a period of consolidation. This pause in momentum is forming a textbook bullish pennant, a pattern often associated with trend continuation. Technical confluence and reclaimed levels now position Hyperliquid for a potential breakout in the sessions ahead. Key technical points Pennant Formation on Daily Timeframe: Consolidation with converging trendlines suggests a coiling market preparing for a breakout. Reclaim of Volume Profile Levels: Price has reclaimed the value area low, point of control, and now trades above the value area high. Bullish Market Structure: A consistent sequence of higher highs and higher lows confirms the prevailing trend remains intact. HypeUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView As price consolidates within the pennant structure, Hyperliquid is trading tightly between dynamic support and resistance lines, forming an apex. This coiling action is a common sign of price compression and typically precedes a breakout. The context in which this pennant is forming, within a dominant bullish trend, adds strength to its breakout potential. The reclaim of major volume profile levels provides further insight into recent accumulation zones. Price moving above the point of control and reclaiming the value area high signals strong buyer interest and market acceptance at higher levels. You might also like: Cookie crypto price crumbling? Support holding firm at key level Importantly, Hyperliquid has maintained its bullish trend throughout the consolidation. Each pullback has been shallow, and no major support has been broken. This confirms the move is corrective in nature, rather than a reversal. However, one key factor is still missing: volume. For any breakout to be considered valid and sustainable, it must be accompanied by a surge in volume. Without this confirmation, price may continue to drift within the pennant or produce a false breakout. What to expect in the coming price action If Hyperliquid sees a strong breakout above the pennant resistance with a noticeable increase in volume, the bullish trend is likely to resume with momentum. Traders should monitor volume closely near the apex to confirm breakout strength and validate continuation toward new highs.

The Official Trump (TRUMP) token lost $233 million in market value. Dogecoin (DOGE) followed suit. Their feud, which began this week when Musk criticized Trump’s flagship tax and spending bill, has morphed into a wider story about how political dramas can sway digital assets. Political Rift Sparks Crypto Volatility On June 5, 2025, Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to lambast one of Trump’s spending proposals. Trump responded later the same day, calling Musk “disappointing” and suggesting their “great relationship” was over. Source: CoinMarketCap Musk fired back on May 23, accusing Trump of “ingratitude” and claiming that without him, Trump “would have lost the election.” Source: X Within hours, traders shifted positions. The Official Trump token’s market capitalization fell from $2.168 billion to $1.935 billion—an 11 percent swing that erased $233 million in value, according to CoinMarketCap data. TRUMP’s price slid from $10.83 to $9.66, a daily drop of 10.74 percent and a weekly decline of 15.58 percent. Trading volume surged to $876.85 million, up 211.87 percent in 24 hours. Meme Coins Under Pressure Musk’s beloved Dogecoin also felt the fallout. DOGE slipped 7.1 percent over the same 24-hour span. Volume on DOGE jumped to nearly $2 billion, a 149.75 percent increase, per CoinMarketCap data. The surge in trading activity suggests a knee-jerk reaction to Musk’s polemics. Both tokens illustrate how “narrative-driven” assets can be. TRUMP and DOGE, once buoyed by social media hype and celebrity endorsements, remain vulnerable to abrupt shifts in sentiment. These two tokens rank among the worst performers in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Mega Caps: More Than Just Meme Coins The Trump–Musk feud did not confine its effects to TRUMP and DOGE. Several large-cap tokens saw muted but noticeable moves on May 23. Cardano (ADA) dipped 2.3 percent. Solana (SOL) fell 1.8 percent. Ethereum (ETH) lost 1.2 percent. Trading volumes for these altcoins rose between 15 and 40 percent, signaling traders hedging or rebalancing against the sudden narrative shift. Meanwhile, megacap assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum—which together account for over 60 percent of total crypto market capitalization—saw slight volatility but maintained upward trajectories. For now, traders watch the headlines closely. Each tweet from Trump or Musk carries an immediate market impact. The Official Trump token traded at $9.66—down 10.74 percent for the day—while Dogecoin hovered at $0.317, off 7.1 percent.

According to the company, this marks the largest-ever issuance of stock warrants in Japan and the first time moving strike warrants have been sold at or above current share prices in the nation. “Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy bitcoin — again! This time: $5.4 billion to accelerate our bitcoin strategy,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in a Friday post on X. Thrilled to announce Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin — again!

Details here: https://t.co/ahL27o9QBg pic.twitter.com/njYybVq1uu — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 6, 2025 Metaplanet is allocating roughly 96% of the capital raised to buying bitcoin, with tiny amounts set for bond redemptions and income-generating strategies such as selling put options. The new shares will be sold to Cayman-based fund EVO FUND, which has backed Metaplanet’s previous financing deals. The 555 Million Plan is a follow-up to its earlier “ 21 Million Plan ” which raised $600 million earlier this year and helped the Japanese-based company to buy about 9,000 BTC. “Bitcoin is repricing the global cost of capital,” Metapanet postulated in a statement. “Through our 555 Million Plan, Metaplanet is doubling down on a high-conviction, equity-driven capital markets strategy to accelerate our bitcoin accumulation trajectory. As the most volatile listed equity in Japan, we are not scared of turbulence — we harness it.” Metaplanet’s Ambitious Goal To Amass 210,000 BTC By 2027 The new round aims to raise enough funds to bolster its holdings to over 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 from the previous 10,000 BTC goal and 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 from 21,000 BTC.

2025-06-06T19:10:10,"Why This Pundit Believes Elon Musk Might Be Two Weeks Away From Buying $100 Billion In Bitcoin","Elon Musk’s public clash with President Donald Trump over various economic and policy issues has drawn attention, sparking speculation over the role of crypto as a safe haven. Now, Compound founder Robert Leshner is suggesting that the richest man in the world is just two weeks away from acquiring a staggering $100 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and “tanking” the US dollar. This comes after the billionaire tech entrepreneur raised alarm against President Trump’s big, beautiful tax bill and its impact on national debt. Notably, the bill is projected to increase the fiscal deficit by 2.4 trillion over ten years. The feud escalated quickly, with Musk threatening to ground SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and Trump countering by claiming the government would move to cut off all federal support for Musk’s companies. Musk lashed back by linking Trump to the infamous Jeffrey Epstein’s files. The spectacular public blowup overshadowed what had been a mostly bullish trend for crypto markets in recent weeks, triggering a pullback in prices. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin reached $105,888 before slumping to $100,783 within a matter of hours, according to data from CoinGecko. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is holding at $103,956. Notably, Bitcoin OG Adam Back recently agreed with a post suggesting that Musk should buy 1 million in BTC to “front-run the US government and the Trump family”. Back is not hopeful that the Tesla/SpaceX boss will eventually go hard on Bitcoin, which would be “the obvious smart money move.” Though the eccentric billionaire does own Bitcoin, Back maintains that the current allocation is considerably low for his enormous net worth. That being said, someone as influential and famous as Musk taking fiscal concerns public could drive investors away from U.S. assets and into alternatives, such a Bitcoin. Moreover, it comes at a time when corporate treasury adoption of BTC and other crypto assets, including Solana and XRP , has picked up pace.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-this-pundit-believes-elon-musk-might-be-two-weeks-away-from-buying-100-billion-in-bitcoin/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare

2025-06-06T19:05:32,"How A Lone Bitcoin Miner Beat Overwhelming Odds And Banked $326,000","A solo miner just scooped up another huge Bitcoin reward by processing a block alone. According to data from Bitcoin explorer mempool, the miner bagged a big reward of 3.151 BTC after solving block 899,826 with a solo-mining setup from CKpool. At today’s Bitcoin price of $103,694 per coin, that’s a more than $326,739 payday. But just how realistic is such a feat? BTC Hash rate calculates the total computational power miners deploy on the Bitcoin network. The miner operated with a weekly hash rate of 6.11 PH/s, but boosted their compute power to as high as 261 PH/s to mine the BTC block. This, according to Con Kolivas, a software engineer and administrator of the Solo.ckpool, suggests that the solo miner likely rented additional hash rate — likely from a cloud or marketplace service — to better their odds of earning the block reward. “This hashrate was almost certainly a rental based on there being only one worker, though the account has been mining for a while with a much lower hashrate,” Kolivas posited . Bitcoin miners work to process blocks on the flagship crypto’s network. Blocks are full of transaction data and are part of the Bitcoin blockchain. Since last year’s halving event , miners now receive a 3.125 BTC fixed reward, along with the transaction fees paid by those using the payment system during that specific block window. As the network has evolved, mining operations have become harder and more energy-intensive, and therefore require more resources. Most blocks mined daily are done through massive industrial operations; warehouses full of machines operated by companies — the majority of which are publicly traded on U.S. stock exchanges. Individual Mining Wins On The Rise? Though this is the 300th block solved with CKpool and the standalone miner obviously rented extra hashpower, it’s no small accomplishment for a miner to solve a Bitcoin block alone. At Bitcoin’s total network hash rate of 796 EH/s as of June 5, the solo miner had a 0.03 % chance of success — or approximately 1 in 3,050. While rare, it’s also not the first time a similar case has occurred, although it’s rare. On March 22, a solo Bitcoin miner earned 3.157 BTC (worth $266,000 at the time) for solving block 888,737. Likewise, in February, a single miner successfully mined block 883,181 , earning a reward of 3.158 BTC (including fees), worth over $307,547 at the time. With Bitcoin mining difficulty recently hitting a new all-time high , such solo wins could become even rarer.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/how-a-lone-bitcoin-miner-beat-overwhelming-odds-and-banked-326000/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $19.63 Market cap $8.26B Trading volume $456.02M Circulating supply 421.74M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $19.93 24-hour low $18.49 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.08% 50-day SMA $22.24 200-day SMA $24.92 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX remains bearish As of June 6, AVAX’s price dropped by 1.48% in 24 hours and rose 2.64% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 29.53% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility is rising. The relative strength index is at 45.43 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing negative market momentum. It is considered oversold when the RSI value drops below 30. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is recovering from the month’s low which it recorded earlier today at $18.43. Last month, it had risen to $26.84 before correcting. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 36.38. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with rising volatility, particularly in the short term, as it attempts to correct from the month’s low. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency.

At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22.

Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023.

Known as a “Labubu,” the toy sold by Chinese company Pop Mart can be seen dangling from impossibly expensive Hermès and Miu Miu purses. Labubus are not just toys; they have come to represent socialites and fashionistas, and toy collectors alike are considered lucky to have their hands on a Labubu. Labubu lafufu štagod pic.twitter.com/u9hr1p6NQk — say my name (@femivv) June 2, 2025 What Is a Labubu? For context, Labubu is classified as a girl and is part of a larger group called “The Monsters,” created by Hong Kong artist and author Kasing Lung. The Monsters debuted in a Nordic mythology-inspired picture book trilogy in 2015. In 2019, Pop Mart turned these creatures into viral vinyl collectibles. While Labubus were not widely sought after at first, the characters gained popularity when Thai rapper Lisa from BLACKPINK professed her love for the creature in interviews and on her social media earlier this year. “When Blackpink #LISA posted this, the whole internet went crazy, Labubu is a @POPMARTGlobal ’s character and it’s always been popular but once #LISA posted it IT BECAME AN EXTRA MEGA SUPERSTAR… the latest collection that LISA posted is already SOLD OUT in KOREA…” pic.twitter.com/l8tCPw88JW — LALISA's Tiktok Updates (@Lalisa_Tiktok) May 23, 2024 Labubu Meme Coin Launch Given the success of Labubu, a Labubu meme coin ( $LABUBU ) was launched on Solana in October 2024, around the same time the viral toy started gaining traction. A Binance blog post notes that the value of $LABUBU has recently skyrocketed by 40 times in the past two weeks. The post also mentions that the Labubu project has raised over $42 million. A $ALCH whale just bought $9.84K of $LABUBU at $23.97M MC https://t.co/RxCPdGsPpM — Whale Watch by Moby (@whalewatchalert) June 6, 2025 Brands and Blockchain Merge Successfully The Binance blog post further states that $LABUBU “may not only be a meme coin but also a prime example of how brands and blockchain can merge successfully.” Indeed, it appears that $LABUBU may be following in the footsteps of Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ). Pudgy Penguins began as a blockchain-based collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Pudgy Penguin NFTs were so successful that Walmart launched a “Pudgy Toys” collection in 2,000 stores across the United States in 2023. Rena Shah, COO of Trust Machines—a community of dedicated Bitcoin builders—told Cryptonews that Labubus and Pudgy Penguins are not just accessories, but have come to represent “IP flexes.” “And nowhere is IP culture more dynamic right now than in Web3,” Shah said. Shah added that Pudgy Penguins successfully broke out of the JPEG silo with toys on Walmart shelves and a licensing model that finally made NFTs feel mainstream . “They made IP tangible—and in doing so, they proved the internet is ready to own characters, not just consume them,” she stated. Will $LABUBU Resonate With The Crypto Community? It remains questionable whether or not the Labubu meme coin will be as successful as Pudgy Penguin NFTs were. According to DEX Screener , the Labubu meme coin has shot from a market cap of $814,710 to $49.16 million over seven months after the token first launched. At the time of writing, the token has since retraced to $22.7 million. Taylan McRae-Yu, growth marketing manager at Web3 infrastructure provider Avail, told Cryptonews that he believes the phenomenon of Labubus is definitely a narrative that will resonate with the wider Web3 community. “It’s culturally relevant, taps into a growing fandom, and mirrors the kind of organic, collectible-driven hype we saw in the early days of NFTs,” McRae-Yu said. However, he stated that it’s unlikely that the Labubu meme coin will see anywhere near the success of the toy. “ ABC News recently reported that the estimated market cap of Labubu toys is $34 billion, while the token sits at just around a $23 million market cap, despite being launched over eight months ago.” Challenges With Meme Coins like $LABUBU McRae-Yu added that the majority of “fan tokens” are often short-lived and launched by unaffiliated parties trying to capitalize on a trend. “We’ve seen this countless times before with tokens like PEPE, Moodeng, PNUT, Chill Guy, and others—very few have had real staying power,” he said. McRae-Yu further pointed out that DEX Screener shows that over 29 different Labubu meme coins have been launched to date. “I think this highlights how many people are eager to capitalize on viral trends by launching fan tokens. This trend will likely continue as launching tokens becomes increasingly easier and more accessible. Buyers beware,” he said. A Binance spokesperson also told Cryptonews that while memecoins have become a powerful cultural and financial phenomenon in the crypto space, building a truly resilient memecoin community comes with major challenges. For instance, they pointed out that most meme coin projects struggle with longevity. “The majority of memecoins launched in recent years have already faded into obscurity.” In addition, market manipulation has become a serious concern , especially with meme coins. “Tactics like disguised holdings, multisend distributions, and wash trading can create the illusion of liquidity, while masking concentrated control and exposing users to risk,” the spokesperson said. Binance’s spokesperson ultimately believes that the most successful memecoins will be those that combine viral narrative appeal with genuine transparency and sustainable community engagement. “Binance believes that fostering safer, more informed markets is essential to the long-term credibility of the space—and we’re committed to supporting that through advanced research, platform safeguards, and user education.” Why $LABUBU May Show Signs of Continued Success Challenges aside, the Labubu meme coin fits the criteria for being a noteworthy project . According to Binance’s spokesperson, several factors contribute to the success of a memecoin that extend beyond just humor or hype. “First, fairness and transparency are critical. Memecoins that launch without private seed rounds or VC allocations tend to attract more trust and grassroots support, as they offer equal access to all participants from day one,” the spokesperson said. Sources note that $LABUBU is a community-driven meme coin. “Second, accessibility and simplicity play a big role. Unlike complex DeFi protocols or infrastructure tokens, memecoins typically have straightforward, meme-driven narratives that are easy for anyone to grasp—even those new to crypto. This helps their stories spread rapidly through online communities and social media,” the spokesperson said. The Labubu meme coin will likely resonate with newcomers, given the success of the toy. Binance’s spokesperson also mentioned that the most sought-after memecoins tap into cultural and emotional resonance, which appears to be the case with Labubu toys. But while $LABUBU appears to meet these requirements, Shah commented that Labubu and other meme coins should consider migrating to the Bitcoin blockchain to see real traction. “If Pudgy Penguins really stand for permanence, culture, and value, then why are they still stuck on chains other than Bitcoin?” she said. Shah further pointed out that Ordinals aren’t just NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, but rather “digital artifacts inscribed directly into the most secure, most finite blockspace in the world.” $Labubu btc pic.twitter.com/QtlB7m9Ua4 — Mayaron (@micilionus) June 6, 2025 “If there were ever a place to enshrine culturally significant IP, this is it. So if Labubu is dangling from Hermès, and Penguins are waddling through Walmart, the next flex is permanence. Not just going viral, but going eternal,” Shah stated.

According to a new report by Bloomberg, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) recently sent the letter to Fight Fight Fight LLC, the same company that created the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin. The report says that the firm and the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden are collaborating to create an unauthorized crypto wallet featuring Trump’s brand. TrumpWallet.com, the website advertised as the waitlist for the crypto wallet, is no longer working at time of writing. Earlier this week, Donald Trump Jr. announced on social media that the Trump organization has nothing to do with this project and that they know nothing about it, adding that WLFI will be launching its official crypto wallet soon. “The Trump Organization has zero involvement with this wallet product. Eric Trump and I know nothing about it. Stay tuned – World Liberty Financial, which we have been working tirelessly on, will be launching our official wallet soon.” WLFI launched late last year as a means of spreading the dominance of the US dollar and helping those disenfranchised by the banking system. Previously, Trump Jr said the family explored crypto after they were debanked in New York for political reasons. “The reason we got into crypto and we’re all in on crypto and we’re doing American Bitcoin and we have World Liberty Finance and [the stablecoin] USD1 was because there was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing.

As long as everything goes as planned, the deal should be completed by June 10. This move shows the company is investing even more money in Bitcoin. The company originally planned to raise $250 million, but strong interest pushed that number up to $1 billion. After removing fees and costs, Strategy expects to receive about $979.7 million in net proceeds. These proceeds will go toward general corporate purposes, including more Bitcoin purchases and working capital. Big banks like Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and TD Securities are backing the STRD launch. The Strategy Inc’s New Preferred Stocks and Dividend Models In addition to STRD, Strategy has introduced two other preferred stock offerings: Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF). Each stock carries a unique structure. STRK is a convertible preferred stock with a fixed 8% annual dividend. STRF, on the other hand, is non-convertible but offers a 10% fixed cumulative annual dividend. Notably, STRD, powering this latest raise, is also non-convertible and carries a 10% fixed non-cumulative annual dividend. Unlike bonds, perpetual preferred shares do not have a set maturity date. They pay fixed dividends for as long as the company operates, but are not required to be paid back like traditional debt. Strategy Buys More Bitcoin, Slows Its Pace as Rivals Rise Alongside the announcement, the Nasdaq-listed firm bought another 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for $75.1 million, funded by earlier STRK and STRF stock sales. The firm now holds 580,955 BTC worth over $60 billion, with an average price of $70,023, giving it $19.3 billion in unrealized profits. This is about 2.8% of all Bitcoin, making Strategy the largest corporate holder. However, the firm’s buying pace is slowing. According to research firm K33, this may be due to a smaller premium on Strategy’s shares compared to its Bitcoin holdings. Competition is also heating up. On the same day, Strategy upsized its offering, and Metaplanet plans to raise $5.4 billion to buy more BTC, adding to the pressure. This came after the Japanese firm issued $ 21 million in zero-interest bonds to buy Bitcoin on May 29. Following the news, Strategy’s shares (MSTR) were up 1.5% in pre-market trading on June 6, according to TradingView. Strategy’s new funding push shows the company remains firmly committed to Bitcoin as its core treasury asset , even as other companies enter the race.

2025-06-06T18:30:11,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Trump Media Files For Major BTC Treasury Deal","While the Trump vs Elon spectacle continues to grab headlines and stir up social feeds, the crypto market isn’t amused. Prices have slumped, sentiment feels strained, and Bitcoin briefly fell below the $102,000 threshold. But behind the curtain of all the public noise, something far more consequential is unfolding. Trump Media & Technology Group has filed an S-3 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, paving the way for a treasury move valued at $2.3 billion . It’s not just paperwork. It’s a quiet signal that crypto, particularly Bitcoin, is being pulled deeper into the financial strategies of institutions tied to political figures. The $2.3 Billion Filing Could Bring Bitcoin Into the Treasury Playbook The S-3 filing allows Trump Media to register shares for potential resale, but the scale and timing of the move have turned heads for a different reason. Analysts believe the capital unlocked could be restructured into a reserve strategy involving Bitcoin. It would align with previous pro-crypto messaging, but this time, it’s not coming in the form of memes or tweets. It’s coming through formal filings with financial regulators. Yesterday's Trump Media & Technology $DJT S-3 filing:- Officially adopts the #bitcoin treasury strategy.- Registers up to ▶️$12 billion◀️ in new securities that can be used to buy bitcoin.- This is in addition to the ~$2.44 billion they already raised via private placement.-… pic.twitter.com/8ULOVBbh3H — NLNico (@btcNLNico) June 6, 2025 At $2.3 billion, even a partial allocation into Bitcoin would carry weight. Not just in terms of liquidity, but in narrative influence. This isn’t just about one company’s treasury; it reflects a growing willingness to treat Bitcoin as a financial anchor rather than a speculative side note. When such moves emerge from politically connected firms, the impact goes beyond price charts. It reshapes how investors, especially conservative ones, frame crypto in their broader portfolios. This Kind of Momentum Can Redirect Capital to Hidden Crypto Opportunities If this move unfolds as expected, it could create an opening for tokens that offer either unique design, functional value, or viral attention. Bitcoin might be the trigger, but attention often flows toward the highest potential gains. And those are rarely found among already mature assets. Right now, the market feels battered. But that often becomes the exact moment when early entries into under-the-radar tokens start to pay off. A large-scale treasury action like this reminds investors that while prices may swing, the long-term direction of capital interest in crypto continues to rise. The key is spotting which projects are already preparing for the next leg up. Best Crypto to Buy Now - 10x Potential Gems Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is an Ethereum-based Layer 2 project built to improve transaction speed and reduce costs for Bitcoin-based activity. It brings together multiple scaling technologies, including Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and the Lightning Network, alongside Rootstock for EVM compatibility. The goal is to make Bitcoin transactions faster, more affordable, and compatible with modern smart contract systems without altering the Bitcoin network itself. The token uses Ethereum infrastructure to simulate BTC usage with higher throughput, enabling a wide range of decentralized applications to settle or simulate Bitcoin interactions at reduced cost. Its design also includes the potential for integrating with sidechains and DeFi platforms that currently do not natively support BTC functionality. While the project carries meme aesthetics to appeal to retail investors, its technical offerings place it closer to utility infrastructure than purely speculative assets. Crypto content creator Today Trader also addressed the project’s launch and potential in one of his dedicated videos on YouTube. In volatile market phases like the current one, this type of Layer 2 concept could attract attention due to its hybrid structure, especially as Bitcoin returns to institutional conversation via treasury plans like the one filed by Trump Media. If this market rotation continues, early-stage tokens with actual technical integrations and Ethereum-based scaling for major chains like BTC may see renewed interest. Bitcoin Hyper is still at a low price point, and with memetic visibility combined with legitimate Layer 2 design, it presents one of the few low-cap entries tied to infrastructure development rather than just narrative hype. BTC Bull BTC Bull is a meme token built around Bitcoin advocacy but includes a built-in system that rewards holders based on token activity and community engagement. The token’s primary utility lies in its structure as a community-driven reward mechanism that circulates incentives for holding, participating, and contributing to Bitcoin awareness. It does not attempt to improve the Bitcoin network directly, but rather, operates as a memecoin that redirects capital and social media attention back toward Bitcoin through incentive loops and staking options. The staking model is straightforward: users lock up BTC Bull to earn rewards over time, with a portion of the tokenomics configured to support price stability and reduce sell pressure. The project’s roadmap includes limited-time events tied to Bitcoin milestones, interactive campaigns designed to onboard non-crypto users, and regular liquidity injections to maintain trading volume on decentralized platforms. Basically, every investor gets access to airdrops as Bitcoin reaches certain ambitious price levels. Given that Bitcoin is again being considered in institutional strategies, as seen in Trump Media’s SEC filing for a $2.3 billion treasury fund, projects tied to BTC advocacy or ecosystem growth could be swept into the spotlight. While BTC Bull doesn’t offer direct infrastructure upgrades, it does offer entry into a token that builds retail community around Bitcoin movement. It remains affordable, highly accessible, and easy to stake, which may attract users looking for crypto engagement outside the typical slow-moving BTC price action. With market activity low and investors scanning for tokens linked to macro crypto narratives, BTC Bull fits into a niche that's easy to understand and act on. Solaxy Solaxy is a Layer 2 blockchain designed to bridge transactional activity between Ethereum and Solana, with a focus on speed, scalability, and yield generation. It provides infrastructure for cross-chain DApps and DeFi protocols, aiming to reduce congestion on both networks while offering near-zero gas fees and low-latency settlements. The SOLX token powers the network, serving three primary functions: gas fees on the Solaxy chain, staking for validator support, and governance rights. Holders can earn rewards by staking SOLX, and early stakers are eligible for high APY rates due to the network’s reward schedule, which currently favors early adoption. Solaxy also enables developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible contracts with Solana-level performance, removing the need for deep reconfiguration. Solaxy supports both retail and institutional use cases by integrating with major wallets and offering SDKs for seamless onboarding. Its validator network is incentivized through protocol fees, and the platform has outlined plans to support NFT interoperability and real-time bridge analytics to track asset movement. The Solaxy universe is expanding every day. 🪐🛸44M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/yIRZinZAPR — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 4, 2025 Having raised over $44 million, particularly with renewed interest in Bitcoin integration across networks, infrastructure projects like Solaxy could become more relevant. Especially in a market where Solana and Ethereum both remain dominant yet congested, Solaxy’s offering positions it as a scalability complement, not a competitor. With low transaction costs, high staking returns, and a roadmap targeting developer tools and cross-chain compatibility, Solaxy could appeal to users seeking long-term growth and ecosystem participation rather than short-term speculation. Snorter Snorter is a Telegram-based trading bot built for users looking to navigate newly launched tokens on Solana with speed and automation. Its core use case revolves around enabling sniping, copy trading, and real-time portfolio interaction, all directly within the Telegram interface. The bot supports early-stage trading activity, allowing users to place fast buy or sell orders, often within seconds of a token going live, by interacting with liquidity pools on Solana-based DEXs. What makes Snorter more than just a basic sniping tool is its layered functionality. Users can track wallets, replicate trading activity through copy trading features, and set up basic risk protections like stop-loss parameters. The bot also includes honeypot detection and slippage filters to help reduce exposure to high-risk or illiquid tokens. This makes it appealing to users trying to capitalize on volatility while avoiding common traps tied to low-cap token launches. The $SNORT token is used within the system to unlock discounted fees, access premium features, and earn staking rewards. Holding SNORT not only reduces the cost of transactions through the bot but also gives users priority access to updates and upcoming tools being rolled out by the development team. As part of its roadmap, the project is working on browser integrations and deeper Solana analytics to enhance decision-making in real time. Snorter functions as both a utility tool and a speculative layer for meme coin traders. With broader discussions around crypto entering mainstream finance again, this type of tool may see renewed usage as traders seek precision in uncertain conditions. SUBBD SUBBD is a creator-economy protocol that provides monetization infrastructure for independent creators, influencers, and communities using blockchain rails. The platform replaces traditional paywall and subscription systems with decentralized tools that give creators direct control over revenue, audience data, and token-gated content access. What powers the project is the $SUBBD token, which functions as both a payment method and a utility tool. Users can subscribe to exclusive creator content by staking or spending $SUBBD, while creators can deploy smart contract-based earnings structures that eliminate middlemen. Token holders can also access premium platform features, participate in content-based governance proposals, and earn engagement-based rewards. SUBBD incorporates optional NFT layers, allowing creators to mint subscription passes or limited-access experiences, and integrates with Web3 social platforms to enable seamless plug-ins across Discord, X (Twitter), and Telegram. A presale is currently ongoing, with the token priced below its projected listing value. As institutional interest in crypto grows and headlines focus on high-capital moves like Trump Media’s treasury filing, the macro trend points to broader crypto acceptance. This raises interest in real-use projects that go beyond speculation. SUBBD addresses a long-standing Web2 problem: platform dependence; and offers a working alternative that aligns with crypto-native principles. The project has already launched its core modules in beta, and early adopters are incentivized with staking rewards and platform voting power. As monetization continues to decentralize, SUBBD could see growing traction among creators looking to retain ownership while building sustainable revenue models. Conclusion As Trump Media takes formal steps toward a treasury model that could include Bitcoin, it signals a deeper shift in how digital assets are viewed at the institutional level. This isn't just about a headline; it’s about where capital might move once the market steadies. While prices remain compressed, the early-stage projects gaining quiet traction are often the ones built around fresh concepts and clear utility. These are not fully matured plays. They're still forming, evolving, and positioning themselves for what comes next. If momentum returns, the projects already building now may not stay under the radar for long.

2025-06-06T18:05:24,"Analyst Michaël van de Poppe Says Bitcoin Is About To Go Higher, Updates Outlook on Sui and One Low-Cap Altcoin","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is gearing up for a massive breakout after correcting to the $100,000 level. In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 790,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is now likely on the verge of breaking through the resistance level at $105,800. “Bitcoin is about to break back higher, as we’ve taken all the liquidity and it’s quickly being absorbed. These levels should usually be the end of the correction.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X He also says that Bitcoin is exhibiting market strength after retesting the $100,739 level. “To be honest, after the recent correction on Bitcoin, this is what you’d want to see. A strong bounce back upwards, ETH also climbing back. Good times are ahead.” Bitcoin is trading for $105,023 at time of writing. Next up, the analyst says he remains bullish on layer-1 blockchain Sui ( SUI ), despite the recent major security breach of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network. The analyst says one reason to be bullish on SUI is that the network’s total value locked (TVL) is recovering after its decline triggered by the Cetus hack. The TVL is the amount of capital deposited within a protocol’s smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem. “SUI has continued to show strength. Despite the recent exploit on Cetus, the TVL on SUI is still $1.8 billion and constantly growing. It has run back with 20% since the recent drop. Such a strong signal and such a strong ecosystem.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $3.18 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the analyst says that the cross-chain messaging protocol Wormhole ( W ) is showing bullish divergence on the weekly chart. A bullish divergence, which suggests price will start to increase, occurs when the price of assets records lower lows while indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator indicator, are witnessing higher lows. “W remains to be one of my portfolio altcoins. They are bringing Dogecoin to Solana as well, as they bridge the memecoin towards the other chain. Secondly, they are the exclusive partner of BlackRock’s BUIDL and more partners. Massive bullish divergence.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Wormhole is trading for $0.07355 at time of writing, down 2.8% in the last 24 hours.

2025-06-06T18:00:28,"Fidelity says Bitcoin is the best digital store of value","Fidelity Investments, a global asset management firm overseeing obout $6 trillion in assets, has reaffirmed Bitcoin’s status as the leading digital store of value. In its recent Coin Report , the company explained how the BTC’s design, scarcity, and decentralized nature set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. Fidelity claims Bitcoin’s scarcity and asset design appeal to investors In their report, Fidelity analysts argued that Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins contributes to its scarcity and thus distinguishes it from other digital assets. Most tokens don’t necessarily have limits on their supply or mechanisms to change up circulation over time, making BTC stand out. Fidelity also believes that Bitcoin’s stable supply and inflation resistance make it especially valuable in today’s uncertain economic environment. It argued that the asset’s design makes it operate like sound money in ways no other digital asset can and makes it a haven for investors fearing fiscal instability. Moreover, its digital design and stable purchasing power allow for global transactions without relying on intermediaries. Its neutrality and censorship resistance further enhance its utility, allowing adoption across all levels—from individuals to banks and governments—as both a currency and a store of wealth. Timmer encourages investors to buy both Bitcoin and gold for their SoV portfolios In May, Fidelity Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer also claimed BTC could be the leading store of value. He then analyzed the Sharpe ratios of both assets and pointed to convergence, hinting that the two assets were becoming increasingly similar in risk-adjusted performance. From 2018 to May 2025, weekly performance data reveals that Bitcoin has steadily closed in on gold, with Bitcoin posting a relative return of $15.95 compared to gold’s $22.48. Considering the data, Timmer even suggested maintaining a 4:1 Gold-to-Bitcoin ratio for long-term SoV portfolios. He commented, “I continue to be fascinated by the fact that the most negatively correlated asset to Bitcoin is gold. For two players on the same store-of-value team, it’s not what I would expect to see. Bitcoin’s risk-reward ratio has continued to impress. There is no other asset quite like it!” The director, however, urged investors to buy both Bitcoin and gold, saying he sees them as different players on a team. he also acknowledgedBTC is a “modern-day invention aspiring to be hard money in an easy money era.” Despite the growing narrative, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds experienced their first quarterly decline in Q1 2025 since their debut in 2024. According to CoinShares, institutional investors’ exposure to Bitcoin dwindled by over 23% to $21.2 billion in Q1 2025 from $27.4 billion in Q4 2024. Nevertheless, gold ETFs drew in more capital. On May 30, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the leading Bitcoin ETF, even saw a huge reversal, with over $430 million in outflows after 31 days of consecutive inflows. Fidelity advances crypto ambitions with stablecoin launch Recent reports indicate that Fidelity Investments is gearing up to launch its stablecoin, marking a significant step in the $6 trillion asset manager’s growing involvement in digital assets as the US moves closer to establishing its first comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the Boston-based firm is in the final phases of testing the token, which will function as a cash equivalent in crypto markets. Fidelity’s digital assets division will manage the stablecoin. Fidelity’s planned launch is part of its expansion into the nascent market for tokenized versions of US Treasuries, having been involved in digital assets for more than a decade. It recently filed to launch a digital version of a US money market fund at the end of May, directly competing with traditional asset manager rivals BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.

2025-06-06T18:00:19,"Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive","Dogecoin’s daily time-frame has reached a critical point that leaves virtually no margin for error. Price settled last night at $0.17551, clinging to a slender cushion just above the confluence of two of the chart’s most important guide rails: the former down-trend resistance that runs from late February and the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2024’s late advance to $0.48440. Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone The structural landscape is defined by a six-month descending channel that has corralled every impulse since Dogecoin topped at $0.48440 on 8 December. The median of that channel—slicing through the field at roughly $0.1800—functioned as durable support until Thursday, when an 11% slide in sympathy with Bitcoin split it cleanly. A failure-retest of a channel mid-line is seldom trivial; until DOGE can reclaim $0.1800 on a closing basis, the chart message remains one of trend continuity. Beneath the market, the black trendline that first rejected rallies on 26 March, 26 April and 2 May reclaimed centre-stage after price vaulted it on 8 May, ran to the channel ceiling at $0.2540, and was twice rebuffed—the first rejection on 11 May, the second on 23 May. The trendline is now retested as support where it intersects the 0.786 Fib at $0.16700, producing a high-stakes cross-point. Related Reading: Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst If that level fractures, the only historical scaffolding is the multi-year ascending trendline (drawn from May 2021’s all-time high) that merges with a proven demand band spanning $0.14500 to $0.13500. That rectangle arrested the early-April shake-out and would represent the bulls’ final trench; surrendering it would invalidate the long-term series of higher lows and almost certainly inaugurate a broader bear phase with potential gravitational pull back to the January pivot at $0.12990. Oscillators and overlays do little to contradict the bearish drift. The fourteen-day Relative Strength Index sits at 34.70, hovering just above oversold territory but still tracking below its own moving average at 45.22, underscoring persistent negative momentum. Price Targets Overhead, resistance layers are stacked like dominoes. Immediate priority for the bulls is a daily close back above the channel midline at $0.1800; failing that, any attempt at recovery is suspect. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The next ceiling is the compressing exponential moving average cluster: the 20-day EMA at $0.20120, the 50-day at $0.20091, the 100-day at $0.20677 and the 200-day at $0.21550. With all four averages declining and bunched inside a three-cent band, they act as a single reinforced lid near the psychological $0.20 handle. Clearing that barricade would deliver price to the channel’s upper rail, now descending through $0.22. A weekly close outside that boundary would finally neutralise the half-year downtrend and force shorts to cover into the next Fibonacci checkpoints derived from the November high: the 61.8 percent retracement at $0.23484, the 50 percent at $0.28249, the 38.2 percent at $0.33014 and the 23.6 percent at $0.38910. Until then, however, the blunt arithmetic favours the bears. A floor at $0.16700 backed by a multi-touch trendline is slim protection when sentiment is fragile and macro flows are unhelpful. If that shelf cracks, the market’s inertia points toward $0.14500–$0.13500, Dogecoin’s last defensible plateau. Should that red demand zone capitulate, the technical map turns blank down to the January base at $0.12990 and, beyond that into deep bearish territory, especially the August 2024 low at $0.08.

2025-06-06T17:59:36,"The Crypto Wave Is Rising in Brazil, But LATAM’s Media Reach Is Fading — Outset PR’s Q1 Report Breaks It Down","Latin America’s crypto boom is the real deal, and in Brazil, it’s especially strong, but according to a new Q1 2025 report from Outset PR, the region’s crypto media landscape is collapsing just as adoption surges. From mid-2023 through mid-2024 this crypto-forward zone saw nearly $415 billion in crypto inflows, representing a 42.5% year-over-year increase . At this rate, LATAM ranks as the world’s second-fastest-growing market. Within Latin America, four countries rank among the world’s top 20 for crypto adoption, Brazil notably placing ninth. The country pairs strong user engagement with a regulatory environment that remains broadly constructive. While it’s often overshadowed by El Salvador – the world’s first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender – Brazil distinguishes itself through a more measured, infrastructure-driven approach. Its focus on fintech collaboration, institutional readiness, and regulatory progress positions it as a long-term leader in crypto integration. Lawmakers recently introduced a bill ( PL 957/2025 ) to allow up to 50% of wages to be paid in Bitcoin with the rest in the country’s native reais. This would make Brazil one of the first countries to officially accommodate crypto payrolls. The central bank has signaled a more open stance toward stablecoin usage by reconsidering a prior ban that limits transfers of stablecoins to self-custody wallets. Mercado Bitcoin, Brazil’s largest crypto exchange, has inked major partnerships: it is Ripple’s first Brazilian client for a blockchain-based payment solution, and it just announced a deal to tokenize $40 million of Brazilian assets on the Plume Network. Even traditional banks are catching up. Brazil’s BTG Pactual has launched blockchain investing tools, and a pilot digital-real/CBDC program has pushed banks like Itaú into crypto services. But with all this momentum, why is Brazil, along with much of Latin America, still lacking consistent, in-depth media coverage of these shifts? As recently highlighted by Outset PR , the region’s crypto media landscape is thinning at the very moment it’s needed most. Outset PR report: Media isn’t keeping pace The media ecosystem communicating these developments is shrinking, despite a thriving crypto economy. Outset PR’s Q1 2025 media-audit report reveals a sharp disconnect: despite clear signs of strong user interest, Latin America’s crypto news outlets aren't performing well. In the first quarter, only a handful of crypto sites managed growth while 73% of active crypto media lost traffic. January’s Bitcoin rally brought a short-term boost in crypto coverage on mainstream finance outlets, but niche crypto news sites and blogs suffered as market momentum shifted. By February, only 12 crypto outlets saw traffic growth, while the majority lost visibility due to market downturns and early algorithmic shifts. Google’s March core update then shuffled rankings further. Only about half of the 55 monitored outlets recaptured traffic by March. Outset PR tracked a steep and uneven recovery, with many outlets failing to regain January traffic levels. Six sites dominate a shrinking ecosystem In practical terms, Outset PR highlights that Latin American crypto media are highly concentrated and exclusive. There are just six top publishers that accounted for around 69% of all visits to crypto-focused outlets in Q1. Despite such a large market share concentrated across a small handful of players, none of these niche sites averaged more than 1 million monthly visits. The rest of the field is fragmented: many crypto outlets in the region struggle to reach even 10,000 visits per month, with the lowest tier capturing just 8% of total traffic. Several previously recognized sites, such as bitcoinmexico.net and latamblockchain.com, are now defunct, dormant, or largely irrelevant, according to the report. Mainstream media overshadows crypto-native press Adoption is surging, but discoverability isn’t. In Brazil, most web users learn about crypto from large general-media brands (Ámbito Financiero, InfoMoney, iProfesional, El Diario, Valor Econômico, etc.) rather than pure-crypto outlets. These legacy outlets cover crypto on occasion and often gear content to market hype. Their editorial focus can spike PR impressions during bull runs, but they offer no guarantee of engaged crypto readers or evergreen visibility. Outset PR’s data suggest that relying on broad “LATAM” press packages without context can backfire. Budgets get spent on clicks that vanish once Google’s algorithm changes or interest drops. Strategy must evolve with the market For crypto brands in Brazil and Latin America, the takeaway is clear: do not equate adoption with media reach. Campaigns must target the right mix of outlets – the few niche sites that actually have crypto-savvy audiences, plus mainstream portals at critical moments, such as around big regulatory or price news. And they must continuously update their playbook: Outset PR stresses using real traffic and search analytics—not just clippings or old rankings. In short, while Brazil’s crypto narrative is vibrant on the ground, PR teams need data-driven media strategies to ensure the message doesn’t get lost in a crowded and volatile landscape. The region’s next challenge for the industry isn’t building a viable crypto ecosystem, it’s being seen. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-06T17:36:52,"Dow Jones, major indices surge on jobs data while Tesla recovers","Stocks are in recovery mode after the latest jobs report beat expectations, while Tesla regained some of its losses. U.S. stock indices rebounded on Friday, June 6, following stronger-than-expected jobs data. The Dow Jones rose 300 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.75%. At the same time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 0.97%, with major indices buoyed by encouraging figures on U.S. employment. According to Friday’s report, U.S. employers added 139,000 new jobs , lower than the revised April figure of 147,000 but still ahead of expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at a relatively low 4.2%. Overall, the report signaled that the U.S. job market remains resilient despite ongoing concerns over the trade war. Nonfarm payrolls data is a key metric for the Federal Reserve, which maintains a dual mandate of supporting employment and keeping inflation low. The stronger-than-expected figures are likely to keep the Fed cautious about cutting interest rates, as inflation remains a concern. Following the positive news on the job market, U.S. President Donald Trump once again launched an attack on the Fed. Trump urged Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. “Go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” Trump stated on social media.

2025-06-06T17:35:26,"Immutable price drops even as Guild of Guardians NFT sales jump","Immutable token retreated this week as market participants reacted to the broader crypto market crash. It also dropped despite welcoming a popular game to its platform and a surge in Guild of Guardians NFT sales. Immutable ( IMX ) fell to $0.495 on Friday, down 36% from its May peak and 86% from its high last year. The sharp decline has dragged its market capitalization from $4.6 billion in September to $958 million. The decline came even after developers announced that Legends of Elumia had migrated to the Immutable network from Ronin. This is notable, as Legends is a fast-growing title acquired by Triumph Games in April and boasts thousands of monthly active players. Legends of Elumia is now available on PC and Mobile. A fantasy MMORPG with hand-crafted Hero NFTs, an onchain economy, and more. @PlayElumia is powered by Immutable. pic.twitter.com/u9al46uC78 — Immutable (@Immutable) June 4, 2025 Meanwhile, Immutable’s NFT activity showed notable strength this week. Data indicates that Guild of Guardians Heroes generated $8.89 million in sales, a 61% increase from the same period last week. Guild of Guardians Avatars sales rose by 64% to $4.2 million. In total, Immutable processed $13.7 million in NFT sales this week, up 69% from the previous period. You might also like: U.S. jobs report sends mixed signals, Bitcoin traders eye Fed’s next move The next key catalyst for the IMX token is a major unlock scheduled for June 13. It will release 24.52 million tokens, valued at over $12.7 million. Fortunately for investors, IMX unlocks will conclude in October, transitioning the token into a deflationary asset. Immutable price technical analysis IMX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the IMX price peaked at $0.8100 in May as most cryptocurrencies rallied. It then pulled back to $0.50, its lowest point since May 8. IMX has since dropped below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while both lines of the MACD have crossed below the zero line. The Relative Strength Index has also tilted downward and is approaching oversold territory. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target key support at $0.3458, its year-to-date low. A drop to this level would complete a double-bottom pattern, which could signal a rebound back to the neckline at $0.8100. However, a decisive move below that support would invalidate the bullish setup.

2025-06-06T17:33:00,"UK’s FCA Proposes Lifting Ban on Crypto ETNs for Retail Investors","The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed unwinding its ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, reflecting a more relaxed attitude towards digital assets. The FCA made it clear in a June 6 press release that retail investors would be able to access crypto ETNs if they are traded on an investment exchange that is approved by the FCA. This is a major policy shift since ETNs have not been accessible to retail consumers since 2021 due to risk perceptions. FCA’s payment and digital assets executive director David Geale said the move reflects a balanced approach: “Lifting the prohibition would allow people to make up their own minds whether such a high-risk investment is best for them, with a chance to lose all their possessions.” In Alignment with the UK’s Broader Crypto Goals Regulatory experts see the step as being in line with the UK’s strategic objectives in the crypto sector. Clifford Chance partner Diego Ballon Ossio called it a sign that the UK is set to “position itself as a sophisticated jurisdiction in the crypto space.” He pointed out that lifting the retail ban on ETNs could offer fresh avenues for investor access and indicate that the UK is becoming more crypto-friendly. Regulatory Momentum Dominates This comes following the FCA’s rapid acceleration of its crypto-regulatory push. In May, the regulator issued a call for public comments on fresh stablecoin and crypto custody service rules. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves pledged further recently to offer a “comprehensive regulatory regime” to allow the country to be at the forefront of digital asset innovation. According to reports, the UK is witnessing a sharp growth in crypto holdings, even surpassing adoption rates in the US. Crypto Donations Galvanize Political Row There was another row on June 5, in which UK parliamentarians expressed dismay at the growing application of crypto to political donations. Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden stressed that fresh guidelines were required that offer transparency in election expenditure. MP Sarah Olney criticized parties accepting crypto, warning of potential loopholes in donation transparency. Her comments followed Nigel Farage’s June 4 announcement that Reform UK would accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from eligible donors. “We are the first political party in Britain to accept donations in Bitcoin,” said Farage. “We’re catching up with America.” Conclusion The FCA’s proposal to reintroduce crypto ETNs to retail investors can reshape the UK’s digital asset landscape, demonstrating enhanced interest and regulatory recognition of crypto’s mass appeal.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/uks-fca-proposes-lifting-ban-on-crypto-etns-for-retail-investors/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED","Blockchain|Regulation",cryptocompare

Crypto is no longer on the fringes of the financial world. On Friday, June 6, Binance Research released its weekly report , emphasizing that crypto is becoming increasingly integrated with traditional finance. Still, it noted that crypto was among the hardest-hit market segments last week, largely due to political turmoil. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) entered negative territory this week, weighed down by the public split between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Their public arguments have significant implications for crypto, as Musk has been a major advocate for the industry. Weekly and YTD performance of major crypto and traditional assets | Source: Binance Research As a result, Bitcoin fell to a weekly low of $101,500, while Ethereum dropped to $2,388. Still, despite the temporary price shock, the long-term outlook for both assets remains positive. Notably, over the week ending June 2, there was a significant decrease in BTC and ETH held on exchanges.

On the regulatory front, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new guidance on proof-of-stake networks.
