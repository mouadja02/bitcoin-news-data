2025-06-27T14:54:20,"Top blue-chip altcoins to buy as Nasdaq 100 Index hits ATH","Cryptocurrency prices have pulled back in the past few days, but a few signals point to an eventual comeback. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, pointing to potential gains that could take it to $140,000. ETF inflows have also jumped and are nearing the key milestone of $50 billion. Similarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has surged to a record high of $22,500, while the S&P 500 Index has climbed to $6,170. Both indices are up over 27% from their April lows. Further, there are signs the Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates in September, while the US dollar index has plunged. Additionally, the U.S. and China are reportedly close to signing a new trade agreement. Best altcoins to buy today ahead of the bull run The bullish Bitcoin pattern and the surging S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices may trigger the next crypto bull run. Some of the top altcoins to buy are Sei ( SEI ), Aptos ( APT ), and Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ). 1. Sei Sei price chart | Source: crypto.new Sei is one of the best-positioned altcoins ahead of the next bull run. It’s a fast-growing EVM-compatible chain gaining traction in gaming, DeFi, and stablecoins. It’s also under consideration to run Wyoming’s stablecoin initiative. The Sei price has risen from a year-to-date low of $0.1315 to a high of $0.3337 on June 25. It recently broke through resistance at $0.2767, invalidating the previous double-top formation. With the price now above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, further gains are likely. Bulls may target the 50% retracement level at $0.4340.

Like Sei, it’s a layer-1 blockchain slowly gaining traction. According to DeFi Llama’s data , Aptos-based DEXs processed over $4 billion in the past 30 days, with a total value locked (TVL) of $1.3 billion, ranking it 12th in the industry. APT price has formed a double-bottom at $3.88, with the neckline at $6.30. This bullish pattern points to a potential breakout, with an upside target near $10 if the neckline is breached. 3. Aerodrome Finance AERO price chart | Source: crypto.news Aerodrome Finance is a leading DEX on the Base blockchain, processing billions in monthly trading volume. The AERO price has rallied from a low of $0.2963 in April to $0.80 as of June 27. It has formed an ascending triangle pattern and is hovering near the 23.6% retracement level. A mini golden cross, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 100-day MA, has formed, a bullish signal. If momentum holds, the next target is the $2 resistance level.

2025-06-27T14:49:07,"Bitcoin big players are making moves; Should you follow?","While Bitcoin’s price has barely budged over the past month, hovering around the $106,500 mark, behind the scenes, something more telling is unfolding: the whales are back. The number of Bitcoin wallets holding 10 BTC or more just hit a 3.5-month high, according to on-chain data from Santiment. As of June 27, 152,280 wallets now fall into this “whale and shark” category, each holding over $1 million in BTC. It’s the highest count since March 12, and it’s happening despite the sideways action in price. “As markets have been volatile, smart money has accumulated on most retail panic sell cycles,” Santiment noted in its report. Bitcoin whale and shark wallets. Source: Santiment Bitcoin whale and shark purchases It’s worth highlighting that a pattern where large holders accumulate as smaller investors exit, is not new, but it is telling. While retail investors grow weary during consolidation phases, institutions and high-net-worth players often treat them as accumulation windows. Bitcoin is up more than 70% over the past year but has traded relatively flat in the short term: down 1.12% on the day, up just 1.28% over the past week, and slightly negative on the month. That’s precisely the type of lull where professional money quietly builds positions, often anticipating the next major leg up. So should everyday investors follow the whales? Historically, spikes in whale wallet counts have preceded significant moves in Bitcoin’s price. It’s not a guarantee, but it’s often an indicator that confidence remains high among long-term holders, especially in a backdrop of ETF inflows, macroeconomic easing, and growing global adoption. With retail interest cooling, the smart money appears to be positioning ahead of the crowd, again.

2025-06-27T14:30:29,"XRP Lawsuit: After Torres Says No, Lawyer Predicts When It’s Over","Following Judge Analisa Torres’ June 26 denial of Ripple and the SEC’s joint motion for an indicative ruling, crypto attorney Fred Rispoli has delivered a blistering breakdown of the legal and political dynamics behind the decision—and issued a clear prediction on when the XRP lawsuit may finally conclude. Rispoli, founder of Hodl Law and one of the most outspoken legal voices in the XRP community, wasted no time analyzing the ruling , which rejected both parties’ efforts to modify the court’s final judgment and resolve the long-running case at the appellate level. XRP Lawsuit Shaken By Denial “I thought Judge Torres would grant the first motion,” Rispoli wrote in a lengthy post on X, “recognizing that the anti-crypto war of the Gensler Era was political animus and that the agency was moving in a different direction under new leadership.” But Torres, he said, “chose not to,” and “there was zero obstacle to her granting the motion and moving on.” In his view, the refusal was less about legal deficiency and more about institutional frustration or political motivation. “There are only two reasons for this,” Rispoli argued. “One, she was pissed that the parties wasted 4.5 years of her time with bitter litigation… Two, she is hostile to the Trump administration and will do what she can to throw up obstacles.” Rispoli’s analysis extended sharply to the SEC’s failure to support the motion with official testimony that could have helped the court reconsider its prior findings of reckless conduct by Ripple. Citing pages 3 and 4 of Torres’ order, Rispoli pointed out that “the ruling parrot[s] back the SEC’s own words of how egregious, dangerous, and reckless the SEC believed Ripple to be and why a $1 BILLION fine was necessary.” He emphasized that nothing in the SEC’s submission countered those prior statements with institutional acknowledgment of past errors. “I said that the second motion had to have some actual testimony by SEC Commissioners,” he wrote, imagining declarations such as: “I, Commissioner Peirce , voted against this ridiculous lawsuit because it was a waste of our enforcement resources,” or “I, Commissioner Atkins … determined the SEC enforcement division under the prior administration acted arbitrarily, capriciously and often with bad faith.” None of that materialized. “This obviously did not happen,” Rispoli said, and offered two possible explanations. “(1) Ripple and the SEC did not discuss this necessity… (2) Ripple did ask and the SEC said, ‘We are not making ourselves look like idiot assholes. This crappy motion on SEC letterhead is the best I can offer.’” He concluded that the second explanation is most likely, and said the SEC’s institutional behavior remains unchanged. “The SEC is going to do what it has done for decades: protect its own regardless of the administration in charge or detriment to the public.” That belief fuels Rispoli’s broader frustration with US regulatory governance. “If you ever want to know the types of pieces of shit that sit atop the SEC, type into your browser ‘david aguirre sec whistleblower’ and read up… I sue .gov agencies all the time for despicable behavior… This is the reason I am so invested in crypto—to opt out of our crumbling system.” When Will The XRP Lawsuit End? Looking ahead, Rispoli remains convinced that a settlement is coming soon. Responding to a reader who asked when the saga might finally end, Rispoli gave two scenarios for the August status update due to the Second Circuit: either the parties ask to resume the appeal, or they declare it settled. “In that scenario, case doesn’t end until late 2026/early 2027,” he said of a revived appeal. But that’s not the outcome he expects. “I think we see (2) happen and get that announcement end of July/early August of this year.” As for the implications of the court’s existing injunction against Ripple’s institutional XRP sales, Rispoli minimized its real-world effect. “It doesn’t affect $XRP on the secondary markets nor will it impact XRP ETF approvals,” he explained. While Torres technically retains authority to enforce it, Rispoli added, “The injunction only substantively matters if the SEC wants it to matter.” He also noted that Ripple appears to be preparing to move forward under mutually tolerable terms. “If you look at the @s_alderoty post on this ruling from today,” Rispoli observed, “he used the term ‘historic institutional sales’ to describe the Torres-determined-bad-behavior. This signals to me that the parties are going to settle and move on with the understanding that XRP sales to institutions will be done in a way the SEC can live with.” Though Judge Torres’ refusal to accommodate the proposed resolution was a procedural blow, Rispoli believes it will prove to be the final flashpoint in a case that is now headed toward closure. “The parties will drop their appeals, settle at $50M and move on with the injunction in place,” he wrote. If his forecast is right, the XRP community could be less than six weeks away from the end of one of the most consequential enforcement actions in crypto history.

2025-06-27T14:20:09,"Crypto Blockchain Industries Unveils Bold $23.4M Bitcoin Investment Strategy","BitcoinWorld Crypto Blockchain Industries Unveils Bold $23.4M Bitcoin Investment Strategy Are you keeping an eye on the latest moves in the crypto space? A significant development from Europe is catching attention: Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI), a prominent French-listed fintech firm, is gearing up for a substantial capital raise. This move isn’t just about bolstering their balance sheet; it’s a direct signal of their confidence in the future of digital assets, specifically through strategic BTC purchases and investment in mining infrastructure. It’s an exciting time to see traditional financial structures adapting to the decentralized world. Crypto Blockchain Industries’ Strategic Expansion Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI), already a recognized name in the European fintech landscape, is making headlines with its ambitious plans. The company aims to secure up to €20 million, equivalent to approximately $23.4 million, to significantly expand its footprint in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it represents a considerable commitment to digital assets and the underlying technology that powers them. Their strategy highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies to directly engage with cryptocurrencies, viewing them as both an asset class and a foundational technology for future growth. Funding Future Growth: The Shareholder Loan Approach The method CBI has chosen for this capital injection is particularly interesting: a shareholder loan . This approach involves existing shareholders providing funds to the company, typically with an agreement for repayment, often with interest. It’s a common financing mechanism that demonstrates strong internal confidence and commitment from the company’s existing investor base. For CBI, opting for a shareholder loan over other financing methods like issuing new equity or traditional debt could indicate: Strong Shareholder Support: Existing investors believe in the company’s vision and are willing to directly fund its strategic initiatives. Flexibility: Shareholder loans can sometimes offer more flexible terms compared to bank loans or public offerings. Minimized Dilution: Unlike issuing new shares, a loan doesn’t immediately dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. This method underscores a deep alignment between the company’s management and its shareholders regarding its bold crypto-centric direction. Powering Up: Focusing on BTC Purchases and Mining Equipment The primary use of these substantial funds is twofold: direct BTC purchases and investment in mining equipment. This dual strategy is designed to maximize their exposure and participation in the Bitcoin network. Acquiring Bitcoin directly allows CBI to: Hold a Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital gold, and holding it can be a hedge against inflation or a long-term value appreciation play. Participate in the Ecosystem: Direct BTC ownership allows for more active participation in the broader crypto economy. Simultaneously, investing in mining equipment positions CBI to earn Bitcoin through the mining process. This not only generates new BTC but also contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. It’s a comprehensive approach that seeks to leverage both the asset’s value and its production mechanism. What This Means for French-listed Crypto Firms CBI’s move could set a precedent for other French-listed crypto firms and even broader European companies. As regulatory clarity slowly emerges in the European Union, particularly with initiatives like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets), more traditional companies might feel confident enough to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets or core operations. This could signal a broader institutional adoption wave, not just from crypto-native companies but from established fintech players. France, with its growing tech scene, is increasingly becoming a hub for blockchain innovation, and CBI’s decision further solidifies this position. Navigating the Crypto Investment Strategy Landscape Every significant financial decision comes with its own set of considerations, and CBI’s bold crypto investment strategy is no exception. While the potential for upside is considerable, particularly with Bitcoin’s historical performance, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies presents inherent risks. Companies embarking on such ventures must carefully consider: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the value of holdings. Regulatory Changes: The evolving regulatory landscape could introduce new compliance requirements or restrictions. Operational Risks: Managing mining operations comes with its own set of technical and energy-related challenges. However, for a company like CBI, which operates in the fintech and blockchain space, these risks are likely weighed against the long-term strategic advantages of being an early mover in what many believe is the future of finance. A Bold Leap into Bitcoin’s Future Crypto Blockchain Industries’ plan to raise $23.4 million for BTC purchases and mining equipment through a shareholder loan is a significant indicator of growing institutional confidence in digital assets. This strategic move by a French-listed firm not only strengthens CBI’s position in the crypto economy but also sends a powerful message to the broader financial market: Bitcoin is here to stay, and smart capital is increasingly recognizing its value and potential. It will be fascinating to watch how this bold investment strategy unfolds and its impact on both CBI and the wider European crypto landscape.

2025-06-27T14:07:45,"How Soon Until We See Widespread Bitcoin Mortgages?","In a notable moment for the convergence of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, Strategy’s Michael Saylor has opened a public dialogue with US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte regarding the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream mortgage lending. This engagement centres on Saylor’s proposal to share a proprietary Bitcoin Credit Model designed to assess loan risk using Bitcoin-specific metrics like volatility and asset coverage. The conversation follows Pulte’s announcement that the FHFA is exploring whether cryptocurrency holdings could play a role in mortgage qualification, potentially signalling a shift in how federal housing agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac evaluate borrower assets. The exchange highlights not only the maturing role of Bitcoin in financial planning but also the potential for federal regulators to influence how digital assets might be incorporated into home lending frameworks. Did Saylor Orange Pill US FHFA Director William Pulte? In a recent development underscoring the growing intersection between digital assets and traditional finance, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor publicly engaged with Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte on the potential for Bitcoin-backed mortgage models. Saylor offered to share Strategy’s proprietary Bitcoin Credit Model , which analyses loan risk and pricing based on key Bitcoin-specific metrics such as price volatility, asset appreciation forecasts, and collateral coverage. This outreach followed Pulte’s statement that the FHFA would study how cryptocurrency holdings might factor into mortgage qualification assessments, an announcement seen by some as a signal that federal housing agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be reconsidering legacy lending criteria in light of evolving asset portfolios among U.S. households. The FHFA’s willingness to examine crypto asset integration is particularly notable given its role in overseeing government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently require that cryptocurrency be converted into US dollars and held at regulated institutions before it can be counted in borrower asset calculations. Until earlier this year, regulations such as the SEC’s now-repealed SAB 121 effectively discouraged mainstream financial institutions from accepting crypto assets as loan collateral. The removal of these accounting restrictions has opened new opportunities for digital assets to be recognised in underwriting frameworks, potentially allowing borrowers to leverage their Bitcoin holdings without liquidating them. Saylor’s intervention adds technical depth to this policy conversation by introducing a credit model tailored specifically to the characteristics of Bitcoin as collateral. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin’s volatility, liquidity, and non-sovereign nature require distinct methods for calculating loan-to-value ratios, duration-based risk spreads, and margin thresholds. His firm’s model aims to quantify these variables to support safer, over-collateralised lending structures that could be integrated into existing mortgage products. Should regulators adopt or adapt such a framework, it could mark a significant step toward the mainstreaming of crypto-backed mortgages through established institutions, rather than niche providers. This exchange also arrives amid growing public interest in alternative financing models, especially among younger Americans who hold a disproportionate share of their net worth in digital assets . A shift in policy from institutions like the FHFA could legitimise the use of Bitcoin as a form of wealth in housing finance, potentially improving access to homeownership for crypto-native households. Whether this signals a broader alignment between crypto innovation and US housing policy remains to be seen, but the dialogue between Saylor and Pulte suggests that such discussions are no longer merely theoretical, they are now taking place at the highest levels of US housing finance governance. What is a Bitcoin-Backed Mortgage and How Does it Work? A Bitcoin mortgage is a type of loan where Bitcoin (BTC) is used as collateral instead of, or in addition to, a traditional cash down payment. In this structure, a borrower pledges a specified amount of Bitcoin to a lender, which holds it in escrow for the duration of the mortgage. The borrower then receives fiat currency (e.g. USD) to purchase property, and makes monthly repayments similar to a conventional mortgage. These arrangements are usually over-collateralised , meaning the value of the pledged Bitcoin exceeds the value of the loan, to protect the lender from price volatility, a dynamic which grew out of DeFi lending. If the value of Bitcoin falls below a certain threshold, the borrower may be required to add more collateral or risk liquidation of their BTC to cover the outstanding balance. Compared to standard mortgages, Bitcoin-backed mortgages offer a different risk-reward profile. Traditional home loans are based on credit history, income documentation, and a fiat down payment, typically between 10% and 20% of the home’s value. Bitcoin mortgages, by contrast, may appeal to borrowers who are asset-rich in crypto but either unwilling or unable to liquidate their holdings. These products can circumvent some of the documentation hurdles in traditional underwriting but introduce new risks around asset volatility. In addition, while specialised lenders offer these products, most traditional banks still do not accept Bitcoin as a valid asset for mortgage qualification due to regulatory and balance sheet constraints, though this may change if agencies like the FHFA broaden asset recognition standards. Bitcoin-native features like multisignature (multisig) wallets and timelocks offer enhanced security and trust minimisation in lending arrangements. Multisig ensures that funds can only be spent when a predefined number of parties approve the transaction, reducing counterparty risk, while timelocks allow transactions to be locked until a specific time or block height, enabling automated loan expiry or repayment conditions without requiring intermediaries. Interest rates for Bitcoin mortgages can be competitive, but they often vary widely depending on the lender, collateral coverage, and market conditions. Rates may be lower than unsecured crypto loans, but not always on par with the most favourable conventional mortgage rates, particularly from government-backed lenders. In some cases, lenders may offer flexible terms to attract borrowers who wish to retain exposure to BTC’s long-term appreciation while accessing liquidity. However, borrowers face additional costs such as custodial and escrow fees, and the risk of margin calls during market downturns, which can erode any rate advantages. Until Bitcoin becomes an approved asset within traditional institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, rates are unlikely to standardise across the broader lending market. Bitcoin’s deflationary economic model, driven by its fixed 21 million coin supply and halving cycles every four years, introduces a unique dynamic into mortgage lending. Theoretically, as new supply is cut in half and issuance slows, the scarcity of Bitcoin could increase its value over time. This has historically incentivised long-term holding (HODLing), making Bitcoin an attractive reserve asset for some. In the context of a mortgage, this means borrowers might be reluctant to pledge Bitcoin as collateral, fearing opportunity cost if the price rises dramatically. At the same time, lenders may be wary of sharp declines that could compromise collateral value. The success of Bitcoin mortgages in the long term will depend on how lenders and regulators manage this volatility, and whether Bitcoin’s deflationary model is seen as a stable enough basis to underpin large, long-duration financial products like home loans. Is Saylor Too Optimistic or Will the Lending Industry Embrace Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s framing of Bitcoin as a digital asset rather than a form of digital cash has defined his entire investment philosophy, guiding both Strategy’s corporate strategy and his broader public advocacy. By treating Bitcoin not as a medium of exchange but as a pristine, long-duration store of value, Saylor has dismissed spending or transacting with BTC in favour of accumulating and holding it indefinitely. However, this conviction has naturally led him to explore mechanisms by which Bitcoin can generate yield, a pursuit that sits uneasily with the asset’s trust-minimised design and P2P principles. His recent interest in Bitcoin-backed credit models, such as mortgages, reflects a desire to monetise Bitcoin without selling it. Yet this approach enters murky territory, especially considering the high-profile collapses of past retail-focused crypto lending platforms that offered similar promises. The failures of firms like Celsius , Voyager , and BlockFi highlight the inherent risks of attempting to extract yield from volatile digital assets in poorly regulated environments. These companies offered attractive returns to depositors while engaging in opaque, leveraged, and often mismatched lending practices. When prices collapsed, so did their balance sheets, leaving users with frozen accounts and mounting losses. Saylor’s version of yield, rooted in secured, over-collateralised lending against Bitcoin rather than uncollateralised or rehypothecated deposits, may seem more conservative in comparison. But the underlying tension remains in the fact that Bitcoin is not a risk-free yield-generating instrument, and introducing debt-based products around it inevitably reintroduces credit risk, counterparty risk, and systemic fragility into a space that was, in theory, designed to eliminate them. If federal regulators such as the FHFA ultimately approve the use of Bitcoin as qualifying collateral for mortgages, the traditional lending industry could be forced to adapt to a new class of asset and borrower. Banks and government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would need to develop protocols for valuing, securing, and managing digital collateral in compliance with capital requirements and consumer protection rules. This could bring new revenue streams, borrower demographics, and innovation to the mortgage sector, particularly among younger, crypto-native households who are currently underbanked by traditional standards but overexposed to digital assets. It would also likely prompt standardisation efforts, including regulatory guidance on custody, valuation methodologies, and margin maintenance. If the federal government, through agencies like the FHFA, establishes a clear and favourable regulatory framework for Bitcoin-backed mortgages, it is likely that major players in the banking industry would follow suit, albeit cautiously. Traditional financial institutions are generally risk-averse and heavily regulated, but they also have a long history of adapting to government-backed policy shifts, especially when accompanied by guarantees or securitisation mechanisms such as those offered by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. A green light from federal authorities would reduce legal ambiguity and provide the compliance infrastructure necessary for banks to safely evaluate, custody, and lend against Bitcoin collateral. While some conservative institutions may remain hesitant due to volatility concerns or reputational risk, others, especially fintech-forward banks or those already exploring digital asset custody, could view this as a competitive opportunity to tap into a growing demographic of crypto-native borrowers and expand their lending portfolios in a high-margin, underserved market. In an optimistic scenario, if Bitcoin-backed mortgages gain traction and prove resilient, the lending industry could see a wave of hybrid financial products that merge traditional underwriting with decentralised asset classes. Lenders might offer tiered products with dynamic loan-to-value ratios based on Bitcoin volatility metrics, or integrate stablecoins and BTC together for risk balancing. Over time, the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a financial asset class could be solidified, potentially leading to secondary markets for tokenised mortgage debt or new layers of credit infrastructure. But this vision hinges on whether institutional actors can manage the volatility and cultural idiosyncrasies of Bitcoin responsibly, without repeating the speculative overreach that doomed previous lending experiments in the crypto space.

2025-06-27T14:06:45,"BitFuFu: Punished For A Bad Quarter, Poised For A Powerful Re-Rating","Summary The market has unfairly punished BitFuFu for a dismal Q1, but a closer look reveals the operational challenges that caused the slump were temporary. Recent operational data from April and May confirms a powerful turnaround is already underway, showcasing an exponential rebound in hashrate and a sharp recovery in Bitcoin production. BitFuFu trades at a glaring valuation disconnect from its U.S. peers, with the market assigning a value to its hashrate that is a mere fraction of the industry average. This significant market misunderstanding has created a compelling arbitrage opportunity, leaving room for a substantial valuation re-rating as the company heads into its Q2 earnings report. Just over a month ago, I claimed that BitFuFu Inc. ( FUFU ), a Singapore-based crypto miner, was well on track for strong operating income growth in 2026. FUFU stock has lost almost 20% since then after the company reported lackluster earnings for the first quarter, characterized by a 46% YoY decline in revenue, primarily attributable to the bitcoin halving event in April last year. All else equal, bitcoin halving negatively impacts miner revenue, which is something crypto investors are well aware of now. After going through BitFuFu's April and May performance data, I am confident that the company is among the few crypto miners that are operationally ready to thrive amid increasing mining difficulty. As such, I find BitFuFu's market valuation materially disconnected from its economic value at a time when it's valued at a substantial discount to its closest peers, presenting an arbitrage opportunity for investors. BitFuFu's Challenging First Quarter The fourth bitcoin halving in April 2024 has materially impacted the comparable revenue growth of crypto miners of every scale and size. BitFuFu's Q1 revenue declined from $144.4 million a year ago to just $78 million, showcasing this massive impact. Not only has BitFuFu felt the impact, but larger players like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) also reported substantial net losses in Q1. MARA's net loss in Q1 totaled $533.4 million, and RIOT reported a net loss of $296.4 million. BitFuFu, on the other hand, reported a net loss of $16.9 million. However, bitcoin halving is not the only factor that has impacted revenue negatively. While peers such as MARA and RIOT mitigated the bitcoin halving impact through substantial operational expansions that led to robust hashrate growth, BitFuFu suffered a temporary decline in the hashrate under management as well (hashrate dropped 28% YoY to 20.6 EH/s from 28.6 EH/s). This paved the way for a truly lackluster Q1 performance. In its Q1 earnings release, BitFuFu reported that this temporary decline in the hashrate came on the back of the expiration of some hashrate purchase orders and miner relocation. While BitFuFu's peers made the most of surging bitcoin prices, the company was not in a position to capitalize on this price increase as self-mined bitcoin production declined staggeringly from 1,103 in Q1 2024 to just 186 in Q1 2025. Exhibit 1: BitFuFu's Q1 Performance Metrics Q1 Earnings Release The below table summarizes how BitFuFu fell behind its closest peers in the first quarter. Company Q1 2025 YoY revenue growth Q1 2025 hashrate growth Q1 2025 YoY BTC production change Comments BitFuFu -46% -28% -83% (self-mining) Revenue was impacted by bitcoin halving and a substantial yet temporary drop in hashrate. Riot Platforms 100% 172% 12.2% Substantial hashrate growth helped Riot overcome the halving impact. Mara Holdings 30% 95% -19% Hashrate growth helped mitigate the halving impact, but revenue growth mostly came from higher BTC prices. Source: Company Filings At first glance, you might feel BitFuFu is losing ground. However, as I reveal in the next segments of this analysis, FUFU stock has been punished for a temporary deterioration in its financial performance. This market misunderstanding is exactly what sets the stage for an arbitrage opportunity. April/May Data Confirms BitFuFu's Rebound As we inch toward the end of the second quarter, we already have access to BitFuFu's April and May performance data that confirms, without a shred of doubt, that the company has well and truly recovered from the challenges faced in Q1. Encouragingly, the rebound is across all key operational metrics, which confirms that BitFuFu is headed in the right direction. The most direct, meaningful evidence of this recovery comes in the form of a significant improvement in the hashrate under management. From just 20.6 EH/s at the end of Q1, hashrate grew 37% MoM to 28.3 EH/s in April, followed by another strong 21% MoM increase to 34.1 EH/s in May. Based on these numbers, within just two months from the end of the disappointing first quarter, BitFuFu's hashrate under management has grown exponentially to surpass Riot Platform's Q1 deployed hashrate of 33.7 EH/s. Along with the hashrate under management, bitcoin production has also rebounded sharply after a sluggish Q1. In Q1, the company produced a total of just 723 BTC (186 BTC from self-mining and 537 BTC from the cloud-mining segment). In April, BitFuFu mined a total of 209 BTC , followed by 400 BTC mined in May , bringing the total BTC production to 609 in the first two months of the quarter. Based on these numbers, BitFuFu seems well on track to produce a meaningfully higher number of BTC in the second quarter, assuming this trend remains strong. The strong performance in May was driven by the contribution from the hashrate purchased in late April, and a similar feat could be expected in June as the company purchased additional hashrate in late May as well. Importantly, the average daily BTC production increased from 7 in April to 12.9 in May, suggesting that the robust increase in hashrate is already contributing positively. BitFuFu's strong growth in April and May corresponded to a robust increase in the power infrastructure as well, which gives me confidence that the observed hashrate growth is well-supported from a power requirement perspective. At the end of Q1, the company had a power capacity of 478 MW, a notable decline from 644 MW of power capacity as of Q1 2024. Since then, however, the trend has turned positive, with power capacity growing 18% MoM in April to 566 MW, followed by another 15% MoM increase in May to 651 MW. This continued increase in power capacity highlights the progress in BitFuFu's strategic plan to reach 1 GW of power capacity by 2026. Exhibit 2: BitFuFu's Power Capacity June Presentation Taking a closer look at BitFuFu's strategic BTC holdings, which form the backbone of its treasury strategy, reveals that the management is following the best course of action to drive shareholder returns higher. After seeing an increase in BTC holdings from 1,835 in March to 1,908 in April, the company sold 178 BTC at an average price of $104,000 in May to capitalize on the recent run-up in bitcoin prices. At the end of May, BitFuFu held 1,709 BTC. BitFuFu's performance in April and May, in my opinion, foreshadows how the company could grow profitably in the post-bitcoin halving environment by focusing on operational efficiency and access to low-cost power. These two variables will play a key role in determining the profitability of every bitcoin miner in the long run, and I am confident that BitFuFu is headed in the right direction on this front. The Valuation Disparity Highlights The Opportunity For A Re-Rating BitFuFu is significantly undervalued from a comparable valuation perspective. I believe this undervaluation primarily stems from the company's unique business model, as it generates the bulk of its revenue from cloud-mining services. This unique business model also involves securing a major portion of its total hashrate from third-party suppliers. In comparison, stock market darlings such as Riot Platforms, Mara Holdings, and CleanSpark have a more straightforward business model where they have positioned themselves as bitcoin miners. This business model differentiation may have contributed to the market seeing BitFuFu as a riskier business compared to its peers. Another factor that may have contributed to the comparable undervaluation is BitFuFu's Singapore origins. All of the competitors I discussed above are headquartered in the U.S., which naturally boosts their investment appeal. BitFuFu's smaller scale from a BTC ownership perspective compared to its peers may have also played a part in this relatively cheap valuation. As of May 31, FUFU held 1,709 BTC compared to 19,225 for Riot, 49,179 for Mara, and 12,502 for CleanSpark according to the most recent data. While this smaller scale may spook some investors, in reality, this should not be a dealbreaker, given that BitFuFu is executing its strategy well. To realistically estimate BitFuFu's intrinsic value, I thought it's best to use a Market Cap/Hashrate comparison of its American peers and then apply a valuation discount to reflect the factors discussed above. Before that, let's see how BitFuFu compares with its peers across a few important metrics. Metric FUFU RIOT MARA CLSK Peer Average Stock price $3.17 $10 $14.98 $10.6 - Market capitalization $535 million $3.58 billion $5.24 billion $2.82 billion - TTM revenue $397 million $459 million $705 million $537 million P/S multiple 1.35x 6.41x 6.57x 4.88x 5.95x Hashrate 34.1 EH/s 35.4 EH/s 58.3 EH/s 45.6 EH/s Market cap/hashrate $15.68 million/EH $101.13 million/EH $89.87 million/EH $61.64 million/EH $84.21 million/EH Note: Stock Price Data as of June 26. Looking at this table, FUFU's disconnect from the peer group is evident. At a P/E multiple of 1.35x, FUFU is significantly undervalued compared to the peer average of almost 6x. The undervaluation is even more evident by the fact that the market is attaching a value of $15.68 million per EH for BitFuFu whereas the peer average is over $80 million. Given the limitations that I discussed earlier, I believe a 30% discount to the peer average is warranted, which gives us a target fair value of $58.95 million/EH. Based on BitFuFu's current hashrate of 34.1 EH/s, the implied market cap comes to $2.01 billion. Based on 163.2 million shares outstanding, the per-share intrinsic value estimate comes to $12.32, which implies an upside potential of almost 300%. Even after applying a valuation discount to account for company-specific limitations facing BitFuFu, the company seems substantially undervalued in the market, which makes FUFU stock an attractive bet for investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin. Takeaway BitFuFu, after a disappointing Q1 performance, is attractively valued in the market compared to other publicly traded bitcoin miners. The short-term challenges that led to this lackluster Q1 performance seem to have passed, and the company has shown resilience in the first two months of the second quarter. The market seems to have misunderstood the growth potential of BitFuFu, leaving room for a valuation re-rating once the Q2 earnings report is out. Key risks to monitor include the company's reliance on third-party hashrate providers, execution risks facing vertical integration efforts involving data centers, and the revenue volatility arising from its reliance on cloud mining.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797765-bitfufu-punished-bad-quarter-poised-powerful-re-rating?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","FUFU",cryptocompare

The S&P 500 rose 0.3% at the open, surpassing its previous all-time high, with the benchmark index hitting 6,156.80. Previously, on February 19, 2025, the S&P 500 touched an intraday high of 6,147.43. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 300 points higher at open, while the Nasdaq Composite opened 0.5% up, looking to end the week on a positive note. This stock market rally comes amid investor focus on the release of new data showing core inflation rose slightly in May. The personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Federal Reserve’s primary inflation gauge, increased to a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for May. This puts the annual U.S. inflation rate at 2.3%. The core PCE inflation reading, which excludes food and energy, stood at 0.2% for the month and 2.7% year-over-year, slightly above economists’ estimates of 0.1% and 2.6%, respectively.

2025-06-27T14:02:04,"Bitcoin Price Prediction – Why Traders Are Watching the Next 48 Hours Like Hawks","Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded sharply, climbing 7% this week after dipping to $98,200. At the time of writing, BTC trades around $106,900, just below the $108,250 resistance, which marks the upper boundary of a descending trendline that’s capped price action since June highs. Technical momentum is cooling, and the next 48 hours could decide whether Bitcoin breaks higher or reverts back toward key support levels. Short-term technicals show a potential reversal brewing. The 2-hour chart displays a rising wedge pattern, with BTC printing a lower high near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $106,237. A break below the 50-period EMA ($106,249) could open a move toward $104,991 and $103,984—marking the 0.382 and 0.5 retracement zones. Key resistance: $108,250 and $110,000 Support to watch: $106,250, then $104,900 RSI: Neutral at 56 MACD: Weakening bullish histogram Traders looking for long exposure may wait for a confirmed breakout above $108,250. Bears, on the other hand, could consider short setups below $106,200, with a downside target near $104,000. Geopolitics, Fed Signals Fuel Rally Bitcoin’s latest move is macro driven. A Middle East ceasefire has calmed the nerves of the market and capital is flowing back into risk assets. Bitcoin reclaimed its 50 day simple moving average (SMA) around $106,000 mid week and buyers are defending that zone. The softer geopolitical climate has given BTC the stability to retest $107,000. Meanwhile the US Federal Reserve has toned down its language on crypto banking so less regulatory pressure ahead. Traders took that as a green light and are reinforcing Bitcoin’s recent strength. Institutional demand is still strong. ETFs have seen net inflows for 13 days in a row and $1.71 billion this week which is the most since May. Major corporate holders like Metaplanet and ProCap have accumulated over 7,500 BTC in the same period. This is institutional conviction despite retail is still sleeping. Can Bitcoin Clear $112K and Aim Higher? Technical resistance between $108,000 and $110,000 remains the key barrier. Analysts say a close above $109,000 with increased volume could push BTC to $112,000 and beyond. Beyond that, potential targets include $120,000 and even $165,000, driven by spot ETF demand and macro tailwinds. He's right! Bitcoin won't ever go above $112k again because: The US is getting their spending under control and the federal reserve will permanently stop printing money. https://t.co/jvslq1lrDD — Vijay Kailash, CFA, CFP® (@realvijayk) June 26, 2025 But upside isn’t guaranteed. A failure to clear $108,250 may trigger a short-term pullback. Volume is still low, and on-chain activity has declined—transfer volume is down 32% to $52 billion, while spot trading remains muted around $7.7 billion. If the price breaks below $106,249, the path to $104,000–$105,000 opens. These zones may act as accumulation points for bulls. Bottom line: The next 48 hours are pivotal. A confirmed breakout above $108K could ignite a fresh rally. A rejection may spell consolidation—or correction—before the next leg higher. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.6M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1 million mark in its public presale, raising $1,673,470 out of a $1,904,052 million target.

2025-06-27T14:00:01,"Ethereum Price: Will ETH Soar Beyond $2.4K? A Crucial Market Analysis","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Will ETH Soar Beyond $2.4K? A Crucial Market Analysis Are you watching the charts, wondering what’s next for Ethereum price ? The crypto community is buzzing with anticipation as leading analysts point to a critical juncture for the second-largest cryptocurrency. With ETH holding above a key support level, the stage might be set for a significant move. Let’s dive into the signals and expert opinions shaping Ethereum’s immediate future. Understanding the Current Ethereum Price Dynamics The cryptocurrency market is a landscape of constant flux, but certain indicators offer clearer pathways. For Ethereum price , the $2,400 level has emerged as a focal point. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, as cited by Cointelegraph, suggests that if Ethereum successfully maintains its position above this crucial support, further gains could be on the horizon in the weeks ahead. This sentiment is echoed by other market observers, who see growing signs of a potential shift. Crypto Fella, a prominent market watcher, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to express a similar conviction: “It’s almost time for the long-expected reversal.” This indicates a broader belief among analysts that Ethereum might be poised to break free from recent consolidation or downward pressure, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The ability of ETH to hold this support level is not just a number; it’s a psychological and technical battleground for traders and investors alike. Diving Deep into ETH Analysis: The $2.4K Support When we talk about ETH analysis , support levels are fundamental. A support level is a price point where buying interest is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. For Ethereum, the $2,400 mark has acted as a significant area of confluence, where previous resistance might have turned into new support. If buyers step in consistently at or above this level, it reinforces the foundation for an upward trajectory. Conversely, a decisive break below $2,400 could signal weakness and potentially lead to further downside, triggering stop-losses and increasing selling pressure. This makes monitoring this level paramount for anyone interested in Ethereum’s short-to-medium term performance. It’s not just about hitting a number; it’s about sustained price action above it, indicating strong conviction from market participants. Decoding Crypto Market Trends: The ETH/BTC Ratio Explained Beyond its USD pairing, understanding Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC) is vital for grasping broader crypto market trends . The ETH/BTC ratio serves as a key barometer for altcoin strength. When this ratio rises, it often signals an ‘altcoin season’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Conversely, a declining ratio suggests Bitcoin dominance, with altcoins underperforming. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio stands at 0.02275, having experienced a 6.84% decline over the past month, according to TradingView. This recent dip indicates that Ethereum has been losing ground against Bitcoin. However, for those anticipating an ‘altcoin rally,’ a reversal in this ratio is a crucial precursor. Analysts are closely watching for signs that Ethereum can regain strength against Bitcoin, which would signify a broader shift in market sentiment towards altcoins. Key Insights from Technical Analysis: Signals to Watch Beyond simple support levels, comprehensive technical analysis involves scrutinizing various indicators to identify potential trend reversals and confirm momentum. Traders often look at: Volume: An increase in trading volume as price holds support or breaks resistance adds conviction to the move. Moving Averages: Crossovers or price interactions with key moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) can signal trend strength or weakness. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator can indicate if an asset is overbought or oversold, potentially signaling a reversal point. Chart Patterns: Formations like inverse head and shoulders, double bottoms, or bullish divergences on indicators can suggest an impending uptrend. For Ethereum, the ‘long-expected reversal’ mentioned by Crypto Fella would likely be confirmed by a combination of these factors aligning, indicating a robust shift in market dynamics rather than just a temporary bounce. Actionable insight here is to combine these signals rather than relying on just one. Is an Altcoin Rally on the Horizon for Ethereum? The potential for an altcoin rally is a recurring theme in cryptocurrency markets, often following periods of Bitcoin dominance. Ethereum, being the largest altcoin by market capitalization, typically leads such rallies. Several factors beyond technicals could fuel such a surge: Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments and successful implementation of upgrades (like the Dencun upgrade earlier this year, or future advancements) can enhance Ethereum’s scalability, security, and efficiency, attracting more users and developers. DeFi and NFT Growth: Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems. Renewed interest or innovation in these sectors directly benefits ETH. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional interest, potentially including spot Ethereum ETFs in the future, could bring significant capital inflows. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish turn in the wider crypto market, often initiated by Bitcoin’s performance, typically pulls altcoins higher. While the signs are promising, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties, macroeconomic headwinds, or a sudden downturn in Bitcoin’s price could dampen enthusiasm. However, if the $2,400 support holds and the ETH/BTC ratio shows signs of reversal, Ethereum could indeed lead the charge in the next significant altcoin rally. Conclusion: Ethereum at a Crossroads Ethereum finds itself at a pivotal moment. The consensus among analysts points to the $2,400 support level as a crucial determinant for its near-term trajectory. Should this level hold firm, combined with a potential reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio and other positive technical indicators, the stage is set for Ethereum to eye further substantial gains. As always, the crypto market remains dynamic, but the current signals provide a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s potential ascent. Keeping a close eye on these key levels and broader market sentiment will be essential for navigating what could be an exciting period for ETH holders.

2025-06-27T13:53:31,"Bakkt Files $1Bn Shelf Offering, Considers Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves","Bakkt Holdings has filed for a $1 billion shelf offering with the SEC, indicating plans to acquire Bitcoin as part of its expanded treasury strategy. Bakkt Moves Toward Direct Bitcoin Investment Publicly traded digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings has filed a $1 billion shelf registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a pivotal step in its strategic pivot toward cryptocurrency treasury allocations. The filing, submitted on June 26, 2025, grants Bakkt the authority to sell a range of securities, including Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt instruments, and warrants in one or more future offerings. This development follows a policy revision earlier this month, enabling Bakkt to invest directly in Bitcoin and other digital assets. While the company has not disclosed any purchases yet, the filing confirms it could use proceeds from this shelf offering to fund crypto acquisitions. In its prospectus, the company stated, “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources.” Strategic Pivot and Business Headwinds A subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt has navigated a challenging year. In March 2025, the company announced it was losing major clients, Bank of America and Webull, triggering a 30% decline in its share price. Further complicating matters, Bakkt disclosed in the filing that its loyalty services segment faces possible divestiture as it sharpens its focus on crypto infrastructure offerings. Bakkt’s revised investment policy is part of a broader repositioning. Co-CEO Akshay Naheta described the plan as a move to “transform Bakkt into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company.” The strategy also includes partnerships, such as a March agreement with Distributed Technologies Research Global Ltd. to enhance crypto payment-processing capabilities. Regulatory Risks and Market Positioning The SEC filing outlines extensive risk factors, with regulatory uncertainty remaining a significant concern. Bakkt warned that evolving legal frameworks, potential classification of digital assets as securities, and disruptions to banking services could materially affect operations. The company also flagged cybersecurity threats and operational complexities in integrating new digital assets. If Bakkt proceeds with a Bitcoin allocation, it would join an expanding list of public firms adding crypto to their balance sheets. At Bitcoin’s current price of $106,800, a full $1 billion investment would secure approximately 9,364 BTC, positioning Bakkt just ahead of Coinbase on the list of top publicly traded Bitcoin holders. Following news of the shelf offering, Bakkt’s Class A shares (NYSE: BKKT) rose 3% to $13.33 on Thursday. However, the stock remains down 46% year-to-date.

2025-06-27T13:50:53,"Belgravia Hartford Propels Strategic Bitcoin Investment with Second $1M Drawdown","BitcoinWorld Belgravia Hartford Propels Strategic Bitcoin Investment with Second $1M Drawdown The world of digital assets continues to attract significant institutional interest, and a recent move by Belgravia Hartford Capital underscores this growing trend. This publicly traded Canadian investment firm has just announced a pivotal step in its strategic foray into the cryptocurrency market: the completion of a second $1 million drawdown specifically earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin. Belgravia Hartford’s Bold Move: A Deeper Dive into Institutional Bitcoin Investment Belgravia Hartford Capital, a name increasingly recognized in the Canadian investment landscape, is making headlines once again with its proactive approach to digital asset integration. Their latest announcement details the completion of a second $1 million drawdown, a clear signal of their ongoing commitment to the Bitcoin market. This isn’t just a one-off purchase; it’s part of a larger, carefully planned strategy to build a substantial Bitcoin portfolio. The funds for this significant Bitcoin investment are sourced from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund, a specialized vehicle designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto space. The firm’s decision to allocate such substantial capital towards Bitcoin highlights a growing confidence among traditional investment entities in the long-term viability and value proposition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic move by Belgravia Hartford is indicative of a broader shift, where established players are no longer just observing the crypto market but actively participating and shaping its future. Their methodical approach, utilizing regulated channels like Coinsquare’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, further solidifies the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto ecosystem. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Work? Understanding the Mechanics For those new to institutional crypto investments, understanding the mechanics behind Belgravia Hartford’s strategy is key. This latest $1 million drawdown is not a direct purchase from an open exchange but rather a structured financing agreement. Here’s a breakdown of how this particular Bitcoin investment is executed: The Source Fund: The capital originates from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund. This fund likely pools money from various investors, including Belgravia Hartford, and specializes in digital asset strategies. The Drawdown Mechanism: A “drawdown” in this context refers to Belgravia Hartford accessing a pre-arranged line of credit or capital commitment from the Round13 fund. This particular drawdown is the second of its kind, part of a larger $5 million financing agreement. Purpose-Specific Funds: Crucially, these funds are explicitly designated for one purpose: to buy Bitcoin. This specificity ensures transparency and adherence to the investment firm’s stated digital asset strategy. Regulated Trading Desk: The actual acquisition of Bitcoin is conducted through Coinsquare’s regulated over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. OTC desks are preferred by institutions for large volume trades as they minimize market impact and offer better pricing, often without revealing the trade size publicly. Coinsquare’s status as a regulated entity adds an extra layer of security and compliance, which is paramount for a publicly traded firm like Belgravia Hartford. Financing Terms: The financing agreement comes with a variable interest rate, which is tied to the Bank of Canada’s prime rate. This detail indicates a sophisticated financial arrangement, typical of institutional lending and borrowing, designed to manage costs effectively. This structured approach allows Belgravia Hartford to systematically accumulate Bitcoin while managing their capital exposure and leveraging established financial partnerships. It’s a testament to the increasing sophistication of how traditional finance is integrating with the digital asset space. The Significance of the Round13 Digital Asset Fund Partnership The collaboration with the Round13 Digital Asset Fund is a cornerstone of Belgravia Hartford’s strategy. This partnership is more than just a source of capital; it represents a strategic alignment with a specialized fund that understands the nuances of the cryptocurrency market. Why is this significant? Expertise and Access: Round13 Digital Asset Fund likely possesses deep expertise in crypto markets, including research, risk management, and access to unique investment opportunities that might not be readily available to traditional firms. Streamlined Acquisition: By partnering with a fund focused on digital assets, Belgravia Hartford can streamline its acquisition process, relying on Round13’s infrastructure and market connections. Risk Management: A specialized fund can offer sophisticated risk management strategies tailored for volatile crypto assets, potentially mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with direct market exposure. Scalability: The $5 million financing agreement suggests a long-term plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation. The fund provides a scalable mechanism for Belgravia Hartford to increase its crypto holdings over time without immediate large capital outlays from its primary balance sheet. This type of partnership underscores a growing trend where traditional financial institutions are leveraging the expertise of crypto-native funds to gain exposure to digital assets, rather than building the entire infrastructure in-house. It reflects a maturing market where collaboration is key to navigating the evolving landscape. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Belgravia Hartford’s continued commitment to Bitcoin through structured drawdowns sends a strong message about the future of institutional crypto adoption. Their actions are not isolated but fit into a broader narrative of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Here are some key implications: Validation and Legitimacy: When publicly traded firms like Belgravia Hartford allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends further credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It signals to other traditional investors that cryptocurrencies are becoming a serious component of diversified portfolios. Market Maturation: The use of regulated OTC desks and structured financing agreements, as seen with this crypto drawdown , points to the maturation of the market infrastructure. This makes it easier and safer for large institutions to participate. Diversification Strategy: For many institutional investors, Bitcoin and other digital assets represent a new frontier for diversification. They offer a potential hedge against inflation, a non-correlated asset, and exposure to a rapidly evolving technological paradigm. Belgravia Hartford’s move exemplifies this diversification play. Precedent Setting: Each major institutional entry or increased allocation sets a precedent, potentially encouraging other firms that have been on the sidelines to reconsider their stance. The domino effect of institutional crypto adoption could accelerate significantly in the coming years. The growing comfort level of these firms with the inherent volatility of crypto, coupled with their focus on long-term strategic accumulation, indicates a fundamental shift in how digital assets are perceived within the global financial system. This institutional embrace is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the crypto market. Analyzing the Impact of this Crypto Drawdown on Market Sentiment Every significant institutional move, like Belgravia Hartford’s latest crypto drawdown , can influence market sentiment. While a single $1 million purchase might seem small in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization, its symbolic weight is considerable. What impact might this have? Positive Signal: The consistent buying pressure from institutional entities provides a positive signal to retail and other institutional investors. It suggests that “smart money” continues to see value in Bitcoin, even amidst market fluctuations. Supply Dynamics: While OTC trades don’t directly impact spot exchange prices in the same way retail trades do, they represent Bitcoin being taken off the open market and held by long-term investors. This gradual reduction in liquid supply can contribute to price appreciation over time. Increased Confidence: News of institutional accumulation often boosts overall confidence in the market, potentially attracting more capital inflows. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is an asset for the future, not just a speculative fad. Regulatory Comfort: The emphasis on regulated platforms like Coinsquare also helps to assuage concerns about regulatory uncertainty. Institutions opting for compliant channels sends a message that the industry is professionalizing. This ongoing accumulation by firms like Belgravia Hartford is a quiet but powerful force, slowly but surely absorbing Bitcoin supply and embedding it deeper into the traditional financial fabric. It’s a key indicator of Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized and accepted store of value and investment asset. Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights for Investors Belgravia Hartford’s strategy offers valuable lessons for all types of investors interested in the digital asset space. Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Investment: Diversification: Bitcoin can offer portfolio diversification due to its relatively low correlation with traditional assets. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Early Mover Advantage (for traditional finance): Firms entering now are positioning themselves to capitalize on the long-term growth of the digital economy. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant swings, posing risks for short-term investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can introduce unpredictability. Security Risks: While institutional platforms are robust, the digital nature of assets means security remains a paramount concern. Market Manipulation: Despite growing maturity, the crypto market can still be susceptible to large movements based on news or whale activity. Actionable Insights for Retail Investors: While most retail investors don’t have access to multi-million dollar drawdowns from digital asset funds, Belgravia Hartford’s approach provides valuable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors often adopt a long-term “hodling” strategy. This suggests that daily price fluctuations are less important than the asset’s long-term value proposition. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): The repeated $1 million drawdowns mimic a form of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy where one invests a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak. Importance of Regulated Platforms: Belgravia Hartford uses Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk. For retail investors, this translates to choosing reputable, regulated exchanges that prioritize security and compliance. Diversification within Crypto: While Belgravia Hartford is focusing on Bitcoin, a broader crypto portfolio might include other strong projects for retail investors, though Bitcoin remains the institutional favorite. Conclusion: Belgravia Hartford’s Strategic Play Reinforces Bitcoin’s Institutional Trajectory Belgravia Hartford Capital’s latest $1 million crypto drawdown to acquire Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s evolving role in institutional portfolios. This strategic move, facilitated by the Round13 Digital Asset Fund and executed through Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk, highlights a calculated and confident approach to digital asset integration. As traditional investment firms increasingly recognize the long-term value and diversification benefits of cryptocurrencies, actions like these pave the way for broader institutional crypto adoption. It signifies a future where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but a core component of sophisticated financial strategies. The steady accumulation by entities like Belgravia Hartford quietly reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a robust and legitimate asset, signaling a continued bullish outlook for its institutional trajectory.

The relisting is complementary to the company’s overall Bitcoin-driven strategy. The firm confirmed that, as of a September issue date, more than 10 million of its common stock—listed on the ticker “BTCT”—are issued and outstanding, already sold in the recent brokered offering. The $92 million gross proceeds resulted from a raise of 125 million Canadian dollars, in which BTCT sold 426,650 shares at CA$10 ($7.32) each. The shares have a four-month and one-day holding period. BTCT Buys 292.8 BTC to Power Institutional Lending Initiative BTCT has put some of the raise to use buying 292.8 BTC for around $31.5 million. It is BTCT’s first meaningful Bitcoin buy under its new lending and accumulation initiative. For BTCT, the Bitcoin will be used to offer liquidity services to clients, so it is not just an asset, but a lending and capital optimization tool. The firm will release a “Bitcoin per share” figure after acquisition period, so that shareholders will be able to get more clarity on the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Long-Term Holders Push BTC Supply to Record Levels BTCT’s strategy is part of an overall movement in the crypto space, with long-term holders not even considering selling despite recent price spikes. CryptoQuant data indicates there has been a 800,000 BTC 30-day record accumulation in wallets that have not sold since at least six months ago. CryptoQuant’s analyst Darkfost points out this as a “key signal” for sentiment, as it shows major holders are still bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value despite institutional investors such as BTCT engaging actively in the market.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-treasury-corporation-relist-venture-exchange/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|Sticky|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T13:49:46,"From $98K to $108K Amid Major Geopolitical Turmoil, Bitcoin’s Doing Pretty Well: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","The past week was a wild one at the cryptocurrency market but that’s also true for legacy markets as well. This just goes to show that the mounting institutional involvement in crypto is, in part, responsible for the correlation, but that’s a topic for another discussion. Even though Bitcoin is trading almost flat on the weekly chart, the past seven days have been anything but calm. Naturally, most of the volatility had to do with the war between Iran and Israel. Around June 23rd, BTC dropped below $100K for the first time since early May, sending the markets into a state of discomfort and causing over $1 billion worth of liquidated positions. This was caused mostly because of the news that the US had decided to enter the war on the side of Israel and bomb strategic nuclear sites in Iran. The turmoil didn’t stop there, but doomsayers had it all wrong because on the very next day, the situation started de-escalating following what many believed to be a staged retaliation by Iran targeting a US base in Qatar, causing minor damage. Following this situation, US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire and despite the minor tensions, it appears that the conflict is now subdued. Markets reacted positively, with BTC rallying from the sub-$100K region to a high at around $108,000. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $107,000, but the majority of altcoins, as you can see in the heatmap below, took a much more considerable punch. Many of them are down between 4% and 10%, signaling, once again at Bitcoin’s unshakable dominance in the past few months. In other news, one of the more interesting developments came from Chainlink as Mastercard – one of the world’s leading payment processing companies – announced a partnership with the aims of enabling its 3 billion users to seamlessly buy crypto. This is what adoption looks like. Another are that many are monitoring closely is the legal battle between the US SEC and Ripple. A lot of people were expecting the case to officially end this week, but the presiding judge tossed the parties’ motion for indicative ruling, which means that the whole thing will be dragged out, possibly for another few months. It all depends on Ripple now. All in all, the market fared very well in the face of mounting geopolitical turmoil and economic instability, but it’s very interesting to see how things will develop in the weeks to come.

Over the past couple of weeks, market participants have sold about 720,000 BTC, the majority of which was off-loaded by relatively new holders. It’s very impressive that the market was able to absorb this quantity without falling off a cliff. Last Time Bitcoin Did This, the Price Went From $60K to $100K. The LTH/STH ratio is creeping up . This particularly positive on-chain metric has previously been the precursor to massive rallies such as the one from $28K to $60K and from $60K to $100,000.

And many regret not holding a… https://t.co/DHtcauZGFt — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) June 25, 2025 Drawing Parallels from Bitcoin and Ethereum History Xena XRP pointed out that skepticism towards XRP mirrors the same sentiment that once surrounded Bitcoin and Ethereum during their early stages. She reminded readers that when articles predicted Bitcoin reaching $1 million, critics dismissed such projections and insisted on focusing first on hitting $1,000. Today, Bitcoin trades significantly higher, and many who doubted regret not having invested earlier. Xena reflected on her own experience, sharing that she acquired Bitcoin when it was priced between $200 and $600 and Ethereum when it was just $5. At the time, many dismissed the possibility of substantial gains, yet those investments turned out to be highly rewarding. She stated that the same type of dismissive commentary now surrounds XRP, with critics frequently repeating the phrase “let’s cross all-time high first” whenever long-term price projections are discussed. Xena stressed that such thought is common among individuals who believe they have all the necessary information, but in reality, lack the full picture. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Referencing Ripple Connections and Riddles Xena XRP further explained her confidence by pointing to longstanding hints within the XRP ecosystem. She referenced the well-known XRP community figure Bearableguy123, claiming he appears to have an insider-level understanding of Ripple’s plans. She highlighted that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse follows Bearableguy123, and Ripple CTO David Schwartz used to follow him as well before facing criticism for doing so. According to Xena, this consistent engagement over the years suggests that Bearableguy123’s advice to “persevere” should not be ignored. She also brought up the frequently discussed number 589 , a figure often mentioned within the XRP community. Xena questioned why Ripple consistently referenced this number, even though the $589 XRP price prediction by the end of 2018 did not materialize. She suggested that Ripple’s leadership, including Brad Garlinghouse, somewhat knows that the number is significant. Trusting the Founders Over the Critics Xena XRP challenged followers to decide whose opinions carry more weight. She contrasted the views of what she referred to as “X haters” and random skeptics with the statements from Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto and CTO David Schwartz. She referenced Arthur Britto’s well-circulated statement that XRP was designed to reach $10,000, emphasizing that even if such a figure were incorrect by several thousand dollars, the implication is still that XRP could hit a substantially high price point. She concluded her response by encouraging people to choose which side they trust. Whether to align with those who dismiss XRP’s potential or to trust the insights of Ripple’s co-founders and individuals who, according to her, understand the project’s true scope. Xena made it clear that she opted for the latter and expressed no doubt in XRP reaching $10,000 , reinforcing that conviction with both historical examples and perceived insider signals.

2025-06-27T13:47:20,"Stablecoins gain momentum, but retail payment disruption remains distant","Stablecoins — long pitched as a dull, dependable cousin of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — have taken center stage in recent weeks. The asset class pegged to stable currencies like the US dollar, has captured market and political attention as big companies and regulators increasingly enter the fray. Last week, the US Senate advanced legislation that would create a federal framework for stablecoins, marking a milestone for a sector that has long operated in regulatory gray areas. Meanwhile, shares of Circle Internet Group, the issuer of USDC, have soared more than 600% since the company’s June 5 debut on public markets. That surge in interest is being matched by action. Fintech firm Fiserv unveiled its own stablecoin this month, and major retailers Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring their own tokens. If current trends hold, stablecoins’ total market capitalization — now at $260 billion — could nearly double to $500 billion by the end of 2026, according to Seaport Research Partners. Despite the buzz, Wall Street remains cautious about how soon stablecoins will become mainstream in everyday retail payments. Analysts at Bernstein and Evercore ISI say the most viable near-term use cases lie in areas like international money transfers and corporate payrolls. Promise in cross-border payments and payrolls Despite the buzz, Wall Street remains cautious about how soon stablecoins will become mainstream in everyday retail payments. Analysts at Bernstein and Evercore ISI say the most viable near-term use cases lie in areas like international money transfers and corporate payrolls. Cross-border payments, where speed and low fees matter most, are likely to benefit from stablecoin adoption, the analysts argue. Blockchain-based transactions can outpace traditional financial systems in both efficiency and cost, offering businesses a reason to integrate stablecoins into their operations. There’s also interest in using stablecoins to pay workers directly. This could help companies in emerging markets sidestep unreliable banking infrastructure, while employees receive faster access to inflation-resistant funds. Retail payments not quite ready Still, when it comes to paying for everyday items — from e-commerce checkouts to bar tabs — stablecoins face higher hurdles. As Bernstein’s analysts put it, “stablecoins are a solution looking for a problem in retail consumer payments.” In traditional card-based transactions, merchants, not shoppers, absorb the interchange fees. As a result, there’s little incentive for consumers to switch to new payment methods that offer them no immediate benefit. Attempts by companies to push customers toward alternate forms of payment often lead to lower sales conversions and higher churn, the Bernstein team noted. Without clear incentives or seamless integration, stablecoin adoption at the checkout counter is unlikely to gain traction anytime soon. Not yet a threat to card networks Evercore analysts similarly downplayed the immediate impact on established payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, despite Tuesday’s announcement that Fiserv had partnered with Mastercard to support stablecoin transactions. “We think the adoption of stablecoins for domestic payments will take a while as the value prop isn’t strong enough yet,” the Evercore analysts wrote. “And speaking from experience, consumers require a lot of incentives to switch their habits.” Stablecoin expansion continues, but timeline uncertain To be sure, stablecoin innovation is advancing at a rapid clip, with more announcements expected from both crypto-native companies and Fortune 500 firms. But for now, it remains difficult to determine who the long-term winners and losers will be. Analysts acknowledge the potential in stablecoins, but say it does not mean the roadmap to its mass adoption is clear. Whether stablecoins eventually reshape global commerce — or remain a niche utility — may hinge on how seamlessly businesses and consumers adapt to a digital payments future that’s still being written.

The move could redefine how digital marketplaces scale. Bolt Financial Inc., the one-click checkout platform that recently partnered with billionaire Peter Thiel’s data analytics firm Palantir Technologies to deliver AI-enhanced payments, has announced two updates targeting some of the most persistent bottlenecks in online commerce. On June 27, the San Francisco-based firm introduced Bolt Connect, a new integration layer that allows marketplaces to onboard merchants with a single click, alongside native support for stablecoin payments. The dual rollout marks a notable expansion of Bolt’s backend infrastructure offerings, as the company shifts focus from front-end user experience to solving legacy pain points under the hood. You might also like: Doge ETF inches toward approval as Bitwise updates filing Bolt’s deepening infrastructure play Bolt’s latest infrastructure update addresses one of digital commerce’s most persistent dilemmas: the trade-off between rapid growth and operational sustainability. While most marketplaces historically faced mounting complexity with each new merchant, Bolt Connect rearchitects the foundation to eliminate traditional scaling barriers. According to the announcement, Bolt Connect’s automated merchant onboarding reduces what was typically a days-long verification process to near-instant approval, while maintaining compliance through built-in regulatory checks. This technical leap could be especially transformative for platforms expanding internationally, where cross-border documentation and payment processing have traditionally required specialized legal and financial teams. Simultaneously, Bolt’s support for stablecoin payments targets the transactional layer of global commerce. The company says this addition enables merchants to access funds immediately, bypassing traditional banking settlement delays. The implications go beyond speed: by sidestepping card networks and correspondent banks, Bolt’s system dramatically reduces the percentage-based fees that eat into marketplace margins. “Marketplaces shouldn’t have to choose between scale and simplicity,” said Ryan Breslow, Founder and CEO of Bolt. “With Bolt Connect, we’re giving them the tools to grow without the usual technical burden, while stablecoin support opens the door to faster, borderless payments for everyone in the network.” Bolt’s strategic pivot toward backend infrastructure reflects a growing recognition in fintech: user experience alone isn’t enough to solve the structural inefficiencies of digital commerce. While Bolt’s earlier products focused on consumer-facing improvements like one-click checkout, these latest developments aim at the operational plumbing that determines whether marketplaces can scale, or stall.

2025-06-27T13:40:42,"Avalon Labs: Pioneering Crucial Regulatory Clarity for the Crypto Industry","BitcoinWorld Avalon Labs: Pioneering Crucial Regulatory Clarity for the Crypto Industry The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and at its core, the quest for regulatory clarity remains a paramount challenge and opportunity. In a significant move towards shaping a more favorable environment for digital innovation, on-chain financial services platform Avalon Labs recently announced a pivotal discussion with the Bitcoin Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. This collaboration marks a crucial step in advocating for a robust and innovation-friendly regulatory framework in the United States. What is Avalon Labs’ Vision for Crypto Innovation? Avalon Labs (AVL) operates as an on-chain financial services platform, dedicated to building infrastructure that supports the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Their core mission revolves around fostering a secure, efficient, and accessible financial future powered by blockchain technology. Their engagement with key policy-making bodies like the Bitcoin Policy Institute underscores their commitment not just to technological development, but also to shaping the regulatory landscape that will allow these innovations to thrive. By actively participating in these dialogues, Avalon Labs aims to ensure that future regulations are informed, balanced, and conducive to growth, rather than stifling it. The Bitcoin Policy Institute : A Key Voice in D.C.? The Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating policymakers and the public about Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space. Based in Washington, D.C., BPI plays a vital role in advocating for sound public policy that supports the development and adoption of decentralized technologies. Their work involves research, advocacy, and direct engagement with lawmakers to ensure that the unique properties and benefits of cryptocurrencies are understood within legislative circles. Their collaboration with Avalon Labs highlights a shared objective: to create an environment where innovation in the digital asset space can flourish without undue regulatory burdens. Why is Regulatory Clarity So Crucial for the U.S. Crypto Industry ? The absence of clear and consistent regulation has long been a significant hurdle for the U.S. crypto industry . This ambiguity creates uncertainty for businesses, investors, and developers alike. Here’s why regulatory clarity is not just beneficial, but essential: Fosters Innovation: Without clear rules, companies hesitate to invest heavily in new technologies and services, fearing potential legal repercussions. Clarity encourages research, development, and the launch of new products. Attracts Investment: Institutional investors and traditional financial firms are often wary of entering markets with unclear regulatory landscapes. Defined rules provide the confidence needed to deploy significant capital. Protects Consumers: While often seen as a burden, well-crafted regulations can protect consumers from fraud and market manipulation, building trust in the ecosystem. Ensures Global Competitiveness: Other nations are actively developing comprehensive crypto frameworks. The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish its own clear path, potentially losing talent and capital to more hospitable jurisdictions. Reduces Legal Costs: Companies currently spend significant resources navigating a patchwork of state and federal regulations. Clarity can streamline compliance and reduce operational overhead. Unpacking the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA): A Game Changer? During their discussion, Avalon Labs specifically expressed its support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). This proposed legislation aims to provide much-needed clarity for certain entities operating in the blockchain space. At its core, the BRCA seeks to exempt blockchain developers and providers of non-custodial blockchain services from certain money transmission laws, provided they do not take custody of consumer funds. The implications of the BRCA are significant: It distinguishes between entities that hold user assets (like exchanges) and those that simply build the underlying technology (like software developers or decentralized protocol creators). By providing this distinction, it aims to prevent innovative projects from being inadvertently caught under outdated financial regulations designed for traditional intermediaries. This could significantly reduce the compliance burden for many blockchain innovators, encouraging more development directly within the U.S. Avalon Labs views the BRCA as a crucial step towards achieving the regulatory clarity the crypto industry desperately needs to mature and integrate more seamlessly into the broader financial system. Shaping the Future of the U.S. Crypto Industry : What’s Next? The dialogue between Avalon Labs and the Bitcoin Policy Institute is more than just a single meeting; it represents a growing trend of proactive engagement between industry players and policymakers. As the digital asset space continues its rapid evolution, such collaborations are essential to ensure that legislation is both informed by technological realities and aligned with the goals of fostering innovation while safeguarding market integrity. The path to comprehensive regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the U.S. is ongoing, but these direct conversations in Washington, D.C., are foundational. They help bridge the knowledge gap between complex decentralized technologies and the traditional legislative process. As Avalon Labs stated, they look forward to continuing these vital conversations and contributing to the broader progress of the industry. The future success of the U.S. as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation hinges on its ability to craft forward-thinking regulations. Initiatives like the support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act are pivotal in demonstrating the industry’s commitment to working constructively with lawmakers to achieve a thriving, regulated, and innovative digital economy.

2025-06-27T13:30:37,"Ethereum ETFs Face Initial $26.4M Outflows: A Crucial Market Test","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs Face Initial $26.4M Outflows: A Crucial Market Test The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, and not just with the usual price fluctuations. The much-anticipated arrival of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. market has brought a new dynamic, attracting significant institutional attention. However, their initial days have unveiled a mixed bag of investor sentiment, with recent data highlighting a notable trend. On June 26, these groundbreaking financial products collectively registered a net outflow of $26.4 million, a figure that prompts a closer look at the forces shaping this nascent market. What’s Behind the Initial Ethereum ETFs Outflows? The first few days of trading for any new exchange-traded fund are always a period of intense scrutiny, and Ethereum ETFs are no exception. The $26.4 million in net outflows on June 26, as reported by Farside Investors, offers an early glimpse into how capital is flowing through these new investment vehicles. While a net outflow might sound concerning at first glance, a deeper dive reveals a nuanced picture, characterized by both significant withdrawals from established players and fresh capital injections into newer offerings. Here’s a breakdown of the key movements: Grayscale’s Dominance in Outflows: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which converted into a spot ETF, saw the most substantial withdrawals. Its ETHE product alone recorded a $27.4 million outflow, while its standard ETH product experienced an additional $12.4 million in withdrawals. This trend mirrors what was observed with Bitcoin ETFs, where Grayscale’s GBTC saw significant outflows post-conversion due to factors like profit-taking, higher fees compared to competitors, and a shift of capital to more competitive offerings. New Entrants Attracting Inflows: In stark contrast, several newer spot ETH ETFs managed to attract fresh capital. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with $5.9 million in inflows, followed closely by Fidelity’s FETH with $4.9 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW with $2.6 million. These inflows underscore continued investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated products, particularly from major asset managers. Stability Among Others: The remaining Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day, indicating a wait-and-see approach from some investors or a more gradual accumulation process. To provide a clearer picture, here’s a snapshot of the activity: ETF Ticker Issuer Daily Flow (June 26) ETHE Grayscale -$27.4M ETH Grayscale -$12.4M ETHA BlackRock +$5.9M FETH Fidelity +$4.9M ETHW Bitwise +$2.6M Total Net Flow -$26.4M Understanding Grayscale ETHE ‘s Significant Withdrawals The outflows from Grayscale ETHE are a critical component of the overall net outflow figure. For many investors, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was one of the few avenues available for regulated exposure to Ethereum before the conversion to a spot ETF. Historically, ETHE traded at a significant discount or premium to its underlying net asset value (NAV), creating arbitrage opportunities and unique investment strategies. Upon its conversion to an ETF, ETHE became redeemable at NAV, allowing investors who bought in at a discount to realize profits. Furthermore, Grayscale’s fee structure, which is typically higher than that of newer ETF competitors like BlackRock or Fidelity, incentivizes some investors to rotate their capital into more cost-effective options. This phenomenon was clearly observed with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following its conversion, where it saw billions in outflows as investors sought lower-fee alternatives or simply cashed out their long-held positions. The pattern with ETHE appears to be following a similar trajectory, representing a natural market adjustment rather than a wholesale rejection of Ethereum as an asset. The Strength of BlackRock ETHA and Other New Entrants While Grayscale faced headwinds, the positive inflows into products like BlackRock ETHA , Fidelity’s FETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW are a strong indicator of robust institutional and retail demand for Ethereum exposure through traditional investment vehicles. These asset managers bring immense credibility, vast distribution networks, and competitive fee structures to the market, making their ETFs attractive to a broad range of investors who might have previously been hesitant to venture directly into the volatile crypto markets. The inflows suggest that new capital is entering the Ethereum ecosystem via these ETFs, potentially from: Traditional Investors: Pension funds, wealth managers, and institutional investors who prefer regulated products over direct crypto holdings. Retail Investors: Individuals seeking simpler, tax-efficient ways to add crypto to their portfolios through their brokerage accounts. Diversification Seekers: Investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings beyond Bitcoin, recognizing Ethereum’s foundational role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. The ability of these new ETFs to attract millions in their initial days, even amidst Grayscale’s outflows, highlights a genuine and growing interest in Ethereum as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance. Navigating Early Crypto Outflows : A Market Perspective Understanding these early crypto outflows requires a balanced perspective. It’s crucial to avoid drawing hasty conclusions based on a single day’s data. The initial phase of any new ETF market is often characterized by significant rebalancing and repositioning of capital. For spot ETH ETFs , this involves a transition from existing trust structures to new, more liquid, and often cheaper ETF formats. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights for investors: Monitor Trends, Not Just Snapshots: A single day’s outflow is less significant than sustained trends over weeks or months. Investors should look for patterns in inflows and outflows to gauge true market sentiment and adoption rates. Distinguish Between Types of Outflows: Not all outflows are negative. Those from Grayscale’s converted trust are often a function of market maturity and fee competition, rather than a lack of interest in Ethereum itself. New Demand is Evident: The consistent inflows into BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise’s offerings confirm that there is new, net demand for Ethereum exposure from a segment of the market that was previously underserved. Volatility is Expected: The crypto market, by nature, is volatile. ETF flows will reflect this, and investors should be prepared for fluctuations as the market matures and reacts to broader economic and regulatory news. The emergence of these ETFs provides significant benefits to investors, offering ease of access, liquidity, and regulatory oversight that were previously unavailable for direct Ethereum investments. However, challenges remain, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the competitive pressures among issuers. The Road Ahead for Spot ETH ETFs : Challenges and Opportunities The journey for spot ETH ETFs has just begun, and while the initial flows provide valuable insights, the true test will be their sustained performance and ability to attract long-term capital. The market is dynamic, and future flows will likely be influenced by several factors: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Development: Continued innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and scalability solutions on the Ethereum blockchain will enhance its appeal as an underlying asset. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment: The overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s performance, often influence investor sentiment towards altcoins like Ethereum. Regulatory Clarity: Further clarity from regulators on crypto assets and related products could encourage more institutional participation. Fee Competition: As the market matures, we can expect fierce competition among ETF issuers, potentially leading to lower fees that could attract even more investors. These ETFs represent a pivotal moment for Ethereum, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. While initial crypto outflows from one major player might grab headlines, the underlying narrative of new capital entering the space through reputable firms like BlackRock and Fidelity paints a hopeful picture for Ethereum’s continued integration into mainstream investment portfolios. Summary: The initial days of U.S. spot ETH ETFs have presented a mixed but ultimately insightful picture. While a net outflow of $26.4 million on June 26 was primarily driven by significant withdrawals from Grayscale’s converted trust ( Grayscale ETHE ), this was counterbalanced by notable inflows into offerings from new players like BlackRock ETHA , Fidelity, and Bitwise. This suggests a rebalancing of capital within the market rather than a fundamental rejection of Ethereum. As the market matures, monitoring sustained trends and understanding the nuances of these flows will be crucial for investors navigating this exciting new frontier in digital asset investment.

2025-06-27T13:27:40,"Cygnal poll: Bitcoin holders have a strong political influence in the USA","Bitcoin ownership is not just a ticket to long-term wealth. Holders are also a growing political constituency in the US political landscape. Polling and research by Cygnal shows BTC ownership is also a growing indicator of political convictions and influence. US-based owners are a significant force on both a global scale and as a domestic voting group. Crypto dragged Trump across the finish line in 2024 According to Cygnal polling, BTC ownership could predict voting inclinations, with immediate potential results for the 2026 midterms. Its recent poll between June 19-21 targeted a selection of 800 potential voters. “ The Bitcoin constituency is now a critical one in elections, but there is a wide chasm between Bitcoiners and voters as a whole, ” said Pollster and Cygnal President, Brent Buchanan. “ However, this data offers a lot of promise and opportunity to the Bitcoin community and the innovation industries surrounding it ,” he added. Bitcoiners already showed their preferences during the contested 2024 election, voting 59% in favor of Donald Trump , and only 34% in favor of Kamala Harris, a significant shift from the general voter pool. Trump also won over 11% of Democratic voters who were also BTC holders, compared to 6% of general Democratic voters who switched teams. The shift in Trump’s direction followed his campaign claims of more lenient crypto policies, which led to a shift in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The effect of Trump’s election victory and the subsequent drive to liberalize crypto regulations led to multiple all-time highs for BTC, further solidifying the holder ethos. Following the emergence of crypto owners as a voting bloc, BTC also shows a clear trend of a growing number of corporations building treasuries , alongside older whales that still hold for the long term. Bitcoin holders: leaning Republican, more educated and younger The voting profile of a Bitcoin holder is emerging as a stronger supporter of Trump than the Republican Party. Nevertheless, holders lean Republican politically. Voters owning BTC were younger, predominantly male, with more years of education, and higher-income than the general population. Despite their conviction, Bitcoiners were low-propensity voters, needing a nudge to go to the polls and support their main preferences. Bitcoin owners were also 53% likely to vote in person on election day, or cast an early in-person vote, with just 15.5% for absentee or mail voting, compared to 23.8% absentee voting for the general population. Bitcoiners also have a different profile of voting issues, with inflation and the economy being their biggest concern. BTC holders have a different issue profile compared to general voters, with their biggest concern being inflation and the economy. | Source: Cygnal Poll Bitcoin holders still diverge from the general GOP voters, with more dramatic support for crypto issues ranging from transactions to a national reserve. Democratic voters are more generally opposed to expanding access to crypto. The most supportive crypto holders are in the 30-44 age bracket, with 61% approval for crypto in general. Those voters are also more likely to support Republicans in the upcoming 2026 elections. Surprisingly, Bitcoin holders were also not entirely maximalist, with 42% favorable opinion on meme tokens, compared to just 19% favorable for the general population.

2025-06-27T13:26:31,"XRP price prediction for July 1, 2025","XRP has experienced considerable volatility over the past 24 hours, primarily triggered by Judge Analisa Torres’ decision to deny motions in the ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit . This ruling, a significant development in a case that has loomed over the token for years, has contributed to a sharp market reaction, with nearly $5 billion erased from XRP’s market capitalization. However, the crypto market appears to have largely priced in this outcome, as evidenced by stabilizing trading patterns and a lack of further significant sell-offs in the immediate aftermath. With only a few days until July 1, a deeper analysis of XRP’s price dynamics, technical indicators, and fundamental developments provides valuable insight into its potential trajectory and performance in the first half of 2025. XRP price analysis Currently, XRP trades at $2.09, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.73 billion, a market cap of $123.46 billion, and a market dominance of 3.76%. XRP 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP’s current price action reveals a mixed outlook. The token is trading below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a bearish signal that suggests potential challenges in regaining upward momentum in the near term. Additionally, XRP has recorded only 13 green days in the last 30 (43%), indicating inconsistent short-term performance. The impending unlock of 1 billion XRP tokens on July 1, part of Ripple’s programmed escrow releases, introduces another layer of complexity. With a yearly inflation rate of 6.45% and a fully diluted valuation of $208.79 billion, this token unlock could exert downward pressure on the price, particularly if market sentiment remains cautious. Historically, Ripple’s escrow releases have had mixed impacts, with some unlocks absorbed smoothly due to pre-existing market expectations and others contributing to temporary price dips. Data says XRP sentiment is at 17-day high According to data analytics platform Santiment: “XRP sentiment is currently at a 17-day high, in terms of positive vs. negative commentary. This has happened after a $50M settlement between Ripple & the SEC was stalled.” 📊 With crypto moving sideways, retail optimism toward Bitcoin & Ethereum has died down a bit.

2025-06-27T13:20:30,"ARK Invest’s Bold Move: Shedding Coinbase Stock Amidst Market Highs","BitcoinWorld ARK Invest’s Bold Move: Shedding Coinbase Stock Amidst Market Highs The world of cryptocurrency and traditional finance often sees intriguing overlaps, and few firms embody this intersection quite like ARK Invest . When a major player like ARK Invest makes a significant move, especially concerning a bellwether crypto company, the market takes notice. Recently, the asset management firm, helmed by the renowned Cathie Wood, executed a notable sale of Coinbase stock, prompting many to ask: what’s behind this strategic decision? What Does ARK Invest’s Recent Move Signal? On June 26, ARK Invest, through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), offloaded a substantial $12.5 million worth of shares in crypto exchange Coinbase. This transaction occurred on a day when Coinbase’s stock had soared to an impressive all-time high of $375.07. For many observers, selling at a peak seems counterintuitive. However, for a firm like ARK Invest, known for its long-term, disruptive innovation thesis, such a move often signals a calculated rebalancing or profit-taking strategy rather than a loss of faith. Profit Realization: Selling at an all-time high allows ARK Invest to lock in significant gains from its investment in Coinbase, which has seen substantial growth. Portfolio Rebalancing: ETFs like ARKK maintain specific weightings for their holdings. When one stock performs exceptionally well, its proportion in the portfolio can become overweight, necessitating a sale to rebalance and adhere to the fund’s investment mandate. Risk Management: While bullish on disruptive technologies, ARK Invest also manages risk. Trimming positions after a sharp rally can reduce overall portfolio volatility. Understanding the Dynamics of Coinbase Stock Performance Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) has been a cornerstone holding for ARK Invest, representing their conviction in the future of the crypto economy. The Coinbase stock has experienced significant volatility, characteristic of the broader crypto market, but has also demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, particularly during bull cycles. Its performance is often seen as a proxy for institutional and retail interest in digital assets. The fact that ARK Invest sold shares precisely when Coinbase reached an all-time high of $375.07 highlights the dynamic nature of their investment strategy. It’s a testament to their disciplined approach to portfolio management, where pre-defined thresholds for profit-taking or rebalancing are often triggered by market movements, regardless of long-term conviction. Cathie Wood’s Vision: Beyond the Daily Trades Cathie Wood , the visionary CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, has consistently championed disruptive innovation, with a strong focus on areas like artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, and blockchain technology. Her investment philosophy centers on identifying companies poised to revolutionize industries over the next five to ten years. For Wood, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem represent a significant disruptive force, and Coinbase, as a leading exchange, plays a pivotal role in this revolution. It’s crucial to view this sale not as a shift in Cathie Wood’s long-term bullish outlook on crypto, but rather as a tactical adjustment within a diversified portfolio. Her public statements and ongoing investments in other crypto-related entities continue to affirm her belief in the transformative power of digital assets. Navigating the ARKK ETF Strategy The ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ETF ) is ARK Invest’s flagship actively managed exchange-traded fund. It seeks long-term growth by investing in companies that are the leaders, enablers, and beneficiaries of disruptive innovation. The fund’s holdings are constantly evaluated, and positions are adjusted based on market conditions, company fundamentals, and ARK’s evolving research insights. The sale of Coinbase shares is a prime example of this active management in action. For investors who track ARKK, these sales and purchases provide insights into how ARK Invest manages concentration risk and capitalizes on market movements. It underscores the active nature of the fund, which differentiates it from passively managed index funds. The strategy is to allocate capital to the highest conviction ideas while maintaining a balanced portfolio. Implications for Your Crypto Investment Journey For individual investors navigating the volatile waters of digital assets, ARK Invest’s move offers a valuable lesson in portfolio management. While it’s tempting to hold onto assets indefinitely during a bull run, strategic profit-taking and rebalancing are crucial components of a sound crypto investment strategy. This particular sale by a major institutional investor does not necessarily signal a downturn for Coinbase or the broader crypto market, but rather a disciplined approach to managing risk and optimizing returns. Consider these actionable insights: Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto holdings to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Define your entry and exit strategies. Consider taking profits on portions of your holdings after significant gains.

2025-06-27T13:18:34,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-27: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, TONCOIN: TON, APTOS: APT, COSMOS: ATOM","The crypto market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours, as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in the red. Prices have been consolidating in the past few days, with BTC consolidating around the $107,000-$107,500 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,402. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) fell from a high of $2,532 on Thursday to close at $2,415. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, struggling to stay above $2,400. Ripple (XRP) is down over 4%, trading around $2.09, while Solana (SOL) is down nearly 3%, trading around $140. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines. Coinbase Stock Hits New Closing High According to data from Google Finance, Coinbase (COIN) shares ended Thursday at a new all-time closing high of $369.21. Real Vision CEO Raoul Paul reacted to the stock’s new high, stating, “Wow, $HOOD, $COIN, and $RKLB are going vertical now. All in the RV Pro portfolio (added to all via calls at April lows). $TSLA is likely to follow. The next step is crypto. The liquidity spigot is wide, wide open.” The recent gains are 3.3% higher from the stock’s previous closing high of $357.59 in November 2021. Coinbase was the best-performing S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, rising over 12%. The stock’s stellar performance comes only a month after it became the first crypto firm to join the S&P 500. However, analysts are split on whether the rally could continue. Investment advisor Andy Heilman stated that while COIN has made stellar gains, it is due a correction. Another prominent analyst stated that the daily Bollinger Band, a volatility indicator that uses price bands, is expanding and looking to go higher. Dow Jones Edges Higher As Trump Eyes Powell Replacement US stocks climbed higher on Thursday amid reports that President Donald Trump is close to selecting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s replacement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57% or 200 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained 500 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.23% as investors bet on increased chances of interest rate cuts by the central bank. The market enthusiasm also stemmed from President Trump, who has stepped up criticism of Powell after the Fed decided to keep interest rates steady. Powell testified before lawmakers in Washington amid reports Trump is close to selecting his replacement. Powell’s term is set to end in May 2026. Trump has whittled down the list to four candidates, with reports stating he could announce a replacement as early as this summer. Real-World Assets (RWAs) Hit $24B, Private Credit Leads Growth According to a report by RedStone, private credit has emerged as the primary growth driver in the RWA market, helping it become one of the fastest-growing categories. RWAs surged to $24 billion in value, up from $10 billion in 2022. This was topped only by stablecoins, which registered even stronger growth in the same period. Marcin Kaźmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, believes private credit is the primary driver of the burgeoning growth of RWA assets. Private credit refers to loans made outside the traditional banking system, often issued directly to private entities. “Private credit has emerged as the foundation for tokenization’s real-world impact. What we’re seeing now is institutional finance actively moving into blockchain—not just exploring, but deploying capital in meaningful ways and innovating with RWA looping strategies.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up during the ongoing session after briefly giving up the $107,000 level Thursday when it fell from an intraday high of $108,343 to $106,970. BTC started the week with a stunning rally as market sentiment improved after the US-brokered Israel-Iran ceasefire. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency rallied to reclaim $105,000 and went past $106,000 on Tuesday. Bullish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as BTC crossed $107,000 and settled at $107,393 before entering a consolidation phase. Market analyst Rekt Capital shared a roadmap for BTC for the rest of 2025, noting that the current cycle has been one of the reaccumulation ranges. The analyst explained that these have formed throughout the cycle since 2022 and have evolved since the latest Bitcoin halving. Rekt Capital stated that during the downside period, BTC registered short price deviations with downside wicks below the reaccumulation range lows on the weekly chart. On the other hand, the post-halving phase has seen BTC deviations occur with multi-week clusters of full-bodied candles below range lows. Analysts highlighted that BTC formed a bullish engulfing candlestick, fully reversing the weekend’s bearish price action. The pattern also ensured BTC maintained its position above $105,000, indicating a potential shift in market structure, adding weight to the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing recovery. However, despite the bullish setup, market sentiment is divided. BTC has recorded 19 instances of the bullish engulfing pattern meeting the defined confirmation criteria. Of these, 15 led to new local highs in the following days or weeks. More importantly, 19 instances occurred within a broader bull market context. The prevailing bull market structure indicates a statistically favorable environment for continuing the current price action, potentially pushing BTC to new highs. BTC registered a sharp drop on Tuesday (June 17), falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. Despite the bearish sentiment, it registered a marginal increase on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631.

BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened, falling to $98,385. It recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982.

2025-06-27T13:14:07,"$15B Bitcoin Options Expire Today: Will This Send BTC Bull Token Soaring?","Bitcoin traders everywhere will be watching their feeds closely, willing the world’s largest crypto to hold steady at or near its current $107K mark. $15B in Bitcoin options expire today, a major portion of the roughly $40B in options outstanding. If $BTC’s price falls to $102K or below, the market would endure a true ‘pain point.’ As long as that doesn’t happen, Bitcoin looks set to press on with business as normal – setting the stage for further growth of the ecosystem and the first meme coin offering direct $BTC exposure, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Narrowing Volatility Indicates Positive Outlook The $BTC volatility index has narrowed in recent days, drawing more closely to the historical volatility and generally indicating that traders don’t expect dramatic price moves either way – up or down. That was supported by Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Péquignot, who stated : ‘Low open interest in perps and fairly depressed Bitcoin implied volatility and skew are indicative of limited expectations for sharp price movements…’ Where does that leave Bitcoin? Still looking bullish. Crypto treasury strategies are still expanding, adding thousands of $BTC tokens to long-term reserves and increasing demand. Metaplanet just added 1,234 $BTC , bringing its total portfolio north of 12K $BTC. And it isn’t just direct Bitcoin purchases; the ecosystem around the world’s leading crypto continues to fuel demand. ETFs Notch 13 Days Consecutive Inflows, Bitcoin Overtakes Google Bitcoin ETFs are building on a 13-day stretch of positive inflows. Monday to Thursday, daily cumulative inflows amounted to: $350M $588M $547M $226M Positive inflows point to long-term interest from retail and institutional investors, rather than short-term traders, and contribute to underlying buying pressure. And with the largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, holding over $70B in total assets, Bitcoin took advantage of weakening Alphabet stock to overthrow Google as the world’s sixth-largest asset. It’s a combination of fundamentally positive factors, reinforcing a bullish case for $BTC – and the meme coin built on that case. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Meme Coin Trusting $BTC to Hit $250K and Beyond BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is confident that Bitcoin will one day reach $250K and more – so confident that the project is built around key Bitcoin price milestones. Bitcoin $125K: The project burns $BTCBULL tokens to exert deflationary pressure on the price. Bitcoin $150K: BTC Bull token investors who hold their tokens in the Best Wallet app receive a free $BTC airdrop. Bitcoin $175K: Another $BTCBULL token burn. Bitcoin $200K: Another $BTC airdrop! Bitcoin $225K: A final $BTCBULL burn. Bitcoin $250K: A massive $BTCBULL airdrop. The combination of token burns and airdrops encourages positive momentum for BTC Bull Token, following Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. The presale has raised $7.5M so far. Only three days remain in the presale, so act now – you can learn how to buy BTC Bull token in our guide. Tokens currently cost $0.00258, but our analysts expect the price to hit $0.0084 by year-end. Visit the BTC Bull token website today. BTC Options Expire, But Outlook Is Bullish for Bitcoin With $15B in Bitcoin options expiring, narrowing volatility, and consistent ETF inflows, Bitcoin’s foundation looks stronger than ever. For investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum, BTC Bull Token offers a bold, milestone-based roadmap aligned with $BTC’s rise to $250K. But be warned – there’s mere days left in the presale, so the window to join is closing fast. Always do your own research.

2025-06-27T01:15:46,"Bitcoin analysis for today with tradeCompass by investingLive","<p>Bitcoin Analysis Today with tradeCompass (June 27, 2025)</p><p>At the time of this Bitcoin analysis, Bitcoin Futures are trading at $107,335, slightly above today’s bullish threshold.</p><p>Summary Box</p><p>Bullish above: $107,275 (Wait for at least one 30-minute candle close above this level for confirmation)
Bearish below: $107,000 (Confirmed by at least one 30-minute candle close below)
Current Price: $107,335
Primary Bias: Slightly Bullish (price near key institutional support level)</p><p>Bullish Partial Profit Targets:</p><ul><li><p>$107,540</p></li><li><p>$107,800</p></li><li><p>$108,115</p></li><li><p>$108,540</p></li><li><p>$109,000</p></li><li><p>$109,625 (runner)</p></li><li><p>$110,715 (runner)</p></li><li><p>$111,000 (runner)</p></li></ul><p>Bearish Partial Profit Targets:</p><ul><li><p>$106,715</p></li><li><p>$106,270</p></li><li><p>$105,775 (runner)</p></li><li><p>$105,425 (runner)</p></li></ul><p>Bitcoin Market Context and Directional Bias</p><p>Currently, Bitcoin Futures prices are trading just above our bullish threshold at $107,275. However, given recent downward momentum, traders might consider waiting for a clearer confirmation of bullish sentiment. One recommended way is to wait for at least one 30-minute candle to close above this key level before initiating a long position.</p><p>This method ensures the bullish threshold is not just briefly pierced but sustainably held. Prices have recently declined, hinting at a potential attempt by market makers to trigger stop orders beneath this critical support area. Therefore, caution is advised, and confirming a sustained move above the bullish threshold is recommended.</p><p>If prices close below our bearish threshold of $107,000 on at least one 30-minute candle, this would signal increased bearish momentum, opening the door for deeper corrections. Traders looking for greater confirmation may wait even longer for sustained bearish activity before initiating positions.</p><p>Key Levels & Partial-Profit Strategy for Bitcoin Traders Today</p><p>The tradeCompass methodology includes a systematic approach of scaling out of trades by taking partial profits at predefined institutional levels, providing traders with structured ways to manage risk and improve trade consistency.</p><p>Bullish Scenario (confirmed above $107,275)</p><ul><li><p>$107,540:
June 12th Value Area Low, likely to attract early resistance or profit-taking.</p></li><li><p>$107,800:
June 12th Point of Control (POC), indicating high historical volume and strong potential resistance.</p></li><li><p>$108,115:
Near today’s and yesterday’s VWAP, highlighting institutional fair-value levels.</p></li><li><p>$108,540:
Just below yesterday’s POC, a critical level for institutional trading.</p></li><li><p>$109,000:
Aligned with June 10th POC, historically significant due to high-volume activity.</p></li><li><p>$109,625 (runner):
Next significant upside level, suitable for holding a smaller portion of the position.</p></li><li><p>$110,715 (runner):
Extended profit target, if bullish momentum strongly persists.</p></li><li><p>$111,000 (runner):
Psychological and institutional magnet, marking the final bullish target for runners.</p></li></ul><p>Bearish Scenario (confirmed below $107,000)</p><ul><li><p>$106,715:
June 12th Point of Control, likely to see temporary price stabilization or bounce.</p></li><li><p>$106,270:
Just above June 17th VWAP, a significant institutional reference.</p></li><li><p>$105,775 (runner):
Positioned just above the June 24th Value Area Low, representing deeper bearish continuation.</p></li><li><p>$105,425 (runner):
Final bearish target slightly above June 20th VWAP, marking a deeper retracement target.</p></li></ul><p>Understanding tradeCompass Methodology</p><p>Volume Profile</p><p>Volume Profile visually displays trading volume distribution at various price levels, highlighting zones of agreement among buyers and sellers. Important components include:</p><ul><li><p>Point of Control (POC):
The highest-volume price level, often acting as key support or resistance.</p></li><li><p>Value Area High/Low (VAH/VAL):
Levels defining the range where approximately 70% of prior session trading occurred, critical for detecting breakouts or reversals.</p></li></ul><p>VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)</p><p>VWAP calculates the average price weighted by volume, signaling institutional ""fair value."" Prices above VWAP generally reflect bullish control, whereas prices below suggest bearish sentiment. VWAP’s standard deviation bands help pinpoint probable reversals or accelerations.</p><p>Liquidity Pools</p><p>Liquidity pools represent price areas with substantial pending market orders. Institutions and market makers typically target these pools to efficiently execute large transactions, causing short-term price reactions. Recognizing liquidity pools allows traders to anticipate these market-moving events.</p><p>Why These Tools Matter</p><p>Incorporating Volume Profile, VWAP, and liquidity pools provides traders a clear view of institutional-level market participation. This combined perspective allows traders to establish precise entry points, effective risk management strategies, and strategically placed partial profit targets rather than relying solely on distant single objectives.</p><p>tradeCompass Trade Management Tips</p><ul><li><p>One trade per direction:
Keeps your strategy disciplined, prevents emotional overtrading, and preserves capital.</p></li><li><p>Moving stops:
Once your second partial profit target is hit, move your stop-loss to entry, effectively reducing risk.</p></li><li><p>Flexible entry confirmation:
Traders may vary their entry confirmations—waiting for candle closes, delta analysis, or sustained price action near thresholds.</p></li><li><p>Logical stop placement:
Always ensure stops are logically placed relative to tradeCompass thresholds to quickly invalidate trades if the scenario changes.</p></li></ul><p>Join Our Free Crypto Telegram Channel</p><p>For timely updates, professional crypto trading insights, and carefully curated market alerts—without unnecessary chatter—join our new, free Telegram Crypto Channel at:
