2025-06-27T11:50:23,"Urgent: Mexican Bank Sanctions Spark Alarm Over US Payment System Access","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Mexican Bank Sanctions Spark Alarm Over US Payment System Access The financial world is abuzz with a startling revelation: a U.S. subsidiary of a Mexican bank sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury allegedly maintains direct access to the very heart of the US payment system . This isn’t just about a bank; it’s about the integrity of global finance and the mechanisms designed to prevent illicit money flows. How could an entity linked to alleged cartel funds still hold such a privileged position within America’s financial infrastructure? Let’s dive deep into this unfolding story that raises critical questions about security and oversight. Unveiling the Controversy: Mexican Bank Sanctions and US Access The recent revelation by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, has sent ripples through the financial community. According to her post on X, the U.S. subsidiary of Intercam Banco, a Mexican financial institution, appears to possess a Federal Reserve master account. This is significant because Intercam Banco itself has been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury due to alleged connections with cartel-related funds. The core of the controversy lies in the apparent contradiction: an entity whose parent company faces serious allegations of facilitating illicit money, potentially retaining direct, unfettered access to the vital US payment system . While Intercam Banco has publicly denied these allegations, the question remains: what does this mean for the security of the U.S. financial landscape? Understanding the Federal Reserve Master Account: A Gateway to the US Payment System What exactly is a Federal Reserve master account , and why is its alleged possession by a sanctioned entity so alarming? Simply put, a Federal Reserve master account provides direct access to the U.S. central bank’s payment services. This includes the ability to send and receive payments through Fedwire, participate in automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, and directly settle balances. For a bank, it’s the ultimate gateway to the U.S. financial system, bypassing intermediary banks and reducing costs and delays. For a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign bank, such direct access is a powerful privilege. The fact that an entity connected to Mexican bank sanctions could potentially leverage this direct access raises significant concerns about the robustness of the US payment system ‘s defenses against illicit finance. The Shadow of Cartel Funds: Allegations and Implications The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s sanctions against Intercam Banco are rooted in allegations of its involvement with cartel funds . These are not minor infractions; such allegations point to serious criminal activity, including money laundering, drug trafficking, and other transnational crimes that destabilize economies and threaten national security. When funds linked to organized crime infiltrate legitimate financial channels, it undermines the integrity of the global financial system. The alleged continued access to the US payment system , even by a subsidiary, suggests a potential loophole that could be exploited by criminal organizations, allowing them to move illicit money with greater ease and anonymity, directly impacting the fight against financial crime. Navigating Financial Compliance: Challenges and Oversight Gaps This situation brings to light critical challenges in international financial compliance and regulatory oversight. Several questions immediately arise: Are Business Ties Clear? It remains unclear whether the U.S. subsidiary has any ongoing business ties or operational dependencies with its sanctioned parent company. This distinction is crucial for assessing risk. Regulatory Lag: How quickly can regulators identify and act upon such connections, especially when dealing with complex international corporate structures? Information Sharing: Is there sufficient real-time information sharing between different regulatory bodies (e.g., U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve) to ensure a unified and swift response to sanction designations? Proactive Measures: What mechanisms are in place to prevent sanctioned entities, or their closely related subsidiaries, from gaining or retaining such critical access points to a nation’s financial infrastructure? The complexities of global banking and the intricate web of subsidiaries often create blind spots that illicit actors can exploit, making robust and adaptive financial compliance frameworks more essential than ever. What This Means for Financial Security and What Comes Next The alleged direct access of a sanctioned Mexican bank’s subsidiary to the US payment system underscores the constant battle against financial crime and the imperative for vigilant oversight. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even with robust sanction regimes, sophisticated actors will always seek vulnerabilities. It highlights the need for continuous review and strengthening of policies governing access to critical financial infrastructure like the Federal Reserve master account . Moving forward, increased scrutiny of foreign bank subsidiaries operating within the U.S., alongside enhanced inter-agency coordination, will be paramount to ensure that the U.S. financial system remains secure against the flow of cartel funds and other illicit monies. This is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of national and international financial security.

Bitcoin is quickly becoming more than a reserve asset for Canadian companies. This week, two firms took concrete steps to build with it, marking a clear shift in how BTC fits into corporate finance. Here are more details. Belgravia Hartford Adds Another $1M to Its Bitcoin Bet Toronto-based investment firm Belgravia Hartford is building its Bitcoin treasury with fresh capital – this week pulling another $1 million from its credit line with Round13 Digital Asset Fund. That brings its total draw so far to $1.5 million, all going straight into Bitcoin. The company is buying BTC through the regulated OTC desk at Coinsquare, one of Canada’s leading crypto exchanges. This is part of a broader strategy. Belgravia recently purchased 1.5 BTC for around $161,000 on June 20. That brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 6.4 BTC, valued at roughly $685,000 at current prices. CEO Mehdi Azodi is clear about the company’s direction. “As a micro-cap, we have determined regularly adding BTC to the balance sheet is our best use and store of funds and that such activity is currently imperative for accretive growth in shareholder value,” he said. Let’s simplify this. Belgravia sees Bitcoin as the smartest way to use its funds right now. The company also launched a Bitcoin-focused private placement to raise more capital and keep building its BTC reserves. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation Makes a First Move On the same day, another player stepped into the spotlight. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, a Canada-based firm focused on institutional Bitcoin services, revealed its first major BTC buy: 292.80 BTC, worth about $31.5 million. The purchase was funded by a $125 million share offering, and it’s just the beginning of the company’s accumulation strategy. But holding Bitcoin isn’t the end goal here! They plan to use it for lending to institutions, offering liquidity while managing risk. The company is clear on its long-term view. Bitcoin is now a key part of how they plan to grow and operate. A Bigger Shift in Canada’s Bitcoin Strategy Both moves point to a growing trend: Canadian companies are getting serious about Bitcoin. Belgravia is slowly building its treasury. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation is jumping in with size and utility. Together, they reflect a bigger shift happening in Canada – where BTC is being treated less like a hedge, and more like an important financial tool.

2025-06-27T11:45:34,"XRP’s Price Dips As Judge Shoots Down Joint Bid From Ripple and the SEC To Reduce the Company’s Previously Ordered Fine","A US judge doesn’t think Ripple should get to walk back the civil penalty from its XRP lawsuit just because the new leadership regime at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now sides with the payments firm. Ripple and the SEC first filed a joint request in May for an “indicative ruling” to see whether District Judge Analisa Torres would be open to vacating the firm’s previously assigned $125 million civil penalty and reducing it to $50 million. Indicative rulings can be filed when a previous judgment is pending with an appeals court, but parties want to see if a district judge would be open to a motion for relief. District judges can deny the motions or express their openness to granting them should the appeals court give them permission. Judge Torres shot down Ripple and the SEC’s joint request in May, ruling that both parties failed “to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty.” Ripple and the SEC refiled a second joint request earlier this month, outlining what they believed were the “exceptional circumstances” that merited a civil penalty reduction. “The balance of the interests here favors entry of the relief sought by the parties. The requested relief reflects a reasonable compromise by all parties to bring this litigation to an end, to avoid litigation risk on appeal, and to avoid the further expenditure of party and judicial resources.” Torres, however, shot down their second request in a similar fashion to the first, noting that the Supreme Court has said that court judgments aren’t just the property of the litigants; instead, they belong to the whole legal community and shouldn’t be vacated unless public interest demands it. The SEC first sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. In 2023, Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged. The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sales of XRP directly to institutional buyers were securities offerings. Last August, the judge slapped Ripple with a $125 million civil penalty, which the firm appealed. The SEC also appealed that number, arguing at the time that it was too low. The regulatory agency changed its tune toward the lawsuit after President Donald Trump took office in January and installed pro-crypto officials at the head of the commission. XRP is trading at $2.12 at time of writing. The fourth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 3% in the past 24 hours.

This announcement aligns with Coinbase's recent stock performance, which saw shares closing at a record high of $375.07, surpassing its previous peak from November 2021 . Armstrong has previously suggested that Bitcoin's price could eventually reach into the millions, reflecting his bullish outlook on the asset. He also anticipates that nations will soon begin to include Bitcoin in their financial reserves, a move that could significantly influence global demand and the role of cryptocurrencies in international economics . Coinbase's stock surge is part of a broader trend of increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial markets. The company's inclusion in the S&P 500 Index in May 2025 marked a significant milestone, signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets. Analysts attribute Coinbase's strong performance to several factors, including the recovery of cryptocurrency prices, enhanced regulatory clarity, and the company's diversified revenue streams from trading fees, custody services, and institutional partnerships. Armstrong's consistent investment in Bitcoin and his vision for its future underscore a broader trend among crypto leaders and institutional investors who view the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/coinbase-ceo-bets-big-on-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare

Bitcoin Solaris is now gaining serious traction across crypto trackers like Live Coin Watch. But it is not just another presale. BTC-S is gearing up for something much bigger. The upcoming LBank listing has placed it firmly in the sights of investors looking for Bitcoin-level wealth opportunities without the $100,000+ entry ticket. Why the LBank Listing Changes Everything Exchanges matter. And LBank is no small fish. With millions in daily volume and a reputation for onboarding promising projects, getting listed there is more than a visibility boost. It’s an official stamp of credibility. It means institutional eyes are watching, and retail momentum will only accelerate. The upcoming LBank listing for Bitcoin Solaris comes at a perfect moment. The presale is nearing its final stages, the hype is real, and the infrastructure is built. When BTC-S hits the exchange, it won’t crawl, it will sprint. This is where many expect the 150 percent projected ROI to begin its climb. Projects with real-world utility and this level of technology rarely come this early. But BTC-S is pulling it off. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just Hype Bitcoin Solaris is not a copy of Bitcoin. It’s an evolution. It was designed from the ground up with a simple goal: bring financial opportunity to more people using scalable technology that still honors decentralization. Unlike most Layer 1 projects, BTC-S splits its infrastructure into two layers. The Base Layer uses Proof of Work to ensure security and fairness, while the Solaris Layer runs on Delegated Proof of Stake to deliver blazing speeds and ultra-low fees. Together, they allow Bitcoin Solaris to process up to 100,000 transactions per second. That is 10 times more than most legacy chains, and it comes with two-second finality. Smart contracts are built using Rust, and the project initially leverages Solana’s dev tools and ecosystem. This makes it easy to launch DeFi apps, NFTs, IoT platforms, healthcare records, and even decentralized education solutions on BTC-S. And because of the upcoming release of the mobile-friendly Solaris Nova app, mining BTC-S is now accessible even without expensive rigs. You can check projected earnings using the mining calculator directly on the official site at Bitcoin Solaris Mining Calculator. Technical Highlights Driving the Buzz What’s under the hood is what makes Bitcoin Solaris really stand out. This is not another meme coin launch. It is a high-performance blockchain built for practical use and serious value creation. Hybrid Consensus: Combines SHA-256 Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake for both power and efficiency. Validator Rotation: DPoS validators rotate every 24 hours with slashing for misbehavior, ensuring network integrity. Smart Contracts: Rust-based contracts leveraging Solana compatibility for speed and low cost. Security: Resistance to 51 percent attacks, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and optional Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy. TPS Performance: Up to 3,000 TPS on the base layer and up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer. This Isn’t Just a Token—It’s a Wealth Engine Built on BTC-S Influencers Are Talking Several top names in crypto content have picked up on BTC-S’s momentum. Their reviews add another layer of visibility and validation. Crypto Vlog dives deep into why the technical design positions BTC-S for long-term growth. Crypto Show outlines why retail investors are showing up in droves. Token Galaxy highlights how BTC-S balances scalability and decentralization. The sentiment is clear. BTC-S is not just trending. It’s becoming a movement. BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris keeps its token economy simple but powerful. There are only 21 million BTC-S tokens. That’s it. The allocation ensures long-term value, adoption, and decentralization. 66.66 percent for mining rewards over 90 years 20 percent reserved for presale participants 5 percent allocated to liquidity pools 2 percent to ecosystem development 2 percent to community incentives 2 percent for marketing 2 percent for staking rewards 0.33 percent to the team and advisors This balanced structure creates a healthy, sustainable economy. Full details are live on the Bitcoin Solaris tokenomics page . BTC-S vs. Bitcoin: A Mining Comparison Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Algorithm SHA-256 SHA-256 Power Usage Extremely High 99.95 percent lower Mining Hardware Specialized ASICs Accessible mobile mining Block Time 10 minutes 5 minutes base, 15 sec Solaris TPS 7 Up to 100,000 The Presale: Your Final Window Only around 5 weeks remain until the official launch. And the window to get in at $9 is closing. The next phase moves to $10, with a launch price already locked at $20. This is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. So far, over 12,800 participants have joined, raising more than 5.6 million dollars. With every new registration, the momentum grows. And yes, Live Coin Watch has started reflecting it too. If there was ever a moment to grab a double-digit ROI potential before the rest of the market catches on, this is it. Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris is the closest thing we’ve seen to a second shot at early Bitcoin wealth. But this time, it comes with scalability, smart contracts, green mining, and actual tech upgrades that suit the modern digital world. With a major exchange listing on the horizon, BTC-S is not just preparing for launch. It’s preparing for liftoff.

2025-06-27T11:43:00,"Bakkt's Jump Into Bitcoin As A Treasury Strategy Distracts From Liquidity Angst","Summary Bakkt is pushing into the Bitcoin as a treasury for publicly listed companies trend. Liquidity continues to drop on a sequential basis with negative free cash flow during the first quarter coming in at $101 million. A $23.5 million private placement of convertible debentures post-period has extended BKKT's liquidity profile, but the company remains a sell. Bakkt ( BKKT ) is pivoting into buying and holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet as part of an updated investment policy that could also see the embattled crypto firm allocate capital in other digital assets. Investing in BTC as part of a corporate treasury strategy has been all the rage in 2025, popularized by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). The ongoing BTC rally has sparked a rush of companies emulating MSTR. BKKT's push into BTC as corporate treasury distracts from its underlying operations and ramping negative free cash flow profile that has dramatically slimmed its liquidity and threatens to push the company into further angst. I last covered BKKT in February with a sell rating, the stock has dipped nearly 10% since then and is set to go lower. BKKT held total cash, short-term investments, and restricted cash of $44.5 million as of the end of its fiscal 2025 first quarter. Removing the restricted cash component of this would place BKKT's short-term liquidity at a more than 3-year low, as negative free cash flow continues to compound angst. Data by YCharts Hence, the move to BTC as a treasury seems out of place with the company's ability to maintain normal operations from its existing liquidity balance. BKKT recorded first-quarter revenue of $1.07 billion , up 25.2% over its year-ago comp on the back of larger crypto services revenues even as revenues from loyalty services dipped. BKKT's crypto services segment is an intensely low-margin business with gross profit of just $11.12 million realized on its portion of revenue. Net income for the first quarter was positive at $7.7 million, up from a loss of $8.17 million in the year-ago period. Bulls would be right to flag that earnings per share (""EPS"") at $1.13 was a material improvement from negative EPS of $1.86 a year ago, with the commons now trading hands for a 2.86x multiple to annualized first quarter EPS. This would be a steal if BKKT could sustain EPS at its current level. Bakkt Holdings Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Form 10-Q Cash Flow, Liquidity, And Risk While BKKT generated positive EPS for the first quarter, the company's free cash flow during the first quarter was negative at $101 million, a deterioration from positive free cash flow of $36.6 million a year ago. The material change in cash flow came from a negative $76.5 million movement in customer funds available and a $32 million loss from changes in the fair value of warrant liability. The overall pace of free cash flow is materially unsustainable and BKKT needs to raise more cash. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was negative at $162 million, in excess of BKKT's total short-term liquidity balance. This has materially expanded doubts about the ability of BKKT to continue as a going concern. Data by YCharts Hence, the shift to BTC as a treasury could be partially viewed through the lens of BKKT pushing to catch some of the euphoric animal spirits that have propelled some crypto-related tickers to new highs this year and sparked a rush of IPOs. Newly listed Circle ( CRCL ) was up 10x from its IPO price at its peak with crypto exchange Gemini and Peter Thiel-backed Bullish filing to go public on the back of the raging enthusiasm for crypto firms. BKKT has since been able to raise $23.75 million through a private placement of convertible debentures. The debentures will mature after just one year and accrue interest at an annual rate of 0%. The deal will mean the non-restricted portion of BKKT's cash will more than double, providing some level of depth for continued operations even as cash burn remains negative. Data by YCharts BKKT's average diluted shares outstanding are up 151% over the last 3 years on the back of equity dilution needed to expand its runway. This currently stands at less than 12 months against the pace of BKKT's trailing 12-month negative free cash flow and the post-debenture raise in liquidity. The risks for the bears, who form the 21% short interest in BKKT, are that the surge in crypto enthusiasm spills over to a buyout offer. Prior speculation that Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ) caused the stock price to spike and there is a non-insignificant possibility of further speculation arising. However, I'm still rating BKKT as a sell on the back of its low liquidity balance, substantial equity dilution, and negative free cash flow. Liquidity has been dipping for 3 years straight and there has not been any fundamental evolution in the company's business model that would allow them to address this shortfall. Hence, BKKT remains a sell, the company's BTC as a treasury pivot is just not material as there isn't sufficient liquidity for BKKT to acquire BTC in large enough numbers and hold it as an investment while its cash position is in such a critical position.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797716-bakkts-jump-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-distracts-liquidity-angst?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","BKKT",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T11:35:14,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin Investing Rises Among Retail and Institutions","Crypto adoption has been steadily brewing beneath the surface, but in recent weeks, momentum has surged from both ends of the spectrum. Institutional accumulation has long been active, with major players snapping up digital assets on any perceived dip. But what is now turning heads is the return of retail capital. Wallet activity and order book data show that individuals are re-entering the market alongside the institutions. This convergence is important. Historically, major rallies have often emerged when both institutional capital and grassroots enthusiasm move in the same direction. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Deepens as Global Institutions Continue Stacking The data is unambiguous: Bitcoin supply on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded . This metric alone speaks volumes. It means fewer coins are available for trading and more are being tucked away into long-term storage. Investors, from individuals to multinationals, are not only holding; they are accumulating. Japan’s Metaplanet also made headlines by acquiring over 1,200 more BTC , raising its total holdings past Tesla’s. With more than 12,000 Bitcoin in reserve, it now ranks among the top corporate holders globally, just behind major mining firms. Meanwhile, the United States, once cautious, has turned its seized Bitcoin stash into a sovereign hedge fund of sorts. Over 200,000 coins now sit on the federal books, with further plans in motion to grow this reserve without touching taxpayer funds. BREAKING: 🇮🇳 BJP’s national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari ( @pradip103 ) highlights importance of #Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. pic.twitter.com/H5YcUJONQf — Crypto India (@CryptooIndia) June 26, 2025 What’s happening here isn’t a string of isolated purchases. Bhutan has quietly built a billion-dollar Bitcoin treasury through surplus hydropower. Pakistan has formalized its own crypto holdings. China, once infamous for its bans, now shows signs of opening up to digital assets in the financial sector. Even India, which has been long ambiguous in its crypto policy, is seeing top party officials call for a national reserve. None of these moves are short-term plays. They reflect a strategic shift in how nations and institutions are preparing for the future of finance. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and independence from central banks, is no longer treated as an experiment. It is being absorbed into portfolios, treasury sheets, and even sovereign policy as a safeguard against inflation, currency volatility, and economic shocks. This level of bullish sentiment and buying across the globe directly suggests a growing interest in potential adoption, making it one of the best periods to accumulate top projects that could turn out to be top gainers in the coming weeks or months. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Buying Intensifies Globally Best Wallet Token At a time when crypto ownership is becoming more widespread and investor profiles are diversifying, the tools that manage and protect digital assets are no longer just accessories. They are infrastructure. The Best Wallet Token fits squarely into this narrative, offering actual utility for a new generation of crypto users who demand both ease of use and layered protection. The token is built into a larger platform that aims to bridge the gap between wallet simplicity and advanced ecosystem access. Holders of the token get more than fee reductions or cosmetic perks. They gain access to curated airdrops, cross-chain swaps, staking modules, and early access to partner launches. In an environment where new users are entering the space and institutional flows are mounting, the need for an intelligent, incentivized wallet layer becomes critical. The Best Wallet platform does not try to reinvent what a wallet is, but rather redefines what a wallet can offer. Thanks to all this, the presale has already raised upwards of $13 million. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 In markets where both volatility and opportunity surge side by side, that extra layer of utility matters more than ever. Whether or not Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, the infrastructure supporting user entry points will remain in high demand. The Best Wallet Token, then, is not just tied to speculative value but to the expansion of user access itself. With the world preparing for broader adoption, smart access layers like this may be one of the few categories that can grow regardless of which tokens dominate the headlines. SUBBD As more capital enters the market and new cohorts of investors begin exploring how crypto can fit into real-world models, the role of creator-driven platforms is getting redefined. SUBBD is not merely trying to replicate what other social dApps or decentralized media hubs have done. It functions as a full-stack platform that gives content creators and curators actual ownership, while also engineering a model that incentivizes quality through tokenized patronage. The architecture of SUBBD allows for tiered monetization, reputation-building, and interactive sponsorships, but all of it happens without the platform taking control of either the audience or the revenue. This is what makes it distinct. As more capital flows into Bitcoin and institutional players begin looking for assets with measurable social stickiness, platforms like SUBBD emerge as a new kind of asset class. They are not tied to volatility or hash rates, but to user engagement and cultural currency. And because SUBBD’s model is designed around direct creator-to-audience monetization with transparent reward loops, its growth potential aligns with both the macro rise in content spending and the micro-behavior of users seeking alternative platforms. As this market matures, creator-led economies will likely command greater relevance, and projects that have already structured themselves to function natively within these systems will have a head start. In that sense, SUBBD is not chasing trends; it is laying the groundwork for a creative economy that can flourish regardless of which coins are rallying. Snorter Snorter enters a category that often gets dismissed too quickly. It is built on a meme aesthetic, operates on Solana, and interacts with real-time trading. But under the surface, the architecture of Snorter is anything but trivial. It functions as a meme-trading robot designed for users who want speed, reflexive order execution, and access to social signals without having to rely on large terminals or manual inputs. Snorter’s appeal lies in the fact that it mirrors what the most successful meme coin traders already do: identify early momentum, lean into social virality, and move funds quickly. However, it removes the friction and guesswork by using algorithmic routing and real-time triggers. As meme culture deepens its role in defining the speculative edges of crypto markets, tools like Snorter begin to carry real value. More than just a bot, it is a behavioral model distilled into executable code. And in a cycle where both retail and institutional players are showing interest, Snorter offers a method of interacting with momentum markets that neither relies on sustained hype nor depends on sophisticated onboarding. For traders who want to stay agile without spending hours glued to charts, it becomes a functional companion. The project has already been endorsed by top crypto YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins , adding to its existing popularity further. With Solana's low latency and Snorter’s smart integration of sentiment and volume signals, it quietly sets a new benchmark for how meme tokens can be tracked, traded, and navigated. If this market stays hot, Snorter becomes a serious edge, not a novelty. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper exists to answer a question that has lingered for over a decade: can Bitcoin become more than just a store of value without compromising its core principles? The project’s answer is not theoretical. It is operational. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper introduces a true Layer 2 experience for BTC that does not rely on custodians, shortcuts, or abstractions. Instead, it allows Bitcoin to be bridged into a high-speed environment where fees are negligible, finality is near-instant, and smart contract functionality is unlocked. This transforms Bitcoin from a passive asset into an active network, capable of hosting DeFi, supporting micro-payments, enabling staking, and running dApps. In a climate where both institutional and retail investors are accumulating Bitcoin with the expectation of long-term relevance, Bitcoin Hyper proposes a model where that relevance includes functionality. It does not replace BTC. It extends it. Investors who already believe in Bitcoin’s scarcity model now have a way to explore its utility without converting to another chain. This becomes even more significant when viewed through the lens of the broader crypto momentum currently underway. With countries building strategic reserves and institutions treating Bitcoin as financial infrastructure, any solution that can unlock new layers of use while preserving Bitcoin’s foundation becomes inherently valuable. Bitcoin Hyper’s architecture ensures that the original chain remains untouched, but its potential is no longer gated. It is not just a faster version of Bitcoin, but also one that finally begins to move. Conclusion Both institutional giants and everyday investors are now actively accumulating Bitcoin and other digital assets. This convergence signals not just optimism, but confidence in a longer-term shift toward crypto integration at every level, from national reserves to individual portfolios. In such a climate, identifying projects with actual utility becomes essential. The tokens mentioned above are not speculative flashes. They represent infrastructure, innovation, and cultural alignment with where this market is heading. With accumulation already underway, this moment offers a strategic entry point before broader adoption drives valuations sharply upward.

2025-06-27T11:30:45,"Top Analyst Predicts New Bitcoin Peak Timeline And ‘Double Cycle Blowoff’","Veteran crypto analyst Bob Loukas has delivered a Bitcoin update suggesting that the asset could be entering the “perfect storm” phase of its four-year cycle. But in a twist that defies traditional cycle models, Loukas now sees the possibility of a delayed blowoff top extending into early 2026 and introduces the prospect of a rare double-cycle structure. In his latest installment of the Four-Year Journey published on June 26, Loukas reaffirms that the current Bitcoin cycle — which began with the November 2022 low — remains structurally intact and is nearing its climactic phase. “This is certainly the most bullish phase of the four-year cycle,” Loukas states. “We’re now sort of on the cusp of what traditionally has been the beginning or the blowoff phase of a cycle.” Bitcoin Blowoff Delayed? What separates this cycle, according to Loukas, is the unique combination of maturing fundamentals and a confluence of macro, institutional, and regulatory forces. These include continued ETF inflows, corporate treasury adoption, and a radical policy shift under the Trump administration, including what he anticipates may be a pro-crypto Fed chair appointment. Together, these forces are creating what he calls a “perfect storm” for price expansion. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Loukas is cautious about providing hard price targets but acknowledges a doubling effect that could send Bitcoin from its current range near $110,000 to as high as $150,000–$170,000 in the short term. Historically, such phases have seen Bitcoin double in a matter of months once new highs are breached. “A breakout to the upside can see Bitcoin essentially almost double in a very short period of time,” he says, pointing to prior legs of the cycle where Bitcoin surged from $25K to $75K or $50K to $100K within five-month windows. Yet what makes this latest report particularly notable is Loukas’ introduction of a more complex structure he calls a “double cycle blowoff.” He describes this as a fusion of two adjacent four-year cycle peaks — a concept that could delay the market top to as late as February or March 2026, well beyond the traditional 35-month cycle peak window. “If we’ve still got sort of a six to seven month expansion to a peak… that would lead us into maybe even a February or March peak,” Loukas explains. This scenario, while still within the broader cyclical rhythm, would imply a 39–41 month uptrend rather than the typical 33–35 months. “I do think it’s time… 15–16 years into Bitcoin’s adoption,” he notes, referencing the arc from early tech believers to deep institutional penetration. Related Reading: $179,000 Or $79,000? Bitcoin Faces Critical Cycle Pivot, Says Analyst The implications are significant. A delayed peak could mean a much shorter corrective phase — or even the emergence of a second explosive rally as the next cycle begins, creating what Loukas describes as the illusion of one extended supercycle. “There’s a significant upside potential still to come in this cycle,” he says, warning that many may be caught off guard. “You don’t want to be surprised.” BTC Price Targets Loukas also addresses the broader sentiment picture, noting that the typical mania — the kind that marked tops in 2017 and late 2021 — has not yet materialized. “We haven’t seen that sort of blowoff, absolute extreme sentiment that you typically would see near the top,” he says. He sees this as further evidence that the final phase is still ahead. Regarding the price target for a supercycle, Loukas ponders: “I can see numbers in the quarter of a million level. I can also see some really crazy numbers when you see prior manias and bubbles in different asset classes, Seeing a 5x, 6x, 7x move from here over a 2-year period in a major mania is not really a stretch. Even from a market cap perspective, it’s not a stretch, seeing where gold is already heading through the $20 trillion level and well beyond.” While he emphasizes that these ideas are probabilistic and not predictions, Loukas does warn of the long-term consequences if his double-cycle thesis plays out. A massive influx of institutional capital, sovereign interest, and retail mania could ultimately trigger Bitcoin’s first true secular bear market, one not measured in months but in years. “If you consider a mania leadup where so many treasury companies and traditional flows come together and peak… the unwinding process just takes a lot longer.” For now, Loukas’ model portfolio remains partially in cash after trimming some positions near recent highs, reflecting a conservative approach tailored to capital preservation. Still, he acknowledges that younger or more risk-tolerant investors may view this moment as a final accumulation window before the next phase begins. “This video is very, very bullish, right?” he quips. At press time, BTC traded at $107,317.

The company says it could recover more than $1 billion in damages from the combined cases. In a press release on Thursday, the Singapore-based company announced that its board of directors has approved a distribution plan for any net damages it recovers. According to the statement, 50% of any funds won in court would be paid out to shareholders as a special dividend, while the remaining 50% would be used to purchase Bitcoin. CEO Roger Hamilton said the decision was made to ensure that any court victories benefit shareholders directly. “The Company has two legal cases, one filed and one pending, in which we are seeking combined damages of over $1 billion,” he said. Genius Group Targets $1B in Damages—50% to Shareholders, 50% to Bitcoin The company’s first lawsuit, already filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeks over $750 million in damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The suit names four individuals, including former SEC Chairman John Clayton, and alleges misconduct that caused financial harm to Genius Group. A second lawsuit is still pending and centers on allegations of naked short selling and market manipulation. The firm says preliminary analysis of its 2023 trading data shows damages between $251 million and $262 million. Its legal team, led by attorney Wes Christian, is currently updating the claim with more recent trading records, and expects the damage estimate to increase significantly before filing. “As both lawsuits are being pursued by the Company to recover damages caused by third parties directly to our shareholders, the Board believes that 100% of any proceeds from the successful outcome of these cases should be directly distributed or reinvested for the benefit of shareholders.” Roger said. 50% of legal wins go to $GNS shareholders as special dividend, 50% to $BTC Bitcoin Treasury.

There’s no timeline yet for when either case may conclude, and the company cautioned that there’s no certainty around the final outcome or the amount of damages it may recover. Still, Genius Group has laid out a clear post-trial roadmap. Once any net damages are collected, after deducting legal fees, recovery costs, and taxes, the funds will be split. Shareholders would receive a dividend, while the company would use the other half to add to its Bitcoin holdings. If successful, the strategy could set the stage for one of the largest corporate Bitcoin purchases linked directly to litigation proceeds. The company did not disclose how much Bitcoin it currently holds but has previously described itself as a “Bitcoin-first” organization . Genius Group is listed on the NYSE American under the ticker GNS. Any payouts or purchases will follow regulations from the SEC, the NYSE, and Singaporean authorities. Court Drama Eases as Genius Group Resumes Bitcoin Buying Spree Post Legal Freeze Following a turbulent legal standoff that saw Genius Group barred from raising funds and forced to offload part of its Bitcoin treasury, the education and AI-focused firm is now back on the offensive. On April 3, a New York court temporarily prohibited Genius Group from selling shares or using investor funds to purchase Bitcoin, citing ongoing lawsuits linked to its scrapped deal with Fatbrain AI (LZGI).

This trove amounts to nearly 40% of the Himalayan kingdom’s gross domestic product (GDP), making it one of the most crypto -exposed nations on earth. Bhutan’s crypto holdings. Source: Arkham Intel Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings, long kept under wraps, are managed by the state-owned Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the government’s commercial arm. “For Bhutan, it was quite obvious in a lot of ways,” said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of DHI, in a rare public comment. Dahal noted that the nation’s abundant hydropower resources provided a clear path to low-cost, sustainable Bitcoin mining , a strategic advantage that few other countries can replicate. Bhutan starts mining Bitcoin in 2020 Bhutan began mining Bitcoin as early as 2020, leveraging its green energy surplus to enter the crypto space with minimal environmental footprint. While several nations have dabbled in BTC holdings or regulation, Bhutan’s deep, long-term integration into the asset class sets it apart, not only in scale but in intent. Bhutan’s holdings now surpass those of Ukraine and El Salvador, trailing only the United States and China in terms of on-chain government Bitcoin reserves. In addition to its Bitcoin position, Bhutan also holds over $1 million in Ethereum , making ETH the second-largest digital asset in its portfolio. While modest by comparison, this secondary exposure reflects an intentional diversification strategy in the broader crypto market. The implications of Bhutan’s strategy could be far-reaching.

And in this shift, Bitcoin stands out as a likely beneficiary, Lienkha says. BTC currently trades within a broad sideways range between $90,000 and $110,000. Additionally, it is near its all-time high. Per Lienkha, the coin could move towards $130,000. “If the positive momentum in equities continues and global risk appetite strengthens further,” he notes, “Bitcoin could break out of its current range and potentially initiate a new leg higher, potentially targeting the $130,000 level in the medium term.” The $93k–$100k range remains a key structural support zone for $BTC , with dense accumulation from Q1.

That said, it “doesn’t necessarily prove hypersensitivity to geopolitics,” he says. Per historical data, BTC usually weathers spikes during geopolitical events, recouping losses within weeks. Also, the latest recovery appears intertwined with several macro factors. These include a weaker US dollar, reduced oil prices, renewed US Federal Reserve rate cut bets, and sustained ETF inflows. Furthermore, Donald Trump said he planned to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “This, more than any other macroeconomic factor, has the ability to cause more short-term financial havoc,” Toledano says. Overall, headlines often provoke short‑term moves, but “long‑term direction is driven by fundamentals and Bitcoin is only going one way as far as the arc of history is concerned,” he concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $107,367. Actually, earlier in the day, the coin briefly fell to 98,974 before recovering to the current level. The intraday high is $107,985. Currently, the price is still trying to hold above the $108,100 level. Next targets would be $110,490 and $112,080. Bitcoin Price Chart.

2025-06-27T11:16:42,"Genius and Clarity Acts could be fast-tracked to Trump’s desk as early as by July","The US might be on the brink of its biggest crypto moment yet, but it is coming with a full dose of political theater, stablecoins, and Trump-branded urgency. House Republicans are reportedly prepping to deliver the Senate’s landmark GENIUS Act to President Trump’s desk as early as the week of July 7. At the same time, they’re eyeing a vote on the long-awaited crypto market structure bill, CLARITY Act. It is anticipated that the House might package both bills together in a single procedural vote. This can be a legislative two-for-one special voting, which is now turbocharged by Trump’s all-caps tweet, “LIGHTNING FAST.” Crypto bills near Trump’s desk The GENIUS Act is not a small bill, as it might sound. This is the first serious attempt to give US dollar-pegged stablecoins proper federal guardrails and a legal backup to private digital dollar issuers. It passed the Senate with a strong bipartisan 68-30 vote and sent a clear signal that crypto’s moving to Washington. Trump’s digital asset empire and 2024 campaign have been powered by some big crypto players, meme coins, and David Sacks. In an X post, the Crypto Czar stated that “July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate!” Sacks even thanked Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Senator Cynthia Lummis for laying down a clear timeline and plan for crypto market structure legislation. This includes introducing the bill before August recess, marking it up in the first week of September, and getting it done by the end of the month. He added that President Trump supports CLARITY on market structure as well as GENIUS on stablecoins. July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate! — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) June 26, 2025 The strategy here seems clear: ride the bipartisan momentum of stablecoin regulation to pull the broader market structure bill across the finish line. It’s a political high-wire act because while GENIUS has Senate traction, the CLARITY Act faces a rockier path, with agriculture and banking committees still weighing in. However, if anyone can turn regulatory chaos into a political showstopper, it’s Trump. House rushes crypto bills According to reports , Capitol Hill aides say conversations are still underway on how to move both bills forward. Committee chairs like French Hill and Tim Scott are threading the needle to make sure the crypto industry, which poured $250 million into this election cycle, gets the clarity it’s been asking for. Meanwhile, the White House Council on Digital Assets, helmed by Bo Hines, is talking openly about making the US “welcoming” again for innovators. That’s a serious pivot from the “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ” just a year ago. If the House moves fast in July, Trump could be signing the first federal crypto law in US history before summer ends and setting the stage for a regulatory framework that turns the US into the next crypto capital. The digital assets market is still stuck in turbulence, while Bitcoin is sailing the high waves alone. As all the major altcoins printed red indexes, BTC price is slowly moving towards its recent all-time high. Despite fresh pullbacks, Bitcoin is trading over $107k. The cumulative crypto market cap hovers around $3.28 trillion, with a trading volume of $100 billion. The stablecoin market saw some bullish updates lately and its total market cap moved to breach the $260 billion mark. Tether’s USDT is still the king of the category as it holds $157.5 billion of the market cap with a trading volume of over $38 billion. USDC stands second in the tally with a cap of $61.6 billion.

2025-06-27T11:10:16,"South Korea’s Pivotal Move: Lawmaker Seeks Crypto ETFs Under Capital Markets Act","BitcoinWorld South Korea’s Pivotal Move: Lawmaker Seeks Crypto ETFs Under Capital Markets Act A significant development is unfolding in the world of finance and digital assets, especially for those keenly following the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. South Korea, a nation known for its technological prowess and dynamic financial markets, is on the cusp of a potentially groundbreaking legislative change. This move could redefine how investors interact with digital assets, paving the way for mainstream adoption through regulated financial products. Are you ready for a new era of South Korea crypto investment? Understanding the Proposed Amendment to the Capital Markets Act At the heart of this exciting development is a legislative initiative spearheaded by Min Byeong-dug, a prominent lawmaker from South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party. He has introduced a bill aimed at amending the nation’s pivotal Capital Markets Act. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental re-evaluation of what can be considered an ‘underlying asset’ within financial products. The current framework of the Capital Markets Act, like many traditional financial regulations globally, was not originally designed with cryptocurrencies in mind. Its definitions of assets and trust properties primarily encompass conventional financial instruments, commodities, and real estate. The proposed amendment seeks to expand these definitions explicitly to include digital assets such as Bitcoin. Why is this amendment so crucial? Legal Foundation: It would establish a clear legal basis for using cryptocurrencies in various financial instruments, most notably Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Without this, institutions face significant legal ambiguity and regulatory hurdles when attempting to incorporate digital assets. Trustee Management: The amendment would empower trustees – the entities responsible for holding and managing assets on behalf of investors – to legally hold and manage cryptocurrencies. This is a critical step for creating secure and compliant investment vehicles. Market Expansion: By providing regulatory clarity, the bill aims to unlock new investment opportunities, allowing a broader range of investors to gain exposure to the crypto market through regulated channels. This legislative push signifies a growing recognition within South Korea’s political landscape of the permanence and potential of digital assets. It moves beyond treating cryptocurrencies merely as speculative assets and instead positions them as legitimate components of the broader financial ecosystem. The Dawn of Crypto ETFs in South Korea: What Does it Mean? The primary implication of this bill, if passed, is the potential creation of crypto ETFs in South Korea. An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. It holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and typically tracks an underlying index. For cryptocurrencies, an ETF would track the price of one or more digital assets, offering investors exposure without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrencies. How do Crypto ETFs benefit investors and the market? The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs and other digital asset ETFs offers several compelling advantages: Accessibility: ETFs are widely understood and accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This means retail investors, who might find direct crypto purchases daunting, can easily invest in digital assets through familiar platforms. Security: Investing through an ETF means the underlying assets are held by professional custodians, mitigating risks associated with self-custody (like losing private keys or security breaches on exchanges). Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices, similar to stocks. Diversification: A crypto ETF could hold a basket of different digital assets, offering instant diversification and reducing risk compared to investing in a single cryptocurrency. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs operate under the scrutiny of financial regulators, providing an added layer of investor protection and legitimacy to the crypto market. This move is not isolated; it reflects a global trend. Countries like Canada and several European nations have already launched crypto ETFs, while the United States recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a monumental shift in institutional acceptance. South Korea’s potential entry into this space would further legitimize digital assets on the global financial stage. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities for Digital Asset ETFs While the prospect of digital asset ETFs is exciting, the path forward is not without its challenges. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and regulators worldwide grapple with how to best protect investors while fostering innovation. Potential Challenges to Consider: Market Volatility: The inherent price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies pose a challenge for traditional investment products. Regulators will need to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to manage these risks. Regulatory Nuances: Even with the amendment, the specific rules for crypto ETFs – such as custody requirements, valuation methodologies, and investor suitability – will need to be meticulously crafted and enforced by financial authorities. Investor Education: Despite the simplified access, investors will still need to understand the unique risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, even within an ETF wrapper. Global Coordination: As crypto markets are global, South Korea’s regulatory approach will ideally need to consider international standards and practices to prevent regulatory arbitrage. However, the opportunities presented by this legislation far outweigh the challenges. It could position South Korea as a leader in digital asset innovation in Asia, attracting foreign investment and fostering a robust domestic crypto ecosystem. It also aligns with the global trend of integrating digital assets into traditional finance, making South Korea’s financial markets more modern and competitive. South Korea’s Broader Crypto Landscape: Beyond ETFs This bill is part of a larger narrative unfolding in South Korea crypto regulation. The country has been actively working on a comprehensive framework for digital assets, recognizing their growing importance. For instance, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been tightening regulations on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to combat money laundering and ensure investor protection. The proposed amendment to the Capital Markets Act complements these efforts by focusing on investment products. Key Aspects of South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Stance: Aspect Description Specific Financial Transactions Act Requires crypto exchanges to register with the financial intelligence unit (FIU) and implement strict AML/CFT measures. Investor Protection Ongoing efforts to enhance safeguards for crypto investors, including measures against unfair trading practices. CBDC Research The Bank of Korea is actively researching and piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), indicating a broader embrace of digital currency concepts. Blockchain Innovation Strong government support for blockchain technology development across various sectors, including finance, logistics, and public services. The introduction of this bill is a clear signal that South Korea is moving towards a more inclusive and regulated digital asset market. It’s about bringing crypto out of the shadows and into the regulated light of traditional finance, offering a safer and more familiar pathway for a wider range of investors. What’s Next for South Korea Crypto Investors? The bill introduced by Min Byeong-dug is currently in its legislative process. It will need to undergo review and approval by various committees and ultimately be passed by the National Assembly to become law. While the support from the ruling party bodes well, the exact timeline and any potential modifications to the bill remain to be seen. For investors, this development signifies a potential opening of new, regulated avenues to access the crypto market. It suggests a future where investing in Bitcoin or other digital assets could be as straightforward as buying shares in a traditional company. This shift could significantly increase institutional participation and bring more stability and maturity to the South Korea crypto market. The proposed amendment to the Capital Markets Act is more than just a legislative change; it’s a statement of intent. South Korea is signaling its readiness to embrace digital assets within its established financial framework, setting the stage for a new era of investment opportunities. The potential for crypto ETFs , including Bitcoin ETFs and broader digital asset ETFs , promises greater accessibility, security, and legitimacy for the burgeoning crypto space. As the world watches, South Korea’s move could inspire other nations to follow suit, further solidifying cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and integral part of the global financial landscape. This is a pivotal moment that could reshape investment strategies and accelerate mainstream adoption.

According to a recent post on X, Adler Jr. found that the average monthly exchange inflow for altcoins has dropped 36% from the annual average capital flow of $2.5 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, on June 27, the average monthly altcoin exchange inflow stands at $1.6 billion. It fell by $900 million from the annual average monthly exchange flow of $2.5 billion. “This moderate flow suggests asset consolidation and growing accumulation potential ahead of the next altseason wave,” said Adler Jr in his post . As of June 27, the average monthly altcoin exchange flow stands at $1.6B, below the annual average of $2.5B.

Even before then, the market experienced a similar cycle indicated by the drop in altcoin exchange flow below the baseline in the second half of 2023. “In each instance, low exchange flows preceded significant altcoin price rallies,” said Adler Jr. You might also like: Why is crypto down today : SOL, XRP and memecoins plummet amidst Bitcoin dominance rise CryptoQuant: How exchange flow could indicate the next altcoin wave When there is less capital flowing into crypto exchanges , it signals less selling pressure. This means that more investors are accumulating assets instead of offloading them on exchanges. They could be in the process of anticipating the next price rebound. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, each time the exchange flow falls below the $1.6 billion mark, it becomes a precedent to significant altcoin rallies. This means that if the exchange inflow slips lower than $1.6 billion, it could result in the next “altcoin season.” As inflows dry up, capital often shifts from short-term speculation toward longer-term holdings, or even toward Bitcoin ( BTC ). But once crypto asset accumulation builds, capital will be able to rotate back into altcoins with greater force, triggering the second phase of the cycle. The data from CryptoQuant suggests that traders are currently entering the transition phase right before the next altcoin cycle. A prolonged dip in exchange inflows supports accumulation, a classic setup for future rally potential. If this holds, the timing could align with broader market recovery and rotation into higher-risk assets.

2025-06-27T11:05:40,"‘Trump’s administration has rapidly reshaped US crypto policy’ – Bybit x Block Scholes Report","A new report shared with Finbold on June 27 by Bybit and Block Scholes highlights how recent U.S. regulatory shifts under President Trump’s administration are accelerating crypto adoption . The administration has appointed pro-crypto regulators across key agencies, ended major lawsuits that had created regulatory uncertainty, clarified staking rules, and provided support for exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) approvals. According to the report, these developments could have far-reaching effects on institutional adoption and global regulatory momentum. The GENIUS Act While Bitcoin ETF approvals have dominated headlines, industry analysts suggest the GENIUS Act may prove to be the most consequential development in US crypto policy to date. The legislation establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the issuance of stablecoins , addressing what experts describe as a core infrastructure gap in the digital asset ecosystem. Stablecoins serve as the critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based systems, and the GENIUS Act provides the regulatory clarity needed to unlock institutional participation and broader public trust. Ratio of stablecoin market cap to M2. Source: Block Scholes The timing appears critical, as stablecoin market capitalization is growing significantly faster than the traditional M2 money supply, with the US Secretary of the Treasury estimating it will exceed $2 trillion. The BITCOIN Act Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposed BITCOIN Act would direct the US Treasury to accumulate 1 million bitcoins over five years, creating a strategic reserve that could “reduce our national debt by half” if held for 20 years, according to Lummis. BTC mined vs BTC bought by government. Source: Block Scholes The government would purchase 200,000 bitcoins annually (roughly 550 per day), amounting to approximately $57 million daily at current prices. This stockpile would surpass the holdings of all publicly traded companies. The bill is already influencing state-level policy. New Hampshire passed HB 302 in May 2025, allowing up to 5% of its public funds to be invested in Bitcoin. Arizona followed with Bill 2749, creating a reserve from abandoned digital assets. Catching up with the US This U.S. momentum has inspired similar moves worldwide. For example, South Korea elected crypto-friendly President Lee Jae-myung, who introduced the Basic Digital Asset Act, enabling non-bank institutions to issue won-backed stablecoins. Additionally, Pakistan unveiled a national Bitcoin strategic reserve and the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority in May 2025, citing inspiration from US policy. The initiative includes a major mining commitment of up to 2,000 MW of energy. Meanwhile, the EU’s MiCA framework, upcoming UK reforms, and developments in the Middle East are creating more unified markets for digital assets. Some UK politicians have proposed Bitcoin reserves and crypto tax reforms, echoing similar initiatives in the US. Featured image via Shutterstock.

The filing, submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, outlines Bakkt’s plan to issue a mix of Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants to strengthen its treasury strategy. New Crypto Treasury Strategy According to the Form S-3 filing, Bakkt updated its investment policy earlier this month to allow capital allocation into Bitcoin and other digital assets, although the company has not yet executed its first purchase. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources,” the filing stated, indicating flexibility in its approach. This “shelf registration” provides Bakkt with the ability to access capital markets swiftly when conditions align, a critical option as the company faces ongoing financial challenges, including a history of operating losses and concerns over its ability to continue as a going concern. Market Timing Key as Bakkt Navigates Challenges Founded in 2018, Bakkt has struggled to maintain momentum , admitting in its filing that it has a “limited operating history and a history of operating losses.” The company noted that its decisions on crypto purchases would depend on market dynamics, capital availability, and strategic goals. Bakkt’s share price gained 3% on Thursday, closing at $13.33, though it remains down 46% since the beginning of the year. In March, Bakkt shares fell 30% following news that major clients, Bank of America and Webull, chose not to renew their agreements with the company, adding further pressure on its stock performance. Despite these hurdles, Bakkt sees promise in the broader crypto environment, recently commenting on X that the wave of crypto IPOs, including those from Circle , eToro, and Gemini, signals renewed momentum for digital assets. “These developments bring validation, visibility, and maturity to the market,” the company noted, underlining its belief in crypto’s growing legitimacy.

At this point, BTC’s last ATH was at $111,900, with new ATHs expected to follow. While Bitcoin has broken many new records in recent months, many altcoins, including the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH), are still trading below their previous ATHs. As investors await the start of the delayed altcoin season, analyst Axel Adler shared the bullish signal he sees for altcoins. Accordingly, the analyst, who examined the average monthly change flow data of altcoins, argued that this data led to sharp increases in altcoin prices. At this point, Axel Adler said that the average monthly trading volume of altcoins is currently at $1.6 billion, which is lower than the annual average of $2.5 billion. The analyst noted that average flow at these levels points to consolidation and increased accumulation potential for altcoins ahead of the next altseason. Referring to previous data in his analysis, the analyst stated that the average monthly trading volume of altcoins had previously fallen below the monthly base line of $1.6 billion, and then experienced major increases. According to the shared chart, the altcoin’s average monthly trading volume fell below the $1.6 billion monthly baseline in early 2023, the second half of 2023, and August-September 2024. “Historically, in any case, low trading volumes have usually preceded significant price increases in altcoins,” the analyst said.

2025-06-27T10:57:00,"Bitcoin Set For New Highs As Blackrock Buys For 16 Days Straight, Remittix and Ethereum Prices To Follow","Bitcoin has seen continuous support from institutional players, with BlackRock reportedly buying for 16 days in a row. This is reinforcing bullish sentiment as the market anticipates new all-time highs. The momentum is also affecting other major assets, with the Ethereum price showing signs of steady growth. Remittix , a newer player in the market, is also gaining attention as capital flows shift toward promising altcoins. Remittix Is Building the Payment Layer Crypto Promised Remittix is gaining attention for its focus on utility in the crypto-to-fiat space. It allows users to convert major crypto assets like BTC and ETH into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts. The process is streamlined, with flat fees and no added foreign exchange charges. Its main appeal lies in how easily it fits into everyday financial activity. Crypto holders can manage payments without needing their recipients to know the transaction started in digital assets. That design will likely gain interest from businesses, especially with the Remittix Pay API offering custom payment routing and fiat settlement options. Remittix’s value grows stronger in markets where remittance services are still expensive and slow. As blockchain adoption rises and platforms seek scalable solutions, Remittix could become a standard tool in regions underserved by traditional finance. Support for over 30 fiat currencies and more than 50 crypto pairs gives it flexibility few rivals offer. If integrations continue across payment platforms and merchant tools, its network effect could widen. Market analysts looking for sustainable infrastructure in crypto will likely track Remittix closely as the year unfolds. BlackRock Marks 16 Days of BTC Buys, Signals Long-Term Conviction BlackRock has extended its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation streak to 16 consecutive days, recently adding another $430 million worth of BTC to its holdings. Notably, there have been zero outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF throughout this period. This sustained inflow signals a long-term positioning strategy rather than short-term speculation. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s illiquid supply has climbed above 14 million BTC, according to the latest on-chain data. This metric tracks coins held in wallets with minimal historical selling activity, indicating that a growing portion of BTC is being locked away by holders unwilling to part with their assets. The result is a supply squeeze that may compound price volatility during bullish inflows. Source: CoinMarketCap Ethereum Price Approaches Key Resistance With Bullish Momentum Returning Ethereum is on the surge again after its June 23 slump. According to the charts, Ethereum remains one of the few major Layer 1 assets consistently showing structural strength despite volatility. Market sentiment has also improved with recent stabilization that has given ETH room to breathe. A key focus for crypto traders is Ethereum’s ability to reclaim and hold the $2,800 level as support. So far, price action has aligned with historical patterns of recovery and current volume trends reinforce a narrative of growing accumulation. If bulls can maintain momentum through the current ETH resistance, technical models point to a potential run toward higher mid-range targets. Source: CoinMarketCap Conclusion As institutional money floods into BTC and ETH, retail investors looking for meaningful upside may find their best bet in infrastructure tokens like RTX . With low fees, strong API tools and broad fiat coverage, Remittix is becoming the solution to PayFi potholes. At $0.0811, this isn’t a moment to watch. It’s a moment to act.

The report analyzes a new wave of regulatory momentum under the Trump administration, highlighting how new laws could institutionalize digital assets and cement the leadership role of the U.S. in the crypto industry. The report outlines key regulatory developments under the Trump administration that have boosted investors’ confidence in crypto. The industry stands at the intersection of the dollar’s legacy hegemony, favorable policy shifts in the U.S., and the global trend of increasing regulatory clarity. Institutional and official acceptance of crypto—from stablecoins to BTC, is being coded into laws. Key Insights: Reinventing the USD – the GENIUS Act: To rejuvenate the greenback’s dominance in the international financial system, U.S. lawmakers have long been pushing for digital asset legislation that can balance consumer protection and innovation. This underscores the GENIUS Act’s significance as the U.S. asserts its might in a volatile world: the future of money will still be denominated in the U.S. dollar. A million BTC in reserves: U.S. legislators are seeking creative ways to defuse America’s time-ticking debt bomb. Some of them are turning to BTC. The newly proposed BITCOIN Act, if passed, will open up demands for 200,000 BTC annually to form part of the U.S. Treasury’s strategic BTC reserves. This will not only cause BTC prices to shoot up, but also signal deeper implications for public recognition and adoption of digital assets.

2025-06-27T10:50:07,"Decoding Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin’s Reign Grips the Crypto Market Now","BitcoinWorld Decoding Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin’s Reign Grips the Crypto Market Now Are you feeling the chill in the air for your altcoin portfolio? The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods where Bitcoin leads the charge and times when altcoins steal the spotlight. Currently, all signs point to a definitive Bitcoin Season , and understanding why is crucial for every investor. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal About Crypto Market Trends? The Altcoin Season Index, a pivotal metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), currently stands at a modest 18 as of June 27, 00:30 UTC. This figure, consistent with recent reports, paints a clear picture: the market is firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this index signify, and why is it such an important indicator for crypto market trends ? The index is designed to provide a snapshot of market dominance. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Here’s a quick breakdown of its mechanics: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season, a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is typically when smaller cap coins see massive gains, often dwarfing Bitcoin’s returns. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is upon us when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that Bitcoin is either holding its value stronger, or appreciating at a faster rate than the majority of the altcoin market. The index scores range from 1 to 100. A score of 18 means that a very small percentage of altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin recently, underscoring Bitcoin’s current dominance. This isn’t just a number; it’s a critical signal for how capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: A Historical Perspective The ebb and flow between Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season is a fundamental cycle within the cryptocurrency market. These cycles are driven by a complex interplay of factors, including market sentiment, technological advancements, macroeconomic conditions, and investor behavior. Historically, Bitcoin often leads bull runs, acting as the primary entry point for new capital into the crypto space. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or reaches new highs, some of that capital tends to ‘rotate’ into altcoins, especially those with strong fundamentals, promising technology, or emerging narratives. This rotation fuels the Altcoin Season, where a wider array of digital assets experience significant price appreciation. Key Characteristics of Each Season: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Dominant Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Various Altcoins Capital Flow New money often flows into BTC first; existing capital consolidates in BTC. Capital rotates from BTC into altcoins; speculative money seeks higher returns. Risk Profile Relatively lower volatility compared to altcoins; perceived as a ‘safe haven’ within crypto. Higher volatility; potential for massive gains but also significant losses. Investor Behavior Focus on foundational strength, institutional adoption, macro trends. Focus on narratives, technological breakthroughs, smaller market cap projects. Index Range (CMC) Typically below 25 Typically above 75 Currently, with the Altcoin Index at 18, we are clearly in a phase where Bitcoin is the preferred asset. This could be due to several factors: institutional interest consolidating around Bitcoin ETFs, global economic uncertainties pushing investors towards perceived safer assets, or simply a period of consolidation after previous altcoin rallies. Navigating Your Portfolio: Strategies for Current Cryptocurrency Performance Given the current market climate, where cryptocurrency performance is largely dictated by Bitcoin, how should investors adjust their strategies? This period presents both challenges and unique opportunities. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: Many altcoins may struggle to gain traction or even decline against Bitcoin, leading to frustration for those heavily invested in them. Lower Liquidity: Smaller altcoins might experience lower trading volumes, making it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. FOMO on Bitcoin: As Bitcoin rises, there’s a risk of chasing its gains late in the cycle, potentially leading to losses if a correction occurs. Actionable Insights for Investors: Prioritize Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe the Bitcoin Season will persist, increasing your allocation to BTC might be a prudent move. This could involve converting some altcoins into Bitcoin, or directing new capital towards it. Research Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, certain altcoins with genuinely strong technology, active development, and clear use cases may still perform well or offer excellent long-term accumulation opportunities. Look for projects that solve real-world problems or are building critical infrastructure. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider DCA into your preferred assets. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price, which helps mitigate risk over time. Set Realistic Expectations: Understand that not all altcoins will moon during a Bitcoin Season. Adjust your profit targets and be prepared for slower growth or even temporary declines in your altcoin holdings. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep a close eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. A significant drop in Bitcoin Dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Example: During past Bitcoin-led rallies, assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) might still see some gains due to their strong ecosystems and widespread adoption, but many smaller, less established altcoins might languish. This is a time for patience and strategic accumulation for future Altcoin Seasons. What Factors Influence Bitcoin and Altcoin Season Shifts? Understanding the drivers behind these market shifts is key to anticipating future movements. While the Altcoin Season Index gives us a current reading, several macro and micro factors influence whether Bitcoin or altcoins will lead the charge. Key Influencing Factors: Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin halvings (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have been precursors to significant bull runs, often starting with Bitcoin leading, followed by altcoin surges. Macroeconomic Environment: Global inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and traditional market performance (e.g., stock market) can all influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. During times of uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Institutional Adoption: The entry of large financial institutions (e.g., through Bitcoin ETFs) brings significant capital and legitimacy to Bitcoin, often strengthening its dominance. Technological Breakthroughs/Narratives: New innovations within the altcoin space (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, AI integration) can spark new altcoin rallies, creating specific ‘mini-seasons’ for certain sectors. Regulatory Landscape: Clearer or more favorable regulations can boost confidence in the entire crypto market, but sometimes specific regulations might favor established assets like Bitcoin over newer, less regulated altcoins. The current Altcoin Season Index at 18 suggests that the confluence of these factors is currently favoring Bitcoin. It’s a period where investors are either consolidating gains, seeking stability, or waiting for clearer signals before diversifying heavily into the broader altcoin market. The Future of Cryptocurrency Performance: What’s Next? While the present firmly indicates a Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is characterized by its cyclical nature. No season lasts forever. The current Altcoin Index reading of 18 is a snapshot, not a permanent state. Looking ahead, several catalysts could potentially shift the market back into an Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Once Bitcoin reaches a new peak or consolidates after a significant rally, investors might start looking for higher returns in altcoins. Major Altcoin Upgrades: Significant technological advancements or network upgrades (like Ethereum’s future developments) can attract new capital and attention to specific altcoins. Emergence of New Narratives: Fresh trends or compelling use cases for altcoins can ignite speculative interest and drive prices upwards. Increased Retail Participation: A resurgence of retail investor interest often broadens the market’s focus beyond Bitcoin to include more speculative altcoin plays. For now, prudence dictates a focus on robust risk management and strategic positioning. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer, understanding the Altcoin Season Index and its implications for cryptocurrency performance is vital for navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of digital assets. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 18 serves as a clear beacon, signaling that we are in a dominant Bitcoin Season. This period calls for a strategic approach, emphasizing Bitcoin’s strength while selectively identifying promising altcoins for long-term growth. By understanding the dynamics of these market cycles, investors can better position themselves to thrive, regardless of whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge.

2025-06-27T10:48:03,"Bitcoin Faces Weakest Monthly Growth Since July as Whales Counteract ETF Inflows","Bitcoin BTC is on track to record its weakest monthly performance in a year amid a puzzling mix of consistent spot ETF inflows and signs of on-chain selling by whales and small wallets. As of writing, BTC changed hands at around $107,000, up just 2% for the month, according to CoinDesk data. That's the smallest monthly gain since last July. The dour price action appears confounding as the U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to see strong uptake, registering $3.9 billion in net inflows in consecutive weeks. Besides, the corporate treasury adoption continues at brisk pace globally. Whale selling However, on-chain data sourced from Glassnode, particularly one key metric called the Accumulation Trend Score , which breaks down the behavior of different wallet cohorts, doesn't paint a rosy picture. The metric measures the relative strength of accumulation for each cohort based on the size of entities and the amount of BTC acquired over the last 15 days. A value closer to 1 suggests that participants in that cohort are accumulating coins, whereas a value closer to 0 signals distribution. Entities such as exchanges and miners are excluded from this calculation. Currently, holders with balances between 10 and 10,000 BTC are in accumulation mode, though their behavior fluctuates between buying and selling, indicating they are more opportunistic traders rather than consistent buyers or sellers. Conversely, whales holding 10,000 BTC or more are leaning slightly toward distributing their holdings, while smaller holders are also net sellers. Consolidation phase Between January and April 2025, all cohorts were predominantly selling, but accumulation resumed once bitcoin bottomed in April near the $76,000 level. Now, the asset appears to have entered another consolidation phase. In its latest “Week On-Chain” report, Glassnode suggests that profit-taking activity is beginning to slow. Realized profits have reached $650 billion in this cycle compared to $550 billion during the previous cycle. Glassnode attributes this trend to a market cooldown, further emphasizing the ongoing consolidation period.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/bitcoin-faces-weakest-monthly-growth-since-july-as-whales-counteract-etf-inflows,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Glassnode|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T10:40:56,"Coinbase’s Strategic Bitcoin Buys: Armstrong Confirms Weekly Acquisitions, Boosting Confidence","BitcoinWorld Coinbase’s Strategic Bitcoin Buys: Armstrong Confirms Weekly Acquisitions, Boosting Confidence In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, a single statement from a key industry leader can send ripples across the market. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with excitement following a significant revelation from none other than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong . His confirmation that Coinbase is consistently increasing its Bitcoin holdings each week isn’t just news; it’s a powerful signal, especially coming after Coinbase’s stock soared to an all-time high. This move underscores a deeper strategic play, prompting questions about corporate crypto treasuries and the future of digital asset adoption. Coinbase Bitcoin : The Strategic Accumulation Unveiled The conversation that sparked this revelation began on X (formerly Twitter), where BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey openly lauded Brian Armstrong’s leadership, particularly after Coinbase’s stock reached an impressive $368.94. Bailey then challenged Coinbase to take a more definitive step: establish a dedicated Bitcoin treasury. Armstrong’s response was swift and impactful, stating, “We are buying more Bitcoin every week.” This isn’t merely a casual remark; it signifies a deliberate, ongoing strategy by one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges to accumulate the flagship digital asset. This consistent accumulation of Coinbase Bitcoin holdings suggests a long-term conviction in the asset’s value and its role in the company’s financial future. It’s a move that speaks volumes about their belief in Bitcoin’s enduring power. Brian Armstrong : A Visionary Leader’s Confirmation Brian Armstrong has long been recognized as a pivotal figure in the cryptocurrency space, steering Coinbase from a nascent startup to a publicly traded titan. His recent affirmation regarding Bitcoin purchases isn’t just a fleeting comment; it reinforces his long-standing belief in the asset’s potential. Armstrong’s leadership has consistently focused on mainstream adoption and regulatory compliance, positioning Coinbase as a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy. His decision to publicly confirm weekly Bitcoin buys, especially in response to a call for a dedicated treasury, highlights a proactive approach to managing the company’s balance sheet and signaling confidence to both investors and the broader market. This transparency from Brian Armstrong provides valuable insight into the strategic thinking at the top tier of the crypto industry. The Case for a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury : Why Now? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury has gained significant traction, particularly among forward-thinking companies. But what exactly does it entail, and why are more corporations considering it? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and quantitative easing, companies are looking for assets that can preserve or even grow their purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its capped supply, is often seen as a digital alternative to gold, offering a hedge against inflation. Balance Sheet Diversification: Relying solely on traditional fiat currencies can expose companies to currency devaluation risks. Adding Bitcoin provides diversification, potentially reducing overall financial risk. Signaling Confidence: Holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet sends a strong message to the market about a company’s belief in the future of digital assets. For a crypto-native company like Coinbase, this signal is amplified, reinforcing its commitment to the ecosystem it serves. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth. Companies that accumulate Bitcoin at strategic times aim to benefit from its potential appreciation. Coinbase’s active weekly purchases suggest they are not just passively holding but actively building a strategic reserve, moving towards what could effectively function as a dynamic Bitcoin treasury . What Does This Mean for the Coinbase CEO and the Exchange? The implications of this revelation for the Coinbase CEO and the exchange are multifaceted. Firstly, it strengthens Coinbase’s position as a leading institutional player in the crypto space. By actively accumulating Bitcoin, Coinbase is not just facilitating trades but also acting as a significant holder, aligning its financial interests even more closely with the broader crypto market’s success. This move could: Boost Investor Confidence: Seeing a major exchange like Coinbase, led by its visionary Coinbase CEO , put its own capital into Bitcoin can reassure investors about the asset’s long-term viability and the company’s financial health. Influence Market Dynamics: Consistent buying from a large entity like Coinbase can contribute to demand, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory, albeit subtly over time. Set an Industry Precedent: As a publicly traded company, Coinbase’s actions are scrutinized. Its active Bitcoin accumulation could encourage other companies, both within and outside the crypto sector, to consider similar strategies. Enhance Brand Reputation: For a company whose business is deeply intertwined with Bitcoin, holding the asset reinforces its authenticity and commitment to the decentralized future. This strategic decision by the Coinbase CEO further solidifies the exchange’s standing as a cornerstone of the digital economy. Broader Implications for Crypto Investment Coinbase’s decision to increase its Bitcoin holdings has significant ramifications for the wider landscape of crypto investment . It signals a maturation of the market and a growing acceptance of digital assets as legitimate components of corporate finance. For individual and institutional investors alike, this move offers several insights: Institutional Validation: When a major, regulated, publicly traded company like Coinbase actively buys Bitcoin, it adds another layer of institutional validation, potentially drawing more traditional investors into the crypto space. Long-Term Outlook: It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a long-term store of value and a strategic asset for corporations. This can encourage a more patient and strategic approach to crypto investment . Diversification Trends: Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury. Coinbase’s actions suggest this trend is gaining momentum, potentially leading to more companies exploring crypto as part of their treasury management. Market Stability: While crypto remains volatile, increased institutional holding can, over time, contribute to greater market stability by reducing the impact of short-term speculative movements. This development is a strong indicator of evolving corporate strategies in crypto investment . Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities While the strategic accumulation of Bitcoin presents numerous opportunities, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges. Volatility remains a key concern, as Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting a company’s balance sheet. Regulatory uncertainty, though diminishing, still poses a potential risk. Furthermore, securing large digital asset holdings requires robust cybersecurity infrastructure. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges for a company like Coinbase, which is already deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem. Their expertise in security, compliance, and market dynamics positions them uniquely to manage these risks. This move could also pave the way for new financial products and services tailored to corporate crypto holdings, further diversifying Coinbase’s revenue streams. Conclusion Brian Armstrong’s confirmation that Coinbase is consistently buying more Bitcoin each week is more than just a passing comment; it’s a strategic declaration. It underscores Coinbase’s deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value, its role as a potential corporate treasury asset, and the ongoing maturation of the broader crypto market. As one of the most influential players in the digital asset space, Coinbase’s actions serve as a powerful signal, potentially encouraging further institutional adoption and shaping the future of crypto investment . This move reinforces the idea that digital assets are not just for individuals but are increasingly becoming a cornerstone of corporate financial strategy.

2025-06-27T10:21:14,"Coinbase Hits a New ATH, Driving Bullishness on BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL)","Crypto exchange Coinbase hit an all-time high in Thursday’s trading session. This comes after the company’s CEO revealed they buy more Bitcoin every week. This marks the latest in a wave of bullishness, particularly on $BTC, that could make related projects like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) extra attractive to investors. Coinbase closed at $369.21 during Thursday’s trading and reached a high of $381.35, a tremendous jump for a stock price that hovered under $100 between 2022 and 2023. The ALT comes just a month after Coinbase became the first crypto exchange listed on the S&P 500 . Factors like the Israel-Iran ceasefire and the passing of the crypto-friendly Genius Act in the US Senate could have helped fuel the rise in the company’s stock price this week. Later on Thursday, the company’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, shared Coinbase’s weekly Bitcoin purchases on X , reflecting his belief that Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars with greater acceptance from G20 countries. Bakkt Bets on Bitcoin Aside from Coinbase, Strategy, Metaplanet, and just about everyone else, Bakkt is also looking to get its hands on large sums of Bitcoin. Yesterday, the crypto custody company filed a prospectus with the US SEC to update its investment policy, allowing it to purchase Bitcoin or other digital assets. Bitcoin Bullishness Boosts BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) With more investors stocking up on Bitcoin, it’s only a matter of time before we see its value reach a new ATH. At least that’s what the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) project is banking on. The project team is rallying support for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, offering free $BTC airdrops to those who buy and hold the $BTCBULL token. These airdrops will occur when $BTC hits $150K and $200K, with a massive $BTCBULL airdrop at $250K. You can buy $BTCBULL tokens for only $0.00258 each via its presale page. But with the presale closing soon, this could be your last chance to get in and qualify for the free token airdrops. To get $BTCBULL, connect la crypto wallet ike Best Wallet to its presale widget, input how many tokens you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. Our BTC Bull Token buying guide has all the steps you need to help you get started. You also get the option to stake your tokens right after purchasing them. This lets you earn staking rewards at 54% p.a., though this may change depending on how many tokens are locked into the project’s staking pool. Just as you can with most of the best presales , you can also choose to HODL your tokens. This is ideal if you’re betting on $BTC only going up, and want to get your hands on the free Bitcoin. Remember, though, you need to hold them in Best Wallet to qualify for the airdrops. According to our estimates , given the right market conditions, the token could be worth as much as $0.006467. Another factor that could drive up its value are the regular token burns when $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K as these reduce the token supply and make $BTCBULL scarcer. Bitcoin Due for a New ATH? With more and more investors stockpiling $BTC, a new ATH is within reach. The jump in Coinbase’s stock value is yet another sign of the market’s bullishness on Bitcoin and the crypto market at large. In particular, Bitcoin bullishness fuels new crypto presales like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , which bets on Bitcoin’s continued rise. If you’re considering buying crypto, make sure you do your research first, as the market is highly volatile.

The decision , filed on June 26, effectively keeps the door open for further appeals and delays a final resolution. Within hours of the ruling, XRP fell from $2.16 to $2.09, erasing more than $5 billion in market capitalization in under 24 hours. At $123.62 billion, it now holds the dubious distinction of posting the biggest single-day drop among the top 40 digital assets and becoming the most trending crypto asset between Thursday and Friday, according to CoinMarketCap . XRP market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap But while short-term sentiment has clearly taken a hit, not all observers believe the verdict spells trouble for XRP’s longer-term ambitions, particularly regarding a U.S.-listed spot XRP ETF. Lawyer weight in on XRP ETF Fred Rispoli, a legal commentator and vocal supporter of Ripple, argues that the ruling, though headline-grabbing, is unlikely to affect XRP’s standing on secondary markets, which is what ultimately matters for ETF eligibility. SEC v. Ripple Update: This is a long post on my thoughts here but the TLDR is: ""Welcome to the new SEC, for now more or less the same as the last one."" And: Ripple and SEC will settle the appeal for the reduced, agreed upon amount and leave the Torres judgment in place, while the… https://t.co/9y9o4M4uBW — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 26, 2025 “Regarding that injunction, it doesn’t affect $XRP on the secondary markets nor will it impact XRP ETF approvals,” Rispoli explained. “And remember, the injunction is just a piece of paper issued by a court… it only substantively matters if the SEC wants it to matter.” In legal terms, Judge Torres’ injunction could theoretically give the court grounds to revisit the case if Ripple is found violating institutional sale restrictions. However, Rispoli emphasized that the SEC would need to actively push for enforcement, an outcome he describes as “extremely low probability.” He also hinted at a broader shift in regulatory posture, suggesting that both Ripple and the SEC may be quietly negotiating a reduced penalty and new guidelines for Ripple’s institutional sales. Such a move would preserve the substance of the Torres ruling while avoiding further escalation. The bigger unknown now lies with the SEC’s leadership. With the commission under political pressure to soften its stance on digital assets, and following the installation of a new Chair under President Trump, there’s growing speculation that an XRP ETF could still move forward, particularly given the rising tide of crypto ETF approvals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even altcoin ETFs in the pipeline.

2025-06-27T10:08:16,"The Smarter Web Company secures $56M, aims for top 30 Bitcoin holders","The Smarter Web Company has raised approximately $56 million, days after spending over $20 million on a Bitcoin investment. According to a Thursday announcement , the UK-based web design and marketing firm secured the funding through an accelerated bookbuild, a fast-track fundraising process typically involving institutional investors. The offering included £36.27 million ($49.8 million) raised via the bookbuild and an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) raised through subscription. Shares were priced at £2.90 ($3.98) each. The newly issued stock is expected to begin trading on July 1. The Smarter Web Company said the capital was raised to support its broader business objectives. While the official filing did not explicitly state whether any of the proceeds would be allocated toward additional Bitcoin purchases, the move follows a pattern of BTC accumulation that has intensified over the past month. Following the 10-year plan The Smarter Web Company, which trades on the OTCQB market in the United States under the ticker TSWCF, has been executing a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy since April as part of its “10 Year Plan.” Under this strategy, the company plans to systematically accumulate Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the next decade. While the firm has accepted Bitcoin payments from clients since 2023, it began accumulating the asset in late spring this year. Two days before the fundraising was announced, the company invested over $20 million to acquire 196.8 BTC at an average price of $103,290, which brought its total holdings to 543.52 BTC, valued at approximately $58.19 million as of the latest update. The average acquisition price across its Bitcoin treasury stands at $104,450. Prior to that, the company had executed a total of four Bitcoin purchases since late May, gradually increasing its holdings from 83.24 BTC to 346.63 BTC through acquisitions totalling approximately £17.9 million. On June 26, CEO Andrew Webley met with Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, for what he described as a “good meeting” on Bitcoin strategy. A day later, Webley confirmed in an X post that The Smarter Web Company is now the 39th largest corporate BTC holder and intends to climb into the top 30. For many publicly listed companies, reports of Bitcoin acquisitions often spark bullish momentum. But that wasn’t the case for The Smarter Web Company. Its shares fell 15% on Thursday, closing at $3.56 after touching an intraday low of $3.19, according to Google Finance. Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a treasury asset Bitcoin has been showing strong resilience against macro jitters, and part of that can be attributed to its growing role as a treasury asset. Over the past year, several publicly listed companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, citing its scarcity, liquidity, and potential as a hedge against currency debasement and a means to improve shareholder value. The trend is particularly prominent in the US, where firms like Strategy and BlackRock have led the way. Strategy alone now holds over 576,000 BTC, and more than 60 other public companies have followed suit, using Bitcoin as a core strategic reserve. Similarly, in the UK, despite the lack of regulatory clarity around digital assets, a number of listed firms are beginning to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Alongside The Smarter Web Company, firms like Vinanz and Abraxas Capital have made sizeable Bitcoin allocations in recent months.

CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the crypto exchange is now purchasing Bitcoin every single week, strengthening its position in the ongoing race among institutions to stock up on BTC . The exchange currently holds $995 million worth of Bitcoin, making it the 10th-largest corporate holder. Armstrong has also encouraged investors to “go long” on Bitcoin, signaling strong confidence in its future as prices inch closer to a new all-time high. We're buying more Bitcoin every week. Long #Bitcoin https://t.co/LleWBXGYTG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 26, 2025 From Maximalism to Multi-Token Strategy Coinbase launched in 2012 with a Bitcoin-only focus. Back then, Armstrong dismissed altcoins like XRP and Stellar (XL M) as distractions. In a now-deleted tweet from 2014, he claimed Bitcoin was “way far ahead” of the rest, reflecting a clear Bitcoin-maxi mindset at the time. That changed in 2016 when Coinbase added support for Ethereum. Then, in 2018, it expanded even further by enabling ERC-20 tokens. During the bull run, the platform added nearly 100 new tokens in just one year. This shift drew criticism from Bitcoin purists who accused Coinbase of chasing trends instead of staying true to BTC.

While Armstrong’s commitment to buy weekly is significant, consistency will be key if Coinbase hopes to narrow the gap. In terms of value, Coinbase’s holdings stand at $995 million, while MicroStrategy’s are worth about $33 billion. It’s a big difference but if Coinbase keeps buying aggressively, that could start to shift over time Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Grows Coinbase’s weekly BTC purchases reflect a growing trend: institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a way to preserve long-term value. With Bitcoin currently trading at $107,363, Coinbase’s position in the market is strong and getting stronger. While altcoins still grab headlines, this move shows that for major players like Coinbase, Bitcoin remains the foundation.

2025-06-27T10:00:18,"XRP Price Declines Back To $2 As Legal Dispute With SEC Continues","The XRP price experienced a significant decline on Thursday following new developments in the ongoing legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Analisa Torres’ decision to deny the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling halted the XRP price recovery as it aimed to breach the nearest resistance level at $2.23. Key Issues Unresolved For Ripple Despite the SEC dropping its appeal, which indicated that the primary legal conflict between the two parties may be reaching a conclusion, Judge Torres’ ruling highlighted that several procedural matters still require resolution, including necessary court approvals. In her judgment, she made it clear that private agreements cannot supersede public court decisions, stating, “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment… They have not come close to doing so here.” Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear In response to the ruling, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to convey that the situation is now back in Ripple’s hands. The executive pointed out that the court has given them two options: either to dismiss their appeal regarding the historic institutional sales or to continue with the appeal. Regardless of the path chosen, Alderoty emphasized that XRP’s legal status as a non-security remains intact, reassuring stakeholders that it is business as usual. Expert Reactions To Torres’ Decision Legal expert Fred Rispoli also weighed in on the implications of the injunction, stating that it would not impact XRP in secondary markets or affect potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings awaiting approval by the SEC. He noted that the injunction is merely a court document and emphasized the low likelihood of Judge Torres calling Ripple and the SEC back into court unless the SEC believes Ripple is violating the terms of the injunction. Rispoli further questioned whether the SEC has the authority to grant Ripple the necessary exemptions to alleviate any restrictions imposed by the injunction, suggesting that such actions fall within the SEC’s executive powers. Ripple has asserted that it has adjusted its operations to align with the court’s findings, particularly regarding its past sales to institutional investors. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Alderoty’s use of the term “historic institutional sales” in his recent statement indicates a shift in how both parties might approach future transactions, signaling a potential settlement that would allow XRP sales to institutions in a manner acceptable to the SEC. XRP Price Could Reach $5 Despite this temporary setback, market analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future. Crypto analyst CryptoBullet recently noted that XRP’s two-week price chart resembles patterns seen in 2017, including a significant accumulation phase and a potential breakout. With this historical context in mind, the expert predicts a final surge in the XRP price, forecasting new all-time high targets between $4.50 and $5.40 for the cryptocurrency. As of press time, the XRP price has retreated to the $2.08 mark, which is a key support level for bulls anticipating further recovery of the token. In the last 24 hours, XRP has dropped 4.4%, and 10% in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, the XRP price remains 38% below its record high of $3.40.

2025-06-27T10:00:09,"Crypto fundraising revives and breaks above $4B in June","Crypto fundraising is on track to end the first half of 2025 on a high note, after a series of high-value private placements. Crypto VC funding usually tracks bullish periods, and has recovered after a couple of slower months. Crypto fundraising is back to levels not seen since 2022, ending the first half of 2025 with expansion, despite some slower months. Deals saw a trend shift, moving to large-scale private rounds and late-stage financing, with more cautious seed rounds. The model of funding a project only to sell tokens to exchanges is being phased out, instead focusing more on late-stage deals. VC funds remained vigilant for opportunities, but this time, the main driver was the rise of platforms with a widely adopted products. In the coming months, some of the high-profile crypto platforms plan to announce new large funding rounds. Some of the major deals include Polymarket , Pump.fun, and Kalshi . The latest deals may yet be included in the statistics for Q2 deals. Recently, World Liberty Fi also closed a $100M inflow from the Aqua 1 fund. June fundraising breaks above $4B Crypto fundraising tracks the general mood on the crypto market. After a relatively slow start to 2025, some months posted peak results. In March, total VC deals expanded to $5B. Even in slower months, VC fundraising was consistently above $1B, though some months included a concentration of large deals. Coinbase Ventures was the leader with nine deals, followed by Pantera Capital leading six funding rounds. Most of the deals were also made in undisclosed international locations, for a total of 70 rounds. The USA only saw 15 deals for the past month. However, those deals were the biggest, raising over $1.79B. Singapore-based projects raised a further $1.09B. Crypto VC deals moved to international locations, but the USA is still the leader in terms of USD value. | Source: Cryptorank A total of 103 rounds in June raised over $4.49B, with the potential for more deals to be added to the bottom line. The absolute record for VC deals is over $6.88B in November 2021, during the first Web3 boom. This time around, VC deals are not led by narrative, but by established use cases and signs of growth from transactions, fees, and liquidity. Projects like EigenCloud were among the significant deals for the past month, raising $70M in a late-stage round. For smaller projects, token sales, airdrops and special events have returned as a viable source of funding. In the past four months, token sales raised consistently over $4B on a monthly basis, tapping crypto natives and whales. In June, a total of 174 sales raised $4.79B, surpassing even the level of large VC rounds. The main source of interest in token sales were again the special campaigns of Binance Wallet and PancakeSwap. For the month of June, most TGE and token sales used those two platforms, achieving the highest returns. Binance Wallet projects posted gains of 483% on average, while PancakeSwap achieved 228.5%. The success of token sales relied on concentrating most of the opportunities on a single platform, having a guaranteed pool of buyers. Most projects have abandoned ICO attempts outside the top platforms, which give them the biggest exposure to liquidity.

However, given recent downward momentum, traders might consider waiting for a clearer confirmation of bullish sentiment. One recommended way is to wait for at least one 30-minute candle to close above this key level before initiating a long position.</p><p>This method ensures the bullish threshold is not just briefly pierced but sustainably held.

Important components include:</p><ul><li><p>Point of Control (POC):
The highest-volume price level, often acting as key support or resistance.</p></li><li><p>Value Area High/Low (VAH/VAL):
Levels defining the range where approximately 70% of prior session trading occurred, critical for detecting breakouts or reversals.</p></li></ul><p>VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)</p><p>VWAP calculates the average price weighted by volume, signaling institutional ""fair value."" Prices above VWAP generally reflect bullish control, whereas prices below suggest bearish sentiment. VWAP’s standard deviation bands help pinpoint probable reversals or accelerations.</p><p>Liquidity Pools</p><p>Liquidity pools represent price areas with substantial pending market orders. Institutions and market makers typically target these pools to efficiently execute large transactions, causing short-term price reactions. Recognizing liquidity pools allows traders to anticipate these market-moving events.</p><p>Why These Tools Matter</p><p>Incorporating Volume Profile, VWAP, and liquidity pools provides traders a clear view of institutional-level market participation. This combined perspective allows traders to establish precise entry points, effective risk management strategies, and strategically placed partial profit targets rather than relying solely on distant single objectives.</p><p>tradeCompass Trade Management Tips</p><ul><li><p>One trade per direction:
Keeps your strategy disciplined, prevents emotional overtrading, and preserves capital.</p></li><li><p>Moving stops:
Once your second partial profit target is hit, move your stop-loss to entry, effectively reducing risk.</p></li><li><p>Flexible entry confirmation:
Traders may vary their entry confirmations—waiting for candle closes, delta analysis, or sustained price action near thresholds.</p></li><li><p>Logical stop placement:
Always ensure stops are logically placed relative to tradeCompass thresholds to quickly invalidate trades if the scenario changes.</p></li></ul><p>Join Our Free Crypto Telegram Channel</p><p>For timely updates, professional crypto trading insights, and carefully curated market alerts—without unnecessary chatter—join our new, free Telegram Crypto Channel at:
