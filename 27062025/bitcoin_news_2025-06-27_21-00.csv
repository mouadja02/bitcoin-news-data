Table of Contents Metaplanet passes Tesla in Bitcoin holdings Why a Bitcoin strategy made sense First profit since 2017 Asia’s corporate playbook evolving Metaplanet passes Tesla in Bitcoin holdings Metaplanet Inc. (MTPLF), a Japan -listed firm, has officially surpassed Tesla in corporate Bitcoin (BTC) holdings following its latest purchase of 1,234 BTC. In a disclosure filed on Jun. 25, the company stated that it acquired the bitcoins for approximately 19.3 billion yen, or around $133 million, paying an average price of about 15.6 million yen, roughly $107,900, per BTC. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,234 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 12,345 BTC* pic.twitter.com/ppeGIrfVfe — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 26, 2025 With this latest purchase, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 12,345 BTC, placing it ahead of Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC. The company is now the fifth-largest public holder of Bitcoin globally. The only firms with larger holdings are Strategy , Marathon Digital, Galaxy Digital, and Riot Platforms, all of which operate with a crypto-native focus. Metaplanet began its Bitcoin accumulation strategy in April 2024. Since the start of 2025, the total value of its BTC holdings has risen by 315%, reflecting both the timing of its purchases and the broader surge in Bitcoin’s price. Investor sentiment has remained strong. Earlier in June, when the company announced plans for its latest acquisition, its stock rose nearly 7% in a single trading day, reaching a high of 1,595 yen, or approximately $11. Why a Bitcoin strategy made sense Metaplanet was founded in 1999 and spent much of its early life in traditional industries, primarily operating in hospitality and corporate services. The company managed hotels and ran an investor relations consultancy, remaining a relatively low-profile business in Japan’s broader economic environment. Over time, financial challenges began to emerge. Japan’s economy was also showing signs of deeper strain, shaped by long-term structural stagnation, rising public debt, and persistently low interest rates that made it difficult for companies to preserve capital value. In early 2024, Metaplanet’s leadership responded by shifting direction. The board adopted a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy, formally recognizing Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset in April 2024. Company executives pointed to a weakening yen and declining real returns on cash as key reasons behind the move. Shortly afterward, Metaplanet published what it called the Bitcoin Manifesto. The document outlined a long-term commitment to prioritizing Bitcoin across its treasury and capital allocation decisions. The strategy began modestly. In April 2024, the company purchased 117.7 BTC at an average cost of around 10.2 million yen per coin, or approximately $6.5 million. The announcement triggered a swift market reaction. Metaplanet’s stock rose from around 20 yen to 35 yen the same day, or roughly $0.13 to $0.22 in dollar terms. As of Jun. 27, MTPLF trades at $1,500 yen, up over 75-times since adopting the BTC-strategy. As the plan gained momentum, the company began repositioning itself more aggressively. It announced plans to open a Bitcoin-themed hotel and acquired the license to operate Bitcoin Magazine in Japan. To fund its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet chose to raise capital through equity issuance rather than debt, using nearly all proceeds from share sales to purchase additional Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s price climbed and investor interest strengthened, Metaplanet scaled up its ambitions. It launched the 210 Million Plan in January 2023, targeting 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026. In June 2025, the company introduced a more expansive initiative called the 555 Million Plan. Under this program, Metaplanet announced it would issue 555 million new shares over two years to raise approximately 780 billion yen in capital. The stated goal is to accumulate up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, representing close to 1% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins. As a result of ongoing equity raises, the number of outstanding shares has expanded significantly, reaching around 760 million by mid-2025. Metaplanet has acknowledged the risks associated with frequent share issuance, particularly the potential for shareholder dilution. To address this, the company introduced a metric it calls Bitcoin yield, which tracks the amount of BTC held per share. The structure aims to ensure that each round of fundraising brings in more Bitcoin than the proportional increase in shares, allowing BTC-per-share to rise over time. The company targets a 35% increase in Bitcoin yield each quarter. If achieved consistently, this would make each fundraising round accretive. However, the model carries sharp risks. A quick decline in Bitcoin’s price or lower-than-expected fundraising results could reduce yield growth, diminishing the benefit to shareholders. First profit since 2017 Metaplanet’s move to a Bitcoin-focused treasury model has fundamentally reshaped its financial profile. After several years of operating losses, the company reported a full-year operating profit in 2024, marking its first return to profitability since 2017. Revenue rose from 261 million yen (approximately $1.8 million) in fiscal 2023 to 1,062 million yen (around $7.3 million) in fiscal 2024. The company recorded an operating profit of 350 million yen (about $2.4 million), reversing a prior-year loss of 468 million yen (roughly $3.2 million). The shift in Metaplanet’s asset base has been even more pronounced. Total assets increased from 1,666 million yen (around $11.5 million) to 30,325 million yen (approximately $209.7 million). Net assets grew from 1,152 million yen (about $8 million) to 18,923 million yen (nearly $130.9 million). Positive momentum has carried into fiscal 2025. In the first quarter alone, Metaplanet reported operating profit of approximately 550 million yen (around $3.8 million). The figure ranks among the highest quarterly results in the company’s history, supported by rising Bitcoin prices, continued coin accumulation, and yield generated from Bitcoin-backed financial activities. Metaplanet’s growing financial position has also elevated its role in public markets. It is now recognized as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. Within Japan, it remains the only publicly listed firm using Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. Investor interest has followed. Before adopting its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet had a few thousand shareholders. Today, it counts more than 60,000 investors, spanning both retail and institutional participants. Among retail investors in Japan, demand has been driven in part by the country’s tax environment. Capital gains on direct crypto holdings can be taxed at rates as high as 55%, making equity-based exposure through listed companies a more attractive alternative. Institutional attention has grown as well. Metaplanet stock has been included in several exchange-traded funds, both domestically and internationally. It is increasingly viewed as a non-traditional growth vehicle that offers indirect access to Bitcoin through regulated equity markets. Asia’s corporate playbook evolving To better understand how Metaplanet’s rise is being viewed within the industry, Crypto.news spoke with Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer, who shared his perspective on the firm’s trajectory and evolving strategy. When asked how Metaplanet’s approach compares to that of MicroStrategy, Hu described the difference as both structural and regional. “MicroStrategy’s approach is focused on large convertible debt raises and a long-term hodl thesis. Metaplanet’s approach seems to be more regionally specific, making Bitcoin an important part of its corporate identity while riding and leading the wave of institutional adoption in Asia. It’s also starting from a smaller base, meaning new purchases represent outsized percentage growth relative to its market cap.” Hu sees Metaplanet’s 210,000 BTC target as a potential signal to the broader corporate landscape in Asia. “Any large institutional purchase could significantly impact supply dynamics. Most importantly it will signal Asian corporations that Bitcoin exposure is no longer fringe. Of course, potential discussions around regulation could also arise.” On whether Metaplanet’s profit model is sustainable — given its heavy reliance on Bitcoin price appreciation—Hu emphasized the importance of investor communication and risk handling. “We’ve been in the market long enough to know that there is always volatility risk in Bitcoin. If these risks are leveraged correctly and communicated to Metaplanet’s investors, then the company is set to win in the long term.” So far, Metaplanet’s strategy has benefited from a favorable macro and market cycle. Future performance may depend on how it adapts when conditions are less supportive.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/after-a-7500-run-on-bitcoin-metaplanet-is-set-to-win/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Feature|Exclusive|Bitcoin|Tesla",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T18:50:16,"Fed Rate Cuts: Kashkari’s Crucial 2025 Outlook for the Economy","BitcoinWorld Fed Rate Cuts: Kashkari’s Crucial 2025 Outlook for the Economy The whispers from the Federal Reserve always send ripples across financial markets, and for those deeply invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, these whispers can feel like seismic shifts. Recent comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Neel Kashkari regarding potential Fed rate cuts in 2025 have ignited significant discussion. What do these projections mean for your digital assets and the broader financial landscape? In a world where economic stability often dictates market sentiment, understanding the nuances of central bank decisions is paramount. Kashkari’s insights offer a glimpse into the potential trajectory of U.S. monetary policy, which, in turn, can influence everything from borrowing costs for everyday consumers to the speculative appetite for digital currencies. Let’s delve deeper into what these anticipated rate adjustments could signify for the economy and the ever-evolving crypto market. What Are the Prospects for Fed Rate Cuts in 2025? According to Walter Bloomberg on X, U.S. Federal Reserve’s Neel Kashkari recently stated his expectation of two Fed rate cuts in 2025, with the first potentially occurring as early as September. This projection comes at a pivotal time when global economies are navigating persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions, and varying growth trajectories. For context, the Federal Reserve has maintained relatively high interest rates in an effort to combat inflation, which surged significantly in the post-pandemic era. These higher rates make borrowing more expensive, which in theory, slows down economic activity and cools price increases. Kashkari’s outlook suggests that by 2025, the Fed may feel confident enough in its progress against inflation to begin easing its restrictive stance. The timing, particularly the September possibility, indicates a data-dependent approach, where the Fed will closely monitor inflation trends, employment figures, and overall economic health before making any definitive moves. Who is Neel Kashkari and Why Does His Monetary Policy Stance Matter? Neel Kashkari serves as the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy. His views carry significant weight because they offer insights into the internal deliberations and varying perspectives within the Fed. Kashkari has often been characterized as one of the more ‘hawkish’ members of the FOMC, meaning he typically prioritizes controlling inflation, even if it means higher interest rates for longer periods. Given this background, his projection of two rate cuts in 2025 is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a growing consensus, or at least a significant consideration, within the Fed that the economy might be on a path where easing rates becomes feasible without reigniting inflationary pressures. Understanding the individual stances of FOMC members like Kashkari helps market participants gauge the likely direction of future monetary policy decisions. Understanding the Broader Economic Outlook and its Implications The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy , primarily through interest rate adjustments, plays a crucial role in shaping the overall economic outlook . When the Fed cuts interest rates, it typically aims to stimulate economic growth. Here’s how: Cheaper Borrowing: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers. This encourages companies to invest in expansion, hire more staff, and consumers to take out loans for big purchases like homes and cars. Increased Spending: With lower borrowing costs, disposable income might increase, leading to higher consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Asset Valuation: Lower rates can make bonds less attractive, pushing investors towards riskier assets like stocks, and potentially, cryptocurrencies, in search of higher returns. However, the Fed must always balance stimulating growth with managing inflation. Cutting rates too soon or too aggressively could lead to a resurgence of inflation, undoing previous efforts. The dual mandate of the Fed is to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and rate decisions are always a careful calibration between these two objectives. Kashkari’s forecast implies a belief that by 2025, the balance will tip towards needing less restrictive policy to maintain economic momentum without compromising price stability. The Ripple Effect: Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions are not just distant economic news; they are critical market movers. The anticipated crypto market impact of potential Fed rate cuts in 2025 is generally seen as positive, largely due to the inverse relationship between interest rates and risk appetite. Here’s why: Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates mean that money is cheaper to borrow and less attractive to keep in traditional savings accounts or low-yield bonds. This encourages investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Risk-On Sentiment: A more accommodative monetary policy fosters a ‘risk-on’ environment. When traditional investments offer lower returns, investors are more willing to allocate capital to volatile, high-growth assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Dollar Weakness: Rate cuts can sometimes lead to a weaker U.S. dollar. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often priced against the dollar, a weaker dollar can make them appear relatively more valuable, potentially driving up their price. Historically, periods of low interest rates have often coincided with bull runs in the crypto market, as ample liquidity flows into the ecosystem. Conversely, periods of rising rates (like the recent past) have often seen capital flow out of riskier assets. While crypto markets are influenced by many factors, including technological advancements, regulatory news, and adoption rates, the macro-economic backdrop set by central banks remains a dominant force. Let’s consider a simplified comparison: Interest Rate Environment Traditional Assets (e.g., Bonds, Savings) Crypto Assets High Rates (Current) More attractive yields, safer returns Less attractive, potential capital flight, ‘crypto winter’ Low Rates (Anticipated 2025) Less attractive yields, search for higher returns More attractive, ‘risk-on’ sentiment, potential for growth What Challenges Could Derail This Economic Outlook? While Kashkari’s forecast offers a hopeful sign, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges that could alter this economic outlook . Inflation, while cooling, could prove stickier than anticipated due to unforeseen supply chain disruptions, geopolitical events, or a resurgence in demand. A persistently strong labor market, while positive for employment, could also put upward pressure on wages and, consequently, prices, making the Fed hesitant to cut rates. Furthermore, the global economic landscape is constantly shifting. Major economies experiencing slowdowns or financial instability could impact the U.S. economy, potentially necessitating a different monetary policy response. The Fed’s decisions are always data-dependent, meaning any significant shift in economic indicators could lead to a revision of their plans. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for Fed rate cuts and their associated crypto market impact , what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official Federal Reserve communications, economic data releases (inflation, employment), and statements from key FOMC members. These are crucial for understanding potential shifts in policy. Understand the Macro Landscape: Recognize that cryptocurrency prices are not solely driven by their underlying technology but are also heavily influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions. Diversify and Manage Risk: While lower rates can be bullish for crypto, volatility remains inherent. Diversifying your portfolio and implementing robust risk management strategies are always advisable. Look Beyond the Headlines: A single statement from one Fed official is an indicator, not a guarantee. The collective consensus of the FOMC and actual economic data will ultimately drive policy. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Finance Neel Kashkari’s projection of two Fed rate cuts in 2025 signals a potential pivot in U.S. monetary policy , moving towards a less restrictive stance. This shift, driven by an improving economic outlook and a continued battle against inflation, holds significant implications for all financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. While the prospect of lower interest rates could usher in a more favorable environment for digital assets, the path forward remains dependent on evolving economic data and the Federal Reserve’s cautious, data-driven approach. For investors, staying vigilant, understanding the interplay between macroeconomics and crypto, and adapting strategies accordingly will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead.

2025-06-27T18:46:33,"Dogecoin consolidates at key support zone as volume remains subdued","Dogecoin is trading within a tight volume-defined range between support at $0.15 and resistance at $0.23. With volume still below average, a confirmed breakout requires stronger buyer engagement. Following a corrective move from recent highs, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has stabilized within a key trading range. Price action is now compressing between the value area low, which aligns with high timeframe support at $0.15—and overhead resistance at the point of control. This structure suggests DOGE may be forming a bottoming base that could fuel the next leg higher. Key technical points Strong Support at $0.15: Value area low aligns with HTF support and a key swing low. Resistance at POC: The point of control is capping price for now, requiring a reclaim to shift structure. Volume Remains Below Average: No breakout likely until volume influx supports price expansion. DOGEUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView DOGE is currently navigating a volume-defined trading range, oscillating between the value area low and value area high, with price now sitting near the lower boundary of this range. The $0.15 support level has held firm, acting as both a structural pivot and psychological zone, reinforced by the proximity of a key swing low. While price has rejected from the point of control, a region with the most traded volume, there is no significant follow-through to the downside. This supports the idea that DOGE is in accumulation rather than breakdown. The lack of volume, however, is notable. Any confirmed reversal or breakout will require a visible volume influx, something that has been absent over the past several weeks. Without this, price action is likely to continue consolidating within the current range. You might also like: Is the crypto bull run here? Bitcoin wavers as traders take profits A proper bottoming structure is still in development. If DOGE can continue holding above $0.15 while compressing beneath resistance, a reclaim of the POC would be a key early signal of strength. If price can establish multiple closes above the POC, the door opens to an impulsive move back toward the $0.23 resistance zone, and potentially the swing high, provided volume and momentum align. Until that occurs, the most likely scenario is continued sideways movement with a slight bullish bias, especially given the support confluence at $0.15. What to expect in the coming price action Dogecoin is consolidating near key support with decreasing volatility. As long as $0.15 holds, a reclaim of the point of control could initiate a rotation toward $0.23. Traders should watch closely for volume spikes and structural reclaim signals before anticipating directional breakout momentum.

2025-06-27T18:41:16,"International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Urges Global Action on Crypto Risks","An international financial watchdog group based in France is urging stronger global actions against the risks associated with crypto assets. In a newly published study , the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – established in 1989 to promote policies that protect the global financial system – says that stronger actions are needed by crypto service providers to ensure safety. According to FATF, while virtual asset service providers (VASPs) overall have made headway in terms of developing anti-money laundering protocols, progress still needs to be made on this front, highlighting the challenges associated with overseas providers. “Progress has been made in jurisdictions requiring licensing and registration of VASPs. Nevertheless, further progress is required in licensing and registration in practice and jurisdictions continue to face difficulties in identifying natural or legal persons that conduct VASP activities. Jurisdictions have reported challenges with mitigating the risk of offshore VASPs, with more than a third of jurisdictions with a licensing or registration framework applying a more extensive approach and requiring offshore VASPs (that are not created or located in their jurisdictions) to also be licensed/registered.” According to FATF, many jurisdictions are in the process of creating “travel rules,” or rules set in place to ensure the transparency of cross-border crypto transfers. “Jurisdictions have made progress on implementing the Travel Rule. For the 2025 survey, 73% of respondents (85 of 117 jurisdictions, excluding those that prohibit or plan to prohibit VASPs explicitly) have passed legislation implementing the Travel Rule… Jurisdictions that have not yet introduced legislation or regulation to implement the Travel Rule should urgently do so [while] jurisdictions that have introduced the Travel Rule should rapidly operationalize it, including through effective supervision and enforcement in case of non-compliance.” FATF concludes by noting that since digital assets are international by nature, a regulatory failure in one jurisdiction, such as North Korea, can have severe global consequences. “The DPRK this year carried out the largest single VA theft in history, stealing $1.46 billion from the VASP ByBit. Only 3.8% of the stolen funds have been recovered, highlighting the need to address asset recovery challenges and improve international cooperation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-27T18:31:15,"Bitcoin ETFs: Calamos Launches Revolutionary Protection Funds","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs: Calamos Launches Revolutionary Protection Funds Are you an investor intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin but wary of its notorious volatility? The wait for a more structured approach to digital asset investing might finally be over. Calamos Investments, a prominent U.S. asset management firm, is set to revolutionize how investors gain exposure to cryptocurrencies with the launch of three innovative Bitcoin ETFs . These new funds promise a unique blend of upside potential and crucial downside protection, marking a significant step forward in the institutional adoption of digital assets. Understanding the New Era of Bitcoin ETFs On July 8, Calamos will introduce three distinct Bitcoin-structured ETFs: CBOY, CBXY, and CBTY. These aren’t your typical spot Bitcoin ETFs. Instead, they fall under the category of ‘defined outcome’ ETFs, designed to offer investors a predictable range of returns over a specific period. This structure is particularly appealing for those seeking to participate in Bitcoin’s growth while mitigating some of its inherent risks. CBOY, CBXY, and CBTY: Each ticker represents a unique level of downside protection, allowing investors to choose the risk profile that best suits their financial goals. One-Year Protection Period: The downside protection is offered over a defined one-year period, providing clarity and a structured investment horizon. Annual Reset Feature: At the end of each year, the ETFs will reset, establishing new upside caps and downside protection levels based on market conditions, offering continuous adaptability. The Innovative Approach of Calamos Investments This strategic move by Calamos Investments highlights a growing trend among traditional financial institutions to cater to the increasing demand for regulated and sophisticated crypto investment vehicles. Unlike direct Bitcoin ownership, these ETFs provide a wrapper that simplifies access for traditional brokerage accounts and offers a layer of professional management. The management of these groundbreaking funds will be overseen by Co-CIO Eli Pars and the dedicated Alternatives Team at Calamos. Their expertise in managing complex financial products is expected to provide robust oversight and strategic adjustments, ensuring the ETFs align with their stated objectives of offering defined outcomes. Why Crypto Protection is a Game Changer For many potential investors, the wild price swings of Bitcoin have been a significant deterrent. The concept of crypto protection embedded within these ETFs directly addresses this concern. By offering varying levels of downside protection, Calamos aims to attract a broader audience, including risk-averse investors, institutional clients, and financial advisors looking for more stable ways to allocate capital to the digital asset space. This innovative structure provides a sense of security, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin’s potential appreciation without the constant fear of sudden, significant losses. It’s a bridge between the high-growth potential of cryptocurrencies and the risk management principles common in traditional finance. Navigating the Upside Caps in Defined Outcome ETFs While the downside protection is a major draw, it’s crucial for investors to understand the trade-off: the ETFs come with defined upside caps. This means that while you’re protected from significant losses beyond a certain point, your potential gains are also limited. These caps are set at the beginning of each one-year period and reset annually. This characteristic is fundamental to all defined outcome ETFs . They are designed to offer a known range of potential returns, making them suitable for investors who prioritize predictable outcomes over unlimited upside potential. It’s about managing expectations and providing a more controlled investment experience in a notoriously volatile market. The Future of Digital Asset Investing The launch of these Calamos ETFs signifies a maturing landscape for digital asset investing . It reflects a growing sophistication in product development, moving beyond simple spot exposure to more nuanced, risk-managed strategies. As more traditional firms enter the space with diverse offerings, it paves the way for greater institutional adoption and wider accessibility for retail investors. This evolution is critical for integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios, offering investors more choices and tailored solutions to meet their unique risk tolerances and financial objectives. It underscores the long-term viability and increasing legitimacy of digital assets as a recognized asset class. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Bitcoin Exposure Calamos Investments’ forthcoming launch of CBOY, CBXY, and CBTY on July 8 marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency investment landscape. By offering defined downside protection coupled with upside caps, these innovative Bitcoin ETFs provide a compelling option for investors seeking a more controlled and predictable way to gain exposure to the world’s leading digital asset. This move not only expands the accessibility of Bitcoin but also sets a new standard for risk-managed investment products in the evolving digital asset ecosystem. It’s an exciting development that promises to reshape how many approach their crypto portfolios.

The flagship coin has struggled to rally beyond $108k in the weekly timeframe, thus signaling possible midterm weakness. Although institutional investors, led by Strategy and Metaplanet , have continued to relentlessly accumulate more BTCs, market data shows the appetite for long exposure has faded over time. According to market data from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s spot volume has hovered at around $7.7 billion in the recent past, far below the prior peaks. Why Traders Are Cautious About Bitcoin Price Consolidation Bitcoin price has failed to record similar bullish gains as Gold (XAUUSD) in the past few months despite the U.S. dollar losing around 10 percent in value since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. The short-term market uncertainty caused by the sharp differences between the Federal Reserve and the government of the day on Interest rates has reduced the overall BTC speculation. According to Aksel Kibar , a popular classical chart trader, the BTC price has gradually formed a potential head and shoulders (H&S) pattern in the weekly timeframe. Although the buyers have been attempting to push higher in the recent past, Kibar highlighted that BTC price must consistently close above $109k in the weekly timeframe to confirm bullish momentum. With the poor performance of the trade negotiations between the United States and other nations led by Canada, Japan, and the European Union, the BTC price faces a midterm bearish outlook. As Coinpedia reported, BTC price is likely to retest $92k before reaching $120k in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-analysis-low-speculative-urgency-signals-more-pain-in-the-midterm/,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T18:30:12,"Crypto Investors Face New IRS Tax Pressures","Over the past two months, an increasing number of U.S. crypto investors have been receiving tax letters from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). According to CoinLedger, a leading crypto tax software company, there has been a 750% increase in users getting these notifications. The IRS is increasing its focus on digital assets and preparing for new regulations. As a result, many regular investors are finding the process confusing and stressful. IRS Crypto Tax Notices Are Increasing Fast CoinLedger reports a significant increase in IRS letters sent to its users. CEO David Kemmerer says this could be the beginning of a larger IRS push to enforce crypto tax rules. The IRS is now getting better access to crypto transaction data as it prepares for new reporting rules. Notably, the IRS sends different types of letters about crypto taxes. Some are just reminders, while others warn of possible missing income. The most serious ones claim underreporting and may lead to audits or a tax bill, often needing a response within 30 days. Accounting firms have also noticed the trend, as more clients enquire about unexpected letters. Many everyday investors still lack a comprehensive understanding of their tax responsibilities regarding cryptocurrency, resulting in confusion and concern. Although some political leaders have discussed removing taxes on cryptocurrency , no new legislation has been passed. For now, the IRS is getting stricter, and many regular investors are being affected. New Crypto Tax Rules Are Coming Starting in 2026, crypto brokers will be required to report both the total amount and the original cost of digital asset sales to the IRS. This will be done through a new form called 1099-DA. The goal is to minimize errors and enhance accuracy in tax reporting. This will give the IRS a clearer view of investors’ crypto profits and losses. Notably, this upcoming rule will not affect decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. In March, President Donald Trump repealed a controversial IRS rule that would have forced DeFi platforms to disclose transaction details. However, centralized platforms still have to report user activity. This new rule is expected to bring big changes to how crypto is taxed in the U.S. Profits Rise, But Tax Mistakes Trigger IRS Warnings Earlier this year, CoinLedger shared that the average crypto investor made over $5,000 in profits in 2024. According to reports, most gains were attributed to Bitcoin (BTC) and other newer altcoins, while coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) experienced losses. Kemmerer stated that many people receiving IRS letters are not avoiding taxes; most make small mistakes or forget to report older activity. A common issue is wallet-to-wallet transfers, which are not taxed but can cause confusion if not tracked properly. As crypto taxes become more strict, it is more important than ever to report accurately and stay compliant.

2025-06-27T18:20:15,"Bitcoin’s Crucial June: Unveiling Its Weakest Monthly Performance in a Year","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Crucial June: Unveiling Its Weakest Monthly Performance in a Year The world of cryptocurrency is rarely dull, but sometimes, even the most seasoned investors are left scratching their heads. Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, recently delivered a performance that has many wondering: what’s really going on? According to CoinDesk, citing compelling data from the reputable on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to record a mere 2% gain in June. This figure marks its weakest monthly performance since July of the previous year, a stark contrast to the exhilarating rallies many have come to expect. While institutional adoption and robust U.S. spot ETF inflows paint a picture of growing mainstream acceptance, the underlying Bitcoin price action tells a more nuanced story. Let’s dive deeper into what Glassnode’s insights reveal about the current state of the market and what it means for you. What Does Glassnode Analysis Reveal About Bitcoin’s Recent Performance? For those closely watching the digital asset space, Glassnode is a name synonymous with in-depth market intelligence. Their Glassnode analysis provides a granular view of blockchain activity, offering insights that traditional market metrics often miss. Their latest findings paint a clear picture of a market grappling with indecision. A 2% monthly gain for Bitcoin might sound positive on paper, especially when compared to traditional assets, but for a cryptocurrency known for its volatility and parabolic surges, it signifies a significant slowdown. Historically, post-halving periods have often been characterized by periods of accumulation and subsequent explosive growth. However, this June’s Bitcoin performance suggests a different dynamic. Despite the significant influx of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs – a development that many believed would consistently propel prices upward – the market seems to be hitting a ceiling. Glassnode’s data points to a curious dichotomy: while institutional interest remains strong, there’s clear selling activity occurring from both large holders (whales) and smaller, retail participants. This profit-taking behavior, while natural after a significant rally, indicates a lack of conviction for immediate upward momentum. Consider this perspective: Subdued Gains: A 2% gain is far below the double-digit, sometimes triple-digit, monthly returns seen in previous bull cycles. Historical Context: Marking the weakest performance in nearly a year highlights a significant shift from the more volatile, yet often upward-trending, price action Bitcoin has displayed. Conflicting Signals: The paradox of strong institutional inflows clashing with widespread profit-taking from existing holders creates a complex market environment. Why Are Whales and Smaller Holders Selling? Dissecting On-Chain Data It’s a question many investors are asking: if Bitcoin ETFs are attracting billions, why isn’t the price soaring? The answer lies in the fascinating world of on-chain data. Glassnode’s strength lies in tracking the actual movements of coins on the blockchain, providing unparalleled transparency into market participant behavior. Their latest report indicates that both ‘whales’ (addresses holding significant amounts of BTC) and smaller, ‘shrimp’ holders are contributing to the selling pressure. This isn’t necessarily a sign of panic, but rather a reflection of strategic profit-taking. Many long-term holders acquired their Bitcoin at much lower prices and are now realizing gains. For whales, this could be a rebalancing of portfolios, or a belief that the asset needs a period of cooling off before its next leg up. For smaller holders, it might be a response to macroeconomic uncertainties or simply cashing out profits after enduring previous bear markets. Here’s what the on-chain data implies: Realized Gains: A significant portion of the coins moving are doing so at a profit, indicating that holders are locking in returns. Supply Dynamics: While new demand from ETFs is absorbing some of this supply, it’s not enough to overcome the selling pressure from existing holders who are taking chips off the table. Market Indecision: Glassnode explicitly concluded that the market has entered another period of indecision. This means there’s no clear consensus on the next major price move, leading to choppy, sideways trading. This dynamic creates a tug-of-war: new money coming in versus existing money exiting. For the crypto market trends , this period of rebalancing is crucial. Is This Just a Temporary Pause? Understanding BTC Consolidation When an asset like Bitcoin experiences a period of sideways movement after a significant rally, analysts often refer to it as a BTC consolidation phase. This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal; in fact, it can be a healthy and necessary part of a market cycle. Consolidation allows the market to digest previous gains, shed weaker hands, and build a stronger foundation for future price movements. Think of it like a coiled spring. After a rapid expansion, the spring needs to compress before it can release energy again. During consolidation: Price Discovery Slows: Volatility often decreases, and the price tends to trade within a defined range. Accumulation or Distribution: This period can be one of accumulation (smart money buying up cheaper coins from those selling) or distribution (smart money offloading to new, less informed buyers). Glassnode’s data on whale selling suggests a mix of both, leaning towards distribution by some larger entities. Market Re-evaluation: Investors use this time to reassess fundamentals, macro factors, and future catalysts. Historically, Bitcoin has seen numerous consolidation phases, some lasting for weeks or even months, before breaking out to new highs. The key is to identify whether the current phase is merely a pause before continuation or a precursor to a deeper correction. The lack of strong immediate upward momentum despite positive news (like ETF inflows) suggests that the market needs more time to absorb new demand and overcome selling pressure. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what does this period of indecision and consolidation mean for you, the investor? Understanding the current crypto market trends is vital for making informed decisions. While the short-term outlook may seem less exciting, it presents opportunities for those with a long-term vision. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Patience is Key: In a consolidation phase, impulsive decisions often lead to losses. Adopt a patient approach and avoid being swayed by daily price fluctuations. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, a consolidation period can be an excellent time to accumulate more BTC through DCA. This involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which helps average out your purchase price over time. Focus on Fundamentals: Revisit why you invested in Bitcoin in the first place. Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing adoption remain strong long-term fundamentals. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Keep an eye on reports from firms like Glassnode. Understanding supply dynamics, exchange flows, and holder behavior can provide early warnings or confirmations of shifts in market sentiment. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Volatility, even during consolidation, can still be significant. Educate Yourself: Use this slower period to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology, new protocols, and emerging trends within the broader crypto ecosystem. This is a time for strategic positioning, not panic. The market is maturing, and its reactions to news and data are becoming more complex. What was once a purely speculative asset is now attracting serious institutional capital, which brings with it a different set of market dynamics. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For While June’s performance has been subdued, it doesn’t necessarily signal the end of Bitcoin’s bull run. Rather, it highlights a period of necessary recalibration. Moving forward, investors should closely monitor several key indicators: ETF Inflow Consistency: Will institutional demand continue to absorb selling pressure? Sustained strong inflows could eventually tip the scales. Macroeconomic Factors: Global interest rates, inflation data, and geopolitical events continue to influence risk assets like Bitcoin. Whale Behavior: Glassnode’s future reports on whale accumulation or continued distribution will be crucial for gauging sentiment among the largest holders. Breakout/Breakdown from Consolidation: Eventually, Bitcoin will break out of its current range. Monitoring key support and resistance levels will be vital for identifying the next major move. The current phase is a test of patience and conviction for many. It’s a reminder that markets rarely move in a straight line, and periods of rest are essential for sustainable growth. In conclusion, Glassnode’s latest report serves as a crucial reality check for Bitcoin enthusiasts. While the 2% gain in June might be its weakest in a year, it underscores a healthy, albeit frustrating, consolidation phase. The market is absorbing new institutional demand while simultaneously dealing with profit-taking from existing holders. This period of indecision is a natural part of the market cycle, allowing for re-evaluation and the building of a stronger foundation. For investors, it’s a time to exercise patience, apply sound risk management, and focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space. The future of Bitcoin remains bright, but its path forward will likely be characterized by periods of calm reflection before the next surge.

2025-06-27T18:12:01,"Five Law Firms Files Lawsuit against Strategy Over Bitcoin","Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has become the subject of discussion among several firms, with a number of them bringing lawsuits against the Bitcoin (BTC) behemoth. It was recently reported that five law firms filed identical class action lawsuits against Strategy. Strategy Accused of Misleading Bitcoin Statements The prosecutors have charged the business intelligence software firm with securities fraud related to the Bitcoin treasury it has built over the past five years. They have accused the firm of making misleading investment statements, including some about Bitcoin and Strategy’s business, operations, and prospects. According to Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, “the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated.” Also, Strategy has been indicted for understating the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. Nor did it reveal the magnitude of losses Strategy could attract on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08. These firms are seeking to recover damages from Strategy. To this end, more entities are encouraged to join the class action. Strategy Acquires More Bitcoin This comes only a few days after Strategy added more BTC to its growing collection. Michael Saylor, the firm’s CEO, stated that the firm purchased an additional 245 Bitcoin units at a cost of around $26 million. Each digital coin was bought at an average price of $105,856. So far, the company has acquired a total of 592,345 BTC in Bitcoin holdings. Collectively, these were acquired for about $41.87 billion but are now worth nearly $60 billion, based on the present market value of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Copies Strategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Another firm with a strong Bitcoin accumulation strategy is Metaplanet, also known as Asian MicroStrategy. This Japanese financial giant also purchased 1,111 Bitcoins for approximately $118.2 million around the same time as Strategy’s recent acquisition. Each unit of Bitcoin was acquired at an average price of $106,408. Metaplanet’s total holdings have now reached 11,111 BTC, purchased for about $1.07 billion. The Bitcoin price is currently at $107,302.30, which places the value of Metaplanet’s holding at nearly $1.12 billion. The company has achieved a strong return, reporting a 306.7% yield this year, which is significantly above most market averages.

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely trade sideways a little longer before reclaiming $108,500 as support and then have a massive breakout to a new ATH. “Slight consolidation before the next breakout, that’s what Bitcoin is telling us. It couldn’t break through this resistance in one-go and is therefore consolidating. That’s fine, I assume we’ll see a big breakout to an ATH when we clear $108,500.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $106,706 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may be on the verge of an explosive move to the upside as it holds the level around $2,400 as support. “We’re likely going to be testing the other side of the range in the upcoming weeks… I’m expecting strong continuation from ETH to be happening in the coming days/weeks as we’re holding onto the range low.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, he suggests that ETH may soon hit the $2,800 level again in early July.

Altcoins, meanwhile, struggled to catch a bid. According to a Binance Research report on June 27, Bitcoin ( BTC ) weathered a volatile weekend spurred by Middle East tensions, briefly dipping below $98,000 before surging past $107,000 and outperforming traditional markets. While the S&P 500 and gold saw muted reactions, BTC’s swift recovery reinforced its status as the go-to asset during uncertainty. Ethereum ( ETH ), meanwhile, lagged with a steeper 17% drop and weaker rebound, underscoring its relative fragility in crisis moments. You might also like: Aptos hits milestone as RWA on-chain breaks $540m Bitcoin’s resilience meets altcoin indifference While Bitcoin’s rebound past $107,000 showcased its strength, the numbers reveal a stark contrast with traditional assets. Per the report, the S&P 500 gained 2.56%, a solid performance, but one that paled next to BTC’s 5% weekly surge after its weekend dip. Gold, typically a safe haven, barely moved, while oil gave up early-week gains as supply fears eased. Notably, the U.S. dollar slumped to a three-year low after President Trump’s renewed attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, reigniting concerns over central bank independence. Bitcoin’s ability to outpace other assets reinforces its dual role as both a risk asset and a hedge against political chaos. BTC once again behaved more like a strategic asset than a speculative bet. Altcoins, however, missed the memo. The divergence suggests a market that still plays by Bitcoin’s rules. Historically, BTC rallies eventually spill over into altcoins—but the 2025 cycle has defied expectations. Ethereum’s 17% weekend plunge and tepid recovery to $2,480, still below its opening price, highlighted its lagging resilience. Solana ( SOL ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) barely budged, mirroring ETH struggles, while speculative favorites in the AI and meme coin categories lacked momentum. The indifference reveals a deeper structural shift: altcoin cycles no longer operate on autopilot. Without a unifying catalyst or narrative, the market has become fragmented, its attention diluted across thousands of competing tokens. The hidden drag on Bitcoin’s momentum Despite reclaiming $107,000, BTC is on track for its weakest monthly gain (just 2%) since July 2025, per crypto.news data. Beneath the surface, Bitcoin faces its own headwinds—a tug-of-war between institutional inflows and whale selling. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed $3.9 billion in fresh capital this month, yet on-chain metrics show large holders (10,000+ BTC) are net sellers, according to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score. Mid-sized wallets (10–10,000 BTC) are accumulating, but opportunistically, suggesting traders are playing ranges rather than betting on a breakout. Bitcoin’s dominance is undeniable, but its solo act raises questions. For altcoins to awaken, the original cryptocurrency may need more than just stability, it might need a true catalyst that reignites risk appetite across crypto’s saturated landscape.

Darkfost, a verified author and on-chain analyst who shared the development on X, highlighted that Bitcoin whale inflows to exchanges are experiencing a sharp decline when compared to the past month. This trend signals a potential shift in market dynamics toward a more confident state among whale holders. A sharp drop in whale inflows to exchanges reflects a retreat from immediate selling pressure , perhaps a revived preference for long-term holdings. It is mostly regarded as a bullish signal because reduced whale inflows often precede periods of price spikes, as it limits massive sell-offs. As Bitcoin broke above the $100,000 mark and pushed toward a new all-time high, Darkfost stated that large investors took advantage of the rally and secured notable gains. The same action from these holders was seen back in 2024. “Actually, the current pattern closely resembles what we saw in 2024 when BTC was reaching a new ATH,” the on-chain expert added. During this ongoing period of upward price performance, there was a brief second, lesser wave of inflows before inflows began to decline once again. This second wave of inflows was a result of the $2 billion in capital inflows recorded on June 16. However, Darkfost revealed that the inflows were entirely due to an internal transaction on Binance that moved over 20,000 BTC, while underscoring the importance of monitoring the metric on a monthly level for a much clearer signal. If whale inflows continue to reduce on exchanges and history repeats itself, the expert is confident that the development might set the stage for Bitcoin to rally to a new all-time high in the near term. BTC Next Big Move Approaching Crypto analysts, such as Titan of Crypto, have hinted at a move to a new all-time high . In his recent analysis, the technical expert and trader highlighted that BTC could be gearing up for its next major move beyond its current peak. Titan of Crypto’s forecast is supported by a key Inverse Head and Shoulders formation on the 1-month chart, which has remained valid since it emerged. Looking at the chart, Bitcoin broke out from the neckline of the channel and later retested the line. However, BTC ’s price held strong above this line and rebounded sharply back to the $107,000 threshold. Should this ongoing uptrend persist, Titan of Crypto anticipates a robust surge to the $125,000 mark.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-whales-step-back/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Whale Inflows|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern|Titan of Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T18:00:15,"Vinanz Unleashes Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation with $631K Boost","BitcoinWorld Vinanz Unleashes Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation with $631K Boost In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, companies are continually seeking innovative ways to strengthen their financial positions and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Today, the spotlight falls on Vinanz Ltd., a UK-listed mining firm that has just made another significant move, signaling a robust commitment to its Bitcoin strategy. This latest acquisition isn’t just a headline; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, even for companies deeply entrenched in the crypto mining sector. For those keenly following the cryptocurrency market, this development from Vinanz offers compelling insights into the strategic foresight driving some of the industry’s key players. Why Vinanz is Doubling Down on Bitcoin ? Vinanz Ltd. recently announced the purchase of an additional 5.85 BTC, valued at approximately $631,000. This brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 65.03 BTC. But why would a company primarily focused on crypto mining operations choose to accumulate Bitcoin rather than immediately liquidating its mined assets? The answer lies in a multi-faceted strategy aimed at long-term value creation and financial resilience. Strategic Treasury Management: By holding Bitcoin, Vinanz is essentially treating BTC as a primary treasury asset, akin to how traditional companies might hold gold or other stable assets. This strategy aims to hedge against inflation and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation over time. Synergy with Mining Operations: For a crypto mining firm, accumulating Bitcoin is a natural extension of its core business. They are already generating BTC through their operations; holding a portion of it aligns their balance sheet directly with the asset they produce, creating a direct upside from Bitcoin’s price movements. Market Confidence: Vinanz’s continued BTC acquisition signals strong internal confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. This can inspire investor confidence, suggesting that the company believes in the long-term viability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This approach isn’t unique to Vinanz, but their consistent accumulation highlights a growing trend among savvy companies looking to diversify and strengthen their financial foundations in the digital age. The Growing Trend of Crypto Mining Firms Building Digital Assets Treasuries Vinanz’s strategy is part of a broader movement where companies, particularly those involved in crypto mining , are increasingly opting to build substantial digital asset treasuries. This paradigm shift challenges the traditional view of corporate finance and embraces the potential of cryptocurrencies as legitimate, long-term investments. Here’s a look at why this trend is gaining momentum: Benefits of a Corporate Digital Asset Treasury: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion and inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often viewed as a scarce asset with a fixed supply, making it an attractive hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth potential. Holding BTC allows companies to participate directly in this growth. Balance Sheet Strength: A substantial holding of a high-value digital asset can enhance a company’s balance sheet, potentially improving its creditworthiness and attractiveness to investors. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing digital assets positions a company as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a new generation of investors and talent. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously pioneered this corporate Bitcoin treasury model, inspiring others to follow suit. While Vinanz ‘s holdings are currently smaller, their consistent additions demonstrate a clear strategic direction that aligns with this burgeoning trend. Understanding Vinanz ‘s Strategic BTC Acquisition Vinanz Ltd.’s latest BTC acquisition , bringing their total to 65.03 BTC, underscores a deliberate and sustained effort to build a robust Bitcoin treasury. Operating mining facilities across the U.S. and Canada, Vinanz is strategically positioned in regions known for their stable energy grids and favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrency operations. This geographic diversification not only optimizes their mining efficiency but also provides a stable base from which to execute their treasury strategy. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin rather than selling it immediately to cover operational costs or generate fiat revenue speaks volumes. It suggests that Vinanz’s leadership team believes the intrinsic value and future appreciation of Bitcoin outweigh the immediate benefits of liquidation. This long-term vision is critical in the volatile crypto market, where short-term fluctuations can often obscure the broader trajectory. Consider the potential impact of such a strategy: Strategy Type Description Potential Benefits Potential Risks Bitcoin Treasury (Vinanz Model) Holding mined BTC on the balance sheet for long-term appreciation and inflation hedge. Significant upside potential from BTC price increases; strong signal of confidence in crypto. Exposure to BTC price volatility; potential liquidity challenges if immediate fiat is needed. Immediate Liquidation Selling mined BTC immediately to convert to fiat currency for operational expenses or profit. Predictable fiat revenue; reduces exposure to crypto market volatility. Missed opportunities for BTC appreciation; constant pressure to optimize fiat conversion rates. Vinanz’s choice to lean heavily into the Bitcoin Treasury model highlights a sophisticated understanding of both their operational capabilities and the macroeconomic landscape, positioning them for potential significant gains should Bitcoin continue its upward trajectory. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? While the allure of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is strong, it’s crucial to acknowledge both the significant benefits and the inherent challenges. For companies like Vinanz, navigating this landscape requires careful consideration and robust risk management. Key Benefits: Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional asset portfolio can provide diversification, as its price movements often correlate differently with traditional financial markets. Attracting New Investors: A forward-thinking stance on digital assets can attract a new segment of investors who are enthusiastic about the crypto space. Cost-Efficiency (Long-term): If Bitcoin appreciates significantly, the value of the treasury could far exceed the cost of acquisition, creating substantial shareholder value. Key Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. Significant price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex and varies by jurisdiction, often requiring specialized expertise. Vinanz, by choosing this path, is clearly demonstrating a belief that the potential rewards outweigh these challenges, and they likely have robust strategies in place to mitigate these risks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Digital Assets Landscape For investors looking at companies like Vinanz, understanding their digital assets strategy is paramount. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin is not just about a single purchase; it’s indicative of a broader corporate philosophy. Here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Management’s Vision: Does the company’s leadership clearly articulate its rationale for holding crypto? Is it a speculative bet or a well-thought-out treasury strategy? Vinanz’s consistent purchases suggest the latter. Assess Risk Management: How does the company mitigate the risks associated with crypto volatility and security? Look for evidence of robust security protocols and clear risk assessment frameworks. Consider Operational Synergy: For mining companies, how well does their crypto treasury strategy integrate with their core mining operations? A strong synergy, like that seen with Vinanz, can create a powerful compounding effect. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Understand if the company is building a long-term position or making short-term trades. Companies with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin, like Vinanz, often present a more stable investment thesis in the crypto space. The move by Vinanz is a microcosm of the larger trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency space. As more companies explore and implement strategies involving digital assets, the market matures, and new investment opportunities emerge. Keeping an eye on these pioneering firms provides valuable indicators for the broader market trajectory. In conclusion, Vinanz Ltd.’s continued strategic accumulation of Bitcoin is a significant development, underscoring a strong belief in the long-term value of digital assets. By building a substantial Bitcoin treasury alongside its robust crypto mining operations in the U.S. and Canada, Vinanz is positioning itself not just as a miner, but as a sophisticated player in the broader digital economy. This proactive approach highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, aiming for financial resilience and growth in an increasingly digital world. For investors, it serves as a compelling example of how traditional business models are adapting and thriving within the innovative landscape of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-27T17:59:07,"List of the Most Discussed Words in the Cryptocurrency Community in the Last 24 Hours Published – Two Altcoins Are Trending","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Santiment has revealed the words that have attracted the most attention in the cryptocurrency community in the last 24 hours. Here are the words popular in the cryptocurrency community according to Santiment analysts: The word 'BTC' came to the fore in light of Bitcoin's central role in cryptocurrency investment, its impact on market behavior, and its comparison to other tokens. Discussions about Bitcoin's use as a store of value and alternative currency are back on the agenda. In addition, large institutional purchases and bull market signals for Bitcoin are among the factors that triggered this rise. The word ‘July’ has become a trending topic in the crypto and financial world due to the many major events expected to take place during July. In particular, Bitcoin price predictions focusing on the end of July 2025, Coinbase launching perpetual futures on July 21, various token launches, legislative hearings being postponed until July, and regulatory initiatives such as the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act being considered in the US Senate make this month a critical juncture for the markets. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies The word ‘Yapyo’ came to the fore thanks to the pre-sale preparations and community interactions of YAPYO, a project connected to the on-chain ecosystem on the Arbitrum blockchain. US-based digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings is in the news with its $1 billion shelf offering application. This application to the SEC has led to speculation that the company may purchase Bitcoin and expand its digital asset strategy. The policy updates that allow the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)-backed company to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet have also attracted attention. The word ‘Bhutan’ has been trending since the Asian country of Bhutan was found to have secretly mined 12,000 Bitcoins since 2020. This reserve is reportedly worth around $1.3 billion, equivalent to 40% of Bhutan’s GDP, making it the third-largest state-backed Bitcoin holder after the US and China. Bhutan’s mining operations are also supported by renewable hydroelectric power, making the country a standout in the field of sustainable mining. The word XRP is on the agenda again due to Ripple's securities lawsuit. In the ongoing litigation process with the SEC, the court rejected requests for early closure of the case. This creates uncertainty over XRP's price, institutional sales and regulatory status. On the other hand, hopeful expectations for XRP have also begun to increase with cross-chain solutions and partnerships for use in payment infrastructures. *This is not investment advice.

Per CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization stood at $3.29 trillion, underpinned by a global trading volume of $97.8 billion, albeit this being 4.4% down in the past 24 hours. While Bitcoin held above $107k and XRP hovered around $2.10, outperforming assets on the day among altcoins included Euler (EUL) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Meanwhile, profit taking pushed Sahara AI and Across Protocol, among others, into negative territory. Bitcoin (BTC) holds above $107k Bitcoin maintained its bullish stance, trading above $107k, with its market cap at $2.1 trillion and daily volume at $45.5 billion. The spot Bitcoin ETF market witnessed net inflows of $225.9 million, with BlackRock’s iShares ETF (IBIT) recording $162.48 million. Institutional interest remained elevated as Strategy, Metaplanet, and others all bought the dip earlier in the week.

The altcoin was holding the key level despite a legal setback after Judge Torres denied a joint SEC/Ripple motion to end an XRP institutional sales injunction. The motion for an indicative ruling also sought the court’s decision on Ripple and the SEC settlement over the $125 million penalty imposed on the company. XRP nonetheless remains bullish amid ETFs anticipation, stablecoin growth , and regulatory developments. Euler (EUL) price soars, just shy of all-time high Euler Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, saw its token EUL surge by 27% to highs of $11.13. The gains meant the EUL price was just shy of the all-time high of $12.97 reached in September 2022. Gains aligned with buying pressure as daily volume spiked over 200%. Also notable is the growth of the recently launched DEX protocol EulerSwap, which hit over $230 million in volume just weeks after its debut. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) surges 12%, above key resistance level Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) climbed 12% to $0.0104, driven by ecosystem developments. Mainly, the PENGU price has risen in the past three days after Cboe submitted its 19b-4 filing for the listing of Canary Capital’s PENGU ETF. The ETF, one of many on small-cap altcoins, will hold 80-95% in PENGU tokens and 5-15% in Pudgy Penguin NFTs.

2025-06-27T17:40:01,"XRP ETF Hopes Remain Optimistic Despite Crucial Ripple SEC Motion Dismissal","BitcoinWorld XRP ETF Hopes Remain Optimistic Despite Crucial Ripple SEC Motion Dismissal The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to legal battles and regulatory hurdles, especially when it comes to groundbreaking assets like XRP. Recent developments in the ongoing saga between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have once again stirred discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike. A recent decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to reject a joint motion from Ripple and the SEC has naturally raised eyebrows. However, for those eyeing the potential approval of a Spot XRP ETF , a prominent pro-Ripple attorney offers a surprisingly optimistic perspective. Understanding the Latest Ripple SEC Court Dismissal To fully grasp the implications of the latest court ruling, it’s essential to understand what a ‘joint motion’ entails in a legal context, particularly concerning the Ripple SEC lawsuit. In this instance, both parties, Ripple and the SEC, had jointly approached the court regarding certain procedural aspects or perhaps a minor dispute within the broader litigation. Judge Analisa Torres, who has presided over significant parts of this high-profile case, ultimately dismissed this joint request. While any rejection from the court might initially seem like a setback for Ripple, attorney Fred Rispoli, a vocal supporter of Ripple’s position, quickly offered a nuanced interpretation. According to Rispoli, this specific dismissal, while a procedural point, does not directly threaten the prospects of an XRP ETF . His reasoning centers on a crucial distinction that has been central to the entire lawsuit: the status of XRP on the secondary market. Key takeaways from this dismissal, according to Rispoli’s analysis, include: Procedural, Not Substantive: The dismissal likely pertains to a procedural agreement or a minor point of contention between the parties, rather than a fundamental ruling on XRP’s security status. Focus on Primary vs. Secondary: The core of the SEC’s argument against Ripple has always revolved around Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities offerings. This latest dismissal does not re-litigate or alter the court’s previous findings regarding XRP’s status on secondary exchanges. No Direct Impact on ETF Criteria: ETF approvals are heavily dependent on the underlying asset’s market characteristics, particularly its trading on secondary markets, not the primary issuance. Why is the XRP Secondary Market Status So Crucial for an ETF? The distinction between primary and secondary markets is paramount when discussing the potential for a Spot XRP ETF . Think of it this way: when a company initially sells its stock directly to investors, that’s the primary market. When those investors then trade the stock among themselves on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, that’s the secondary market. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple primarily targeted Ripple’s direct, programmatic sales of XRP to institutional investors, classifying them as unregistered securities offerings. However, Judge Torres’s landmark ruling in July 2023 determined that XRP, when sold on secondary exchanges to retail investors, does not constitute an investment contract. This distinction is the bedrock of Fred Rispoli’s optimism. Here’s why the XRP Secondary Market status is so vital for ETF approval: Regulatory Clarity: The court’s ruling provided a degree of clarity that XRP, as traded on public exchanges, is not an unregistered security. This reduces a significant regulatory hurdle for issuers looking to launch a spot ETF. Comparison: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Factor Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval XRP Spot ETF Potential Primary Regulatory Hurdle Market manipulation concerns, lack of surveillance-sharing agreements. XRP’s classification as a security (now largely resolved for secondary sales). SEC’s Stance Historically resistant, citing investor protection. More complex due to ongoing lawsuit, but secondary market clarity is a positive. Market Structure Robust, liquid spot market. Robust, liquid spot market, now with legal clarity on status. Investor Protection: ETFs are designed to offer regulated access to assets. If the underlying asset’s secondary market trading is deemed legitimate and non-security, it aligns with the SEC’s mandate to protect investors within regulated financial products. Precedent from Bitcoin ETFs: The recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC sets a significant precedent. While each asset is evaluated individually, the framework and the SEC’s comfort with regulated spot crypto products have increased. The core requirements, such as surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets, will likely apply to a potential Spot XRP ETF as well. Fred Rispoli emphasizes that the injunction against XRP selling, which the SEC might seek, only truly matters if the SEC decides to enforce it broadly to impact secondary markets. He suggests the SEC could opt not to enforce such restrictions on the secondary market, focusing instead on Ripple’s direct sales if any. This flexibility on the SEC’s part could be pivotal. The Role of Fred Rispoli and His Insights Attorney Fred Rispoli has become a notable voice in the cryptocurrency legal landscape, particularly concerning the Ripple-SEC case. His consistent analysis and interpretations have provided valuable insights for the XRP community. Rispoli’s perspective is rooted in a deep understanding of securities law and the specific nuances of the Ripple litigation. His ability to dissect complex legal jargon and translate it into understandable implications for the market has made him a trusted source for many. Rispoli’s argument that the secondary market status is the “key factor” influencing XRP ETF approval aligns with the broader legal and regulatory trends seen in the crypto space. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the mechanisms of trading and the integrity of the exchanges where these assets are bought and sold, rather than solely focusing on their initial distribution methods. This shift in focus is a significant win for XRP, as its secondary market trading has been largely deemed legitimate by the court. Beyond the Courtroom: The Influence of Regulatory Reform and Paul Atkins While court rulings provide clarity, the broader regulatory environment plays an equally significant role in the approval of new financial products like a Spot XRP ETF . Fred Rispoli wisely points to the importance of potential shifts in crypto regulation, specifically mentioning whether a ‘new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins’ is geared up for reform. While Gary Gensler currently chairs the SEC, the mention of Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner known for his pro-market and less interventionist stance, highlights the ongoing debate within regulatory circles about the future of crypto oversight. The crypto industry has long advocated for clear, comprehensive regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. The current patchwork of regulations and the SEC’s enforcement-first approach have created uncertainty. Should there be a genuine move towards regulatory reform, potentially influenced by figures like Paul Atkins who advocate for clearer rules and less ambiguity, it could significantly expedite the approval process for various crypto-related financial products, including an XRP ETF . What kind of reforms are needed? Here are some key areas: Clear Classification of Digital Assets: A framework that clearly defines which digital assets are securities, commodities, or something else entirely. Innovation-Friendly Regulations: Rules that allow new technologies and business models to flourish without being unfairly constrained by outdated frameworks. Harmonization: Better coordination between different regulatory bodies (SEC, CFTC, etc.) to avoid overlapping or conflicting rules. Pathways for Compliance: Clear guidelines for crypto projects to comply with existing laws, rather than relying on enforcement actions. The debate around regulatory reform is critical because it addresses the systemic issues that create uncertainty for issuers and investors. A more predictable and supportive regulatory landscape would undoubtedly pave the way for more crypto ETFs to gain approval. The Path Forward for a Spot XRP ETF: What to Watch Despite the procedural dismissal, the overall sentiment regarding a Spot XRP ETF remains cautiously optimistic, largely thanks to the legal clarity gained on the XRP Secondary Market . Investors and market participants should keep an eye on several key indicators: SEC’s Stance on Other Crypto ETFs: While Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the SEC’s decisions on Ethereum ETFs and other altcoin ETFs will provide further clues about their evolving comfort level with various digital assets. Court Filings and Appeals: The broader Ripple-SEC lawsuit is not entirely over. Any further appeals or significant rulings could impact the perception of XRP’s regulatory status, though Rispoli’s analysis suggests the secondary market ruling is quite robust. Applications from Asset Managers: The submission of official applications for a Spot XRP ETF by major asset management firms (similar to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF application) would signal serious intent and could kickstart the formal review process. Legislative Developments: Any new crypto legislation emerging from Congress could override or clarify existing regulatory ambiguities, potentially streamlining the ETF approval process. The journey to a Spot XRP ETF is complex, weaving through legal battles, regulatory policy, and market dynamics. However, the insights from experts like Fred Rispoli provide a valuable roadmap, highlighting that the core legal status of XRP’s secondary market trading is the most potent factor in its favor, outweighing procedural skirmishes. Conclusion: Unwavering Optimism for XRP’s ETF Future The latest court dismissal in the protracted Ripple SEC legal battle, while a headline, appears to be a mere blip on the radar for the potential approval of a Spot XRP ETF . As articulated by attorney Fred Rispoli , the fundamental legal clarity achieved regarding the XRP Secondary Market status remains the paramount factor. This distinction, separating Ripple’s past institutional sales from the everyday trading of XRP on exchanges, provides a robust foundation for future ETF applications. The path forward for XRP into mainstream financial products seems increasingly plausible, bolstered by legal precedents and the ongoing push for clearer crypto regulations. While challenges persist, the core legal victory for XRP’s secondary market status offers compelling reasons for continued optimism among its proponents.

2025-06-27T17:38:04,"‘BTC All-Time Highs Are Coming’: Arthur Hayes Reveals 3 Key Catalysts For Next Parabolic Bitcoin Bull Run","The market may have cooled for now, but the bull rally is far from over. Bitcoin billionaire and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has highlighted multiple catalysts that could supercharge the next BTC bull run to fresh all-time highs. 3 Signs That Suggest BTC Has Room For Further Upside Arthur Hayes took to X on Thursday to outline catalysts that he expects to drive Bitcoin prices higher in the coming months. For starters, the Bitcoin OG pointed to the United States’ monetary policy. Hayes noted that the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption for banks is currently “progressing.” The so-called SLR exemption is a monetary policy tool that lets banks hold more U.S. Treasury securities without raising their supplementary leverage ratio, a move that raises their liquidity. On top of that, Hayes pointed to the US legislation, including the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to set up guardrails around the approval and supervision of U.S. stablecoin issuers. According to the former BitMEX CEO, the GENIUS Act “hands US stablecoin market to banks.” Finally, Hayes claimed that the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are a boon for safe haven assets like Bitcoin, amid a fragile President Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire pact between Israel and Iran. “BTC all-time highs are coming.” Earlier this month, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would more than double within the next six months, rocketing to the $250,000 mark. The rocket surge will be buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve accelerating money printing to manage a ballooning national debt load.

2025-06-27T17:34:13,"Bitwise Files Updated Application For Spot Dogecoin ETF Amid Overwhelming SEC Approval Odds","Asset manager Bitwise has updated its filing for a U.S.-listed spot Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded fund, indicating that the Securities and Exchange Commission may soon approve the investment vehicle. Bitwise Includes In-Kind Redemptions In Amended DOGE ETF Filing On Thursday, ETF provider Bitwise submitted updated S-1 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos exchange-traded funds. This move, according to pundits, is an indication of increased approval odds. “Bitwise has filed amended S-1s for their spot dogecoin ETF and their spot aptos ETFs,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed on X. “Good signs as it indicates SEC engagement, and tracks with other spot approvals.” Notably, the Dogecoin filing was amended to include in-kind creations and redemptions, which were not present in Bitwise’s initial application. According to Balchunas, in-kind redemptions, whereby broker-dealers interacting with the ETF can directly trade shares for DOGE tokens instead of cash, are a “near-lock” for spot crypto ETFs “across the board.” At present, all U.S.-based crypto funds must exchange their tokens for cash, then swap that cash for shares — or swap the shares for cash, then the cash for tokens — which is considered less tax efficient. Notably, Bitwise was the first company to submit paperwork for a DOGE ETF in January. Other asset managers, including Grayscale and 21Shares, have also filed to introduce their own funds tracking the price of the OG memecoin. Multiple issuers and industry leaders have sought in-kind creations and redemptions for months, particularly for spot BTC and Ether ETFs that are already on the market. “You’re not adding in kind to the Doge ETF if they didn’t say it was probably kosher,” Balchunas opined. “And if it’s kosher for the Doge ETF, it’s going to be kosher for Bitcoin, which is a much bigger market. “It’s got to be close to 100% that we’ll see in kind creations for all of [the funds].” During a panel at the Bitcoin Policy Institute on Wednesday, US Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Hester Pierce said in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs are “certainly on the horizon.” Dogecoin was changing hands at approximately $ 0.1615, down 1.3% over the last 24 hours. The popular canine-themed meme coin, created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, is currently ninth-ranked on the crypto leaderboard with a $24.2 billion market capitalization. High Likelihood Of SEC Approval The Securities and Exchange Commission under the new Donald Trump administration has adopted a more lenient approach to crypto when compared to the previous Biden-Harris regime. Since the change of leadership at the SEC, companies have looked to get the agency’s approval for a slew of crypto ETFs, from ones tracking Ripple-affiliated XRP to Solana’s SOL to DOGE and Official Trump. Last week, Bloomberg experts raised the odds of the SEC greenlighting the majority of these spot crypto ETF filings in 2025 to 90% or above.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-files-updated-application-for-spot-dogecoin-etf-amid-overwhelming-sec-approval-odds/,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin",cryptocompare

Although it was officially retired in 2022, the Nano S has received some limited updates since then. However, Ledger has now decided to stop all software support for this model due to major hardware limitations. Users to Upgrade to Nano S Plus Guillemet explained that the Nano S does not have enough memory to support new security features and multiple applications. He pointed out that apps like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), LedgerOS, and exchange apps already fill almost all the memory on the device. This limits the ability to add new features, which is crucial in today’s changing digital asset ecosystem. Although support for the Nano S has ended, users can still use their devices for basic functions such as sending, receiving, and swapping funds. However, users will not receive any future security updates or new application support. Meanwhile, Ledger has encouraged users to upgrade to the Ledger Nano S Plus, which launched in 2022. It is worth noting that Ledger’s decision aligns with its aim of focusing on newer devices. This change helps the company focus on secure, innovative, and scalable hardware solutions. Ledger Teases Collaboration With Pudgy Penguins Recall that Ledger has hinted at a collaboration with the popular Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection, Pudgy Penguins. Interestingly, the announcement sparked excitement within the crypto community. This upcoming initiative is part of Ledger’s broader effort to expand its operations in the crypto industry. Ledger posted a cryptic message including geographical coordinates, suggesting the event will be launched in Dubai. As reported by TheCoinRise, the details of the partnership remain unknown. Ledger Faces Discord Breach Meanwhile, the hardware wallet provider is under the cybersecurity microscope after confirming that its Discord server was briefly compromised. A malicious actor exploited the account of a contracted moderator to post a fraudulent message urging users to verify their recovery phrases via a phishing link. While Ledger has insisted the incident was isolated and internal security measures have been tightened, the breach highlights a recurring vulnerability in community-driven platforms . As of now, Ledger has not confirmed whether any wallets were compromised and has yet to issue a public statement beyond the Discord update.

2025-06-27T17:00:30,"Bitcoin Dominance Holds Altcoin Season At Bay, Analyst Says No Upside Until This Happens","The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) continues to exert pressure on the broader crypto market, casting a shadow on the prospects of an incoming altcoin season. Despite recent volatility and decline in the market, a crypto analyst observes that Bitcoin Dominance remains firmly elevated, signaling that capital is still concentrated in the leading cryptocurrency. This trend, they argue, is preventing any meaningful breakout for altcoins and could persist unless a decisive shift in market structure occurs. Altcoin Season Stifled As Bitcoin Dominance Surges The Bitcoin Dominance in the cryptocurrency market is tightening its grip, crushing hopes of an imminent altcoin season. According to a recent technical analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter) by market expert Tony Severino, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance has reached 65.72% with both monthly and Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings pushing above the critical 70 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% – How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season At the time of the analysis, the RSI on the monthly timeline stood at 73.19, while the weekly registered at 70.58—both firmly in overbought territory. These levels typically reflect strong momentum and extended bullish conditions, indicating that Bitcoin’s command over the crypto market is still strong and growing. Severino shared a dual chart view of Bitcoin Dominance and RSI across the weekly and monthly time frames, highlighting candlestick structures that support Bitcoin’s ongoing upward momentum. BTC.D has been climbing since late 2023. The RSI values also remain comfortably above their respective Moving Average (MA) baselines of 67.31 and 65.42, indicating sustained strength rather than signs of immediate exhaustion. As long as Bitcoin Dominance holds these elevated RSI levels across their major time frames, Severino suggests that altcoins will likely continue to underperform, further delaying the long-awaited altcoin season. The analyst emphasizes that meaningful upside for altcoins will not begin until BTC.D starts to wane and RSI readings fall below 70—effectively signaling a shift in sentiment and market strength that could allow capital to rotate to alternative cryptocurrencies. Until such a pullback occurs, the analyst argues that the weekly and monthly BTC.D and RSI charts strongly indicate that any expectations of an altcoin season this cycle remain premature. Dragonfly Doji Forms On BTC.D Chart In another X post, Severino announced that the Bitcoin Dominance has potentially formed a Dragonfly Doji on the weekly chart. With four days left in the weekly session, the analyst notes that the distinct candle pattern is still developing but presently resembles the classic Dragonfly Doji, characterized by a long lower wick and a close near the opening price. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why Typically, this chart pattern is viewed as a bullish reversal signal when it appears at the bottom of a downtrend, indicating possible upside momentum. However, in this case, it has emerged during a broader uptrend in BTC.D, creating a more complicated technical picture. Severino believes that the Dragonfly Doji could either represent a continuation of the current momentum or a temporary pause in market direction. If the candle evolves into a larger bullish body and closes above the 65.65% level, it may confirm further strengthening of Bitcoin’s growing market dominance relative to altcoins.

2025-06-27T17:00:23,"Top 3 Crypto ICOs to Watch in July 2025: BlockDAG, Bitcoin Hyper, & Snorter Token Lead the Way","As the altcoin market starts to show signs of recovery, many buyers are turning their attention to early-stage opportunities that could surge in the next bull run. While larger names like Ethereum and Solana slowly regain traction, several crypto ICOs in the presale phase are catching attention thanks to real progress, strong use cases, and early community traction. Among the many new launches, three projects stand out right now: BlockDAG, Bitcoin Hyper, and Snorter Token. With a combined total of more than $324 million raised and compelling growth narratives, these projects could shape the next big wave in crypto. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the top 3 presale cryptos currently making waves: 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Raised Over $324M With Layer 1 Expansion Underway BlockDAG is quickly gaining a reputation as one of the most promising Layer 1 launches, and the figures prove it. The project has already raised $324 million, sold 23.3 billion BDAG units, and is offering a limited-time entry price of $0.0030. However, in less than 12 hours, that price shoots up to $0.0080. This is more than just another crypto ICO; it’s a full ecosystem in development. By combining Bitcoin’s Proof of Work security model with DAG-based architecture, BlockDAG aims to offer fast, scalable infrastructure capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. Unlike many other presales, the platform has already gone live with its testnet, released a no-code dApp builder, and built a user base of over 2 million through its X1 mobile mining app. The project’s appeal lies in more than just technology. It includes an ongoing 100 million coin airdrop, 18,200 mining rigs sold, and over 200,000 current holders. With a $0.05 exchange listing price confirmed, those who enter at $0.0030 could potentially see a 16x gain. Brand exposure is also increasing, thanks to a U.S.-based sponsorship push and a high-profile partnership with Inter Milan. Between infrastructure, momentum, and well-timed execution, BlockDAG is shaping up as a long-term player. 2. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Scaling Solutions for the Bitcoin Network Bitcoin Hyper is getting noticed as one of the more advanced Layer 2 solutions for Bitcoin, currently in its presale stage. With $1.6 million raised so far, the project focuses on bringing smart contract capabilities, low fees, and faster settlement to the Bitcoin network using tools like sidechains and optimistic rollups. Users will be able to bridge Bitcoin onto the HYPER platform, enjoy quick, low-cost transactions, and then move funds back to the original chain if needed. This flexibility preserves decentralization while enabling greater functionality. Its roadmap includes staking rewards, support for decentralized applications, and a user-friendly design for both developers and mainstream users. By moving beyond Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, HYPER is tapping into a growing demand for utility on the Bitcoin network. The project’s structure allocates 15% of the supply to staking incentives and 30% to development, setting a solid foundation for continued progress. 3. Snorter Token (SNORT): Combining Meme Energy With Real Trading Tools Snorter Token brings together meme coin culture and practical trading features. Built on Solana and priced at $0.0961, the project has raised over $1.2 million in its presale. SNORT is gaining recognition for its set of tools designed to enhance meme trading, including automated bots, rug-pull protection, and honeypot detection. Going beyond memes, Snorter plans to roll out a complete six-tool platform that helps everyday traders operate more safely and efficiently in this volatile space. One upcoming feature includes copy trading, which will let users mimic top-performing traders directly. The roadmap includes exchange launches, deployment of its Telegram-based trading bot, and deeper integration with DeFi services. If the platform hits its milestones, its fun brand and practical tools could attract significant attention after launch. Early Access, Strong Potential Each of these three projects addresses a distinct area of the crypto space: BlockDAG focuses on high-speed Layer 1 scaling, Bitcoin Hyper targets practical applications for Bitcoin through Layer 2, and Snorter Token aims to bring structure and safety to meme coin trading. While they have different approaches, they share common ground in terms of momentum, real-world relevance, and active communities. With presale pricing still in effect, now may be a rare window to tap into projects with strong fundamentals before they reach full market exposure. For those looking to combine early positioning with long-term upside, this trio presents a compelling mix of infrastructure value, practical use cases, and speculative energy. As the market shifts toward utility and adoption, getting involved with these crypto ICOs early could offer a meaningful edge in the next growth cycle.

2025-06-27T16:55:54,"Asian Crime Syndicates Tap Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Other Lenders To Launder Billions Siphoned in Pig Butchering Scams: Report","Reputable financial institutions have reportedly served as stations in the multistep money laundering process that transports funds from US scam victims to crime syndicates in Asia. ProPublica reports that Asian crime syndicates behind pig butchering scams tap on the services of financial titans like Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, HSBC and Wells Fargo, along with many other U.S. and foreign lenders, to convert the proceeds of their illicit operation into crypto. Pig butchering, a scheme in which scammers build a relationship with their targeted victims to financially exploit them, siphons some $44 billion per year. Chinese gangs that operate in prison-like compounds in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar often carry out this scam. The report says that black market bank accounts are thriving because of this fraud, with Chinese-language channels on the messaging service platform Telegram offering to rent US bank accounts to pig butchering scammers. The bad actors need the bank accounts to move stolen funds. Although fraudulent transactions now use cryptocurrency, the typical consumer does not own this asset, so many scams involve getting the victim to wire money through traditional banks. The swindlers receive the funds in their account, then convert them into crypto to send overseas. Later, they exchange the digital assets for standard currency. In a statement to ProPublica, the American Bankers Association, which represents the industry, says banks cannot completely filter out scammers despite their efforts to stop fraud. “With more than 140 million bank accounts opened every year bad actors can sometimes get through despite determined and ongoing efforts to stop them. They hide their true identities, exploit the good names and reputations of banks and other responsible companies, and abuse shell corporations to facilitate moving their ill-gotten gains away from their victims.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-27T16:48:35,"Top 5 Crypto PR Agencies for Market Dominance in 2025","As capital surges back into the digital asset space, crypto projects are playing for dominance.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What does “market dominance” mean in crypto PR? Market dominance refers to a crypto project’s ability to own its narrative and visibility across multiple platforms—from Google search and Discover to media headlines and community channels—achieving recognition, traffic, and influence beyond competitors in a short timeframe. Why is PR so critical for crypto projects in 2025? With institutional capital returning, regulatory clarity improving, and token issuance accelerating, attention has become the most scarce and valuable asset. Effective PR ensures your project is consistently seen, understood, and trusted by the right audiences—before, during, and after launch. How is crypto PR different from traditional tech PR? Crypto PR must navigate faster news cycles, decentralized communities, market-fit narratives, and platform-specific nuances like Google Discover and Web3-native media outlets. The top agencies like Outset PR specialize in these dynamics, which traditional PR firms often struggle to address. Which agency is best for early-stage token launches? Outset PR is best positioned for early-stage and emerging token projects that need rapid recognition, traffic, and trust-building through media saturation, SEO strategies, and performance-led content delivery.

2025-06-27T16:45:09,"Record Hodl Move from Bitcoin's Long-Term Investors! Why Whales Aren't Selling? Here's the Latest Data","Bitcoin long-term investors are experiencing one of the strongest accumulation periods in history. Record HODL Move by Bitcoin Long-Term Investors: Monthly Accumulation of 800K BTC Onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant announced that long-term investors have accumulated a net 800,000 BTC in the past 30 days, the highest monthly increase ever recorded. LTHs, i.e. investors who have held their BTC for at least six months without selling, are refraining from selling even as prices reach new highs in 2025. This trend points to a strengthening of the “hodl” spirit in market psychology. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted in his analysis published on Thursday that this move is a signal that should not be ignored: “The signal from LTHs this week is quite significant. Such accumulation increases have only been seen six times, the last two of which were precursors to major price increases in July 2021 and September 2024.” The average purchase price of new LTH positions is between $95,000 and $107,000, making this price band a key support zone for analysts. Accumulation in this area suggests that the price could remain strong at these levels. Short-Term Investors Eye $93,000 On the other hand, short-term investors (STH – Short-Term Holders) also play a critical role in the market structure. According to Cointelegraph’s analysis, the average cost of STH is just under $100,000, and this area often acts as support during bull market corrections. Onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that the $98,000-$93,000 range is critical throughout this week: “As long as the price stays above this range, the bull market structure remains intact. However, if it breaks below this support, a deeper correction could be triggered, especially if investors with costs in this area start panic selling.” The behavior of both short-term and long-term investors in Bitcoin plays a critical role in the sustainability of the current market structure. The aggressive accumulation of long-term investors and the support level formed in the $93,000-107,000 band give hope for the continuation of the bull market. However, any breakout below these levels could reverse the market momentum. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Record Hodl Move from Bitcoin's Long-Term Investors!

2025-06-27T16:32:09,"Bitcoin Miners' Daily Income Drops to Three-Month Low! Is Selling Pressure Coming? Here Are the Details","While daily income of Bitcoin miners dropped significantly in June, according to CryptoQuant data, selling pressure is not yet felt in the market. Despite the decrease in income, miners continue to accumulate BTC. Bitcoin Miner Revenues at 2-Month Low, But No Selling Pressure According to the weekly report shared by CryptoQuant, the daily income of Bitcoin miners fell to $34 million on June 22, reaching the lowest level since April. This level stands out as one of the weakest earnings in the last year. The decline was driven by lower transaction fees and Bitcoin prices trading near local lows, weakening miners’ incentives to stay online. The Bitcoin network’s total processing power, hashrate, has fallen by 3.5% since June 16, the sharpest pullback since July 2024. While this suggests increasing pressure on miners whose profit margins have been squeezed post-halving, the expected panic selling has yet to materialize. The amount of BTC leaving miner wallets has decreased from 23,000 BTC per day in February to around 6,000 BTC currently. No major transfers to exchanges were observed either. Long-term investors, especially those known as “Satoshi-era miners” who produced coins in the early years of Bitcoin (2009-2011), are also maintaining their positions. While only 150 BTC were sold from these wallets in 2025, this figure was around 10,000 BTC in 2024. On the other hand, wallets that usually belong to medium-sized operations, mining addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC, have added another 4,000 BTC since March, bringing their balance to the highest level since November 2024. Long-Term Expectations Dominate According to CryptoQuant, instead of selling, miners are determined to either burn through their cash reserves or wait for prices to recover. The report stated: “This clearly shows that there is no selling pressure from miners at current price levels.” Although revenues are down, Bitcoin miners’ refrain from selling is largely limiting potential selling pressure in the market, suggesting that Bitcoin is finding support at current levels and that long-term bullish prospects remain. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) is also riding high, having broken back above the $106,000 resistance. Will Bitcoin be the next to attain an all-time high? S&P 500 all-time high - still climbing Source: TradingView The S&P 500 on the weekly time frame shows the complete recovery for the biggest Wall Street companies. The new all-time high pushes the index to 6,177 points, well beyond the 6,000 points resistance, and a good way higher than the previous 6,147 all-time high. With the weekly close just a few hours away, it remains to be seen how much higher the price might go. As can be noted in the chart above, the price is approaching an ascending trendline. Given that the Stochastic RSI indicators (bottom of chart) are beginning to top out, there may be some sideways, accumulative price action to come, with the possibility of a dip, possibly back to the region of 5,700 if 6,000 does not hold. $BTC nears top of channel Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC reveals how the price is being maintained inside the descending channel. The last swing low may have put the fear of God into some investors, as the price hit a low of $98,300. Be that as it may, the price bounced well from there, and is now near the top of the channel. The price could still hit the top of this channel, but the odds are that some sideways and downwards price action could follow from here, allowing the shorter term Stochastic RSIs to reset back to the bottom. The 4-hour Stochastic RSI is already there, and therefore this might provide the momentum needed to touch the top of the channel first. $BTC bull flag has emerged Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC illustrates that the descending channel is probably a bull flag. This makes things even more bullish. If the price can emerge from the top of this flag and confirm above, the next step higher can begin. Bullish weekly Stochastic RSI close Source: TradingView All eyes need to be on the weekly time frame. While there may be one last dip down to come, to the strong supports at $106,000 or $104,000, there could be a bullish close of the Stochastic RSI. If the indicators can continue to flatten out, this augurs well for the following week, where we might see them cross back up, and with this, an impending breakout.

2025-06-27T16:22:04,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction toward $0.55. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.5575 Price Change 24h -2.8% Market Cap $4.1 Circulating Supply 7.44B PI Trading Volume 24h $217.6M All-Time High $2.98 (Feb 26, 2025) All-Time Low $0.4012 (Apr 05, 2025) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.546 Price Prediction $ 0.477123 (-25.39%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 22.32% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 41.98 Pi Price Analysis Pi hits resistance at $0.58, indicating that it is holding back the new bullish trend. RSI crosses the overbought territory, indicating reduced buyer strength in the daily frame. The MACD histogram is weakening, pointing to buying pressure in short-term charts. On June 27, 2025, the Pi Network sells at $0.5575 and reflects a pullback following an unsuccessful rally. The level of resistance is found at $0.58, and the immediate support is at $0.54. A decline below this line may cause additional losses. Pi 1-day chart shows weakening momentum as Pi Network struggles below key resistance Pi Network (PI/USDT) fell 2.84% to approximately $0.5575 in value. This was after an upward rally since buyers bounced off the $0.66 rejection area, and sellers took control. The relative strength index (RSI) oscillator currently stands at a daily reading of 37.19, and it is well below the 50 neutral level, thus indicating rising bearish momentum. The indicator indicates that the asset is approaching the oversold area, exposing it to further fluctuations in the downward direction. At the same time, the daily MACD demonstrates declining bullish momentum. The MACD line crossed upwards through the signal line, that is 0.0076 compared to -0.0309 now. Yet the bars in the histogram are weakening, showing that there is a possible break and an absence of purchasing power. In case of further weakness, Pi can challenge the significant support at the level of $0.54. Pi Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The 4-hour diagram of Pi Network (PI/USDT) reveals attempts at short-term consolidation following a strong fall on this chart. The price is standing around 0.5569 now and has had a minor rise of 0.20 per cent in the last four hours. This slight increase indicates less selling pressure, though it is not yet confirmation of recovery. The 4-hour RSI is 47.62, which is less than 50, indicating that there is no solid bullish pressure developing. But the RSI average is still quite high at 58.32, with some buyers still lingering in the recent trading sessions. The MACD line stands at -0.0065 under the signal line 0.0101. Although this indicates continued bearish pressure, the histogram is starting to fade, pointing to a possible slowing down in the bearish pressure.

The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.72 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare
